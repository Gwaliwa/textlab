Executive summary 
Objective of the assignment: The objective of this assignment was to conduct an end-term evaluation of the 
GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-2020)1, which 
forms a core component of the UNICEF’s Country Programme 2017-2021. In terms of the geographical scope, 
the evaluation covers 15 districts spread across six divisions of Bangladesh.2 
Approach and methodology for evaluation: The evaluation methodology is guided by the Terms of 
Reference (ToR) of the assignment and the evaluation questions given therein. Specifically, the overarching 
evaluation framework follows the OECD DAC criteria, namely relevance, effectiveness, impact, efficiency, and 
sustainability.  
A mixed method approach that combines content analysis of programme documents and secondary literature 
with quantitative and qualitative insights from primary data, has been adopted for the study. Further, keeping in 
mind the multiplicity of interventions and actors in the WASH sector of Bangladesh and lack of availability of 
unit level data on programme participants (and a possible counterfactual), the evaluation has been done from 
contribution analysis perspective rather than focusing on strict causal attribution.3 Finally, the evaluation adopts 
a gender-responsive approach.  
Key findings and conclusions: The key findings and related conclusions have been arranged as per the 
OECD-DAC criteria below. 
Relevance: Under this evaluation criterion, we have assessed if the designs and strategies presented in the 
current country programme document4 (CPD) are responsive to the needs and priorities of the country and the 
government.5  
Bangladesh’s WASH sector faces different problems in different regions, ranging from vulnerability to extreme 
weather events and their knock-on effects, to arsenic poisoning, challenges of provision of safely managed 
water and sanitation to low-income communities in urban centers like Dhaka, to name a few. UNICEF’s WASH 
strategy in the country is well aligned to the varied needs of the country, as it is informed by a detailed and 
participatory bottleneck analysis.6  
Provision of safe and resilient WASH services in the face of the challenges posed by climate change is a cross-
cutting issue in Bangladesh. UNICEF has sought to address this challenge by working with the Government to 
pilot innovative solutions like double platform deep tubewells with managed aquifer recharge (MAR). 
As Bangladesh is gradually transitioning to a lower middle-income country, public investment in the sector is 
going to increasingly account for much of the direct demand for WASH services in the country. Therefore, in 
order to remain relevant and responsive to newer opportunities, UNICEF is striving to move to upstream 
activities like advocacy, multisectoral discussions with Government and other development partners, evidence 
generation as well as fostering the development of the WASH market in the country. 
UNICEF continues to be responsive to the emerging challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing 
technical support to the government in planning, capacity building, implementation of COVID-19 emergency 
responses and dissemination of protocols on good hygiene practices.  
Effectiveness: Under this evaluation criterion, we have checked whether the WASH programme has been able 
to achieve the intended objectives and targets as presented in the current country programme document 
(CPD). 
 
1 For ease of reference, this Programme “GoB-UNICEF Bangladesh Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme of Cooperation (2017-2020)” has been referred 
as the WASH Programme throughout this document.   
2 Programme districts considered for the evaluation: Faridpur, Pirojpur, Bandarban, Khagrachari, Comilla, Jamalpur, Netrokona, Khulna, Narial, Satkhira, 
Nilphamari, Rangpur, Habiganj, Sunamganj and Sylhet 
3 MICS provides information between 2012 and 2019, while the period of evaluation is 2017-2020. Primary survey data at unit level on programme participants 
in targeted/prioritized districts and is not available. 
4 While the CPD was extended to 2021, this evaluation remained through 2020, so it does not cover the full work under the 2017-2021 CPD. 
5 For ease of reference, this document “Country Programme Document and Strategy Notes; UNICEF Bangladesh Country Programme for 2017-2020; June 
2016” has been referred as Country Programme document (CPD) throughout this document. 
6 WASHBAT Report Bangladesh-2018 (This report is the outcome of a number of WASHBAT Divisional Workshops (total eight) steered by LGD of the Ministry 
of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLRDC) and organized by the respective Divisional Commissioners Office, with assistance from 
UNICEF Bangladesh during 2018.) 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the programme has been effective in creating an enabling environment for provision of safely managed 
WASH facilities in communities and institutions.  
Analysis from inter-temporal comparison of MICS unit level data shows that access to WASH services have 
improved overall in the priority districts. Data also shows that access inequity (across different wealth quantiles) 
has reduced. Note that this reduction is the net result of multiple programmes aimed to improve water and 
sanitation access and service delivery in the targeted districts of which UNICEF’s interventions constitute a 
part. This evaluation, however, shows that UNICEF’s programmes have made positive contribution and can be 
thought to be effective in improving access to WASH services.  
Gender equity and social inclusion considerations have been effectively incorporated in the programming 
through gender responsive planning (design of programmes), monitoring, and reporting. Respondents from the 
surveyed communities report that the GoB-UNICEF WASH programme has contributed to reduction of 
instances of adolescent girls’ school dropout, implementation of inclusive toilets in the low income communities 
and time spent by women to collect water. The programme also fostered innovations for need based WASH 
services for the elderly and people with disabilities, residents of areas with hard-to-reach areas, etc. Some of 
such solutions include the adoption of less water consuming technologies like SATO taps and SATO pans in 
the water scarce areas, and provision of handholding support in developing sanitation infrastructure at the 
community and institutional levels, for the elderly and people with disabilities. 
UNICEF has played a critical role in policy advocacy and coordination. As the WASH cluster lead, in the 
emergency response to the Rohingya crisis and COVID-19, UNICEF facilitated coordination among different 
line departments. In the Rohingya camps, UNICEF played a key role in the provision of safely managed water, 
sanitation, and hygiene facilities for all. UNICEF ensured protection of human rights of the refugees by 
addressing fundamental issues relating to health, nutrition, education, etc. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
UNICEF developed guidelines and sector wide strategy documents for making people aware about the safety 
protocols. Additionally, UNICEF assisted the government in developing a national strategy for the provision of 
safe water in communities and institutions.  
The WASHBAT analysis, which identified barriers in WASH sector for all eight divisions of Bangladesh by 
involving around 800 professionals from WASH, education, health, nutrition sectors, is yet another example of 
the crucial thought leadership role played by the UNICEF.  
The evaluation has brought to light a few shortfalls from targets set in the CPD. While the recognition and 
resolution of these shortfalls are a collective responsibility of various programmes, stakeholders, and donor 
agencies working in the WASH sector, the evaluators note them to pave the path towards the way forward. A 
few areas where some improvement could be made are as follows: (1) While there has been a rise in access to 
safe water and sanitation services, the targets set in the CPD with respect to SDG 6.1 and SDG 6.2 at the 
community level appear ambitious retrospectively. (2) The ‘WASH in schools’ programme could not achieve the 
set targets with respect to equipping primary and secondary schools with basic WASH facilities. (3) The CPD 
target of equipping healthcare facilities (HCFs) with basic WASH facilities, has not been achieved.  
 
Efficiency: The evaluators have mapped the use of resources (time and budget) vis-à-vis the achievement of 
target output and outcome indicators in the programme districts in this section.  
The programme was able to achieve the utilization as well as physical progress milestones in access to safely 
managed sanitation facilities. However, resource mobilization is a key challenge in equipping primary schools 
and HCFs with basic WASH facilities according to the national standard. Also, UNICEF has got strategic shift 
and not supporting any hardware in the institutions (Schools/HCFs) and focussed only on policy level issues. 
This was reflected in the target to achievement ratios in case of HCFs and schools. 
We find that there is scope for improvement in efficiency in terms of performance ratio.7,8 In terms of areas of 
improvement, creating and maintaining a database for outcomes along with data on funds utilization would help 
in tracking progress. 
Another efficiency component in WASH could be accelerating engagement with local manufacturers in 
production of low-cost (economic) sanitation equipment. For example, UNICEF has been promoting sanitation 
markets at local level in collaboration with an implementing NGO. Local latrine producers are provided access 
to funds through micro-entrepreneurs, micro-finance institutions and NGOs. Another example is the provision of 
legal water points for urban slum dwellers in collaboration with Dhaka WASA and UNICEF. Further, UNICEF’s 
 
7 Performance ratio = achieved/target; budget consumption = expenditure/allocated 
8 As per the value for money analysis, the performance ratio was low in 2020 for providing basic sanitation facilities in: (i) primary schools (6%), (ii) HCFs (4%), 
secondary schools (44%) 
   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration with KTH (Swedish Royal Institute of Technology) for developing capacity of local drillers on 
arsenic safe drilling is another important example of successful local capacity building. 
Impact: Under this evaluation criterion, the evaluators have assessed contribution of the WASH Programme 
towards achievement of programme objectives. Using the MICS data of two years (2012 and 2019), the 
evaluators have conducted a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis comparing the priority and non-priority 
districts across two time periods. The analysis shows improvement of access to WASH facilities and reduction 
in WASH gaps in targeted programme areas. The programme contributed to successfully ensuring an 
increased use of safely managed WASH facilities through service delivery, awareness programmes, hygiene 
promotion programmes, trainings, adoption of the three-star approach in schools, community engagements 
through social media, tax exemption of MHM products, etc. Along with other actors in the WASH sector, 
UNICEF’s interventions have positively contributed to ‘improved and equitable access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation’.  
Evaluators also find corroboration on UNICEF’s positive contribution from the responses of respondents from 
communities in targeted areas. Respondents report that the programme has contributed to increasing the 
proportion of schools and HCFs providing gender segregated sanitation facilities. Additionally, the respondents 
report that there has been an increase in awareness about MHM among communities, and reduction in dropout 
of adolescent schoolgirls during the last four years. Additionally, UNICEF has played a crucial role as a 
coordinator and policy advocate, through the WASH in Schools programme. Through the three-star approach, 
schools were encouraged to ensure handwashing with soap, access to safe drinking water, and access to 
clean, gender-segregated and child-friendly toilets at school. At the community level the respondents report that 
there has been a substantial increase in the awareness of safe water practices and more equitable access to 
safe drinking water. 
UNICEF has also contributed to improvement of access to safe water in urban areas. Korail LIC model is one 
such example, which addressed the issue of lack of access to legal water connections and safe sanitation in 
the urban slums and LICs. The Korail model, may be upscaled to all urban slums and LICs, which cannot 
access legal and safely managed WASH facilities. 
Sustainability: Under this evaluation criterion, evaluators have assessed whether the interventions under the 
WASH programme will continue and the positive contributions will last after the exit of the programme. In this 
section, the following components of the programme have been assessed: M&E system, market-based 
approaches, community participation, capacity building, and behavior change. 
The programme has assisted the government in implementing monitoring systems to some extent for WASH 
interventions. However, this can be further bolstered by integrating a robust M&E system at sub-national level.  
There is a need to scale-up market-based approaches and promote participation of private sector through 
policy advocacy for long-term sustainability. Local entrepreneurs and communities can be encouraged to 
participate in sanitation markets and businesses to develop WASH market as a long-term strategy aimed at 
sustainability of the sanitation interventions. 
Sustainable WASH interventions require emphasis on behavior change. Evaluators find that UNICEF has 
focused on several awareness campaigns in the priority districts. As reported by the respondents in 
communities surveyed, this has contributed to improved social norms on the use of safe water and safe 
sanitation and hygiene practices. UNICEF has also supported the government entities particularly DPHE and 
LGD in capacity building and programme implementation at the local level. This has positively contributed to 
sustainability of the positive practices at the institutional level. 
Cross-cutting themes: Relevant cross-cutting issues such as gender9, climate change, urbanization and 
population youth trends have been targeted by the WASH programme.  
UNICEF has been making constant efforts to make their WASH programme gender-responsive and socially 
inclusive. This is reflected in the programme commitment to reduce existing gender-based inequality and 
provide effective, efficient, and sustainable WASH services to all.  
Increased demand for the WASH facilities in the urban areas is one of the key challenges for Bangladesh’s 
WASH sector. Issues in urban areas like lack of fecal sludge management (FSM) need to be addressed 
through engaging with the government (specifically, the ULBs).  
 
9 For Gender considerations, we have included only key findings in this report. A stand-alone Gender Analysis report has been provided as deliverable of this 
evaluation assignment. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is further scope to build climate-resilient service delivery models to make WASH facilities more 
sustainable.  
Lessons learned: The following lessons were learned from evaluation of the GoB-WASH Programme 2017-
2020.  These are more widely applicable for capacity enhancement process in the WASH sector: 
• 
Clear understanding and coordination between all stakeholders of the programme regarding their roles and 
responsibilities as the programming has ensured efficient implementation and timely completion of 
outcomes. The programme involved active participation of the communities, youth, religious leaders, 
schoolteachers, and women in policy framework and implementation.  
• 
Encouraging and upscaling market-based approach has improved access to raw materials for WASH 
infrastructure through promoting local micro-entrepreneurs. 
• 
Engagement in PPP arrangements has helped in providing sustainable access to water supply and 
sewerage services in the low-income urban areas.  
Recommendations: The evaluators provide the following recommendations and sub-recommendations after 
consultation, joint validation and refinement sessions with UNICEF WASH team and key stakeholders from the 
GoB.  
1. Development of a robust M&E system for tracking coverage of WASH infrastructure in terms of 
availability, functionality, and quality. (Stakeholder: UNICEF, DPHE, Municipalities and BBS; Priority: 
High)  
a. Create a more robust M&E system so that evidence generation on WASH service coverage within the 
prioritized/targeted districts for the period of programme implementation is available. Specifically, the 
data collection may be strengthened at levels of (i) urban slums and union level, and (ii) WASH in 
Institutions (Schools and HCFs) 
b. Conduct evidence generation for monitoring the progress and evaluating UNICEF interventions in 
WASH sector within each country programme cycle. 
c. Capacity building to administer and oversee the M&E system at the national and sub-national level.  
d. Create an M&E system that is GESI (gender equity and social inclusion) aware and envision the design 
and creation of indictors that can be disaggregated by gender as also other vulnerable or marginalized 
communities in the targeted areas. 
2. Scale-up market-based approaches10 and promote participation of private sector through policy 
advocacy for long-term sustainability. (Stakeholder: UNICEF, other implementing agencies, private 
sector; Priority: High) 
a. Advocate for a low interest sanitation financing policy for households and entrepreneurs through MFIs.  
b. Encourage increased participation of local entrepreneurs and communities to develop the WASH 
market as a long-term strategy aimed at sustainability of the WASH programme.  
c. Promote affordable and climate resilient sanitation products in disaster prone areas by training 
entrepreneurs and encouraging them to scale up the production as per the demand. 
3. Develop and promote low cost, climate resilient and suitable11 WASH technologies to improve 
accessibility of WASH services to the poor12, residents of urban slums and hard to reach (HtR) 
areas. (Stakeholder: DPHE, PSB, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, UNICEF, and 
other implementing agencies; Priority: High) 
a. Promote designing, production, and availability of low-cost WASH technologies such as reusable MHM 
pads, low-cost improved latrines, mid-range offset toilets with durable superstructure, affordable septic 
tanks, etc. Technologies developed by the private sector such as SATO taps and pans could be 
effective solutions for water scarce areas. 
b. Provide legal water connections and fecal-sludge management in the urban slums. 
4. Policy advocacy for factoring in the costs associated with climate change issues into the WASH 
budget. (Stakeholder: UNICEF; Priority: Medium) 
a. Include the cost for climate change issues such as contamination of ground water and breakage of 
WASH infrastructure during natural disasters13, depletion of ground water during droughts, etc. into the 
WASH budget 
 
10 Sanitation Marketing Systems (SanMarkS) approach was adopted initially in six districts, namely, Rangpur, Bogra, Rajshahi, Barisal, Khulna and Sunamganj 
districts as per the approved project under the Development Project Proforma (DPP) between UNICEF and the Local Government Division (LGD) of 
Bangladesh Government in November 2015. 
11 Examples of affordable sanitation technologies include plastic SATO pans (USD 1.5), gooseneck plastic pans (USD 0.12-USD 1.06); Source: Sanitation

Statistics (BBS). 
13 Natural disasters such as Floods, cyclones, storms etc. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Increasing women entrepreneurship in sanitation markets and their participation in decision 
making positions. (Stakeholder: UNICEF and other implementing agencies; Priority: Medium) 
a. Adopt a pro-active and gender-sensitive approach to employ more female staff at the decision-making 
positions in the WASH programme at the community level.  
b. Provide training to women entrepreneurs to (i) strengthen the WASH market supply chain and (ii) make 
women key value chain actors in the sanitation market. 
6. Maintain WASH budget heads at a disaggregated level to better monitor and evaluate the expenses 
for all WASH outputs and outcomes. (Stakeholder: MoLGRDC, GoB, UNICEF; Priority: Medium) 
a. Conduct annual budget tracking study and national and sub-national accounting for WASH sector 
specifically.  
b. Informed decisions on funding requirements and utilization for ensuring quality and sustainability of the 
WASH sector may be taken by the Government as well as UNICEF, by tracking expenditures in the 
WASH sector of all stakeholders14. This will help in better monitoring of efficient and effective public 
spending in the WASH sector.
