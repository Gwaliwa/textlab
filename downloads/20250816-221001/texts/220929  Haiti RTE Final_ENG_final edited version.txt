Acknowledgements 
 
The evaluation team would like to thank all the institutions and 
individuals who made this fascinating evaluation possible. Haiti 
is a context that pushes institutions to their limits. Despite this, 
so many people took time out to meet us, answer our 
questions, and share their concerns and views about UNICEF’s 
earthquake response.  
Special thanks to the UNICEF Haiti Country Office team, who, 
from the UNICEF Representative to the drivers, were very 
supportive to the RTE process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
A. OBJECT, OBJECTIVES, AUDIENCE and METHODOLOGY 
The evaluation team carried out a real-time evaluation (RTE) of UNICEF’s response to the earthquake 
that struck the three southern departments of Haiti on 14 August 2021. The RTE reviews both the 
emergency response phase (between August 14th, 2021 and October 14th, 2021) and the recovery phase 
(between October 14th, 2021 and the RTE deployment).  
The objectives of the RTE were: 
a. to determine whether UNICEF’s response to the earthquake was appropriate/relevant, effective, 
connected, coordinated and coherent;  
b. to assess the extent to which UNICEF adhered operationally and programmatically, to the Core 
Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs); 
c. to examine the extent to which UNICEF effectively responded to the needs of the most affected 
population in a timely manner and identify gaps and appropriate strategies to improve operational 
coverage and effectiveness (see Annexe 1 ToR). 
The primary audience includes UNICEF’s management and staff at the field, country, regional and 
headquarters levels involved in the response to the earthquake. The secondary audience includes: the 
wider community of partners - governmental, UN agencies and other implementing partners 
(international and national NGOs); populations affected by the emergency, the Executive Board and 
interested member states; and donor agencies that support emergency programmes with technical and 
financial resources at all levels.  
The data collected for the evaluation came from a literature review, a large number of interviews with 
stakeholders, and observations during field visits. Data collected was triangulated and then the findings, 
conclusions and recommendations were validated through a series of workshops with staff from the field 
office, Country Office and Regional Office. The evaluation team used different frameworks and 
approaches for the two different phases of the response: 
- 
For the emergency response phase the team used OECD/DAC evaluation criteria as the main 
analytical framework combined with the procedure on regional emergency activation for L2 
emergencies and the CCCs. The findings are presented in relation to these in the main report as 
well as in annexes 5 and 6; 
- 
For the ongoing recovery phase, the team opted for an iterative “real-time evaluation” approach 
to trigger real time learning and provide “real time solutions”. 
B. A COMPLEX CONTEXT 
Over the last 20 years, Haiti has been affected by more than 20 disasters. The earthquake on August 14th 
2021 further compounded a complex context which includes a) a political crisis related to the 
assassination of the President on July 7th; b) an economic crisis that has been looming for years, 
including regular gas shortages; c) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and d) gang-related 
insecurity which has made the transportation of supplies and aid extremely difficult. The rural areas of 
the southern peninsula's three most westerly departments were the hardest hit. The damage was located 
in a number of isolated communities that could only be contacted and reached after several hours. Two 
days later, on August 16th, with people mostly sleeping in the open, tropical storm Grace hit, further 
blocking roads due to landslides.

The impact of the earthquake was significant with around 2,200 deaths, 12,700 injured and around half 
a million children affected. As in other responses to natural disasters, UNICEF’s response to the 2021 
Haiti earthquake had two main phases. an emergency phase, during which UNICEF conducted a series 
of relief activities in health/nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education and child 
protection, and a rehabilitation phase to assist the affected areas and populations to recover from the 
main impacts of the earthquake. The findings below are structured in relation to the following 7 criteria: 
RELEVANCE/ APPROPRIATENESS: Despite its low level of emergency preparedness, to a large extent, 
UNICEF’s emergency response was appropriate, with some variation in levels of appropriateness 
between sectors. However, many remote rural areas received only limited assistance for some time due 
to access difficulties. The response only started to be more comprehensive at the beginning of the 
recovery phase. Regardless of the difficulties, most activities were organized in order to restore basic 
services. UNICEF’s response was largely aligned with the CCCs (see annex N°6), with different levels 
of success depending on the sectors. The strategy for the recovery phase was also relevant as it was in 
keeping with local needs and priorities and despite significant constraints, including the lack of long-
term funding which limited the capacity to reach the most affected people at scale. 
EFFECTIVENESS: During the emergency phase, with a rapidly changing situation on the ground, most 
of the emergency response was reactive (sometimes at the expense of staff safety), and it focused on 
emerging needs rather than on implementing and achieving planned targets. More planning was 
developed for the recovery phase in coordination with the national and local authorities and other 
agencies. During this phase, it was the reactivity and adaptability of the Haiti Country Office (HCO) 
that made the response effective, rather than any longer term planning process. On another level, a 
serious concern remains the extent to which the office was able to maintain business continuity for the 
other programmes in the other parts of Haiti and to manage two crises simultaneously: the earthquake 
and the urban crisis in Port-au-Prince. However, the office was not fully staffed as key positions 
remained vacant despite requests for replacements made by the HCO. The L2 declaration with the 
proactive engagement of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) and UNICEF HQ 
was of great help in terms of solving some of the human resources issues, facilitating access to financial 
resources and easing some of the bureaucratic procedures. Fundraising was only partly successful with 
the main bilateral and multilateral donors but worked relatively well with NatComs. During the 
emergency phase, the most urgent health and WASH activities were mostly timely. The mobilization of 
Haitian health personnel and the means to support them, the water trucking, the existence of the office 
in Les Cayes and the one month “open window” in Martissant greatly facilitated the timeliness of the 
early response in the Southern Peninsula. However, UNICEF’s response in GrandAnse and Les Nippes 
was insufficient compared to its response in the South Department. 
Despite the existence of useful tools and a number of activities carried out prior to the earthquake, the 
emergency preparedness activities (EPP) had little influence on the way the Country Office’s responded 
to the earthquake. The constraints linked to the access to roads, the need to work with the UNICEF 
Copenhagen Supply Division and internal difficulties within Haitian counterparts significantly affected 
the speed of the supplies during the emergency phase. The recovery phase was significantly hampered 
by the rainy season and the blockade of the bridge in Jeremie, in addition to the difficulties getting 
convoys out of Port-au-Prince.  
COVERAGE:  Despite efforts, UNICEF encountered many difficulties in reaching the most vulnerable 
groups 
(e.g. 
communities 
in 
hard-to-reach 
areas, 
IDPs, 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
unaccompanied/separated children, and pregnant women) during the emergency phase as many national 
bodies were inadequately staffed and equipped to deliver. Things improved significantly during the 
recovery phase. Though we know the number of kits that were distributed, it is not possible to assess 
the number of people assisted via programmes that target community infrastructure such as water, 
health, schools, etc. Nevertheless, we can say that geographic coverage was relatively significant at the 
time of the RTE.

EFFICIENCY: Although the RTE mission did not have the means to carry out a proper cost-efficiency 
analysis, the evaluation team observed that efficiency varies significantly depending on phases, subject 
and territories. Some of the hindrances in this area are linked to internal choices made by UNICEF on 
procurement (“petits et grands achats”). The speed of international and local procurements varies 
significantly depending on who is in charge. The mobilisation of the fleet, in particular the fleet of 
vehicles based in Port-au-Prince to support the operation, which was constrained by the Martissant 
blockade, was apparently not optimal, and resulted in expensive car rentals in the South. 
CONNECTEDNESS: UNICEF’s approach was broadly oriented towards ensuring that infrastructure and 
local services could be properly rehabilitated, and such able to deliver  services, as a component of the 
exit strategy for its emergency response. This was particularly important in WASH (what to do after 
water-trucking) and in education (what to do to ensure that education was able to resume promptly in 
appropriate buildings than in tents).  
COORDINATION: Coordination within UNICEF and with other actors was a key challenge in order to 
ensure that there was effective coverage of very specific, scattered and multidimensional needs. 
Internally, coordination was extremely time-consuming (for example, due to the large quantity of 
information that LACRO and HQ wanted to received) and did not always lead to a sufficient amount of 
multi-sector coordination. Externally, UNICEF’s support to strengthen national leadership was a key 
factor for the appropriateness and effectiveness of its response. In the field, UNICEF was a key player 
in sub-national coordination during the emergency phase at the les Cayes level and to a lesser extent in 
the GrandeAnse and Les Nippes departments, both globally (COUD) and in its thematic areas of 
responsibility.  
GENDER EQUALITY AND INCLUSION: In Haiti, women and children are often victims of different types 
of mistreatments and require proper protection. The earthquake was seen as an aggravating factor in this 
regard. Gender and disability were taken into consideration as much as constraints and the characteristics 
of the context permitted. UNICEF had to develop specific workstreams with specific national 
institutions and with specialized NGOs to ensure proper management of these highly sensitive issues. 
The policy on Protection Against Sexual exploitation and Abuses (PSEA) was well supported at the 
political level and coordinated with the UN World Food Programme (WFP). 
The report includes 11 main lessons which are drawn from the findings and conclusions. Lessons 1 to 7 
have been drawn from the overall response and evaluations of previous disaster responses. Lessons 8 to 
11 concern UNICEF emergency management procedures. 
C. CONCLUSIONS 
The conclusions below, are structured in line with the 6 objectives stated in the evaluation ToRs and the 
Evaluation Questions: 
A) UNICEF’s response to the earthquake was appropriate and relatively effective given the needs that 
it created and the significant constraints. There was substantial effort to contribute to enhanced 
coordination, including with the national institutions, and to connect the short-term response with 
the longer term. The lessons from previous evaluations have not been fully integrated; 
B) Both during the emergency phase and during the ongoing rehabilitation phase, UNICEF has made 
a significant effort to adhere operationally and programmatically to the CCCs, despite major 
constraints. UNICEF’s response was facilitated a great deal by the L2 declaration. 
C) The level of preparedness was low, with key HCO staff absent despite the beginning of the cyclone 
season. UNICEF was caught “off guard” by the earthquake. As such, the L2 declaration was of 
great help. 
D) The primary focus of the M&E system is to “report to the donor and HQ” rather than being “a tool 
for steering complex operations in an unpredictable environment”.

11 
E) UNICEF did all it could to effectively respond to the needs of the most affected population. The 
level of political, security, logistical and access constraints made the timeliness of the response 
variable although the L2 declaration was of great help. The high level of vulnerability of the 
population even prior to the earthquake made needs overwhelming. Nevertheless, efforts were 
made at the local and central levels, including through interagency processes to ensure the best 
coverage of the hard-to-reach rural areas. 
D. RECOMMENDATIONS  
The recommendations are split into 3 main categories:  
a) what to do to improve the ongoing response;  
b) how to better prepare for the ongoing cyclone season; and  
c) key elements to contribute to “risk informed and shock responsive” Haitian development.

Recommendations for the current recovery phase: 
The first set of recommendations are related to the ongoing operations (timeline: immediate). 
Recommendation 1: Make UNICEF’s response more effective by: 
Strengthening UNICEF field presence  
• 
Open operational offices in GrandAnse and Les Nippes 
• 
Ensure proper logistics for these offices and their local counterparts.  
• 
Ensure proper inclusion of gender and disability in the design of the response in all sectors 
HCO  
This will help ensure that all programmes achieve their targets (both quality and quantity). Furthermore, each sector can be 
further reinforced:  
Strengthen Health/Nutrition -  
• Establish an agreement with PROMESS to pre-position medicines in the country. 
• Look into ways of supporting hospital departments with fuel during acute fuel crises. 
• Strengthen the visibility of health/nutrition interventions in GrandAnse and Nippes. 
 
HCO 
 
LACRO 
Reinforce the WASH sector –  
• Ensure strong presence of staff to support the continuation of the OREPA rehabilitation work in the three departments. 
• Fund OREPA directly to accelerate future fixing of broken SAEP. 
Reinforce Education and Child Protection -  
• Advocate for faster construction in order to ensure that more resources are available for this process. Ensure that kits are 
available before classes are opened. 
• Ensure involvement of DDE in all interventions (distribution, construction monitoring, etc.).. 
• Advocate for an increase in the number of IBESR staff present in the Grand Sud to avoid slowing down certain activities. 
Advocate to strengthen the operational capacity of state protection agents (the institutions in charge of protection) 
Social Protection and Cash Transfer -  
• Strengthen UNICEF’s cash response dedicated to supporting education processes. 
• Improve the HCO’s capacity to design and implement emergency cash transfer programmes in order to better respond to 
the needs of vulnerable populations, including women with young children and protection cases. 
Limit the weight of silo approach and develop interconnection between the different sectoral programmes 
• 
Develop multi-sectoral team work 
• 
Engage more in inter-agency coordination (with PAHO/WHO, WFP and FAO)
