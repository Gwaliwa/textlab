Executive Summary 
 
Project description 
 
The MTV Shuga programme is an award-winning TV programme in Africa and Asia, that uses 
edutainment as a model to showcase challenges of young people in different contexts with the aim to 
provide behaviour change content to adolescents and young people.  Aligned with the Third National 
Strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS in Botswana, the programme was initially introduced by National 
AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA) through the national Botswana television in 2011 and 
later reintroduced on radio with the support of UNICEF in 2018 with the goal of reaching adolescents 
and young people with behaviour change content focusing on safe sexual behaviour (delayed sex 
debut, prevention of transactional and intergenerational sexual relationships) and uptake of HIV 
services. As such, it was implemented through a collaboration mainly between UNICEF and the 
National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA), in partnership with MTV Staying Alive 
Foundation (MTV SAF), with a budget of budget was US$1,724,696.00. The programme under 
evaluation was a catalytic initiative linked to the UNICEF’s Country Programme Outcome 2 which seeks 
to ensure that by 2026, adolescents and young people (10–24 years), particularly the most vulnerable, 
will be more empowered and engaged to access quality and gender-responsive HIV, health, nutrition, 
education, and child protection services.  The programme also addressed sustainable development 
goal 3 (SDG 3), on ending HIV and AIDS epidemic by 2030. The programme was therefore adapted and 
implemented as a behaviour change communication strategy to help adolescents and young people 
adopt safe sexual behaviour by targeting key drivers of new infections and non-adherence to ARV 
treatment. The following were the key programme objectives: 
i. To improve self-efficacy to know HIV status and access sexual and reproductive health services. 
ii. To improve attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex. 
iii. To improve attitude and self-efficacy to demand or practice safe sex. 
iv. To improve knowledge and attitude towards sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and gender-
based violence (GBV). 
 
The MTV-Shuga peer education programme, was piloted in two districts in 2019 and scaled up to four 
districts in 2020 (Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe and Gumare) districts). With 
the advent of COVID-19, virtual peer education (through social media platforms) programme was 
introduced in Botswana in 2020 to ensure continuous access to information and services among AYP 
during this period. Various adaptations to the MTV programme, to secure a comprehensive reach – 
especially to deepen impact of the radio programme and improve access in remote rural and peri-
urban areas were therefore made.  The programme 
included: Radio: The Drama series were an adaptation 
of MTV Shuga Down South with episodes of about 7-
10 minutes, followed by in studio discussions by young 
people for some of the episodes. Interpersonal 
communication: Peer education component (led by 
trained Peer Educators (PEs)) targeted in school and 
out of school adolescents and young people (AYP) in 
Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe 
and Gumare) districts. The model used the MTV Shuga 
Peer Facilitation Guide which contained 7 sessions 
which were increased to 9 sessions (to incorporate parent to child engagement) that each group of 
participants have to complete to be classified as being fully exposed to the MTV Shuga Peer education 
Programme. Interactive voice response (IVR): Episodes of the MTV Shuga drama series were uploaded 
to the interactive voice response (IVR) platform known as 124, for audience to listen to at their own 

 
vi 
time in case they missed the radio show. Also, a ‘choose-your-adventure’ game was introduced to the 
platform for improved interaction with audience. The game allowed young people to choose 
characters they like and personify the character`s decision making process and listen to how their story 
ends. Social Media: With the advent of COVID-19, the programme adopted virtual peer education 
approaches to ensure and sustain service demand generation and uptake by adolescents and young 
people. 
 
Evaluation purpose, scope, objectives and intended audience 
The evaluation purpose was “to evaluate how well the MTV Shuga programme achieved its outcomes”. 
The evaluation intended to measure the outcomes of the MTV Shuga programme in all the four 
targeted districts. It also determined how effective the programme was in achieving its set targets. The 
evaluation results are intended to inform replication of the programme by the Government of 
Botswana in several districts of the country. The primary user of the evidence generated from the 
evaluation will be the Government of Botswana through NAHPA as the evaluation will inform the 
current scale up of the programme to other districts. UNICEF will use the evidence to continue 
advocacy efforts towards ensuring adolescent and young people programmes for safe sexual 
behaviours are developed and implemented. Development partners and other non-governmental 
organisations stand to benefit from the results of the evaluation as well on the use of peer approaches 
to behaviour change and in alignment with other programmes targeting Adolescents and Young People 
(AYP).  
 
Methodology  
 
Evaluation approach: The evaluation used mixed methods approaches premised on qualitative and 
quantitative data. Quantitative data was used to determine MTV Shuga’s performance on envisaged 
outcomes while qualitative data was used to answer questions on relevance, efficiency, sustainability 
as well to validate and explore further outcomes of the programme. The evaluation was designed on 
the premise of a contribution analysis approach where the evaluation did not seek attribution but 
rather how the MTV Shuga sessions and other support are contributing to observed outcomes. The 
evaluation utilised the contribution analysis methodology to help track emerging programme 
impacts/outcomes and determine the programme’s contribution. Across all evaluation criteria the 
evaluation explored the extent to which the project design mainstreamed human rights, gender 
equality, disability, and equity. The United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) guidance on evaluation, 
human rights centred, and gender responsive evaluation were adopted in the tools and data collection 
approaches. The UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) was the main guidance 
on evaluation quality standards. Evaluation principles of independence, credibility, integrity, and 
inclusiveness were integral to the evaluation approach.  
 
Data sources, collection, and analysis: The evaluation team conducted an extensive literature review 
to inform the design of the evaluation, methods, and data collection tools as well as the findings. The 
quantitative evaluation component relied on secondary data from the programme’s monitoring system 
(baseline survey, pre- and post-exposure surveys, and monitoring reports). The qualitative evaluation 
component comprised Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), Case Studies 
(using the Most Significant Change (MSC) approach). Key informants were drawn from programme 
stakeholders such UNICEF, Makgabaneng, NAHPA, BIHL, MTV-SAF, Peer Coordinators, DAC, Chief 
Education Officer, DHMTs, and teachers for Guidance and Counselling (G&C).  FGD discussants were 
primarily adolescents and young people (AYP) that went through the MTV Shuga sessions in- and out 
of school, in separate groups of males and females. Case studies were held with selected participants 
of the MTV Shuga programme. Only two districts: Selibe Phikwe and Okavango were selected for the 
qualitative data collection.  Primary quantitative data from pre- and post-exposure surveys was 
analysed in accordance with the indicator definitions provided by UNICEF. Differences between the 

 
vii 
baseline and post-exposure survey was compared to ascertain the differences.  Qualitative data 
collected was systematically analysed, triangulated, and synthesised by the evaluation team. The 
collected qualitative data complemented and clarified the quantitative findings by helping to identify 
common themes.  
 
Validation and dissemination: The evaluation reference group reviewed the draft evaluation report to 
correct any factual errors. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated to all stakeholders by 
implementing partners.   
 
Limitations of the evaluation: The following were the limitations of the evaluation exercise: 1) Only 
the in-person peer educator programme and the IVR platform had pre- and post-exposure data. This 
meant assessment of the performance of the programme was limited to these two channels. 2) Visit 
to only two of four districts had the potential to skew the perceptions on programme performance. 
The evaluation ensured the selection of four wards that represent fully the context of the programme 
including selecting some successful localities, provided the evaluation with sufficient variation to fully 
explore the programme’s performance.  3) The study relied on secondary data (pre- and post-exposure 
survey data) due to unavailability of funding for primary quantitative data collection. Primary 
qualitative data on programme was outcomes was collected instead. 4)    There was potential to collect 
and use clinical data (especially utilisation of HIV services). While this could have provided trends in 
utilisation of services, the low performance of lower-level results meant such a contribution story 
would be very weak.  Resultantly this data was not used for the analysis of outcomes. The programme 
had no focus on linkage to health services a requirement for enhancing utilisation of such services 
further weakening the contribution story. Instead, the evaluation relied on qualitative obtained 
through FGDs and case studies on the outcomes of MTV Shuga. 
 
Findings 
 
Relevance 
1. The MTV Shuga programme was strongly aligned to the Government of Botswana’s HIV response 
and prevention framework – the third Strategic Framework. Use of multiple channels of 
communication (Interactive Voice Response platforms (IVR), radio, social media (Facebook and 
WhatsApp) interpersonal communication (through peer educators) allowed for various categories 
of AYP with differing resourcing to access behaviour change messages.  
2. Content delivered through these platforms was relatable for AYP and applicable in varying context 
although in some instances such as in Okavango some adaptations were necessary to address 
specific cultural context. Content for IVR and interpersonal sessions were modelled from extensive 
research on drivers of new HIV infection among AYP and understanding the motivations for risky 
sexual behaviours among the group undertaken in the pilot first phase of the programme. 
However, content for social media platforms was not standardised and driven by district level 
online peer educators. While such an approach can affect the quality and depth of behaviour 
change communication, the use of young people within districts to drive the online engagements 
made the content relatable for AYP in those contexts.  
3. Young people, through peer educators, led delivery of the programme in particular interpersonal 
communication and social media platforms enhancing the effectiveness of communication.  
4. While the programme targeted in school and out of school AYP, the design was more effective in 
retaining in school than out of school AYP in the programme. For out of school AYP, the lack of 
integration with livelihoods or economic empowerment initiatives removed motivation for their 
continued participation in the context of other competing needs. Also, when refreshments were 
provided for meetings, attendance by out of school AYP tended to increase. However, there was 
no budget for this in the programme. In Selibe Phikwe and Okavango peer educators made 
arrangements with local NGOs HPP and BOCHAIP respectively for venues for holding sessions with 

 
viii
out of school AYP. while this was commendable it was only for one locality in each district with 
space for holding sessions for out of school a challenge throughout the programme period across 
all districts. On targeting again, the programme could have been effective by adopting 
differentiated approaches, especially after delivery of the nine sessions, to support behaviour 
change for those most at risk AYP. This could have been supported by more effective risk profiling 
of participants.  
5. IVR platform also struggled to keep listeners logged in for majority of sessions as the number of 
listeners for the last session decreased by 90% from the first session (approximately 32,000 to 
2,000). However, majority of participants had received two sessions on the platform. 
6. Peer educators were well trained and perceived to be effective by Guidance and Counselling (G&C) 
teachers and AYP (in-school and out of school) in delivering sessions. Because of their effectiveness 
peer educators were being allocated more time for sessions in schools including requests for them 
to address other issues not necessarily part of their focus e.g., bullying and drug abuse. However, 
in Boteti and Okavango districts, Peer Educators had challenges in reaching out to some hard-to-
reach areas for the out of school AYP and their engagements with their caregivers/parents due to 
transport constraints.  
7. Programme learned and adapted during implementation. One adaptation was the integration of 
parent to child communication to improve the enabling environment for AYP behaviour change 
which led to expansion of the sessions from seven to nine. Attendance of parents to these sessions 
was low due to a poor community mobilisation strategy that failed establish meaningful 
relationships with community leaders.     
 
 
Gender and equity 
8. The programme design document recognised the importance of gender but fell short of providing 
specific strategies to make the programme gender responsive beyond the session content. Despite 
this, during implementation, several initiatives were put in place to enhance gender 
responsiveness including recruitment of equal numbers of male and female peer educators, data 
collection included sex disaggregated data, and implementation of gender specific interventions 
such as targeting teen mothers or “boys’ and girls’ talks”. Majority of these initiatives were district 
specific and adhoc. Gender responsiveness of the programme could have been improved by the 
collection of session experiential data to address gender specific concerns in session delivery, and 
collection of additional demographic data for session participants such marital status, childbearing 
etc to support differentiated support.  
 
9. Disability was not considered in the design and implementation of the programme. Peer educators 
had no capacity handle children with disabilities and therefore generally avoided them. In schools 
where there was some existing capacity or initiatives to support children with disabilities such as 
at Lebogang Junior Secondary School (JSS) some support was provided to PEs to handle such 
children.  
 
10. Equity was considered in the selection of districts which ensured urban, rural and hard to reach 
areas were selected for the programme. While this was commendable resource allocation did not 
consider the additional costs incurred for reaching out to AYP in remote areas which compromised 
quality of delivery of the programme in such areas e.g., Shakawe in Okavango.  
 
Effectiveness  
11. The MTV Shuga programme improved the capacity of AYP to delay sex and practice safe sex (4.9%, 
p-value=0.000) as well as gender equitable attitudes in relationships (13.1%, p-value=0.000). It had 
a negligible effect on improving AYP’s attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex 
(0.6%, p-value=0.7975). The main challenge for this was males whose views of intergenerational 

 
ix
and transactional sex did not change. For female AYP, an increase of 3.1% had improved attitudes 
on intergenerational sex compared to 1.8% for males. However, AYP’s perceptions of transactional 
sex did not improve with a high proportion of over 80% of MTV Shuga participants still maintaining 
that it was reasonable for a partner to expect sex in exchange for money or gifts. Therefore, while 
negative attitudes towards risky sexual behaviour changed slightly, the programme had a greater 
effect in building capacities of AYP to practice safe sexual behaviours within those relationships 
(ability to negotiate safe sex, that both males and females should carry condoms etc.). 
 
12. MTV Shuga in Botswana had a greater effect on females than males. This is important in the 
context of equity as new HIV infections were high among female AYP.  Nonetheless the effect 
changes were marginal primarily as a result of limited engagement of session participants post 
completing the standard 9 sessions as discussed earlier. The initiative by PEs in Boteti to reinforce 
behaviour change through creating platforms for engaging those AYPs that demonstrated 
emerging behaviour change is an emerging practice that could be explored for other districts.  
 
13. While there was a 4% change in the proportion of AYP “intending to go for an HIV test in the next 
three months” after the post session survey, the overall proportion of 29% of participants was still 
very low showing a lingering reluctance among AYPs.  
 
14. The MTV Shuga programme failed to achieve the targets of any of the outcomes. However, output 
indicators were achieved for some outputs e.g., Programme Output 2: Effective and efficient 
project management. The best performing indicator was “Percentage of adolescent boys who hold 
gender equitable attitudes” which was 0.8% short of the target. This was followed by the indicator, 
“Percentage of AYPs who demonstrate intention to demand safe sex under pressure” which was 
10% off the target. The programme was able to reach 8,250 AYP instead of the target of 10,000 
primarily due to challenges with mobilising out of school AYP. 
 
15. There were cases of young people that had changed their behaviour e.g., stopping transactional 
sex, intergenerational sex, drug, substance, and alcohol abuse. Mary’s story (Case study 1) 
demonstrates the effect the MTV Shuga sessions can have on behavioural outcomes of adolescents 
and young people. The session delivery approach and its content can have a profound effect on 
changing risky sexual behaviour as observed in Mary’s story.  However, cases of such behaviour 
change, as noted by PEs were still few. This could be a result of limited follow of the MTV Shuga 
cohorts by PEs or the limited engagement of the same cohort post 9 sessions of MTV Shuga. 
 
16. Several factors contributing to the programme’s effectiveness including:  
a. PEs’ ability to deliver the programme sessions effectively.  
b. Varying levels of support provided to PEs by District AIDS Coordinators (DACs) helped 
improve PEs’ work through linkages to other important stakeholders and provision of 
office space etc.   
c. PEs’ relationships with schools ensured access to adolescents.  
d. Availability of multiple virtual or online communication channels allowed the 
programme to adapt quickly to COVID-19 restrictions. Virtual PEs were able to reach 
21,297 AYP with behaviour change messages, 92,983 AYP were reached through 
various IVR platforms, and 8,250 were reached through physical interaction with PEs.  
 
17. Challenges undermining effectiveness included:  
a. A PE to AYP ratio of 1:295 may have been too high for PE’s effective interaction with 
AYP.  
b. Nine (9) sessions were inadequate to facilitate behaviour change and needed to be 
supported with additional risk-based support to AYP.  

 
x
c. Out of school AYP were difficult to motivate to stay on the programme and therefore 
the MTV Shuga programme was not successful with this group.  
d. Module content was adaptable across districts but could have addressed some 
context specific issues and other areas to support behaviour change.  
 
Efficiency   
18. While the PEs created strong relationships with DACs linkages and coordination with other critical 
stakeholders were weak. For education, PEs had close working relationships with schools but less 
so with the district education office. this posed challenges when school access was denied as 
occurred in Ghanzi and in Shakawe, Okavango.  Limited linkages with the youth ministry were a 
lost opportunity to create synergies with livelihoods or economic empowerment interventions of 
the ministry. While Makgabaneng tried to foster these relationships through engagement of all 
stakeholders at the onset of the programme in each district this was not followed through by PEs 
as there was a lack of a standard stakeholder engagement strategy they could follow.  
19. Makgabaneng was responsible for programme implementation in the districts for the peer 
education programme and UNICEF for the IVR platforms through Viamo Inc and the radio 
programme. Quarterly meetings between UNICEF and Makgabaneng were held to support review 
and planning. These were informed by PE reports, quarterly monitoring and supportive visits 
undertaken by Makgabaneng and joint monitoring visits conducted with UNICEF and NAHPA. 
Refresher trainings were also used as points of reflection. However, coordination of the 
programme could have more systematically involved NAHPA through the structured quarterly 
meetings to ensure they kept abreast of the programme implementation. This would have added 
to the involvement of NAHPA in training of PEs.  
20. Peer educator training was conducted through a Training of Trainers approach, with quality 
assurance being provided by MTV SAF. PEs generally appreciated the scope and content of the 
training they received but viewed the duration as too short. 
21. Adaptation of the programme to incorporate virtual communication platforms increased reach 
even in the face of restrictions on physical interaction to contain the COVID-19 pandemic but 
required additional support to be effective. This included (1) provision of audio and visual content 
to support communication on Facebook and WhatsApp for the virtual PEs, (2) integration with 
social mobilisation using community leaders and influential people to increase access by AYP, and 
(3) unavailability of pre and post exposure questionnaires for participants made the work of virtual 
PEs unmeasurable.  
22. While virtual platforms with their high reach are more likely to be cost efficient (e.g., 93,000 were 
reached with virtual platforms compared to 8,000 from the in-person peer education over the 
same period). Results from the IVR show similar or better performance on selected indicators 
when compared to in-person peer education. Season 1 of the IVR had impact on attitudes towards 
transactional sex, condom use and capacity to negotiate safe sex. Season 2 had an impact across 
all indicators include on HIV testing which lagged among participants in the physical peer 
education programme. Given that the numbers reached by the IVR platform are over ten times 
that of the physical peer education programme, the former is likely to result in shifts in attitudes 
and capacities among larger population of AYP. It is therefore likely to be more cost effective. 
However, all the channels are required. While the virtual communication channels may appear to 
be more cost effective, they may not be best to deliver equity as some AYP where unaware or did 
not have resources to access these platforms. A differentiated approach is necessary accompanied 
by risk profiling to address specific needs of AYP to achieve behaviour change. This is difficult to 
achieve with mass communication and would need to be supported by social mobilisation through 
the physical peer education programme.    
23. The programme’s data collection framework was aligned to its results framework with data being 
used to inform programme changes. Areas for improvement were performance feedback to PEs 
and local stakeholders, and collection of qualitative data on behaviour change.

Sustainability  
24. NAHPA has demonstrated readiness (willingness and capacity) to integrate the MTV Shuga 
programme scope into its roll out plans, without external support. The MTV Shuga programme 
(primarily the peer educator programme) was incorporated in the current round Global Funding 
cycle for Botswana under the HIV prevention pillar and within the behaviour change 
communication thematic area. The funding will enable scale up of the programme in all high-risk 
districts. Furthermore, NAPHA has included the MTV Shuga programme under its HIV response 
social contracting modality. Makgabaneng provides technical leadership working with CSOs in four 
additional districts implementing the full package of the MTV Shuga peer educator programme. 
The programme budget is BWP16 million. 
25. Integration of the PEs sessions with G&C sessions served as a good entry point for comprehensive 
sexuality education. There was limited integration with health facilities. While PEs are well 
recognised as an important stakeholder, the MTV Shuga programme was not always included in 
the district evidence-based HIV annual plan e.g., in Okavango in was included while in Selibe 
Phikwe it was excluded. 
26. DACs, G&C teachers, and PEs have demonstrated readiness to continue supporting the programme 
but require more orientation or sensitisation on additional programme components. 
27. The adoption of MTV Shuga as part of the national HIV response is testament to the success of 
advocacy efforts by UNICEF for national ownership and effectiveness of the technical support from 
MTV SAF. 
 
Conclusion 
MTV Shuga programme has provided a model design that is feasible, acceptable, and implementable 
without external funding through PEs, schools, and communities. It can be easily scaled as it is 
applicable in multiple contexts of Botswana. The multiple communication channels provide the 
programme the unique ability to reach a broad range of AYP with behaviour change messaging. The 
evaluation demonstrated that the programme in its current state can build capacities of AYP, especially 
females, to negotiate and practice safe sex and support more gender equal attitudes within sexual 
relationships. However, what remained in the programme is to ensure with this capacity AYP can 
overcome the barriers that undermine positive behaviour. This is where the programme needed to 
invest more through differentiated approaches that addressed the unique needs of the most at risk 
AYP. The current model has also failed to sustain engagement with out of school AYP and requires re-
designing to integrate economic livelihoods and linkages with health facilities whilst strengthening 
differentiated PE approaches and parent-AYP engagement. 
 
Lessons learned  
Below are the lessons have been learned from the implementation of the MTV Shuga programme in 
Botswana:  
 
Lesson 1: Out of school AYP require incentives or additional motivation to participate in MTV Shuga 
sessions. The programme faced challenges in mobilising AYP as they found the opportunity cost high 
or just lacked interest to meet and talk about “HIV and teenage pregnancies”. When refreshments 
were introduced during meeting sessions participation in the programme increased. The motivation 
must be a basket of interventions to support the diverse needs of AYP.  
 
Lesson 2: A programme targeting AYP must remain adaptable and agile to remain relevant. The MTV 
Shuga programme in Botswana was implemented through a changing context at national and micro 
level. The advent of COVID-19 led to introduction virtual peer education programme which has 
continued post COVID-19. When visual TV episodes were not working due to vandalism of electrical
