EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
The purpose of this formative evaluation is to assess 
to what extent the programme entitled, ‘Improving 
enrolment and learning: Transition from frontal 
teaching to differentiated learning (hereinafter 
referred to as the Programme) was successful in 
improving the performance of the Education 
Foundation of the Moravian Church (SOEBGS) 
schools in Suriname. This evaluation is also focused 
on learning more about enabling factors, bottlenecks 
and challenges, as inputs for learning and future 
actions for improving and scaling up the Programme.   
 
The goal of the Programme was to strengthen 
teacher training to build teachers’ knowledge, 
capacities and skills to apply more innovative 
teaching methods in the classroom, which would 
improve student learning, outcomes and academic 
performance.  Trained teachers should be able to 
effectively integrate these innovative teaching 
methods into the classroom in a more holistic 
manner, and use different teaching styles and 
approaches to teach students with different learning 
styles 
and 
abilities.1 
The 
Programme 
was 
implemented in 56 SOEBGS primary schools across 
Suriname, including in coastal zones and the sparsely 
inhabited interior.  
 
The Programme aimed to create an integrated 
capacity development programme for teachers, 
which includes teacher training, specifically training 
coaches and support staff (counsellor) who are 
available to support teachers to use more innovative 
and differentiate teaching methods in the classroom.  
More specifically, the objectives of the Programme 
were that:  
• 
Teachers are able to encourage students’ 
creative thinking by asking questions in a 
different way (e.g., Socratic questioning). 
• 
With differentiated teaching approaches, 
teachers’ are able to respond in a more dynamic 
manner to students learning differences and 
talents, and classroom dynamics.  
• 
Teachers are better able to identify and assess 
the learning needs of students and adapt their 
teaching approaches accordingly.

Programme Document, 2018. 
2 On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the novel 
coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. 
Subsequently, on 13 March 2020, Suriname announced 
the first confirmed case of COVID-19 and closed its 
borders. On 16 March 2020, all schools were closed to 
prevent a further spread of COVID-19.  The closure of 
schools had a notable negative impact on the ability of 
• 
Teachers are better able to understand and 
work with diverse groups of students in the 
classroom, and to support students who 
underperform or have learning delays or 
difficulties, and do so by increasing students’ 
learning opportunities. 
• 
Through efforts of the Activating Didactic 
Instruction (ADI) Model students are provided 
the opportunity to participate and take a more 
active role in their lessons and to participate in 
the learning process. 
• 
Teachers are more aware of the language goals 
and are better equipped or capacitated to 
support language stimulation and production 
among students.  
• 
Teachers are capacitated to use visual teaching 
materials during lesson plans to engage and 
teach students in a more playful and interactive 
way, to increase their understanding and 
solution-oriented thinking. 
 
The Programme was supported  by UNICEF with civil 
society organization (CSO) partner contributions (i.e., 
SOEBGS).  The Programme was funded by UNICEF as 
a thematic initiative versus with external donor 
monies; thus, programme-related documents were 
limited in number, as there were no specific external 
donor reporting requirements. Programme-related 
documents that were available were reviewed and 
used to design the evaluation methodology and data 
collection tools, and draft the Inception and Final 
Evaluation Reports.  
 
The Programme was initially planned to be 
implemented from 1 August 2018 to 31 December 
2020, but it was interrupted by the COVID-19 
pandemic which began in March 2020.2  To date, the 
Programme continues to be implemented by the 56 
SOEBGS primary schools.   
 
The intended use of this evaluation is to inform 
ongoing implementation of the Programme in 
SOEBGS primary schools. Thus, this evaluation offers 
evidence-based 
recommendations 
for 
further 
improvement of the Programme and the potential for 
schools and teachers to ensure all children have access to 
distance education and remote learning.  Although the 
COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2020 and into 
2022, schools in Suriname were able to open in October 
2020 with protective measures, yet temporary closures 
did occur as needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
Thus, the spread of COVID-19 continued to interrupt the 
delivery of education and student learning.  

ii 
 
scaling it up to other grades and schools, and to 
inform national teacher training programmes.  This 
evaluation offers strategic guidance to UNICEF on 
how to sharpen its focus areas of support to SOEBGS 
and MINOWC for mainstreaming differentiated 
teaching and learning approaches in education, and 
the overall approach to quality education.  
 
The target audience, including primary expected 
users of this evaluation, include UNICEF SCO, SOEBGS 
and MINOWC.  This evaluation will also be of interest 
to partner UN agencies and international financial 
institutions/donors that contribute to UNICEF results 
and wider UN system commitments, intended 
outcomes and efforts on the realization of children’s 
rights and wider human rights commitments, 
including equitable access to quality education and 
improvement to learning skills and outcomes.  
 
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 
 
To ensure the evaluation approach was as thorough 
and reliable as possible, a mixed methods evaluation 
approach was developed to ensure systematic 
collection of data and information related to each of 
the evaluation questions and evidence as it relates to 
the evaluation criteria of relevance, effectiveness, 
efficiency and sustainability, as well as equity, 
gender equality and human rights-based. The mixed 
method evaluation approach included: 
• 
Desk review 
• 
Sample and site visits for 9 SOEBGS primary 
schools 
• 
Key 
informant 
interviews 
with 
UNICEF, 
implementing partners and SOEBGS school staff 
• 
Focus group discussions with SOEBGS primary 
school teachers 
• 
Review of administrative data 
 
The evaluation approach developed for this 
evaluation were guided by the Terms of Reference 
(TOR) and a desk review, with inputs from UNICEF 
SCO.  The evaluation approach allowed for a 
comprehensive, fair and unbiased evaluation of the 
Programme and its implementation in SOEBGS 
primary schools.  
 
Participatory approaches were used throughout this 
evaluation. This included mainstreaming a gender 
lens, applying human rights approaches and 
recognizing key stakeholders and beneficiaries as 
‘rights-holders’, and the responsibility of the State 
and other actors to act as ‘duty-bearers’ to support 
the realization of children’s rights to equitable, 
inclusive and relevant education services.   
 
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
The three-year Implementation plan for the 
Programme (2018-2020) was interrupted and 
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Training of 
SOEBGS counsellors, school heads and coaches 
occurred in 2018-2019, as initially planned. In 2019, 
coaches began to train other teachers in their schools 
to implement the Programme; however, activities 
planned for 2020 were interrupted in March 2020 by 
the pandemic. Because of the pandemic, SOEBGS 
management and NGO SAGA Foundation were 
unable to perform school visits and provide refresher 
trainings that were initially envisioned. During the 
pandemic, SOEBGS management and school staff 
shifted their focus to delivering education to students 
remotely, largely via television and radio; as a result, 
teachers had limited contact with students and were 
unable to assess their learning or use differentiated 
teaching approaches. When students returned to the 
classroom, school heads and teachers were focused 
on reintegrating children into the classroom, 
delivering curriculum and limiting contact between 
children to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools. 
At the time of this evaluation, Programme activities 
implemented under the aegis of the Programme 
Cooperation Agreement had ended, although they 
were not fully implemented due to the pandemic, yet 
schools were still implementing the Programme to 
varying degrees. 
 
In 2020, during the pandemic, the MINOWC enacted 
the 
Automatic 
Promotion 
Policy 
in 
primary 
education, a practice of allowing students to progress 
from one class/grade to the next higher class/grade 
at the end of the school year regardless of academic 
performance or educational attainment.  The 
Automatic Promotion Policy has had a significant 
impact on the effectiveness of the Programme. The 
challenge is that teachers perceive students as being 
less motivated to learn; in turn, teachers are less 
motivated to expend more time and energy to help 
to address students learning gaps and needs. Both 
teachers and students are well aware that students 
will be promoted to the next grade at the end of the 
year, regardless of their learning outcome and 
academic achievements, or lack thereof. 
 
The key findings present a picture of the strengths 
and limitations of the Programme as it relates to the 
Programme's goal and objectives, and its relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. 
 
Relevance 
 
The Programme was designed and implemented to 
support 
SOEBGS 
to 
implement 
differentiated 
education in their 56 primary schools in an effort to 

iii 
 
tailoring instruction to students’ learning needs.  
SOEBGS recognized that the traditional teacher-
centred pedagogy that has long been at the centre of 
the country’s primary education model was not 
effective for all students, as many students were 
having to repeat primary school grades and were not 
transitioning from primary to secondary education.  
Given the high rates of grade repetition and school 
dropout, SOEBGS envisioned that a student-centred 
pedagogy that relies upon differentiated teaching 
approaches as a way to meet the learning needs of all 
students, regardless of differences in their abilities.  It 
was envisioned that the Programme would help to 
reduce grade repetition and improve academic 
performance.  The Programme was also aligned with 
educational reforms that MINOWC had been 
discussing. 
 
The Programme’s objectives, strategies and activities 
were relevant to the national context and primary 
education. On average, respondents ranked the 
Programme as a 6.3 on a 10-point scale (1=not 
relevant to 10=very relevant) as being relevant to the 
national context and primary education.  This 
included strengthening teacher trainings and building 
teachers’ knowledge and skills to apply differentiated 
teaching approaches in the classroom to teach all 
students, and to give additional attention to students 
who struggled to learn. The aim of the Programme 
was also to improve student learning and academic 
performance in the areas of literacy and numeracy. 
The Programme was also recognized as important at 
preparing teachers to use differentiated teaching 
approaches in the classroom.  On average, 
respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.8 on a 10-
point scale of importance (1=not important to 
10=very important). 
 
Effectiveness 
 
The Programme was evidence-based and modelled 
after a similar programme introduced in SOEBGS 
special schools, in cooperation with NGO SAGA 
Foundation. To support the Programme, NGO SAGA 
Foundation developed a Programme manual and 
workbook for teachers; then trained school head and 
two teachers (coaches) from each of the 56 primary 
schools.  The coaches were expected to return to 
their schools and deliver trainings on the Programme 
to their colleagues, as well as to coach their 
colleagues to properly develop daily lesson plans, 
apply a three-star system of categorizing students 
and use differentiated teaching approaches in the 
classrooms.  Not all coaches followed through with 
these responsibilities for a variety of reasons, 
including: lack of commitment or buy-in to use 
differentiated education in the classroom; lack of 
understanding of differentiated education based 
upon the trainings received; lack of capacities and/or 
time to train and coach their colleagues; resistance 
from their colleagues; and lack of support from 
school heads. 
 
There were several advantage and disadvantages to 
the Programme’s teacher trainings. Advantages 
included: 
The 
Programme’s 
teacher 
training 
reinforces 
good 
differentiated 
education 
and 
teaching that school heads and teachers recognize 
benefit students and help them to move from one 
grade to the next, particularly before the pandemic; 
teachers who were trained to be coaches were 
provided with a Programme manual and workbook; 
Programme’s teacher training, if delivered properly 
and in its entirety, can capacitate teacher to 
understand and apply differentiated teaching 
approaches in the classroom; and the Programme’s 
teacher training succeeded at capacitating teachers 
to develop daily lesson plans, to varying degrees 
(paragraphs 208-213 and 221-229).  
 
In comparison, disadvantages included: SOEBGS 
counsellors were not fully capacitated or committed 
to support schools to implement the Programme; 
there was no clear criteria or guidance provided to 
school heads for selecting teachers to be trained as 
coaches to support the implementation of the 
Programme, and teachers who were selected to be 
coaches were not clearly informed as to what would 
be their roles and responsibilities as coaches in their 
schools; school heads should have received the same 
trainings that coaches received so that they full 
understood all components of the Programme, as 
well as additional trainings on how to manage the 
Programme’s implementation and support teachers 
education in the classroom; and to varying degree, 
teachers were capacitated to use differentiated 
teaching approaches in the classroom, but they were 
not capacitated on how to use differentiated testing; 
and the cascade training approach was wrought with 
challenges (paragraphs 214-220 and 221-229).  
 
The Programme helped to improve teacher 
performance and abilities to address the different 
needs of students, and to mad teaching and learning 
more inclusive, but to varying degrees. On average, 
respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.0 on a 10-
point scale (1=not at all to 10=very much) at 
contributing to increasing the capacities of SOEBGS 
primary schools to use differentiate teaching 
approaches that are focused on improving child 
learning. Some respondents pointed out that before 
the pandemic many more teachers were more 
actively applying the Programme, but now there are 
new teachers who have never heard of the 
Programme; thus, they called for more trainings on 
differentiated 
education. 
Some 
schools 
have 

iv 
 
expanded the Programme beyond grades 3-6, as 
originally planned, and are now trying to implement 
the Programme in pre-school and the upper grades. 
At the same time, however, not all teachers are 
implementing the Programme in the classroom and 
teachers complain that developing daily lesson plans 
is a lot of writing and time consuming.  As a result, 
teachers from many of the schools reported that they 
have reverted back to using traditional teaching-
centred pedagogy (paragraphs 235-243).  
 
The Programme was ‘somewhat effective’ at 
achieving its objectives, including: preparing teacher 
to identify and assess the learning needs of students; 
adapting teaching approaches to teach students with 
different learning abilities; and preparing teachers to 
use visual teaching materials during lesson plans to 
teach students in more playful and interactive ways.  
On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 
5.0 on a 10-point scale (1=not effective to 10=very 
effective) at preparing teachers to identify and assess 
the learning needs of students, and ranked the 
Programme as a 5.3 on 10-point effectiveness scale 
at preparing teachers to adapt their teaching 
approaches to teach students with different learning 
abilities. Teachers were more likely to rank the 
Programme at ‘not so effective’ at accomplishing 
these the first objectives, due largely to the fact that 
the cascade training approach was not so effective.  
As it relates to preparing teachers to use visual 
teaching materials during lesson plans to teach 
students in a more playful and interactive way, 
respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.2 on a 10-
point scale of effectiveness. Teachers complained, 
however, that schools lack the resources and 
materials that teachers need to create their own 
visual teaching materials (paragraphs 247-267).  
 
On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 
6.5 on a 10-point scale (1=not effective to 10=very 
effective) at preparing teachers to take a more active 
role in developing their lesson plans. Coaches 
recognized that spending more time on developing 
lesson plans improves the way teachers teach and 
their relations with students; however, not all 
teachers are developing daily lesson plans or 
understand the importance of the lesson plans. Many 
teachers tend to see the lesson plans as time 
consuming and not very useful.  Teachers also 
complained that they have to pay to photocopy the 
lesson plan forms and the costs can be high for 
teachers, particularly those teachers who teach math 
and language (paragraphs 268-273).   
 
 
3 Conducting a costing analysis was beyond the scope of 
this evaluation and the evaluator was not able to conduct 
cost comparisons. The evaluator was provided with 
This evaluation found that nearly all respondents 
identified the need more training and training 
materials (90 percent), as well as educational and 
teaching materials (90 percent).  The majority of 
respondents also identified the need for better 
collaboration, coordination and cooperation (72 
percent), 
improvements 
to 
the 
classroom 
environment (70 percent) and more resources (56 
percent).  Fewer respondents also identified the need 
for improvements to the school environment (20 
percent), improved Programme management (18 
percent) and more Programme monitoring and 
monitoring tools (9 percent) (paragraphs 277-292).   
 
Efficiency 
 
This Programme was implemented with no donor 
funding; it was funded predominately by UNICEF.3  
The total cost of the Programme was USD 89,728 
(SRD 663,989), of which USD 81,355 (SRD 602,032) 
was UNICEF’s contribution and USD 8,373 (SRD 
61,957) was a CSO contribution (i.e., SOEBGS).   
 
UNICEF and SOEBGS learned that two years was not 
enough time to implement the Programme to the 
extent that it was able to change the culture of 
schools and reform education in primary schools to 
include differentiated education.  Nor was there 
enough time to really assess the Programme’s 
effectiveness and impacts, or to ensure sustainability.  
Schools need a longer period of time to be 
capacitated to possess the knowledge, attitudes and 
skills to effectively implement the Programme as a 
whole school approach.  SOEBGS schools would 
benefit from an additional training and technical 
assistance to implement the Programme, and 
additional resources to ensure that schools have the 
training and teaching materials needed to fully 
implement the Programme in all 56 primary schools. 
 
Given the lost learning time and learning losses 
experienced by children during the pandemic, 
additional resources are needed to support 
programming, such as the Differentiated Education 
Programme, that aim to help students recover from 
learning losses and to catch-up from unfinished 
learning.  Ultimately, there is much work to be done, 
yet the challenges for educators, students and 
parents are considerable and will require educational 
reforms and interventions that include a focus on 
differentiated education and tailored or remedial 
instruction that focuses on helping teachers to deal 
with students who are not prepared for the 
summary expenditures data presented by implementation 
phase and result/activity.

levels of understanding (paragraphs 297-298). 
 
Sustainability 
 
This evaluation found limited evidence that the 
Programme will be sustainable after only two-years 
of implementation; more time is needed for 
Implementation. 
On 
average, 
in 
terms 
of 
sustainability, respondents ranked the Programme as 
a 6.0 on a 10-point scale (1=not sustainable to 
10=very sustainable). : There were challenge and 
barriers to Programme implementation that need to 
be addressed for the Programme to be sustainable. 
To ensure sustainability, school heads and teachers 
need additional training on how to implement the 
Programme, including training on how to develop 
lessons plans and how to teach using differentiated 
teaching approaches and testing. They also need 
educational 
and 
teaching 
materials, 
and 
differentiated tests that are aligned with teaching 
based upon the three-star system. Respondents also 
recognized that there needs to be better cooperation 
among teachers in schools and support from school 
heads to implement the Programme; this is because 
there is a lot of resistance to the Programme.  
 
On average, respondents thought it ‘somewhat likely’ 
that the Programme will be scaled up and 
mainstreamed into all SOEBGS schools. On average, 
respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.9 on a 10-
point scale (1=not likely to 10=very likely) that it has 
the potential for scaling up and mainstreaming.  
Schools, however, need to be provided with the 
resources and educational and teaching materials for 
the Programme to be scaled up and mainstreamed 
into all SOEBGS schools.  Additional invests also need 
to be made to ensure that the Programme is 
implemented in schools in the interior, to ensure that 
teachers in the interior are properly capacitated and 
provided with the technical assistance they need, 
coupled with the resources and educational and 
teaching materials (paragraphs 308-312).   
 
Any effort to ensure sustainability of the Programme 
requires 
continued 
external 
inputs, 
including 
financial support and technical assistance to support 
a review and revisions to the Programme manual and 
workbook based upon lessons learned from this 
evaluation, and the development of improved 
capacity building trainings and training materials for 
continued trainings of counsellors, school heads and 
teachers.  This includes financial support to ensure 
that Programme-related manuals, workbooks and 
teaching materials are readily available to all teachers 
in all SOEBGS schools. External inputs are also needed 
to ensure that schools and teachers have the 
resources and materials they need to practice 
differentiated education in the classroom. This 
includes reusable educational and teaching aids, such 
as visual teaching materials, blocks and furniture to 
create reading and math coroners in schools and 
classrooms. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED 
 
There were several lessons learned to consider if 
there are plans going forward to continue to support 
the Programme’s implementation, and could be 
relevant to MINOWC and other faith-based school 
systems in Suriname that plan to implement 
differentiated education.   Lessons learned include: 
 
• 
In Suriname, educational institutions and 
educators are slow to change, including to 
transition from teacher-centred pedagogy to 
student-centred differentiated education and 
teaching pedagogy. Thus, efforts to ‘win the 
hearts and minds’ of school heads and teachers 
to implement the Programme on a daily basis in 
the classroom requires significant capacity 
building and technical assistance, as well as a 
demonstration of results and proper allocations 
of resources.    
 
• 
Counsellors, school heads and teachers all need 
to be properly capacitated and mentored to 
implement the Programme and to work together 
as a team to implement the Programme, as a 
whole school approach. A whole school 
approach will increase the responsibility and 
engagement of all teachers in the Programme. 
EBGS primary schools need school heads and 
teachers who are willing to champion the 
Programme.  
 
• 
EBGS counsellors need to be agents of change 
and champions of the Programme, and they 
need to be fully capacitated and certified to train 
school heads and teachers on all components of 
the 
Programme, 
and 
to 
assess 
its 
implementation in the classroom.   
 
• 
School heads need to be committed to the 
Programme and capacitated to support a whole 
school 
approach 
for 
Programme 
implementation.  In keeping, school heads need 
to serve as role models to teachers and regularly 
communicate 
and 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment to the Programme, and ensure that 
all teachers are capacitated to implement the 
Programme.  
 
• 
There should be clear criteria and guidance for 
school heads to recruit and select teachers to be
