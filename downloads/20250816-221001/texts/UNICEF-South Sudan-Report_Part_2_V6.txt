ation process with active engagement and support from UNICEF South Sudan country office.

PREFACE
This report contains the results of Part Two of the evaluation of the UNICEF 
Level 3 emergency response in South Sudan (from January 2016 to De-
cember 2019). The focus of Part Two is on child protection and emergency 
education, although it also covers some cross-cutting issues including the 
humanitarian-development nexus and the centrality of protection principle. 
It also updates the analysis of ‘child survival’ sectors from Part One of the 
evaluation (Nutrition, Health and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene). While the 
formal cutoff date for the evaluation is the end of 2019, the report also makes 
reference to the more recent situation, particularly as affected by the coro-
navirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related control measures. The report’s rec-
ommendations are framed with this in mind.
Although much of the work on the evaluation was undertaken in 2019, com-
pletion was delayed by a number of factors, including changes in personnel 
on the evaluation team and in the South Sudan country office, and more 
recently by the COVID-19 situation. This necessitated some mid-term revision 
of the terms of reference: in particular, some of the more management-re-
lated and operational aspects of the response were not considered, and the 
overall timeframe was extended to the end of 2019. The core focus on child 
protection and emergency education has remained constant.
The evaluation team was led by James Darcy, an independent consultant, 
who was also the team leader for Part One of the evaluation. He was joined 
by Francesca Ballarin, an independent specialist in child protection and 
education in emergencies, and by Sophie Busi, an independent consultant 
who assisted particularly with data analysis. A specialist in education, Rui da 
Silva, formed part of the team in 2019. Volker Huls, who was involved with 
the Part One team, also supported Part Two remotely with document colla-
tion and data analysis. The team was joined on the inception mission by Jane 
Mwangi from the UNICEF Evaluation Office, who also provided support and 
oversight to the evaluation process from New York.  I would like to convey 
my sincere appreciation to James and the rest of the team for the evalu-
ation team for undertaking the two-part evaluation and generating useful 
recommendations that will enable UNICEF to enhance its programming for 
children of South Sudan.

PREFACE
I would like to express our thanks to the  UNICEF  South Sudan, and in par-
ticular Hyun Hee Ban and her team in the social policy, planning, monitoring 
and evaluation department, and the Deputy Representative (Andrea Suley) 
for generously hosting the evaluation and supporting it over such an ex-
tended period. Their patience throughout has been much appreciated. 
Thanks finally to colleagues in the Evaluation Office in New York for enabling 
and supporting the whole two-part process, namely, Jane Mwangi for man-
aging the evaluation; Carlotta Tincati and Laura Olsen for technical inputs 
and support; and Celeste Lebowitz, Geeta Dey and Dalma Rivero for provid-
ing administrative support throughout out the evaluation process.
