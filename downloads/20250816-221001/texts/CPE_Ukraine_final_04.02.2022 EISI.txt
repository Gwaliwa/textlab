Due to the unprecedented situation and the scale and nature of the crisis, UNICEF Ukraine 
CO is no longer able to finalise their Evaluation Management Response. Given the urgency 
and scale of needs, and considering the complexity of the crisis, UNICEF Evaluation 
Director has lifted the requirement for the Ukraine Country Office to provide 
Management Responses within 60 days as required by the Evaluation Policy. The Country 
Office can file Management Responses once there are improvements in the operating 
environment.

Executive summary 
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Ukraine Country Programme (CP) for the 
period January 2018 to June 2021. It focuses on the impact, relevance, and coherence of the CP and the work 
of the Country Office (CO) and its partners in fulfilling UNICEF’s six core Outcomes.  
The evaluation is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and 
Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine. 
The evaluation aims to support the planning process for the next programming period. 
Overview of the Country Programme 2018–2022 
Between 2018 and 2021 UNICEF Ukraine supported the ambitious and wide-ranging reform agenda of the 
Government elected in 2019. This support prioritized the best interests of children and protection of the 
rights of children and adolescents during the period of instability in Eastern Ukraine.  
The CP’s overarching goal is to reduce equity gaps and contribute to the progressive realization of the rights 
of all children in Ukraine. The CP had six mutually reinforcing main Outcomes:  
o Evidence-driven, integrated and equitable social protection policies, efficient financial allocations 
and family-friendly local service provision are in place to address the social exclusion of children in 
Ukraine. 
o The most vulnerable children in Ukraine benefit from more-child-friendly and family-oriented 
social welfare and justice systems.  
o All children and adolescents in Ukraine, especially those disadvantaged and affected by the conflict, 
have access to inclusive and quality school education and early learning. 
o All children and pregnant women in Ukraine, including those living in situations of humanitarian 
crisis, utilize improved quality and affordable mother and child health-care services.  
o All children in conflict-affected settings have access to safe drinking water and reduced exposure to 
any environmental risks.  
o The rights of children in Ukraine are effectively monitored and clear mechanisms for accountability 
are established through a child-rights monitoring system. 
In addition, the CP introduced several outputs and planned activities in 2020, to ensure a swift and sensitive 
response to the emerging urgent needs of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences 
This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral evaluations and specialized studies 
carried out in the past five years. The evaluation aims to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability to national 
stakeholders by evaluating its contribution to results at scale for children, particularly those most 
vulnerable. The evaluation also assesses the implementation of the change strategies applied, thereby 
assisting the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD).  
The primary users of this CP evaluation are the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. Secondary users are 
the Government of Ukraine, UN agencies, development partners with a presence in Ukraine, and civil society 
organizations (CSOs).  
Evaluation context 
Since 2014, Ukraine has experienced acute political, security, and economic challenges. The ongoing armed 
conflict in Eastern Ukraine has been a major crisis for national security, as well as for the safety of children 
and families in the country. It also affects access to public services, including water and sanitation. In 
addition, Ukraine has been one of Europe’s most severely affected countries by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In 
the third year of the programme, the pandemic crisis posed another major challenge to the UNICEF CO and 
to the CPD and the interventions envisaged had to be adjusted to react rapidly to the new needs of children, 
parents and relevant institutions in the country. 

 
5
Before 2017, Ukraine had embarked on a set of far-reaching reforms in all areas previously addressed by 
UNICEF. The political and institutional instability, particularly in 2019, disrupted these significant and 
sustained efforts in conducting reforms. The COVID-19 pandemic added complexity to the context, leaving 
the most vulnerable of Ukraine’s 8 million children in dire need of urgent, strategic support. Supporting 
these children was often complicated by geographic barriers, as the children may be displaced due to 
conflict, live in conflict areas, in rural areas, or in institutions for children with disabilities.  
Evaluation methodology 
The Terms of Reference of the evaluation proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of 
Change developed by the UNICEF CO in Ukraine. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD 
DAC1 criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. To provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and 
strategies in achieving impact for children at scale, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken 
for three selected areas: (1) immunization, (2) youth empowerment and participation, and (3) justice for 
children. Other evaluation methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder analysis and a social 
network analysis.  
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, including a wide-ranging document review and 30 key 
informant interviews at national and local levels. The key informants included workers at UNICEF, 
government entities at multiple levels, UN and other development agencies, and CSOs (UNICEF’s 
implementing partners). In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social network 
analysis.  
The evaluation methodology fully considered ethical considerations and the obligations of evaluators. 
Interview respondents were assured confidentiality, with appropriate safeguards in place for all 
participants in focus groups, including young people. Child rights, equity and gender were key issues 
throughout the evaluation. 
Key findings  
Relevance 
The CP and activities implemented by UNICEF Ukraine were aligned to national and local priorities. UNICEF 
Ukraine took into consideration the needs of vulnerable children, as planned and indicated in the CP. It 
focused primarily on children in conflict areas, children with disabilities, children without parental care, 
children in contact with the law, and displaced or most-at-risk adolescents.  
UNICEF Ukraine reacted rapidly to the COVID-19 crisis and successfully mobilized support for the national 
government’s response to crisis-related demands. This resulted in effective funding for many regions 
despite the difficulty of creating a regionally-equitable plan during the COVID-19 outbreak.  The 
effectiveness of the UNICEF Ukraine COVID-19 response was, however, affected by a large funding gap at 
the time of drafting the COVID-19 response plan, resulting in the unequal availability of funds for different 
regions. 
Gender equality was not fully mainstreamed into UNICEF implementation work, as limited gender analysis 
was available. However, UNICEF Ukraine collected gender-disaggregated data for some areas of its work 
and has begun to systematize the collection of analysis of such data.  
Coherence 
UNICEF Ukraine aligned its programmatic activities with Agenda 2030 and with the Government of Ukraine 
– United Nations Partnership Framework (UNPF).  
In this context, UNICEF Ukraine built partnerships at the national level with line ministries, the 
Ombudsperson’s Office and governmental institutions to advocate for systemic changes in the country. In 
some areas, such as its partnership with the Ministry of Justice, UNICEF had a well-defined vision and 
understanding of partnership strategies. In other areas, such as health reform, UNICEF’s role was less

clearly articulated. Nonetheless, partnerships with regional health and social care institutions were 
important to UNICEF for the rapid collection of information from the field and for an effective response to 
the most urgent gaps. In partnerships at regional level with city and regional authorities UNICEF is valued 
for its role in bringing stakeholders together for cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary cooperation.  
Partnership with traditional and social media – complemented by innovative approaches such as online 
competitions, video diaries, and engagement with bloggers – has played a crucial role in the effective 
delivery of organizational global priorities and in addressing the growing need for trustworthy sources of 
information during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF’s partnership with the private sector is more recent 
and is sustained through institutional business engagements. Both UNICEF staff and their counterparts 
assess UNICEF’s partnership with UN agencies as requiring further improvement.  
UNICEF is acknowledged by its partners as the main player in monitoring the implementation of the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child, with a clear strategy for systemic change through support for 
evidence-based decision making, legislation and policy developments, and technical assistance.  
Impact 
UNICEF Ukraine has achieved positive results for certain vulnerable groups, such as children in conflict 
areas, children living with HIV, children living in institutions, child victims of violence and Roma children.  
The evaluation found that CP activities could have been better designed and implemented to meet the needs 
of children in rural areas and children with disabilities and generate results for these categories. UNICEF 
provided immunization and helped health facilities to maintain their services during the COVID-19 crisis. It 
also helped Public Health Centres to build up an efficient COVID-19 related data management system. 
UNICEF Ukraine furthered the national educational reform by improving the evidence base for decision-
making, developing a positive learning environment, and supporting both teacher training and provision of 
educational supplies. At the same time, UNICEF contributed to deinstitutionalization reform by drafting a 
financial framework on the ‘money follows the child’ principle and conducting an alternative care system 
assessment aligned with the government’s National Plan of Action on Deinstitutionalization Reform.  
Three important bottlenecks limited the CP implementation. The first is the use of state and international 
resources for the humanitarian response, with limited fiscal and political space available for social-sector 
reforms. The second is a lack of coherence between ongoing reforms on decentralization, on the one side 
and between health, social services and education on the other. In addition, UNICEF Ukraine has had to 
continuously mitigate risks related to political instability, the conflict in the east of the country and the 
COVID-19 crisis.  
Conclusions 
UNICEF Ukraine has significant capacity to enable multi-institutional cooperation and bring various 
stakeholders together to achieve synergies. However, the CO would achieve greater impact with a more 
comprehensive and systematic strategic approach in this regard. This is particularly important in areas that 
require inter-sectoral coordination.  There is room for improvement in UNICEF Ukraine’s partnerships with 
other UN agencies but also with the European Union’s (EU’s) Delegation in Ukraine. There is also potential 
for stronger resource mobilization from Ukraine’s private sector.  
UNICEF Ukraine’s results were achieved at scale when it 
• 
partnered with key stakeholders to develop national strategies and policies;  
• 
built the capacity of stakeholders at national, regional and local levels;  
• 
implemented far-reaching behavioural change campaigns.  
UNICEF Ukraine also obtained results at scale when investments and interventions were continued over a 
period of time that allowed that data to be analysed and turned into models for governmental 
implementation. Support for governmental capacity building for the planning, oversight and delivery of 
services also aided the effectiveness of UNICEF work.

Barriers to obtaining results at scale appeared in several areas. First, several risks and bottlenecks were 
identified in the planning stage and documented as such in the CPD. However, the CPD did not include a full-
fledged risk mitigation strategy or a strategy to counteract the negative effects of decoupled sectoral and 
decentralization reforms. There is also room for improvement in alignment between the UNICEF CPD and 
Agenda 2030: this could increase the engagement of relevant ministries and other key stakeholders, and, 
ultimately, improve children’s rights in Ukraine. 
UNICEF Ukraine has made an important contribution to improving overall monitoring of the extent to which 
children’s rights are observed in Ukraine, but also to the collection of in-depth evidence and data, for 
example through the regular surveys on immunization. However, it is, at this time, difficult to analyse the 
results of this contribution at scale.  
Lessons learned 
Strengthening the capacity of both national and local government staff in Ukraine helps ensure the 
implementation of reforms and/or new policies – particularly in the context of decentralization. 
Strengthening capacity at local and regional levels could counteract the negative effects of changes at the 
central political level, thereby ensuring continuity of services to children in times of crisis. 
Partnering with key donors and international institutions in the country is vital to create synergy and 
generate results at scale and at system levels, particularly as significant financial resources are necessary 
to address the existing needs of children. Continuous systematic and strategic advocacy would enable 
UNICEF to react quickly to changes in policies or situations.  
“Exit strategies” should be included in project models or intervention designs. This will ensure that 
necessary preconditions – including legislation, financial resources and capacity – are in place for the 
investments made and for their results to be sustained. 
Recommendations 
Recommendation 1. Engagement of key stakeholders to ensure synergy. UNICEF Ukraine should 
pursue strategic partnerships in a more systematic manner with both the government and key stakeholders 
in the country, including other international organizations and other UN agencies, to strengthen the 
protection of children’s rights. In this regard, UNICEF Ukraine should create a country-wide coalition 
involving all stakeholders that support children’s rights, including the EU Delegation in the country and the 
private sector, to consult and coordinate interventions in the interests of children, at both managerial and 
technical level.  
Recommendation 2: Continuous action to obtain sustainable results. UNICEF Ukraine should prioritize 
actions that need to be continued to achieve results at scale, including the implementation of national 
strategies and legislative frameworks; innovative actions; child rights monitoring activities; and platforms 
that enable the voice of children and youth to be heard.   
Recommendation 3: Institutionalizing the models framework. To enhance the sustainability of its 
interventions, UNICEF Ukraine should develop exit and transition action plans as early as possible in the 
process to enable a smooth transfer of responsibilities to national and local authorities, as well as the scale-
up of the models piloted.  
Recommendation 4. Implementation of effective change strategies and more focused programming. 
To obtain maximum results with the resources available, UNICEF Ukraine should select priority areas for 
the next CP where an effective combination of strategies can be applied, particularly strategic partnership, 
resource leveraging and capacity building. For each area covered, UNICEF Ukraine should identify at least 
the main specific risks and bottlenecks and integrate mitigation measures into the design of its actions. At 
the same time, UNICEF Ukraine should assess in greater depth the extent to which certain vulnerable groups 
and boys/girls have specific needs and take these into account in the design of interventions, building more 
on Agenda 2030 and grounding the results in Ukraine’s targets and indicators for the achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals.

Recommendation 5. Strategy-based advocacy, evidence generation and best practices. Advocacy and 
evidence generation should be undertaken systematically. UNICEF Ukraine should develop an advocacy 
strategy that covers all stakeholders, considers their interests and power, and defines the most appropriate 
advocacy strategy to be taken with each stakeholder. One strategy should be the promotion of best practices 
and innovative approaches that have been implemented successfully by UNICEF Ukraine.          
Recommendation 6. Evidence and progress. UNICEF Ukraine should develop monitoring procedures to 
enhance the availability of evidence, particularly for medium- and long-term changes triggered by its 
interventions. The indicator system in the new Country Programme Performance Framework needs to be 
improved to enable adequate regular monitoring that would identify gaps in terms of the targets initially 
set, trigger corrective actions and show UNICEF’s contribution to wider changes at national or regional 
level.
