GLOSSARY 
KEY TERMS OF EVALUATION 
Accelerated Education 
Working Group (AEWG) 
The Accelerated Education Working Group (AEWG) is an inter-agency working group made up of several 
education partners supporting and/or funding Accelerated Learning Programmes (AEPs).1  
Accelerated learning 
programmes/pathways 
(AEP) 
A flexible, age-appropriate programme, run in an accelerated timeframe, which aims to provide access to 
education for disadvantaged, over-age, out-of-school children and youth. This may include those who 
missed out on, or had their education interrupted by, poverty, marginalisation, conflict and crisis. The goal 
of AEPs is to provide learners with equivalent, certified competencies for basic education using effective 
teaching and learning approaches that match their level of cognitive maturity.2 
Accelerated education 
(AE) principles 
These principles aim to clarify the essential components of effective AEP. Each principle contains 
evidence-informed best practices which can be viewed as a series of key actions or indicators to support 
the design, implementation and evaluation of accelerated education work.3 
Basic education  
Typically comprises primary and lower secondary education, and increasingly one or more years of pre-
primary education.4  
Centre for Evaluation 
approach (CEval) 
Uses a participatory approach, clients as well as other relevant parties (e.g., implementing partners or 
target groups) are involved in the different phases of the evaluation process.  
Coherence 
The compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a country, sector or institution.5 
Contribution analysis 
design 
Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to 
observed results.6 
Effectiveness 
The extent to which the intervention achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives and its results, 
including any differential results across groups. 7 
Efficiency 
The extent to which the intervention delivers, or is likely to deliver, results in an economic and timely way.8 
Equity 
All children have a fair chance to survive, thrive and reach their full potential.9 
Formative evaluation  
Formative evaluations are done during the development of a programme or during the course of a 
programme to identify areas for improvement.  
Gender equality 
Is the process of being fair to men and women, boys and girls and is about equality of outcomes and 
results. Gender equity may involve the use of temporary special measures to compensate for historical or 
systemic bias or discrimination. It refers to differential treatment that is fair and positively addresses a bias 
or disadvantage that is due to gender roles, norms or differences between the sexes.10 
Human rights-based 
approach (HRBA) 
A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is 
normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and 
protecting human rights.11 
Hybrid evaluation design 
Using multiple evaluation designs. 
Impact 
The extent to which the intervention has generated or is expected to generate significant positive or 
negative, intended or unintended, higher-level effects.12 
Internally displaced 
persons (IDP) 
Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places 
of habitual residence, in particular because of or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of 
generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have 
not crossed an internationally recognized state border.13 
Mixed-methods approach 
A procedure for collecting, analysing and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods 
in a single study to understand a research problem.14 
Non-formal education 
(NFE) 
Education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining 
characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal 
education within the process of the lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided to guarantee the 
right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a 
continuous pathway-structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity, and it is typically provided 
in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications 
that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-
national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Non-formal education can cover programmes

Executive Summary 
This report presents the key findings, conclusions, lessons learnt and recommendations of the 
Formative Evaluation of Provincial Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP)22 models and centres 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘supported ALPs’), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund, Pakistan 
Country Office (UNICEF PCO) and implemented by relevant education and non-formal education (NFE) 
public sector partners in the provinces (i.e., Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)). 
ALP centres are a model of NFE that provide flexible, fast tracked education equivalent to the formal 
sector. AAN Associates undertook the evaluation from December 2021 to September 2022. The 
evaluation complies with the evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR, attached as Appendix 1) and follows 
UNICEF prescribed reporting guidelines (i.e., Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS)). 
The report comprises five chapters and a series of appendices. 
Intervention Context and Object of Evaluation: Pakistan is young country with a population of 220.8 
million (2020).23 The problem of out-of-school children (OOSC) is huge as one in every third child (32 
per cent) between 5-16 years is not enrolled in the formal education system or is out of school.24 The 
key contributory factors are: poverty, inaccessibility of schools and quality of education, and local norms 
restricting girls’ education.  
The object of this evaluation is to assess the UNICEF-supported ALPs in Balochistan, Sindh, Punjab 
and KP for children (aged 5-16 years), who have either not been admitted into or (if admitted) 
subsequently dropped out of the formal education system. Since 2016, UNICEF Pakistan has provided 
assistance to provincial governments to set up and institutionalize ALP centres to enrol OOSC (over-
age youth in particular) with the possibility of either mainstreaming OOSC to formal education or shifting 
them to vocational training/employment. The evaluation scope included all ALP centres supported by 
the UNICEF PCO in 31 districts across four provinces of Pakistan.  
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Formative Evaluation with a learning focus. 
The expectations of this evaluation are to look backwards and generate evidence of success around 
institutionalization of ALPs in four provinces (both pre/during COVID-19), glean lessons learnt and good 
practices, and list recommendations for adaptation of supported ALPs. The geographic scope includes 
supported ALPs in 31 districts (of four provinces) and the temporal scope includes all UNICEF PCO-
supported ALPs from 2016 to 2021. The thematic scope includes four components i.e., i) learners; ii) 
tutors/facilitators; iii) management of supported ALPs; and iv) alignment of supported ALPs with Ministry 
of Education (MoE) and policy frameworks. The scope excluded assistance by other partners/donors 
and UNICEF PCO-supported ALP centres beyond the targeted 31 districts. 
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The overarching approach to this evaluation was 
drawn from the Center for Evaluation (CEval)25 and remained Participatory.26 The evaluation applied 
a Hybrid Design, comprising two sub-designs i.e., Contribution Analysis27  and Normative 
Comparison.28 The contribution analysis assessed outcome level achievements disaggregated by 
province (to the extent possible) and normative comparison assessed consistency using the 
Accelerated Education Working Group’s (AEWG) 10 principles.29 The evaluation used a ‘mixed-
methods’ approach. The quantitative component was based on secondary data (including budgets, 
expenditures and assessment of ALP centres) whereas the qualitative data was gathered through key 
informant interviews (KIIs) with 14 female and 27 male participants and focus group discussions (FGDs) 
with 170 female and 130 male participants. An extensive desk review of 253 documents has also 
informed the evaluation. The evaluation faced limitations around availability of usable performance and 
financial data, which constrained measurement of impact, effectiveness and efficiency. 
Evaluation Findings and Conclusions: Evaluation findings and preliminary conclusions based on 
criteria developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – Development 
Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) are found below:

Relevance: The findings indicate that supported ALPs are relevant as the numbers of OOSC (in all 
provinces) are staggering. Through the technical support provided to provincial ALP centres, the aim 
was to formulate/approve NFE/ALP policy frameworks, develop/approve condensed ALP curricula and 
teaching and learning materials, and train staff and establish ALP centres. The provincial education and 
NFE 
stakeholders 
appear 
to 
have 
focused 
on 
education-based 
ALPs 
with 
limited 
integration/incorporation of technical and vocational education into ALP curricula for adolescent 
learners. The supported ALPs have taken an adaptive approach, whereby adjustments were made in 
design and delivery due to COVID-19. For instance, all provinces have taken measures to address 
COVID-19 risks by introducing home-based learning packages, subject-based educational videos, and  
others. The approach to supported ALPs was found to be consistent with provincial policy priorities 
(e.g., as listed in Balochistan NFE Policy 2016-2030; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Education Sector Plan 
(ESP) 2020/21-2024/25; Punjab Literacy and Non-Formal Basic Education 2019-2020; and Sindh Non-
Formal Education Policy 2017). 
Coherence: The results of post-facto normative assessment of supported ALPs (against AEWG 
standards introduced in 2017) indicate a high to moderate level of coherence or consistency. The 
supported ALPs are fully/mostly compliant in Balochistan, KP and Sindh (found to be compliant with 9 
out of a total of 10 principles; found non-compliant vis-à-vis alignment with the national education 
system). Punjab is slightly behind others for only being compliant with 7 of the 10 principles and being 
non-compliant due to non-approval/non-introduction of the ALP condensed curriculum. 
The supported ALPs came up as the singular OOSC intervention by UNICEF provincial offices, hence 
the evaluation team is unable to assess how other OOSC interventions complemented the supported 
ALPs. The findings indicate variable sector coordination (involving public sector entities, development 
partners and civil society organizations (CSOs)) in different provinces. For instance, coordination was 
found effective but was carried out informally in KP whereas in Sindh, the coordination platform was 
found dormant. The sector coordination needs a clear focus and investments from relevant provincial 
actors.  
Effectiveness: Data limitations (such as non-annualised targets, lack of provincial governments’ 
targets and limited number of indicators for which achievement data is recorded) constrained a deeper 
effectiveness assessment of supported ALPs. The achieved vs planned outcomes are compared for 
three indicators for which secondary data is available (i.e., numbers of centres established, number of 
learners enrolled and number of facilitators trained). Achievements vary across the three indicators. 
The data points to Punjab and KP being most effective for achieving (for some over-achieving) the 
planned outcome targets. Balochistan and Sindh appear to have been less effective due to 
underachievement against planned targets. Balochistan managed to achieve three-fourths of the 
intended outcome targets whereas Sindh achieved only two-thirds of the targets. With exception of KP 
(where interventions started in 2020 and authorities opted to keep ALP centres open), COVID-19 
delayed implementation and consequently affected achievements in the provinces.  
The supported ALPs did contribute to/produce unintended results such as: perceived delaying of girl 
marriages (for parents to allow girls to complete education); learners disseminating COVID-19 
precautionary messages; ALPs promoting inclusion by improving access for Afghan refugee children 
and children with disabilities; and learners helping families with calculations (after learning 
mathematics). 
The most significant enablers include: availability and willingness of relevant provincial public 
institutions (except in KP) to immediately approve and roll out supported ALPs; use of community-based 
approaches and cultivation of community interest and ownership; flexible timing (morning and evening 
shifts for ALP learners); use of local facilitators (which reinforced trust in the centres); and placement 
of centres in villages/neighbourhoods (which improved accessibility). The disabling factors include: 
unavailability of qualified facilitators (especially in hard-to-reach communities in Balochistan and KP); 
limited success with mobilising public financing (across all provinces); and COVID-19 driven 
disruptions, which reportedly triggered economic migration-driven dropouts.  
The NFE/ALP policies lay adequate focus on innovation, however there was limited clarity/guidance 
regarding: what is meant by innovation; what are the areas for innovation; and what are associated 
incentives. The evaluation found examples of needs-based innovations (i.e., use of supportive 
supervision for facilitators (in KP); use of madrassas/government schools as ALP centres (in 
Balochistan and KP); and learning assessment through use of technology (the Literacy Assessment 
Drive (LAD) application developed in Punjab)).30 The documentation of innovation process and 
 
30 Literacy Assessment Drive (LAD) enables quick and error free learning assessment and consolidates assessment as feedback to the facilitator.

associated results remained weak. Moreover, limited focus is placed on knowledge creation/generation 
and learning exchange for replication and scale-up of good practices across provinces.  
Efficiency: Data limitations constrained the measurement of efficiency. Province-specific budgets and 
expenditures tracking were not available for most provinces. In view of data limitations, the evaluation 
team has done a basic yet consolidated efficiency analysis. From the consolidated achievements data, 
the supported ALPs look efficient for being able to achieve overall targets (for three outcome indicators: 
centres established, learners enrolled, and facilitators trained) within available funds (used 68 per cent 
of allocated funds). Given the fact that outcome results (for three indicators) are mostly achieved whilst 
using only two-thirds of funds, the budgeting assumptions look unrealistic. The cost/learner appears to 
have increased from US$38 (in 2018) to US$94 (in 2020). The has been identified as an evaluation 
finding and the evaluation team feels that this should be explored further by UNICEF PCO. Compared 
to the national average for NFE (US$49/learner), the supported ALPs look cost-efficient at US$38 (if 
2018 numbers are taken and not 2020 numbers).31  
Impact: The evaluation has measured impact with respect to institutionalization of ALPs across 
provinces. This has been measured with respect to changes in the policy environment; curriculum; 
recruitment and training of facilitators; provincial budgets; certification process and reintegration 
mechanisms; and impact on OOSC and their families. Overall, the supported ALPs have contributed to 
both prioritisation and institutionalization of NFE/ALPs across all provinces. The most significant 
contributions are evident in terms of standardization of teaching and learning materials (including 
curricula and facilitator training materials), and examination, certification and reintegration systems. The 
assistance helped with drafting and approval of provincial NFE/ALP policies (i.e., KP, Punjab and 
Sindh). While the intent and willingness to commit public funds for NFE/ALPs is evident across 
provinces, none has so far allocated any funds. KP and Punjab have drafted Planning Commission 
Form-I (PC 1), however these are not yet approved. The supported ALPs have been successful in terms 
of defining the process for re-integration or mainstreaming ALP learners, however actual rates of re-
integration/mainstreaming are still low (i.e., Balochistan 13.1 per cent, KP 3.4 per cent and Punjab 2.5 
per cent). However, since ALP learners are not individually tracked, these statistics may not be 
accurate. Impact is evident in changing community (and parent) perceptions and willingness to let 
children resume education; inclusion of disabled and refugee children in supported ALPs; and perceived 
impact on delayed marriages for children (girls).  
Sustainability: The evaluation team noted an absence of guidelines/exit planning for UNICEF’s 
technical and financial disengagement from supported ALPs. Cross-province learning remained 
minimal, hence constrained replication of successful practices/learning across provinces. There is 
evident interest and willingness from provincial governments to continue supporting the ALPs. This has 
translated into approved NFE policies (except in KP); standardised curriculum and training material; 
and a defined process of certification and reintegration of learners into the formal education system. 
However, at the time of the evaluation fieldwork, the provincial governments had not yet allocated 
financial resources for the continuation and scale up of supported ALPs.  
Non-DAC 
Human rights-based approaches (HRBA): The supported ALPs were mostly consistent with HRBA 
principles across all four provinces: participation (through engagement of rights-holders and duty-
bearers); non-discrimination and equality (supported ALPs were equally available for all target 
beneficiaries); empowerment (ALPs enabled access to education leading to perceived sense of 
empowerment in learners); and legality (compliant with local laws and provincial sectoral policies). 
Supported ALPs were partially compliant with the accountability principle due to lack of an ALP-
supported feedback and grievance management system. 
Gender Equality: Across all four provinces, the supported ALPs were found to be mostly compliant 
with gender equality principles. Although a structured gender assessment was not conducted in any 
province, implementation is assessed as gender responsive as both parents (male and female) were 
sensitised on the importance of education; community-based ALP centres were established for easier 
access to education (especially for girls); Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) kits were provided 
for young adolescent girls to promote an inclusive and safe learning environment; and female facilitators 
were used to comply with cultural norms. There are positive results as most of the facilitators engaged 
were female (creating employment opportunities for women in target communities) and almost half of 
the enrolled learners were girls (21096 out of 37340).
