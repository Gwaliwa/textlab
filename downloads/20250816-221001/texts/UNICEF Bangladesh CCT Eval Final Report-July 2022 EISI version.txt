Executive Summary 
1. Context and Background  
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh commissioned the Economic Policy Research Institute 
(EPRI) to conduct an evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme (CCT programme) of the Child 
Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh, implemented from 2012 to 2019 in Bangladesh. The evaluation 
was conducted between the period 2016/17 to March 2022. 
Context. Children in Bangladesh have continued to be particularly vulnerable and an estimated 33 million children 
live in poverty.1 In 2008, UNICEF Bangladesh and the Ministry of Social Welfare (MoSW) implemented an 18-
month cash transfer pilot programme “Amader Shishu/Our child” to support orphan and vulnerable children in 
seven upazilas affected by the 2007 Cyclone Sidr. UNICEF replicated the programme in old Dhaka city in 
partnership with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) and MoSW with the objective of 
reducing child labour and child marriage. 
Object of evaluation. The CCT programme of the child sensitive social protection project (CSSP) in Bangladesh 
was implemented from 2008 to May 2020. The programme designed by UNICEF as a pilot was implemented in 
partnership with MoWCA up to 2017, when it was transferred to the Department of Social Services (DSS) within 
the MoSW. The main outcome indicators of the CCT were reduction in child marriage and child labour and 
increase in school enrolment of vulnerable children in the target districts.  
The programme comprises two key interventions: case management services through the establishment of a 
trained social workforce and case management toolkits to identify children at risk of a wide spectrum of challenges 
from abandonment and violence to school dropouts, conflict with law, as well as child marriage and child labour. 
For those meeting the qualifying conditions – score above 24 on the risk assessment, the conditional cash transfer 
of BDT 2,000 per month was delivered every six months for an 18-month period. A spectrum of other education, 
counselling and disability related services were also referred through the case management process, which was 
expected to monitor at risk children until the age of 18 years. 
At the time of evaluation, the programme was in the second phase (2015 onwards) and the active beneficiaries 
were spread across eight districts: Dhaka North, Barisal, Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandh, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and 
Chapai Nowabgonj. The programme was finally discontinued in July 2020, after 12 years of implementation. 
Theory of Change. The programme’s original theory of change (ToC) included Impact and Outcomes of the 
programme. However, the pathways towards these outcomes were inadequately expressed, which led to a 
modification of the ToC to include interim outcomes and mediators, with no changes to the outcomes and 
indicators presented in the original ToC. The ToC reflected the importance of knowledge, attitudes and practices, 
the role of cash as an “incentive” and for improving child’s bargaining power within the household. It also 
strengthened the role of the case management process in early identification of risk, and role of other services 
offered through that process in achieving the intended outcomes. 
Evaluation timeline. The evaluation was delayed expectedly due to limited data availability and lack of reliable 
information at the national level, along with unplanned field visits, the addition of a profiling phase, and COVID-
19 related public health measures led to a 6 month+ delay in being able to get to the field. 
2. Evaluation purpose and objectives 
Following the decision to discontinue the CCT in May 2020, the objectives of the evaluation were revised. The 
revised primary objectives of this evaluation were as follows: 
1. To generate evidence on the impact of the CCT and to understand the role of cash and complementary 
child protection services in the provision of sustainable and transformative social protection for children.  
2. To generate accountability by exploring how successful the CCT programme has been in achieving its 
expected outcomes and to generate actionable recommendations for how cash transfers can best be used 
to supplement the direction of social protection schemes in the future and the necessary capacities within 
government to conduct such schemes.

3. To assess the programme design and implementation as well as its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and 
sustainability. 
To this end, the specific objectives of the evaluation were to: 
1. Analyse the extent: (i) to which the CCT programme has been designed and implemented efficiently and 
effectively, (ii) the conditions of the programme were beneficial or hindering and (iii) of the programme’s 
cost-effectiveness   
2. Understand how families use the money provided, whether they complied with conditions, whether the 
transfer value is adequate, and explore the extent to which spending translated into benefits for children 
3. Understand the role of COVID-19 in sustaining progress on schooling, child labour and early marriage 
among CCT programme beneficiaries  
4. Assess institutional capacity at national and sub-national level (including human and financial resources), 
identify key gaps and bottlenecks in its pilot and small-scale stages and the impact of these gaps on 
programme and beneficiary outcomes, with an eye to understand the role of programme in strengthening 
(or not) such capacity  
The results from the evaluation were intended to inform the Department of Social Services and UNICEF 
regarding the estimated achievement of the CCT programme and to draw lessons for the improvement of 
interventions for children in Bangladesh. 
3. Methodology 
Approach and design. The study was conducted in two phases: Part 1 the evaluability assessment and Part 2 the 
evaluation. Once beneficiary and non-beneficiary risk forms were digitized; a profile of both groups was 
constructed in Part 1 of the evaluation. With half the non-beneficiary sample receiving at least one other service 
(excluding cash transfer) and a fraction of the database representing non-beneficiaries of the CCT or any other 
intervention, getting a robust match was going to be challenging. Even within the sample of non-beneficiaries 
available, the risk of not being able to track them all down was high. 
In Part 2, the evaluation team then approached a quasi-experimental evaluation using Propensity Score Matching 
(PSM) methods. The team implemented a two-pronged analysis – assessing the difference between those receiving 
the CCT and not receiving any interventions and those receiving the CCT+ other interventions and those receiving 
any intervention except the CCT. The study used a theory-based but exploratory approach to measure the 
relevance, sustainability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the programme. 
Qualitative Sample 
KIIs were conducted with key stakeholders at the national, district and sub-district levels including those involved 
in programme implementation, monitoring, or oversight as well as from programme beneficiaries using a 
purposive sampling approach. The following interviews were conducted: 
• 18 national level KIIs: UNICEF, UNFPA, SCI, DSS, MoWCA, Aparajeyo Bangladesh, MoSW 
• 56 sub-national level KIIs: Social workers, CBCPC, USSO, Health workers, Educators, NGO workers, 
Woman Councillor 
• 35 FGDs: (Beneficiary and non-beneficiary) Caregivers, Adolescents, Children, CBCPC 
• 9 case studies: Selected based on compelling stories 
Quantitative Sample 
The quantitative survey was sampled to be representative. It covered 8 districts including Dhaka North, Barisal, 
Khulna, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Sylhet, Sunamgonj, and Chapai Nowabgonj. The summary of the final number of 
respondents is provided in the Table 2. 
4. Key Findings 
Relevance and appropriateness 
• The study finds that the choice to use conditional transfers rather than unconditional transfers was justified to 
some extent.  There is no conclusive evidence to show that the conditional mechanism has anything to do with 
the positive effects of CCTs or that conditions have a larger impact on these outcomes than unconditional cash 

 
 
viii
transfers. In the given context of limited capacity of the implementing actors to monitor conditions, the use of 
conditions appears unnecessary, taking away from resources that could be allocated to better social messaging and 
behaviour change. 
• The risk assessment increased the visibility of potentially the most vulnerable children to a great extent and was 
successful in identification of vulnerable children to complement the targeting of other social protection projects, 
especially for children with disabilities and for children’s access to education overall. However, there were gaps in 
coverage as not all vulnerable children that were identified through risk assessment received the CCT and the 
programme excluded children in institutional care who could benefit from parental or community-based care, and 
potentially street children, who tend to move frequently. 
• The targeting and selection criteria were designed to minimise errors to the extent possible given financial and 
human resources available. The programme’s targeting approach was designed to include as many children as 
possible that may be considered at risk. Yet, whenever an arbitrary line - such as a PMT score for poverty targeting 
or a risk score in this case are used, targeting errors will exist. Children who score just below 24 are marginally 
different from those that score just above that threshold. Furthermore, financial availability limited the number of 
CCT provision available causing social workers to bypass the risk assessment alone and incorporate other 
dimensions such as confidence that the child will meet conditions to determine who is enrolled. 
• Cash was considered adequate to meet the needs in terms of access to education but inadequate to increase 
household income in the short term and were insufficient to drive long-term outcomes in terms of reduction in 
child marriage and child labour. When tackling complex outcomes such as child marriage and child labour that 
are rooted in decades of social practice and deeply entrenched social norms, cash alone is often insufficient to 
drive long-term change. While cash is necessary to alleviate the financial limitations that drive such behaviours, 
overcoming social pressures requires additional non-monetary efforts to challenge and change social norms. 
• The programme design did not address the needs of girls and boys separately. There was no specific guidance or 
guidelines on specific risks to look out for boys or girls and the assessment forms did not adopt any gender-
specific risk questions. The risk to boys and girls assumed equally in design, but social workers demonstrate 
awareness of differences that should be accounted for. Nonetheless, these differences sometimes also led to social 
norms and practice driven decisions that were gender negative (e.g. girls being dropped from the programme for 
child labour compared to boys; domestic chores not counting towards work, etc.). Finally, the same set of 
interventions were offered for all children in the programme. 
• The TOC is being followed in relation to the non-monetary components of the programme package. The evidence 
does not corroborate the achievement of the assumed pathways of outcome and impact through the cash transfer, 
particularly the realisation of increasing household income for 60% of the households. 
Efficiency 
• The implementation process was very resource and time intensive and offers vital lessons to simplify it for 
improved efficiency. The CCT had a lengthy implementation process and repetitive processes, which increased 
the administrative burden and reduced resources available for programme activities for sub-national authorities 
(e.g. monitoring and case management). The programme relied on a parallelly established structure for 
implementing the core programme activities such as case management, which generate efficiency losses in the 
short and long-term and make little contribution to strengthening systems in the long run. 
• The lack of detailed cost breakdown limited the analysis of the cost-efficiency. Using a cost per beneficiary 
approach, the cost of the programme appears to be high for the cash transfer (due to administrative costs of high 
costs of identification and monitoring) but the case management approach itself costs about BDT 5,000 per 
beneficiary. A comparison with data from other countries shows that cost of case management varies by context 
and this programme has opportunities for improving cost-efficiency through scaling up, integration and 
simplification of processes.  
Effectiveness 
• The programme has achieved some progress towards impact in the form of improvements identifying at-risk 
children, in attitudes towards child marriage and child labour, improved agency of adolescents in negotiating 
decisions related to education with parents.  
• Girls were more likely to drop out of the programme, more likely to me married while in the programmes and 
comprise nearly 75% of all dropouts due to child labour. Boys on the other hand were more likely to be allowed 
higher tolerance with child labour, as it was deemed necessary.  

 
 
ix 
• The programme included children (270) with disabilities and increased access to services for them significantly. 
The programme also had an important role to play in keeping children in school through cross-sectoral linkages. 
• The establishment of CPCPC and deployment of social workers has been vital to the implementation of this 
programme. The social workers received training before and on the job, but the programme was not integrated 
with permanent government structures. While there is some evidence that CBCPC and the social mobilisation 
have increased awareness and activated community members to address such risks, the roles of the CBCPC and 
social workers in improving capacity beyond the programme may be limited without government ownership and 
commitment to their continuation. 
• The programme was monitored by officials from the Upazila as well as through UNICEF field offices. 
Nonetheless monitoring of beneficiaries and of social workers could be strengthened further using a structured 
monitoring framework and evaluation plan, clear feedback loops and improvements in programme design. 
• Social workers were successful in monitoring conditions in the programme period (18 months), but children 
became hard to track and monitor after the cash transfer and until the age of 18 due to workload of social workers 
and movement of children away from the original location. Nonetheless, none of the monitoring was systematic, 
recorded, or analysed for routine and reflective learning and accountability. 
Sustainability 
• Key learnings from a programming perspective 
o Social workforce and case management are non-negotiable elements of child sensitive social protection 
o Education is critical for reducing a whole spectrum of other risks for children. 
o Extending the programme to cover married children will be instrumental in preventing further violation of 
children’s rights. 
o Integration with government institutions is vital, even for pilots to scale up as it enables processes to be 
optimized for national capacity 
• Integrating case management with existing cash transfers would significantly reduce the burden on case managers 
and prevent duplication, thereby tackling the non-financial resource gaps 
• Not enough evidence to conclude but data suggest that under the current format, sustaining any evidenced impacts 
will be challenging. However, if caseworkers have the necessary time and resources and if caseloads are better 
managed, there is great potential for them to affect lives of children after graduation. No differences are evident 
between boys and girls due to lack of monitoring data. 
5. Conclusions 
• The CPSP programme has been implemented for over twelve years. In these twelve years, the programme has 
filled a critical gap in capacity for protecting children’s rights. The key contribution of this programme has been 
to establish and pilot a robust case management system, with important lessons for future investments in this area.  
• Th study concluded that the programme was relevant and responsive to the needs of vulnerable children to some 
extent and was supportive to beneficiary households in the short term. The risk assessment system was successful 
in enabling the identification of vulnerable children – especially children with disabilities – for a wide spectrum of 
services through strong referrals and linkages.  
• The case management component plays an important role in achieving intended outcomes and the programme 
offers a solid foundation on which a national social workforce may be established. Cash and case management 
together improve outcomes for agency of children as well as knowledge, attitudes of families. Limited change is 
noted at the community level, which requires community level interventions to propel the necessary social change 
• Cash has undeniable effects on enabling households to overcome financial barriers and is a key component 
enabling children to stay in school.2 However, the implementation of a new and conditional cash transfer 
programme adds to the cost of implementation and had limited, if any, value addition to the uptake of education 
where a comprehensive case management system is in place and a range of education stipends already exist. 
• Focusing efforts on building the referrals and linkages with a long-term and periodic cash transfer while 
strengthening case management offer significantly higher returns on this investment. 
• Finally, inclusion of children that are living on the street, and those in institutional care that can be placed in family 
or community-based care, as well as inclusion of children who are married and in labour in case management for

referrals to other programmes, would greatly improve the situation of children and the maximise the investment 
in case management for the most vulnerable children. 
6. Lessons Learnt 
The learnings UNICEF needs to embrace are as follows: 
• The costs of running a pilot – especially in the absence of planned and timely evaluations - are significantly higher 
than projects which benefit from the economies of scale, adopt a learning-by-doing approach through clear 
monitoring and feedback loops. 
• After 12 years of implementation, the CSPB was unable to establish institutionally interest and engagement with 
the government for the CCT programme. With the programme moving from MoWCA and MoSW and with 
significant UNICEF involvement until programme closure, there are several lessons for future programming. 
Where a pilot is designed, governments must be closely consulted, existing government channels must be 
leveraged and a clear roadmap with roles and responsibilities for UNICEF and government should be developed. 
• The monitoring aspects of case management processes fell short in this programme, costing UNICEF decades of 
learning and opportunities for vital evidence generation. 
• The removal of girls who may be married while enrolled into the programme is rather concerning. It is vital to 
seek and establish linkages to other UN partners and agencies working with married children to hand-over cases 
or better coordinate for their protection and empowerment. 
• Social service workforce is valuable, as this programme shows that once a child is under case management, there 
are immense benefits to the vulnerable child and their household. 
7. Recommendations 
For future pilots: 
1. Make pilots designed to build national capacity, use national structures and eventually integrate in national systems. 
(UNICEF) 
2. Develop planned implementation and evaluation timelines with clear feedback loops for programme closure or 
expansion in the design phase. (UNICEF) 
3. Incorporate rigorous and systematic monitoring processes (data collection, collation, analysis and feedback loops), 
develop a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework and assign monitoring and oversight 
responsibilities as part of the design package to prevent oversights during implementation. (UNICEF) 
For programmes that may adopt and use risk assessment and case management systems: 
4. Invest in piloting, testing and refining the risk management protocols to ensure all changes are based on evidence, 
and tools are sensitive to needs of the most vulnerable boys and girls in a gender-sensitive manner. (UNICEF) 
5. Consider digital case management systems – including risk forms for better recordkeeping, effective monitoring 
and utilization of the data. (DSS) 
For the national system on child and social protection: 
6. Draw lessons from the case management tools used for the CCT for generating lessons, communication and 
advocacy to develop, implement and scale national child protection systems. (DSS) 
7. Invest in establishing a social service workforce drawing on the learnings from the CCT programme. (DSS) 
8. Explore the potentials for integrated cash plus care programmes, especially for children with disabilities to improve 
their access to services and opportunities and to achieve long-term impacts on complex outcomes like child 
marriage and labour. (DSS) 
9. Engage in further research to explore the advantages and disadvantages of conditional transfers in Bangladesh, 
where resources for monitoring and tracking are limited. (DSS/UNICEF) 
10. Establish vital partnerships and lengthen the planning horizon for systematic strengthening of social and child 
protection systems and delivery of basic social services. (UNICEF)

1. Context and Background of the Evaluation 
1.1. 
Introduction to the report 
This report presents an evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme (CCT 
programme) of the Child Sensitive Social Protection project in Bangladesh, implemented from 
2012 to 2019 in Bangladesh. The evaluation research was conducted between the period 2016/17 
to March 2022 by an independent international team of the Economic Policy Research Institute 
(EPRI) contracted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh.  
EPRI led the project evaluation, whilst working in continuous close collaboration with UNICEF 
and key stakeholders, important ministries and departments such as the Department of Social 
Services, the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs, and local governments as well as other 
relevant partners.  
During the start of this evaluation in 2019, the government of Bangladesh was keen to scale-up 
the CCT programme nationally. However, in May 2020, a decision was taken to discontinue the 
CCT programme. Since the evaluation was underway during this period, following discussions 
with the UNICEF Bangladesh office, a decision was taken to revise the focus of the evaluation so 
that the findings of the evaluation would still be relevant and valuable for future programming. 
Since the programme is no longer operational, the original focus on providing recommendations 
for scaling up the programme was shifted to understanding how the programme can provide 
insights and recommendations for the ways in which cash transfers can be used to inform future 
child-sensitive social protection programming.  
1.2. 
Context of the CCT programme 
Bangladesh is a lower-middle-income nation, with an estimated population of 164.7 million people 
in 2020. The country made remarkable progress in poverty reduction – from 43.5% in 1991 to 
14.3% in 2016.3 Bangladesh achieved a GDP growth of 8.31% in 2018-2019 and its economy was 
recognised as one of the fastest-growing economies globally.4  
Despite the impressive achievements in reducing poverty and achieving economic growth, key 
challenges have continued to persist. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, 
infrastructure is weak and far stretched – thus, unable to meet the needs of its growing population. 
The challenges are made worse with rapid urbanisation and high climate-risk vulnerability; both of 
which undermine national efforts to cater to the needs of the most vulnerable. 
Within the country, approximately a quarter (24.6%) of the population is multidimensionally poor 
while an additional 18.2% are classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.5 Bangladesh 
ranked 75 out of 107 countries according to the 2020 Global Hunger Index 6 The proportion of 
undernourished has stayed relatively consistent at 13.0% over the period of 2017 to 2019.7 The 
prevalence of stunting in children due to malnourishment under five was 30.8% as of 2018.8 Data 
has shown that stunting tends to be concentrated among children from households facing multiple
