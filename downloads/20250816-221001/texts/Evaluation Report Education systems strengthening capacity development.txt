Executive Summary 
Overview of the intervention, Purpose, Objectives and Scope of the Evaluation 
1. The project ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its sub-national 
Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality education outcomes’ was implemented by UNICEF in 
close collaboration with a linked UNESCO project, as well as with the Government of Iraq. The project targeted 
teachers at governorate level, as well as education planners, statisticians, and other relevant staff in the MoE 
at central and governorate levels. The indirect Rights Holders are the students and pupils visiting Iraqi schools, 
including vulnerable school children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Teachers are secondary Rights Holders 
in this context. The project had a budget of EUR 5,094,577.95 and was implemented over a period of 46 months, 
from August 2019 to May 2023. The project was implemented in a subset of governorates and general 
directorates, namely Baghdad (Rusafa 2 and 3, and Karkh 1 and 3), Najaf, Anbar, Basra, Thi-Qar, Missan, 
Muthanna and Qadissiyah. It was focused on downstream project implementation and planning development, 
and had three strategic objectives (SO): 
• 
SO1: to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of education through roll-out of the Education 
Management Information System (EMIS) and increase capacity of education planners, statisticians 
and educators at governorate level: UNESCO (national level), UNICEF (governorate and school 
levels). 
• 
SO2: to strengthen the capacity of the MoE at the central and governorate level to improve 
education services delivery: UNESCO (National Level), UNICEF (governorate level). 
• 
SO3: to enhance the quality of teaching and learning by operationalising the capacity development 
plan and developing teachers’ capacities at central and governorate levels: UNESCO (national 
level), UNICEF (governorate and school levels). 
2. The purpose of the evaluation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the outcomes of UNICEF’s 
activities to strengthen the education system in Iraq and to identify areas for improvement. The evaluation is 
both formative and summative in nature and aims to generate insights that are useful for the design and 
implementation of future initiatives on systems strengthening in education and in Iraq more particularly, as well 
as to foster accountability for the performance of the intervention and the results achieved. The objectives of 
the evaluation were i) to assess the achievement of results, their sustainability and how valuable the results 
were to the intended targeted groups; ii) to understand how the design and implementation strategy could be 
improved; iii) to examine how well the intervention has adapted to changing contexts and to other factors 
influencing the achievement of the results, and how well the monitoring system of the intervention supported 
adaptive management decisions; iv) to identify lessons learned and good practices useful to inform future 
programming and policy decisions; and v) to provide actionable recommendations. 
3. The evaluation’s scope at geographical level covers the project’s activities across all the target governorates 
for the project1 and at temporal level covers the entire implementation period of the intervention, including 
the 10 months of the no-cost extension that was granted in July 2022 with the total period being 46 months, 
from August 2019 to May 2023. 
4. The key users of this evaluation are the UNICEF Country Office, the Ministry of Education in Iraq at both the 
centralised and decentralised levels, and the wider group of education stakeholders, including the Education 
Sector Group in Iraq and the main donor, the Delegation of the European Union to Iraq. 
Evaluation Methodology 
5. This evaluation applied a theory-based approach rooted in contribution analysis of the causal linkages based 
on the project’s Theory of Change (ToC), which was developed during the inception phase. The evaluation’s 
approach drew on the principles of outcome harvesting, by gathering data about the targeted outcomes, then 
working backwards and, guided by the results framework, determining the extent to which the interventions 
contributed to changes (if any) and particularly any unintended/unplanned effects.  
6. The Evaluation Team used a mixed-methods approach of data collection, including primary qualitative data 
from Key Informant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGD), secondary qualitative data from the 
review of relevant documents as well as primary quantitative data from an online perception survey covering 
 
1 Baghdad (Rusafa 2 and 3, and Karkh 1 and 3), Najaf, Anbar, Basra, Thi-Qar, Missan, Muthanna, and Qadisiya. Not all output 
activities were implemented in all of these governorates alike (see table 3 for details).

key stakeholders of the intervention purposely sampled across three governorates. The evaluation utilised 
appreciative inquiry for shaping its data collection tools, in order to help interviewees and FGD participants 
uncover existing strengths and opportunities, as well as to explore challenges and issues in a constructive way. 
The approach to data analysis incorporated a realist evaluation approach, as this approach is designed to 
understand how and why interventions work in a given context. The evaluation design and tools received ethical 
clearance from an Ethics Review Board, prior to the beginning of the data collection. Taken together, these 
approaches helped to ensure the rigour of the data gathered, and thus the strength of the evaluation findings. 
Key Conclusions on Findings 
7. The project was overall successful at achieving results, particularly output-level results, and this in the face of 
some significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This success has to be balanced against weaker 
results related to achieving outcomes, due to the longer-than-the-project timeline for achieving them, as well 
as due to underestimating organisational change, which is a key element for achieving the outcome-level 
results. The project’s overall success is attributed to a partnership approach that worked well, particularly in 
collaboration with UNESCO, though areas for improvement exist in engendering ownership and enhancing 
stakeholder engagement, especially with the Ministry of Education and local Directorates of Education. The 
project benefits however from the support of its stakeholders, which is an essential enabler for ultimately 
achieving the outcome-level changes. The key challenge is how to capitalise on that stakeholder support and 
commitment to build upon and consolidate movement towards project outcomes. These key themes are 
elaborated in what follows. 
Output-Level Results Achieved, Outcome-Level Results not (yet) achieved 
8. The project was overall successful in achieving its targeted output-level results, despite significant challenges 
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A project design that was strongly in line with the needs of target groups 
and with the context, plus an adequate monitoring mechanism for activity and output-level results, were 
important factors that contributed to the strong achievement of output-level results. The key factor to this 
success however was the partnership approach, which worked well. 
9. While the project demonstrated success at the output level, uncertainties linger regarding outcome-level 
results. Deep-rooted project design issues, including an extended timeline for outcome achievement and 
delayed activity implementation, contribute to this uncertainty. The intricate nature of organisational change 
processes within a large institution like the MoE adds further complexity. The usage of newly developed 
capacities and planning tools also requires organisational-level change, including appropriate incentivisation 
and ownership building measures in order to facilitate the move towards data-driven decision-making and 
planning and thus the achievement of the outcome-level results. This is also relevant for SO3’s e-learning, not 
including measures to amplify the capacity building beyond the core group of teachers trained, via 
institutionalisation. A further observation is that the project’s SOs were relatively siloed from one another. This 
reduced their ability to create synergistic change, which is particularly relevant given how an effective EMIS 
system should support governorate-level planning guided by a GESP and stronger staff capacities. The overall 
conclusion then is to call into question the project’s implicit assumption that individual-level capacity building 
and the creation of sophisticated planning tools will on their own produce organisational-level change and 
ultimately system-level change (in Iraq’s education system). It also underlines the need to manage the 
expectations given the large changes aimed at, including with the donors and with implementing partners. 
Strong Adaptive Management and Stakeholder Commitment 
10. A key strength of the project lies in its efficient execution of output results, attributed to robust adaptive 
management strategies and a high level of stakeholder commitment and coherence, particularly between 
UNICEF and UNESCO. Effective coordination mechanisms facilitated collaboration, allowing timely adjustments 
in timelines and resource sharing. However, this success has heightened expectations on the Ministry of 
Education (MoE) for sustained progress. The project now stands at a critical juncture, where continued 
engagement and follow-up with the MoE are imperative to capitalise on achieved successes and to ensure 
sustained momentum. 
Use of Theory of Change and Outcome Monitoring 
11. The project’s Theory of Change did not fully grasp and address the complexity of the change process it was 
aiming to achieve. This is reflected in some linkages and assumptions not being sufficiently clear or strong. A 
more detailed ToC could have supported the movement from output- towards outcome-level results. This is 
also reflected in the strong monitoring of results at the output level, but weaker monitoring at the outcome 
level. Process indicators related to linkages between outputs and outcomes, stronger outcome-level 

 
9 
 
monitoring, as well as feedback loops would have informed analysis of what was working and what was not 
working in the move towards outcomes. This could in turn have informed a stronger response to improving 
those results through adaptive management approaches. 
Highly Functional Partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO, and MoE 
12. The project's success is attributed, in part, to a highly functional partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO, and the 
Ministry of Education (MoE). Effective communication and coordination mechanisms, both between the 
organisations as well as with some of the local-level stakeholders, fostered capable adaptive management 
strategies and skilfully navigated implementation opportunities and challenges. However, while strong 
horizontal connections between UNICEF, UNESCO, and the MoE were evident, weaker vertical feedback loops 
hindered quick communication of challenges up the line from local-level stakeholders from Directorates of 
Education (DoE) to the upper management level. This potentially contributed to delayed decision-making, thus 
impeding the achievement of the targeted outcomes. 
Ownership Can Be Increased 
13. The evaluation revealed a need for enhanced stakeholder ownership, particularly within the MoE. Insufficiently 
specific tasks assigned to the MoE diminished its ownership of the project, which underlines the importance of 
substantive engagement and clear roles. Strong ownership, coupled with the adoption of capacity building 
measures on EMIS within the MoE, could strengthen the project's sustainability. Hence, the need for continued 
engagement and follow-up with the MoE, in order to build on existing successes and ensure sustained 
commitment. 
Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Measures lacking 
14. The context in Iraq is particularly prone to climate-related fragilities, with potential impacts on education for 
example through population movements but also by virtue of the need to increase young peoples’ awareness 
and to encourage their informed efforts to help combat it. Climate change mitigation and adaptation measures 
were not foreseen in the design of the project which is a significant weakness of the project given the context 
of Iraq and given the conceptual room to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in the 
design of the project. 
Integration of gender/JfWMGB Principles across the Project 
15. The integration of gender principles across the project varied, with explicit attention given to SO2 and more 
implicit considerations in SO1. Despite gender-disaggregated data inclusion and analysis, there was a lack of a 
differentiated approach in terms of programming for boys, girls, men, or women. The monitoring system did 
not thoroughly address gender/JbWMBG issues, with gaps in articulating how gender would be prioritised and 
implemented across project components. While there is potential for gender considerations in the EMIS 
system’s future use, explicit strategies were absent. 
Lessons Learned 
Partnerships 
16. The evaluation underscores the pivotal role of strong partnerships in achieving robust project results. A 
successful partnership involves aligning roles with organisational strengths, establishing clear communication 
and feedback loops, and fostering long-term ownership. The project’s success, particularly in navigating 
challenges and tight timelines, highlights the importance of assessing partners’ strengths, reputation, and their 
ability to bring stakeholders onboard. The lesson learned is to conduct a thorough evaluation of partners’ 
capacities and reputations in the national/sub-national context, facilitating the achievement of project results 
and ensuring successful collaboration. 
Project Design and Implementation 
17. A critical lesson emerges regarding the significance of a well-constructed project design rooted in a realistic 
Theory of Change (ToC). While individual-level capacity building and planning tools are vital, they alone do not 
guarantee organisational or system-level change. Collaborative efforts at the concept note and proposal stage 
are crucial, in order to ensure a strong and realistic ToC. This collaborative process helps articulate assumptions, 
appraise mechanisms realistically, and foster commitment from higher management. The lesson emphasises 
the importance of using the ToC to inform implementation and to adapt the project as needed, leading to 
realistic and achievable outcome-level results. 
Gender, Equity, Human Rights, and Climate Change 
18. The project highlights challenges in incorporating gender equity, human rights, and climate change elements 
due to a weak understanding of their integration. Mainstreaming these elements across all project components 
is crucial, yet the evaluation reveals a tendency for them to be somewhat lost in the approach or only 

 
10 
 
superficially integrated. Proactively addressing this weakness at the design and implementation stages is 
essential. The lesson learned is the importance of specifically reviewing and prioritising gender equity, human 
rights, and climate change elements throughout project development and implementation, leveraging expertise 
from UNICEF’s specialists. 
Project Monitoring 
19. The evaluation identifies the importance of robust monitoring at both the output and outcome levels, coupled 
with effective feedback mechanisms. Weaknesses in outcome-level monitoring data and linkages between 
outputs and outcomes were observed. The lesson here is that strong outcome-level monitoring and feedback 
loops are crucial for adjusting the project’s approach and facilitating progress towards outcomes. This includes 
monitoring organisational change-related outcomes using appropriate indicators, especially in contexts where 
adjustments to the project are likely to be required. Without such mechanisms, the chances of achieving 
outcomes are diminished, particularly in fragile or conflict-affected contexts. 
Key Recommendations 
Recommendation 1: Maintain and Expand Work on Focus Areas of the Project 
20. UNICEF and its partners should plan for and implement further work on the focus areas of the project, to build 
upon its promising yet incomplete results. This should be done in the near-term, especially as the project’s 
achievements will weaken/become progressively more outdated over time. 
Recommendation 2: Revise and Fine-tune Theory of Change and Project Design at Large 
21. To address challenges in design and implementation, UNICEF and its partners should revise and update the 
project’s Theory of Change (ToC). This includes building the capacity and will to use new tools, plans, and 
capacities for organisational capacity building, system strengthening, and fostering ownership by engaging the 
MoE actively. Recommendations further emphasise involving the MoE in project design, ensuring widespread 
coverage of the EMIS system, creating stronger linkages between project components, and enhancing 
monitoring at output and outcome levels. 
Recommendation 3: Strengthening the Project’s Partnership Approach 
22. The partnership between UNICEF, UNESCO and the MoE has been a key strength of this project, incorporating 
strong linkages between upstream and downstream components and capitalising on many of the institutional 
strengths of each partner. Furthermore, this partnership approach is in line with institutional commitments 
made in the UN Cooperation Framework for Iraq. The approach should thus be continued for future work 
projects. 
Recommendation 4: Maintain Sensitivity to Shifting Needs of Target Populations in a Volatile Environment 
23. UNICEF is advised to ensure the appropriateness of all components in future projects based on needs analysis 
and project proposals. While acknowledging that the thematic focus of this project’s SO3 on e-learning was 
influenced by the COVID-19 crisis, the project should conduct regular needs assessments to inform decisions. 
This includes responding to shock events, while mitigating negative impacts on the project’s longer-term 
objectives. 
Recommendation 5: Include Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Measures 
24. Future project iterations should integrate robust climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, 
particularly in education-related projects. The vulnerability of Iraq to climate-related challenges underscores 
the importance of embedding such measures into policy and learning. Recommendations emphasise 
mainstreaming climate change components into GESPs, the EMIS system, and capacity-building measures for 
key stakeholders. This involves adhering to UNICEF’s institutional commitments related to climate change and 
incorporating appropriate measures into project design despite the challenging local context.

1. Introduction 
25. This final report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations resulting from the 
evaluation of the intervention ‘Systems building and capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education and its 
sub-national Directorates of Education for effective delivery of quality education outcomes’, also referred to as 
the ‘EU-funded intervention on education systems strengthening’. This is also called ‘the project’ in the rest of 
the report. 
26. This evaluation report provides an overview of the context and background of the intervention in Iraq, as well 
as its objectives. It also shines a light on the purpose, objectives and scope of this evaluation. Moreover, the 
evaluation framework is presented, as well as the evaluation approach and methodology. Finally, the report 
outlines findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations. These are aimed at informing relevant 
key stakeholders and decision-makers about the performance of the intervention. A further aim is to generate 
insights and support learning about possible future initiatives on strengthening Iraq’s public education system 
for effective delivery of quality education outcomes. 
1.1. Context and Background 
27. The education system in Iraq was considered one of the best in the Middle East up until the early 1990s, with 
strengths including a strong track record on combating illiteracy. However, the country has experienced a series 
of conflicts since then, including the first Gulf War in 1991, the Iraq War from 2003 to 2011, and the fight against 
the insurgency of the ‘Islamic State’ from 2014 until 2021. 
28. These various conflicts caused significant numbers of deaths and widespread suffering, destruction of 
infrastructure, large flows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) – compounded by hundreds of thousands of 
refugees from the civil war in neighbouring Syria – as well as very significant economic disruption. The resulting 
impacts upon the education system in Iraq have been significant: a drastic decrease in operating schools, a lack 
of qualified teachers, and an overall lack of appropriate investments and financing for the system. Indeed, 
government expenditures on education declined from just over 5 per cent of GDP in 2009 to only 3.9 per cent 
ten years later.2 
29. This situation has had a strong impact on the country’s student population. Evidence of this is the several million 
students who have been out of school for often long periods of time, as well as the large number of damaged 
schools and the need for multiple shifts in many schools. There has also been a significant decline in learning 
levels in the country, varying school completion rates between girls and boys (with 5 per cent more boys than 
girls completing primary school versus 6 per cent more girls than boys completing upper secondary school), 
declining pass rates in national leaving exams between 2009 and 2017, and clear evidence of weak reading skills 
as well as low maths and science levels. Moreover, these various impacts have been compounded by the effects 
of population growth as well as by the long school closures and economic disruptions linked to the COVID-19 
pandemic: according to UNOCHA, school closures in Iraq were some of the longest in the world, lasting up to 
63 weeks and affected some 11 million children.3 
30. The impacts have also been significant in terms of further entrenching vulnerabilities, especially in the poorest 
population quintiles of the project Rights Holders (primary-school-age children from the poorest quintile are 
significantly more likely to be out of school than children in the richest quintile); and, girls in rural areas (only 
80 per cent of girls aged 6 to 10 are in school, as compared to 90 per cent of rural boys). Furthermore, school 
closures related to COVID-19 aggravated the situation of vulnerable children and especially girls.4 Likewise, the 
IDPs in the country were also impacted by the many schools damaged due to the conflict (the number of IDPs 
remained over a million in 20235), while children with disabilities were disproportionately impacted by the 
overall deterioration of the education system and were more likely to be out-of-school.6 Importantly, it is

presumed that intersecting identities exacerbate these exclusions and vulnerabilities (e.g. being a girl with a 
disability from a rural area).7 
31. In response to this situation, the Government of Iraq has prioritised improving the education system. Areas of 
focus from the 2011-2020 National Education Strategy include raising the quality of education in the country, 
by better supporting schools and teachers and by enhancing the professional development for teachers. The 
National Development Plan 2018-2022 included a focus on improving enrolment rates; building thousands more 
schools and renovating thousands of damaged schools; improving the quality of teaching such as by building 
teacher capacities and modernising curriculums; and improving the management of education information as 
well as the capacities of education administrators. These various efforts are within a larger context, where the 
country is transitioning from being a conflict- and post-conflict state to a more stable and development-oriented 
one, and thus where work localised around the triple nexus of humanitarian-development-peace is ever more 
important.8 
1.2. UNICEF in Iraq 
32. UNICEF has been working in Iraq since the mid-1980s, focused on humanitarian needs and emergency response 
from the early 1990s to the late 2000s, including in the area of education. Beginning in 2009, the agency shifted 
its response to focus on working with the government to develop child-friendly social policies, modernise its 
institutions, and improve the nationwide delivery of basic services critical to the future survival and 
development of children. From 2019, UNICEF’s agenda was focused on supporting the Government of Iraq to 
achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which is to ensure an inclusive and equitable, accessible, 
quality education and lifelong learning for all. The Government of Iraq emphasised these goals in its Second 
National Voluntary Review Report on the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (p. 62).9 This was 
to be done by: supporting the strengthening of the education systems in policy development, coordination, 
planning, budgeting and monitoring; supporting the generation of new strategic data for evidence-based 
advocacy; and, supporting the strengthening of systems and policy development including to decentralise 
education management, as well as the integration of life skills into the education system. UNICEF was also 
advocating for equitable and efficient allocation as well as use of resources to ensure equitable school access 
and to enhance quality education for children and particularly for girls.10 
33. UNICEF’s vision in Iraq is that “by 2024, children, adolescents and women in Iraq are better protected and have 
more equitable and inclusive access to quality basic services.”11 The outcome statement on education is that “… 
by 2024 children and adolescents, especially the most vulnerable, benefit from equitable access to quality and 
inclusive education.”12 There are multiple specific areas of focus for UNICEF, including strengthening the 
capacity of the Ministry of Education to effectively plan, budget, implement and monitor equitable delivery of
