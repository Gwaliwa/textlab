EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
BACKGROUND 
Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a diverse nation with a population of 10.1 million and 10,000 ethnic clans, residing 
across 600 islands and speaking more than 800 languages. The majority of its population lives in rural areas with 
limited access to basic services. PNG is considered a lower-middle-income country with a medium human 
development ranking and high gender inequality. With nearly 39% of the population living below the poverty line, 
the county strives to achieve the goals in the PNG Vision 2050 and the Development Strategic Plan (2010-2030). 
PNG faces significant challenges in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets related to water, 
sanitation and hygiene (WASH), with rural areas having low access to basic sanitation and hygiene services. 
Estimates by the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program demonstrate disparities in service levels between urban 
and rural areas, between districts, and between types of WASH services, with the need for improvements in 
underserved areas to enhance public health, human potential, and socio-economic development. 
The PNG Constitution recognizes the primacy of Provincial and Local Level Governments (LLG), with law making 
responsibilities for WASH, education and health assigned to the LLGs and provinces under the Organic Law for 
Provincial and Local Level Governments. Although the National WASH Policy (2015-2030) does not accord priority 
to districts, they have received greater focus since the approval of the District Development Authority (DDA) Act 
of 2014 that established DDAs as a vehicle for the creation and transfer of assets. 
OVERVIEW OF THE INTERVENTION 
The EU-UNICEF Klinpela Komuniti Project (KKP) began in late 2017 with the first phase focusing on district selection 
and the preparation of costed five-year WASH plans. The project, funded by the European Union (EU) and UNICEF, 
aims to enhance the quality of life for women, men, and children in PNG by improving access to safe water, 
sanitation, and hygiene practices in alignment with the National WASH Policy. The project has two primary 
objectives: to create a healthier and safer environment, reducing waterborne and hygiene-related illnesses, and 
to enhance governance and service delivery in the WASH sector. It targets schools, health care facilities (HCF), and 
communities with a focus on community-led total sanitation (CLTS) in four districts: Hagen Central, Goroka, 
Nawaeb, and Bougainville Central. The project beneficiaries include school children in 200 schools, patients, 
mothers and newborns in 36 HCFs, people in 800 communities around the beneficiary schools, and the general 
population with a goal to increase their awareness of sanitation and hygiene. The project's three main output 
results are (1) improving sanitation and handwashing facilities in schools and HCFs, (2) increasing public awareness 
of hygiene and sanitation, and (3) strengthening the institutional framework for WASH service delivery. 
EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, & INTENDED AUDIENCE 
The purpose of this evaluation is to provide sound and credible evidence on the KKP with the aims to trigger 
UNICEF PNG Country Office and National Partners’ learning, enhance accountability with respect to UNICEF’s work 
on improving WASH for children and their families and to inform decision-making on national policies and budgets 
for WASH and for programme design for scale-up. The key intended users of the evaluation are the WASH Section 
within UNICEF PNG and the EU donor. The secondary audience of the evaluation are relevant government 
institutions and authorities in charge of WASH, rights holders, future contracted project implementers and 
experts, and other UNICEF Offices. The evaluation covers the period from 2017 until 2022, in the four projects 
districts, and thematically covering the three KKP results areas outlined above. 
The evaluation’s objectives are: 
1. To assess the major factors enabling or constraining the achievement of project results; 
2. To identify key lessons learned, including success and failures, good practices and innovations from 
implementation of the project; 
3. To validate and reconstruct the project’s theory of change, including its underlying assumptions and risks; 

1 
 
4. To generate a set of clear, forward-looking, and actionable recommendations logically linked to the findings 
and conclusions. 
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 
The KKP evaluation had formative and summative elements, with a focus on the latter to gather lessons for the 
next programme and assess the programme's interventions' value and contributions to intended and unintended 
results. While non-experimental, efforts were made to include a comparative and external perspective. Due to 
limited monitoring data, qualitative methods such as key informant interviews, desk reviews, and transect walks 
were used. The evaluation encompassed cross-cutting themes of gender equality and disability, aiming to reach 
vulnerable and marginalized groups. The process was participatory, providing ongoing feedback to implementers 
and primary users, with various interactions, including field visits, feedback workshops, and data validation 
meetings. 
The key criteria and questions that frame the evaluation are: 
Relevance 
1. How do the stakeholders view the appropriateness of the project - and its planned results - to the local 
context, given the improving conditions in the country, and the remaining WASH challenges? 
2. To what extent did the project address the WASH needs of children, particularly those in the lowest wealth 
quintile, the remote populations and ones with the worst sanitation and hygiene conditions? To what extent 
did the implementation strategies of the project address gender, disability, and climate change issues? 
Effectiveness 
3. To what extent did the project help households climb up the sanitation ladder and improve children’s access 
to improved WASH, particularly for girls, and children living with disabilities and special needs? 
4. How did collaborations with counterparts and implementing partners contribute to achieving the project 
outputs and outcomes? 
Efficiency 
5. How well was the project implemented in terms of fidelity to the model, design, and plans, and management 
of costs and timelines? How did external factors – technical, financial, institutional, environmental, social - 
modify the level of achievement of outputs and outcomes? 
6. What were the strengths and gaps in capacity of the implementation team composition (UNICEF and partners 
together)? How did they contribute to the timeliness and cost of the project? 
Sustainability 
7. Are the toilets provided in schools / HCFs cleaned and looked after?  
8. Considering the emergency context and need for response under scenarios such as COVID-19, what are key 
programmatic adaptations needed to ensure handwashing practices, Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and 
the associated social norm sustain following certification? 
Coherence 
9. To what extent was the KKP delivery model appropriate to the PNG context? 
10. To what extent did the project align with implementation of the National WASH Policy 2015-2030? And how 
can it better target its contribution to the WASH SDGs? 
Data collection included desk reviews of 49 items including reports, documents, databases, and secondary data. 
The site visits occurred between the 3rd and 26th of October 2022, and included 21 schools, 11 HCFs and 9 
communities across the four districts. In the absence of a well-maintained monitoring and evaluation system, the 
evaluation relied on a purposive sample of sites proposed by the implementing partner. Interviews of 15 key 
informants supplemented the data. Data was thematically reviewed, by the two evaluation team members for 
reliability, and the emerging themes were connected to the key evaluation questions. Qualitative data was 
triangulated from multiple sources to substantiate findings, and analysed by relevant social stratifiers where 
possible, and corroborated with quantitative data from secondary sources that was analysed using descriptive 

2 
 
statistics. Consultations and workshops held with partners and UNICEF helped validate and refine the findings and 
draft recommendations. 
KEY CONCLUSIONS ON FINDINGS 
Relevance 
The significance of KKP is considered to be high, in the light of the limited access to basic sanitation services (only 
15% in rural areas), limited access to basic hygiene services (25% in rural areas), inadequate WASH facilities in 
schools and HCFs, and the high prevalence of chronic undernutrition in children (45% of rural children under five 
are stunted).   
In terms of needs addressed, the KKP aimed to target the neediest districts and children affected by the lowest 
levels of sanitation and hygiene. However, the equal allocation of facilities and targets to each of the four districts 
did not account for the differing needs between the target districts. Baseline data indicating that many schools 
and HCFs already had limited access to sanitation and hygiene services, did not necessarily affect their selection 
for improving sanitation and handwashing facilities. So while addressing significant WASH challenges in PNG, the 
KKP may not have targeted the neediest areas and beneficiaries. 
Effectiveness 
All the target project outputs have been successfully delivered by KKP, despite the numerous challenges posed by 
the ambitious targets, capacity constraints, and the restrictions imposed by COVID-19. These outputs include: 
- 
the delivery of sanitation and hygiene facilities in 200 schools and 36 HCFs. 
- 
the promotion of sanitation and hygiene with 796 communities declared ODF.  
- 
the preparation of WASH Plans, service delivery assessment and application of the bottleneck analysis tool. 
- 
the development of national guidelines for WASH in schools, national protocols for the declaration of ODF 
communities and deployment of the national monitoring information system. 
Despite the success in the achievement of these outputs, the KKP is unlikely to deliver the intended sanitation and 
hygiene outcomes, the intended health and education impact (i.e. human capital development), or the 
strengthening of the institutions necessary to ensure sustained sanitation and hygiene services for all. This 
conclusion is primarily derived from findings that: 
- 
most of the sanitation and hygiene facilities in the 200 schools and 36 HCFs are not being routinely used. 
Among those being used, over half will likely experience the premature backing-up of the toilets, and none of 
the remote rural toilet blocks can be managed safely when full, in the absence of sludge trucks. 
- 
the modeling of the CLTS approach without improvement to the wider enabling environment challenges the 
sustaining of newly acquired hygiene and sanitation behaviours. 
- 
the District WASH baseline data and WASH plans have not been used, the District WASH Committees appear 
to be inactive, and the members do not appear to have influence over sanitation and hygiene investments. In 
addition, the DDAs do not hold law-making responsibility for WASH, education, or health service provision 
although they can construct and transfer WASH assets.  
- 
while the responsible national institutions were engaged in the setting of standards for sanitation and hygiene 
services in schools, HCFs and communities, they were not involved in the monitoring, evaluation and learning 
from KKP. There is little evidence of the LLGs and provinces with law making powers for sanitation and 
hygiene, education and health service delivery being engaged by the KKP. 
The net result of choices to pursue targets over the managing of processes, to prioritise target successes above 
that of monitoring progress or understanding challenges, to roll-out a standardized approach without sufficient 
piloting and testing, may have compromised the intended outcomes of KKP and left behind flawed designs and 
processes that could negatively impact future progress in the PNG WASH sector.

While sanitation and hygiene behaviour change are a priority sub-sector for rural PNG, it is well recognized to be 
extremely challenging to affect change, particularly in schools and HCFs. In the context of the capacity challenges 
posed by the remote rural settings in PNG, ‘bottom-up’ approaches that prioritize operation and maintenance 
over asset creation likely provide better incentives for outcomes than ‘top-down’ infrastructure-led approaches. 
In this sense, the 3 Star approach to WASH in schools and HCFs, which links facility provision with a commitment 
to behaviour change, is a better alternative in remote rural settings. 
Efficiency 
KKP successfully delivered school and HCF WASH facilities on time and on budget, despite challenging conditions 
in remote areas and restrictions due to COVID-19. Evaluation findings point to concerns with the fidelity to the 
model design and plans. Issues arose primarily due to the lack of attention given to the substructure, particularly 
the effluent absorption capacity in more structured soils and the permeability of pit lining materials in less 
structured soils. Failure to develop designs that can be emptied when full and the premature filling of pits 
contributed to the abandonment of toilets. While the centralized deployment of a standard design was efficient, 
the failure to sufficiently consider site-specific factors, such as soil type, rainfall, and cultural preferences, resulted 
in facilities that are not being used or cannot be maintained. 
The KKP model surpassed the 60% target of 800 communities for ODF declaration, achieving a remarkable 99.5% 
verified and certified ODF by the DDAs within an extremely tight time frame. While the evidence of open 
defecation from the site visits may have been due to slippage, the absence of a robust monitoring and learning 
system undermines the credibility of the open defecation certification data. The absence of a third-party 
monitoring firm, lack of consolidated input, output, and outcome monitoring against baseline, and a lack of 
endline assessments makes assessment of efficiency challenging.  
Sustainability 
The technical sustainability of many toilet facilities is undermined because the pits cannot be emptied when full. 
The safeguarding of water for sanitation and hygiene was a common cause of failure in usage and routine cleaning 
of WASH facilities in all districts. 
The capacity of the various departments responsible for planning, monitoring and evaluation in the WASH sector 
requires strengthening for institutional sustainability. There was inadequate engagement with the Departments 
of Education and Health in rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and learning processes of sanitation and hygiene 
service delivery and the Department of Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs in deploying legal and social 
instruments to ensure universal access to sanitation and hygiene services. 
Coherence 
The evaluation finds several challenges in the alignment of KKP activities with policy implementation. Namely, the 
lack of clear legislation supporting the role of District WASH Committees, 5-year District WASH plans, or 
instruments for their enforcement, which presents a risk to the district-level delivery of sanitation and hygiene 
facilities. Also, the sequence of project activities lacked logical progression, with many steps not building on the 
preceding ones. For instance, baseline assessments and planning were often conducted after the design phase, 
and standardized targets were set before District WASH Plans were prepared. 
The WASH in Schools Infrastructure Design Manual produced by UNICEF did not incorporate lessons learned from 
the project implementation. The standard designs for water-based and dry pit toilets did not address critical issues 
posed in construction, the premature filling of pits, and their maintenance, which are vital for understanding the 
principles that should guide sanitary system design. The standard designs for water-based toilets repeated 
mistakes like the discharging blackwater to septic tanks that cannot be emptied in rural areas, the lack of design 
details of the septic tanks or the soakaways, and failure to address water supply system demand management 
issues. Similarly, the standard designs for dry pit toilets did not address issues like pit collapsing risks, immoveable 
concrete slabs and superstructures.

LEARNINGS 
The key lesson from the KKP is the need to embed a learning culture in the project. This requires engaging 
organizations committed to systems that encourage listening and learning, and people who value the experiences 
of local practitioners and policymakers. The KKP experience shows that each detail of sanitation and hygiene 
facilities should be systematically trialed, refined, gradually improved and lessons documented before developing 
standardized designs. It also shows that the absence of effective demand management for water supply systems 
plays a crucial role in the failure of sanitation and hygiene systems. 
Another lesson from the KKP is that in politically contested environments, it is vital to have a robust understanding 
of the legislative assignments for sanitation and hygiene to avoid falling victim to political patronage incentives. 
Furthermore, the CLTS approach’s emphasis on bottom-up strategies needs careful tailoring to individual settings, 
particularly in areas with low open defecation rates and a culture of shame that hinders community participation. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Project Design 
The evaluation recommends the creation of institutional incentives to prioritize beneficiary demand creation and 
capacity development, above the public provision of infrastructure and information products within these low-
capacity environments.  
Sanitation and Hygiene in Schools and HCFs 
The evaluation makes specific recommendations for emptying of sanitation systems in rural settings, alongside 
review and revision of National Construction Guidelines for Schools and HCFs. It also recommends complementing 
additional water storage for increased water security with strategies to reduce the risks of water wastage. 
Sanitation and Hygiene in Communities 
The evaluation recommends developing an appropriate approach and incentives for the PNG context, building on 
the experiences of applying CLTS in different contexts as part of the KKP in PNG.

1 BACKGROUND 
Papua New Guinea is one of the most diverse countries in the world, home to 10.1 million people (UNDESA, 2022) 
and more than 800 different languages spoken among a population divided into more than 10,000 ethnic clans 
across 600 islands (The World Bank, 2023). PNG’s population is young and growing, with 56% under the age of 25, 
11% under 5 years old (NSO, 2022), and a fertility rate of 4.2% (DNPM, 2020). Between 70-80% of the population 
live in rural areas, many considered remote with poor access to roads and basic services. 
PNG is classified as a lower middle-income country. The human development index (HDI) puts the country in the 
medium human development category, ranking 155th out of 189 countries on the index. The 2019 Gender 
Inequality Index (GII) ranks PNG 161 out of 162 countries (UNDP, 2020). About 39 percent of the population live 
below the poverty line of less than US$1.90 per day (DNPM, 2020). The PNG Vision 2050 aspires for PNG to be a 
to be a “Smart, Wise, Fair, Healthy and Happy Society by 2050” and be in the top 50 countries in the HDI ranking. 
Recognizing the aspirations of the 2050 vision, the Development Strategic Plan (2010-2030) sets objectives around 
strategic planning, systems and institutions, human development, wealth creation, security and international 
relations, and environment and climate change (DNPM, 2010). 
The Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New 
Guinea recognizes the primacy of Provincial and Local Level 
Governments (LLG)1, the necessity of an elected legislature, 
with an executive and an office of the head of the executive2 
as defined in an Organic Law for Provincial and Local Level 
Governments3. The Organic Law on Provincial Governments 
and LLGs assigns law making powers:  
- 
to the LLGs for the provision of water supply, sanitation 
and hygiene, housing and the improvement of villages, 
towns, cities & communities4. 
- 
to the Provincial Legislatures for primary, secondary, 
technical and vocational education (but not curriculum) and for rural health5. 
Although the district does not exercise any law-making powers, decentralization is a critical development agenda 
issue for PNG that continues to evolve. Districts have been established as a constituency for political 
representation on the Provincial Legislature and the National Assembly.  In 2014, the District Development 
Authority (DDA) Act6 was passed, establishing DDAs as an administrative vehicle of the government, and giving 
 
1 187A: There shall be a system of Provincial Governments and Local-level Governments for Papua New Guinea 
2 187C: (2) For each Provincial Government and Local-level Government, there shall be established - (a) a mainly elective (elected directly 
or indirectly), legislature with such powers as are conferred by law; and (b) an executive; and (c) an office of head of the executive 
3 4. An Organic Law shall make provision for and in respect of– (a) grants by the National Government to Provincial Governments and 
Local-level Governments; and (b) subject to Subsection (4A), the imposition, collection and distribution of taxation by Provincial 
Governments and Local-level Governments, and may make other financial provisions for Provincial Governments and Local-level 
Governments, to an extent reasonably adequate for the performance of their functions. 
4 44. Law making powers of the Local-level Governments. (1) Subject to the Constitution, this Organic Law, and a Provincial Government 
law, a Local-level Government may make laws on the following subject matters—(c) self-help and tokples schools, but not curriculum;  
(e) provision of water supply; (g) improvement of villages, towns, cities & communities; (j) town, city, village and community planning;  
(r) housing; (t) human settlements; (x) hygiene and sanitation; (ac) village communities; (ad) local aid posts and clinics; 
5 42. Law-making powers of the Provincial Legislatures. (1) Subject to the Constitution and this Organic Law, a provincial legislature may 
make laws on the following matters— (b) primary, secondary, technical and vocational education, but not curriculum; (j) community, 
urban and rural development; (n) rural health; (q) town and urban planning; 
6 33A. District Development Authorities. (1) A DDA is established in each District. (2) An Act of the Parliament shall make provision for the 
functions and powers of, and other matters relating to, DDAs 

6 
 
districts increased authority to manage themselves (but not law-making powers), including to improve sanitation 
service delivery  and to exercise local accountability and transparency (ADB, 2020). The Act confers powers on the 
DDA - headed by the District Member of Parliament - to build and transfers assets in any sector. However, only a 
few districts have functioned as hoped and have delivered expectations according to the Act. Specifically for 
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), the National WASH Policy (2015-2030) does not accord any primacy to 
the provision of WASH infrastructure via the DDAs or the District WASH Committees. Nevertheless, the Service 
Improvement Programmes continue to channel more resources to districts to streamline service delivery in line 
with the National Service Delivery Framework (DNPM, 2020). 
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene are: 
- 
SDG 6.1: By 2030, to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all 
- 
SDG 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open 
defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations 
These targets are measured with three indicators: 
- 
SDG 6.1.1: Proportion of the population using safely managed drinking water services 
- 
SDG 6.2.1a:  Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services 
- 
SDG 6.2.1b:  Proportion of population with handwashing facilities with soap and water at home 
Rural access to basic sanitation and hygiene services in PNG is the lowest in the Pacific Region and amongst the 
lowest in the World, with 45% without access to handwashing facilities, and 85% without access to basic sanitation 
(WHO/UNICEF, 2020). Figure 1 shows the household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene service levels in PNG 
in 2020, while Figure 2 and Figure 3 show service levels in schools and health care facilities (HCF). Coverage of 
facility types in the four provinces of relevance to this evaluation are provided in Figure 4. Improvements in 
sanitation and hygiene services, particularly in the rural areas where most of the PNG population reside, is not 
only crucial to the health but also the physical and intellectual potential of the population, and ultimately the 
socio-economic development of the nation (Hutton, Haller, Water, & WHO, 2004; Water and Sanitation Program, 
2008).

1.1 The Klinpela Komuniti Projek 
The EU–UNICEF Klinpela Komuniti Projek (KKP) scoping in PNG began in late 2017. The first phase of the project 
involved district selection and preparation of costed five-year WASH plans for project districts. The second 
implementation phase, started in April 2019 in three districts (Goroka in Eastern Highlands; Nawaeb in Morobe; 
and Bougainville Central in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville) and in September 2019 in Hagen Central in 
Western Highlands. The project was funded with a European Union (EU) contribution of EUR 22.3 million and a 
UNICEF contribution of EUR 1 million with the goal to “Contribute to improve the quality of life for women, men 
and children through increased access to and utilization of a safe, adequate and sustainable water supply, 
sanitation and improved hygiene practices in line with the National WASH Policy” (UNICEF, 2018).  
The specific outcome objectives of the project were to: 
1. Enable 
a 
healthier 
and 
safer 
environment, particularly for women 
and children, thereby reducing the 
impact of waterborne and hygiene-
related illnesses. 
2. Improve governance and the quality-of-
service delivery in the WASH sector. 
The KKP targeted children in select schools, 
health centre and rural hospital personnel 
and families in communities surrounding 
selected schools with the introduction of the 
community-led 
total 
sanitation 
(CLTS) 
approach 7 in the four target PNG Districts: 
Hagen Central in Western Highlands; 
Goroka in Eastern Highlands; Nawaeb in Morobe; and Bougainville Central in the Autonomous Region of 
Bougainville.  
The intended beneficiaries of the project are: 
- 
About 40,000 school children in up to 200 schools in the 4 districts. 
- 
About 36,000 patients and about 3,600 pairs of mothers and new-borns per year in up to 36 health centres. 
- 
Approximately 96,000 people in 800 communities (with 480 declared open defecation free) surrounding the 
200 targeted schools. 
- 
General population to have increased knowledge on sanitation and hygiene. 
- 
Key decision makers who are influenced to invest in sanitation. 
The three expected output results of the KKP, along with the main activities that contribute to those results are: 
1. Improved sanitation and handwashing facilities in schools and health centres, with particular focus on the 
neediest districts: 
a. Pre-select, according to well-defined criteria, 200 schools, and construct gender-sensitive and 
disability-friendly sustainable WASH facilities. 
b. Pre-select, according to well-defined criteria, 36 health centres in the four districts, and rehabilitate 
or construct sex-segregated and disability-friendly sustainable WASH facilities in each centre. 
2. Increased awareness among the population on the importance of hygiene and sanitation, and increased 
number of ODF (Open Defecation Free) Communities. 
 
7 CLTS was introduced in PNG and integrated with the Healthy Island concept by Oxfam (2008), Live & Learn (2009) and scaled-up by the 
EU funded RWSSP in 12 Provinces (2012).
