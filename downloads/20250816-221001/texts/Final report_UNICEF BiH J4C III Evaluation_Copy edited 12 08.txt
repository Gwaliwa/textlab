Executive Summary 
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of phase III of UNICEF’s Justice for Every 
Child project (May 2018–November 2021). The evaluation covers the period May 2018 to 
December 2020. With regard to assessing ownership by relevant institutions and 
sustainability, as well as impact, a broader focus was taken into account as all key 
stakeholders, including governmental partners, donors, and UNICEF itself, have invested in 
support to justice for children throughout the three phases of the project, for nearly 10 years.  
Overview of the project 
Phase III of the Justice for Every Child project (2018–2021) is a continuation of UNICEF's 
engagement to improve justice for children in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and builds on 
the results and lessons learned gained through implementation of the first two phases of the 
project (phase I from 2010 to 2013, and phase II from 2014 to 2017). The overall goal of the 
project is that children in justice processes and children at risk are dealt with in compliance 
with international standards on justice for children, and that decisions are taken in their best 
interests. The specific focus of the interventions evolved with different phases of the project 
from the introduction of the relevant legislation and establishment of the juvenile justice 
system in the first phase of the project, to supporting implementation of the laws, promoting 
support to victims and witnesses, and exploring the secondary prevention models in the 
second phase, to focusing on continued support for full implementation of laws, further 
capacity-building, and supporting the development and implementation of secondary 
prevention programmes during the third phase of the project. 
Purpose of the evaluation  
The purpose of the evaluation, while taking into consideration social inclusion, gender, 
or/and human rights were to:  
• 
Provide evidence of the extent to which interventions in the third phase of the project 
contributed to achievement of results, through the lens of relevance, effectiveness, 
efficiency, sustainability and impact, and identify if there were any unintended project 
results; and  
• 
Identify gaps, lessons learned and provide feasible recommendations for exit 
strategies or areas where interventions may still be warranted, for example 
continuous 
capacity-building 
of 
justice 
for 
children 
(J4C) 
professionals, 
implementation and countrywide roll-out of diversion/alternative measures and the 
secondary prevention programmes.  
Expected users and intended use  
The primary intended users of this evaluation are UNICEF and the project staff, the Project 
Coordination Board, and donors. In addition, the results of the evaluation will be shared and 
used for policy dialogue and advocacy – in line with the Project Exit Strategy and Advocacy 
Plan. This means that secondary users will be the relevant entity, cantonal, municipal 
authorities and relevant institutions, as well as wider stakeholders in the area of child 
protection/justice for children including civil society organizations (CSOs).

Evaluation methodology 
The evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR) proposed seven key evaluation questions (EQs), 
focusing on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria of relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and synergies and coherence. Additional questions 
relating to the cross-cutting issues of gender and social inclusion and the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic were also included. The evaluation matrix was developed around the 
evaluation questions and criteria to map out the data sources, methods and analysis 
approach. The evaluation was criteria-based, as this was the final phase of project support. 
The primary evaluation methods included wide-ranging document review and analysis of 
administrative data, key informant interviews (KIIs) with UNICEF and stakeholders, a series 
of focus group discussions (FGDs) with stakeholders, partners and beneficiaries, as well as 
a qualitative online survey. The data collection processes employed by the evaluation team 
reached a total of 136 stakeholders and beneficiaries, through 31 KIIs, 6 thematic FGDs and 
57 responses to the online survey. 
Findings  
Project Relevance  
The project was relevant to the needs of children in accessing justice and was fully aligned 
with UNICEF’s Country Programme 2015–2019 (extended to 2020), as well as the strategic 
priorities of the project’s donors. Further, it is aligned with the overall Reform Agenda of BiH 
and its Justice Sector Strategy, as well as contributing to BiH’s commitments to the 2030 
Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The design of phase III of the 
Justice for Every Child project was evidence-based and informed by extensive research, 
analyses and data; however, there is less evidence that it fully captured the voice of children 
in BiH, although views of children obtained in previous phases of the project were taken into 
account. The project design contributed to its theory of change and no major programmatic 
adjustments were made during the lifespan of the project, beyond adaptations to the COVID-
19 pandemic.  
Project Efficiency  
The project implemented a number of strategies to achieve efficiency gains that, when 
analysed against its results, provided a good value for money coefficient. The project was 
able to maximize partnerships with relevant entity and district levels, as well as cantonal and 
municipal stakeholders. This included relevant entity and cantonal ministries, Centres for 
Social Work (CSW), Centres for the Protection of Mental Health (CMH), courts, prosecutor’s 
offices, academia and civil society. At the state level, the project engaged with the BiH 
Ministry of Justice, the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council and the Institution of Human 
Rights Ombudsman. 
Project Effectiveness  
The project has achieved tangible and quantifiable results, which have strengthened the 
justice and social welfare systems and made them more adaptable and responsible to the 
rights and needs of children participating in justice processes. Results have contributed to 
the empowerment of children through prevention programmes, legal support and information 
to enable them to access justice. Continued efforts are required to fully embed some of the 
project results into the system and to ensure their financial sustainability.  

 
8 
The project generated important, relevant and effective results that contributed to the 
achievement of the project’s overall objective, namely that children in justice processes are 
dealt with in compliance with international standards on justice for children and that 
decisions are taken in their best interests. However, these objectives have not yet been fully 
realized and there is a need for greater budgetary allocation for justice for children, 
leadership by relevant authorities and the potential introduction of stronger accountability 
mechanisms to respond to gaps in implementation of the relevant laws.  
Project Impact  
It is indisputable that the project has had a large impact in improving the position of children 
within the justice system and fundamentally changed the approach to children involved with 
the system. It has brought the issue of children at risk and children in contact with the law to 
the awareness of the relevant authorities; it has strengthened the legislative and policy 
framework for children; it has improved their access to justice; it has created strong 
multisectoral coordination; and it has embedded the “best interests of the child” principle into 
the system.  
Project Sustainability  
Sustainability  
The project results achieved sustainability in terms of promoting greater local ownership and 
a change in attitudes towards children in contact with the law and children at risk. The results 
of the project that have been integrated into the legislative framework or official procedures 
are likely to continue in the long term and there is great scope for harmonizing the 
approaches by promoting learning and exchanges of good practices and scaling them up 
across BiH. Future sustainability will require additional efforts to integrate Justice for 
Children (J4C) into ongoing reform efforts and funding opportunities, including the European 
Union (EU) reform agenda.  
Ownership 
The project activities and results were focused on building the system and this has 
encouraged a strong sense of ownership, which was in part promoted by the Project 
Coordination Board. There is scope to further strengthen the ownership of local, cantonal, 
district and entity processes.  
Scalability  
There is good scope for scaling up the Secondary Prevention Programme based on lessons 
learned and best practices gathered during J4C Phase III. Similarly, there is good scope for 
scaling up the good practices from one region to another to promote the use of diversion and 
alternative measures,1 as well as of expert associates.  
 
1 For the purposes of this report the diversion and alternative measures cover the continuum of measures aimed 
at diverting children in conflict with the law away from formal judicial proceedings towards an alternative way of 
resolving the offence, including by involving non-judicial bodies, up to promoting alternatives to detention in cases 
where the formal judicial proceeding has taken place. Diversion and alternative measures are defined and 
foreseen by the Laws on Protection and Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings.

Coherence  
UNICEF has made positive steps in terms of leveraging contributions and catalyzing joint 
work with the EU, and the two organizations are key allies with regards to policy dialogue 
and advocacy efforts.  
While there may have been a lack of opportunities to maximize resource potential and 
strengthen complementarities with other UN agencies, UNICEF should continue to seek out 
such opportunities where possible. 
Cross-cutting Issues  
The project successfully adopted a human rights-based approach (HRBA) in both its design 
and in its implementation, working on both the supply and demand sides of development 
programming. However, while the project does include some gender disaggregated data, 
gender and social inclusion were not its primary focus.  
UNICEF was able to respond swiftly to the COVID-19 context through amending certain 
project activities and adjusting its implementation approach. All partners were satisfied with 
the speed and manner with which UNICEF reacted to adapt the programmes to the 
pandemic and address the newly emerging priority. However, while recognizing the 
challenges of moving to online delivery of training and other project activities during COVID-
19, further opportunities could have been explored to promote the greater use of online 
delivery of training and other project activities, such as through social media and other 
modern technologies.  
Conclusions 
The evaluation findings show that UNICEF has successfully implemented three phases of 
the Justice for Children project in BiH over a ten-year period, achieving meaningful and 
quantifiable results. UNICEF has built and maintained close working relationships with its 
key stakeholders, which has the effect of building trust through continually demonstrating 
that UNICEF is a reliable and active partner. While it has positioned itself as an integrator, 
coordination without UNICEF remains a key challenge and the overall fragmentation of the 
operating environment represents a sizeable constraint.  
Relevance  
UNICEF positioned itself as the lead actor addressing issues pertaining to access to justice 
for children in BiH. The J4EC project was relevant not only to UNICEF’s own strategic 
priorities but, more importantly, to those of BiH and its entities and districts, and those of its 
donors and development partners. The project design was evidence-based and informed by 
extensive stakeholder consultations, although additional capturing of the voices of children 
could have further strengthened the design and implementation.  
Efficiency  
The J4C project provided good value for money, with results being achieved beyond the sum 
of the component parts. Cost efficiencies were achieved through a lean staffing structure 
and utilizing to the greatest extent local or in-house expertise. Strong partnerships were 
created with relevant stakeholders and the use of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and civil society organizations (CSOs) to support project implementation was not only cost-
effective but also had the knock-on effect of strengthening the relationship between 
governmental institutions and civil society. Good examples are the referral mechanism 

 
10 
utilized in Republika Srpska as part of the school-based secondary prevention programme or 
the implementation of community-based diversionary measures. The project had a 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework that was very much tied to the programmatic 
M&E structures and the indicators used were purely quantitative and therefore not sufficient 
to fully capture the project’s progress and results. A greater use of qualitative indicators that 
measure perceptions and behaviour at the outcome level would better capture project 
progress and results, as well as contributions towards outcomes and impact.  
Effectiveness  
The project has achieved tangible and measurable results contributing towards ensuring that 
children in justice processes are dealt with in compliance with international standards on 
justice for children, and that decisions are taken in their best interests. However, the project 
was hampered to some extent by the complexities of the context within which it was 
operational and fragmentation of the system across state, entity, district and cantonal lines. 
This meant that UNICEF had to localize and tailor each of its interventions at the local level 
which, while leading to measurable results, has meant that children throughout BiH do not 
have access to the same level of support services. It is the evaluation team’s assessment 
that without this level of localization and contextualized initiatives, progress and results 
would have been less satisfactory. The lack of a fully harmonized approach and overall 
fragmentation affects equal access to justice, as a result of which some of the interventions 
and results were uneven.  
Impact  
The project has had a broad ranging impact in improving the position of children within the 
justice system in BiH. Through integration of the best interests of the child principle, the 
project has contributed towards completely changing the approach towards children in the 
justice system. The principle is has been integrated into the normative framework through 
legislative and policy reforms, as well as into service provision from a wide range of 
stakeholders including courts and prosecutors’ offices, Centres for Social Welfare, Centres 
for Mental Health, schools, free legal aid providers and NGOs/CSOs. While some activities 
and results would have been achieved without UNICEF’s support, it is certain that results 
would not have been achieved to such an extent, nor as quickly.  
 
 
Sustainability  
The project has had key successes with regard to ensuring sustainability of results after the 
end of the project. In particular, those aspects which have been included in the legislative 
and policy framework, official procedures of schools’ programmes, and will be budgeted for, 
are likely to continue.   
The biggest constraints to sustainability are the availability of funding and the absence of 
sufficient political backstopping at the highest levels, to ensure that children’s access to 
justice remains a key priority in the future. There are concerns among stakeholders that 
once the project comes to an end, there will be a lack of supervision and quality control over 
the process, as well as a lack of accountability, which may lead to previous results 
regressing.   

 
11 
UNICEF was recognized as the lead coordinator in terms of access to justice for children in 
BiH and among all the stakeholders had a niche role as integrator. While one of the biggest 
impacts the project has had is in terms of developing multi-stakeholder coordination among 
all relevant actors, this will remain a critical challenge going forward, particularly in the 
foreseeable vacuum at the project’s end. This might be addressed by exploring opportunities 
for the continued functioning and transformation of the Project Implementation Board into a 
J4C, or broader, coordination body. This could provide an effective avenue for advocacy and 
coordination and provide the drive for greater sustainability of results.  
There is a strong sense of ownership among stakeholders with regard to the project’s 
interventions, but UNICEF also played an important role in the overall reform of justice for 
children in BiH and was often perceived as primary owner of the process. In this sense, 
there is still scope for strengthening ownership.  
Coherence  
The key stakeholder in BiH in terms of development remains the European Union. UNICEF 
established a strong working partnership with the EU, including a coordinated engagement 
strategy and synergies across specific interventions. However, UNICEF could have 
leveraged even more in terms of its partnership with the EU to move forward on certain 
interventions and to coordinate further on policy dialogue and advocacy issues, such as 
inclusion of J4C activities in the EU assistance available through the Instrument for Pre-
accession (IPA). Justice for children and access to justice, for example, could be ensured as 
a rule of law priority by becoming an integral component of BiH's reform agenda for EU 
accession. 
During the third phase of the project implementation, there was limited scope for 
strengthening collaboration with other UN Agencies, including UNDP. Opportunities for 
collaboration should continuously be explored in the future to promote joint objectives and 
coherence more efficiently.  
Cross-cutting issues  
Human rights-based approach (HRBA) and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) 
By adopting a human rights-based approach in the project’s design and implementation, it 
was possible to address issues on both sides of the development equation. This provided an 
opportunity to strengthen the normative framework and capacities of relevant institutions to 
implement the Law and provide quality services, to better informed and aware children. A 
stronger gender and social inclusion analysis and overall focus would have allowed a 
stronger response to GESI issues, and additional efforts in capturing the voice of children 
could have improved results.  
COVID-19 response  
UNICEF’s swift response and timely and appropriate adaptation of project activities provided 
for its successful transition at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. By keeping children 
in the centre of BiH’s response to COVID-19, it was possible to adjust the project and 
continue with implementation of its activities. Despite this, COVID-19 has affected some 
project activities and caused certain delays. Additional technical support to project partners 
and recipients could potentially have allowed the transition of a greater number of capacity-
building programmes and awareness-raising activities to an online format, including by
