Executive Summary
Introduction to the UNICEF Nepal 
Country Programme (CP)
The goal of the country programme is “children 
benefit from improved and equitable access to 
and the use of high-quality child-friendly services, 
improved care practices, protective and safe 
environments and better policies and resource 
allocation for children”. The CP has six thematic 
outcomes with 22 outputs that target specific 
change in the lives of children, plus an outcome 
on programme effectiveness. Following the mid-
term review (MTR) of the CP, an output on local 
governance was added to support improved 
planning and implementation for children at 
local levels. The CP focuses on all three levels of 
government with overall targeting of the most 
disadvantaged children, particularly focusing on 
the central Terai and far western areas of Madhesh 
and Sudurpaschim Provinces. 
The Country Programme is reflected as the 
Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP), a signed 
document between UNICEF Nepal Country Office 
(NCO) and the Government of Nepal (GoN). The 
sub-national activities are implemented through 
three field offices, Nepalgunj, Bharatpur and 
Siddharthanagar. CPAP was amended in 2020 
following the MTR.
The Country Programme has been designed with 
a budget of about USD 150 million made up of 
USD 36 million from Regular Resources (RR) and 
USD 114 million from Other Resources (OR).
Purpose, objectives of the Country 
Programme Review (CPR)
The scope of this “light touch review” is limited to 
four domains (relevance, effectiveness, adaptation 
to changing context, and UNICEF’s strategic 
positioning in Nepal). Only two OECD-DAC criteria 
of relevance and effectiveness have been covered 
as guided by the TOR and utility for the next 
country programme. The CPR, covering the period 
2018-2021, is expected to inform programme 
design and support managerial decision-taking 
for the next country programme, and assess 
the performance of results. The Review focused 
on  five thematic areas, namely, health, nutrition, 
education, social policy, and emergency/DRR. The 
main participants of the review were stakeholders 
(duty-bearers), who were mapped and identified 
in consultation with UNICEF ROSA/NCO. 
Methodology
The review adopted a participatory and interactive 
approach based on an evaluation design matrix. A 
perception survey was undertaken using a group of 
stakeholders, which provided quantitative data on 
relevance and effectiveness, including stakeholder 
satisfaction of interventions. 94 stakeholders 
(out of 126 invited to participate) responded to 
the survey. Desk research was conducted using 
reports and other published and unpublished 
materials. Qualitative data were collected from 
interviews with 69 key informants comprised 
of 35 external stakeholders and 34 UNICEF 
staff members, using structured KII Guides. 
Save for five, all KIIs were conducted online. 
Aspects of equity, gender equality, and ethical 
norms and principles were followed during the 
whole evaluation process. This evaluation followed 
the minimum standards laid down by UNICEF and 
UNEG. The qualitative information collected was 
analysed and triangulated to derive trends and 
conclusions. The data gathered in the Perception 
Survey were analysed using the statistical 
software SPSS.

The Country Context
Nepal is land-locked and has a population of 29.5 
million with half the population in the Terai region. 
It is a highly diverse country, with 125 caste/ethnic 
groups speaking 123 languages and representing 
over 10 religions. Children under 18 is estimated 
at about 40 per cent.
The new constitution, promulgated in September, 
2015, encompasses federal democratic republic 
governance restructuring the country to seven 
provinces and 753 Palikas (metropolitan cities 
and rural/urban municipalities), with substantial 
devolution of power to the sub-national agencies. 
Nepal was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 
7.8 Richter Scale in April 2015; this and a series 
of afterquakes caused the death of about 9,000 
people, and one-third of them were children. 
The Fifteenth Plan (2020-2024) of the Government 
of Nepal aims to upgrade Nepal to a middle-
income developing country by 2026.  Over the 
past decades Nepal has made rapid progress on 
many fronts related to children’s wellbeing. Under 
five mortality has steadily declined. Immunization 
rates of infants are at 84 per cent. Maternal 
mortality has also reduced. Stunting affects 31.5 
per cent of children under five in Nepal; wasting 
at 12 per cent has not declined. Access to primary 
education is at 47 per cent (attendance rate). The 
completion rate for primary school is 82 per cent. 
About 40 per cent of children attending school are 
taught in a language other than the language they 
speak at home. Birth registration has increased to 
77 per cent of children under five. About 22 per 
cent are engaged in child labour. About 33 per 
cent of women aged 20-24 were married before 
they were 18 years old. Access to improved water 
sources has improved significantly but the quality 
remains an issue. Open defecation has declined. 
 Nepal experienced several waves of the COVID-19 
pandemic since beginning of 2020; it was worst 
hit with the second wave as daily cases reached 
up to about 9,000. The COVID-19 pandemic had a 
direct impact on the livelihoods of millions in the 
country and negated some of the gains. Children 
living in poverty rose from an estimated 1.3 million 
before the pandemic to about 6 million in August 
2020. Schools were closed for long periods. 
Findings of the Country Programme 
Review
Relevance
The 2018-2022 Country Programme (CP) is 
aligned to the Fourteenth National Plan (2016-
2019) of the Government. The CP is directly linked 
to three of the UNDAF’s four outcomes and is 
in line with UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018-2022), 
UN Convention on rights of the child (CRC) and 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)
Overall, the theories of change (ToC) are relevant 
and address the needs identified in SitAn 2017 and 
the country plans and strategies. In Nutrition, the 
outputs respond well to the situation in Nepal and 
have fairly clear and measurable indicators. There 
is about 10 to 15 per cent “unreached” children 
who continue to show wasting. In Education, 
the outcome is well reflected with detailed 
indicators, which are however not reflected in 
toto in the Results Framework. Although the 
ToC identifies “the most disadvantaged”, the 
inclusivity is not explicitly reflected in the CPAP. 
The WASH outcomes are well reflected.  Whilst 
the interventions are positively linked to bring 
about the desired changes, there are provincial 
differences (e.g., open defecation) which are not 
reflected in the Results Framework. In Social 
Policy, the outcome is reflected in the CPAP with 
well-defined indicators; however, the outputs are 
less clearly linked to the indicators.
The planning framework in Results Assessment 
Module (RAM) is strong: most indicators are 
well defined with baselines and annual targets. 
Exceptions include several instances of targets 
being identical to or lower than the baselines. The 
ToC uses national data which are not available for 
measuring targets. The initiatives of UNICEF NCO 
directly address Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) 1, 3 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 16 in Nepal.
In the planning process, selection of Palikas is 
somewhat unclear to the stakeholders and some 
sub-national agencies did not concur with UNICEF 
selections. Consultations at the Provincial level 
have been less frequent. Palika-level work plans
