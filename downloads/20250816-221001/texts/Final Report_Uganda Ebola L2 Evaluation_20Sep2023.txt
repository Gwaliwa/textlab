EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report describes the results of the Learning-Focused Evaluation (LFE) of UNICEF’s Level 2 (L2) 
Ebola Preparedness and Response in Uganda (hereafter referred to as the ‘Ebola response’). The LFE 
was led and implemented by the external evaluation firm hera (right to health and development). As 
per the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Evaluation Policy, it was managed by UNICEF’s 
Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO), in close collaboration with the UNICEF Uganda 
Country Office (UCO) and in line with the UNICEF terms of reference (see Annex 1). The evaluation 
was conducted from February to August 2023.  
 
Background and context  
Ebola is a severe, often fatal, illness in humans and non-human primates that is caused by a highly 
virulent virus. The Government of Uganda (GoU) declared an Ebola outbreak on 22 September 2022 
(Sudan virus) and called for assistance from the country’s partners to strengthen its preparedness and 
response capacity. Four months after the first case, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 
outbreak over (on 11 January 2023). In total, the outbreak caused 164 cases, 142 of which were 
confirmed and 22 of which were probable; there were 55 confirmed deaths. This was the eighth Ebola 
outbreak declared in Uganda, marking the country's fourth outbreak within a decade and its fifth 
outbreak of the Sudan virus strain of Ebola. 
 
Object of the evaluation 
UNICEF activated an L2 Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP) Scale-up from 27 October 
2022 to 26 April 2023 to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda. The response was led by UNICEF’s 
UCO, with support from ESARO and Headquarters (HQ). The primary goal of the L2 activation and the 
implementation of the L2 emergency procedures was to scale up UNICEF’s response by providing 
access to Emergency Programme Funds (EPF), deploying additional personnel from the regional office 
and HQ, assisting to establish partnership initiatives, addressing supply chain requirements, continuing 
advocacy efforts, and mobilising resources. The UNICEF Ebola Response Appeal budget totalled 
US$18.3 million. 
 
UNICEF’s Ebola response focused on supporting seven specific Ebola response pillars aligned to 
GoU’s Ebola response: Coordination, Leadership, and Partnership; Risk Communication and 
Community Engagement (RCCE); Surveillance and Contact Tracing; Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene 
(WASH); Case Management; Addressing the Indirect Impact of the Outbreak; and Logistics and 
Operational Support. UNICEF added mainstreaming gender-based violence (GBV) and protection from 
sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) as priorities. 
 
Evaluation purpose, objectives, scope, and users 
The LFE serves the dual purpose of promoting learning and accountability. The evaluation objectives 
were, first, to assess UNICEF’s response to the Ebola outbreak in Uganda vis-à-vis issues of 
appropriateness/relevance, effectiveness, efficiency (including value for money (VfM)), coverage, 
connectedness, coordination, and partnerships; and, second, to draw out key learning and 
recommendations to equip UCO decision makers with the information they need to formulate UCO’s 
transition from L2 emergency to long-term strategy, ensuring humanitarian–development–peace (HDP) 
nexus is in place and increasing preparedness for future public health emergencies (PHEs). The 
intended beneficiaries include UNICEF staff, national and subnational ministries, donors, communities, 
civil society organisations (CSOs), and other United Nations agencies. The evaluation scope 
encapsulated the L2 UNICEF Ebola preparedness and response between 20 September 2022 and 26 

2 
April 2023 across the Ebola affected districts. It assessed certain institutional, programmatic, and 
operational elements of the Ebola preparedness and response. 
 
Evaluation design, methodology, sampling, limitations, and ethics 
The evaluation was both summative and formative, and its design was realist-based and use-focused, 
and allowed for robust analysis. It employed both quantitative and qualitative methods and tools. The 
primary data collection included 101 key informant interviews (KIIs), 27 focus group discussions 
(FDGs), a Community Rapid Assessment (CRA) (sample size: 524), and validation and co-creation 
workshops. The CRA survey was a randomised population-based survey conducted by hera in 
partnership with Viamo. A robot call sent a series of questions via mobile phone and gathered 
information on respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to Ebola. Additionally, the team 
reviewed a variety of internal and external documents (369) as part of a secondary data analysis. Data 
sources were triangulated where possible to ensure robust evidence. The evaluation encountered a 
few limitations, and several mitigation measures were applied. The evaluation obtained ethical 
clearance from Lacor Hospital Institutional Research and Ethics Committee and adhered to the ethical 
principles of informed consent, voluntary participation, confidentiality, data protection, and ‘do no harm.’  
 
Conclusions 
The conclusions set out below are based on the LFE’s findings and have been colour ranked. Red 
indicates that there were significant issues, delays, or problems with the intervention. Amber (Yellow) 
signifies there were some concerns or risks that need attention. Green indicates that progress was as 
planned and there were no major concerns or risks. 
 
Conclusion 1: UCO’s in-country preparedness was not sufficiently relevant to an Ebola outbreak 
and it did not allow for an efficient transition to the Ebola response. UNICEF’s 2021 Ebola 
Preparedness and Response Plan was incomplete, and insufficient funding dedicated to preparedness 
activities hindered the establishment of relevant partnerships, contingency plans, contingency budgets, 
and the procurement of essential Ebola supplies. The transition from preparedness to response was 
therefore challenging, and this was further hampered by UCO’s lack of familiarity with the L2 emergency 
procedures and the small number of UCO staff with Ebola expertise. As the Ebola response 
progressed, UNICEF demonstrated relevant adaptiveness, improving its preparedness measures. It 
effectively mitigated some of these shortcomings by repurposing programme funds and resources, 
deploying ESARO and UCO programme staff. In parallel, efforts by ESARO to invest in regional 
preparedness across neighbouring countries demonstrated the importance of potential cross-border 
spread of Ebola. However, the limited funding available raised questions about the extent to which 
donors are committed to funding prevention efforts. 
 
Conclusion 2: UNICEF’s leadership and coordination were mostly effective in ensuring the 
response was coherent. UNICEF demonstrated commendable leadership and engagement in 
coordinating response activities at both national and subnational levels. UNICEF’s active engagement 
and its leadership role in co-chairing the RCCE pillars, as well as the sub-pillars of WASH and Infection 
Prevention and Control (IPC), Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and Continuity of 
Essential Services (CoES), confirmed UNICEF’s comparative advantage in these pillars By fostering 
collaboration among various local responders, such as the District Task Forces (DTFs) and District 
Disaster Management Committees (DDMCs), UNICEF effectively aligned preparedness and response 
efforts with national strategic plans. Moreover, UNICEF enhanced the relevance of the response by 
expanding its reach and collaboration, including working with the Ministry of Gender, Labour, and Social 
Development (MoGLSD) and the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) to promote a more multi-
sectoral response. In parallel, there were notable coordination challenges, albeit mostly at onset. Such 

3 
challenges included the multiple response plans, competing roles and overlap in mandates among 
United Nations agencies, the absence of a clear inter-agency coordination mechanism, and also the 
government’s unusual split of risk communication (RC) from community engagement (CE). These 
issues resulted in gaps or delays in critical areas, such as safe and dignified burials (SDB), IPC, CE, 
and Ebola case management, and raised questions about such arrangements for larger and more 
extensive PHEs. At the same time, internal UNICEF coordination and support mechanisms involving 
UCO, ESARO, and HQ were highly regarded.  
 
Conclusion 3: UNICEF’s efforts had a significant and positive impact on affected populations.  
The evaluation revealed many commendable efforts with high levels of appropriateness and 
effectiveness in addressing key issues, contributing to early case detection and reducing transmission. 
UNICEF’s RCCE activities led to behavioural change within communities through diverse mass media 
channels which communicated tailored and appropriate key messages. The strategic engagement of 
local responders and community influencers, and the implementation of Integrated Outbreak Analytics 
(IOA) and anthropological studies, leveraged transdisciplinary data, helping to improve outbreak 
decision-making. The integration of WASH/IPC across pillars, Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs), isolation 
centres, community structures, and communities filled critical response gaps and showcased effective 
strategies for future outbreaks, including the IPC Ring approach. The evaluation also identified that 
UNICEF successfully facilitated access to essential nutritional supplies in ETUs, and that the response 
exceeded its target for reaching children and affected populations accessing MHPSS. The integration 
of MHPSS and child protection in the Ebola response through innovative partnerships received praise, 
but these interventions also exposed the dire needs experienced by children and women. UNICEF's 
efforts on education were a best practice and ensured every child attended school and completed their 
final exams. Health continuity interventions ensured primary healthcare was maintained but the 
lockdown measure, a lack of transport, and fear of Ebola transmission reduced healthcare utilisation.  
 
Conclusion 4: The L2 procedures were not sufficiently applied. The effectiveness of the response 
faced several challenges, including significant delays. The L2 response successfully mobilised a 
substantial US$7,949,919, strategically allocating funds toward RCCE, case management, and 
WASH/IPC, showcasing efficient resource utilisation and leveraging UNICEF's comparative advantage. 
With support from ESARO, UNICEF demonstrated proactive measures by repurposing programme 
funds, redeploying UCO staff, and initiating the response even before the L2 was activated. However, 
the evaluation also identified areas for potential improvement, including the timing of the L2 activation, 
which occurred 36 days after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak. Hesitancy about declaring an L2, 
compounded by unfamiliarity with the L2 protocols, contributed to delays. Challenges in regard to 
securing funding, gaps in human resources at the field level, a lack of contingency plans, procedural 
delays in partnerships, and limited supplies adversely affected efficiency, leading to diminished 
relevance in some cases. 
 
Conclusion 5: UNICEF’s approaches were child-centred and integrated women’s needs and 
other vulnerabilities. UNICEF successfully integrated education, child protection, GBV/PSEA, and 
MHPSS into the national response, demonstrating the organisation’s commitment to addressing 
multifaceted vulnerabilities. The active inclusion of children in decision-making processes 
demonstrated a commitment to promoting children’s voices, while partnerships with child-focused 
organisations increased the child-friendliness of the response. UNICEF provided gender-disaggregated 
targets and results, employed gender-sensitive approaches, and prioritised GBV/PSEA. UNICEF also 
implemented interventions for persons with disabilities, but only in certain aspects of the response. 
While MHPSS services benefitted 16,359 children, the response did not address the long-term needs 
of orphans and survivors. Important missed opportunities included a lack of advocacy for better
