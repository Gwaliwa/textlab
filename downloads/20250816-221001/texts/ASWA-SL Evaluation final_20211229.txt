1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1.1 Introduction 
This report presents the results of the formative and summative evaluation of the Accelerating 
Sanitation and Water for All programme in Sierra Leone (ASWA-SL). The evaluation was carried out by 
PEM consult in 2020. The evaluation reviewed programme implementation and results from January 
2013 to December 2019, after program closure. ASWA-SL was funded by the Directorate-General for 
International Cooperation (DGIS) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands and was 
implemented by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Sierra Leone, the Government of Sierra 
Leone (GoSL) and partners. ASWA-SL was implemented in three target districts, Bonthe, Koinadugu 
and Falaba, covering 15 chiefdoms. The program was funded with contributions from UNICEF Sierra 
Leone, GoSL and the recipient communities of the programme with a total budget of USD 10.8 million. 
The programme was temporarily suspended in 2015 during the Ebola outbreak, and funds during the 
outbreak were re-programmed for Ebola response, with a separate Ebola response grant from DGIS.  
1.2 The ASWA-SL Programme 
DGIS and UNICEF initiated the Accelerated Sanitation and Water for All in West and Central Africa 
(ASWA-WCA) in December 2012. ASWA-WCA was a multi-country WASH programme implemented in 
nine West African countries, including Sierra Leone, which were off-track vis-à-vis achieving their 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7c targets. 
In Sierra Leone, ASWA-SL emanated from GoSL’s participation in the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) 
global partnership, as a means to increasing political prioritization, promoting evidence-based decision 
making, and increasing allocation of resources in the water and sanitation sectors. The programme 
supported the development and implementation of national plans of action, which resulted from the 
SWA initiative. The SWA process helped to drive these advances forward and contributed to the 
specific government commitment to prioritise the delivery of sanitation and water for the country’s 
development agenda. This is specifically articulated in the Agenda for Prosperity (PRSP III - 2012) and 
the National Water and Sanitation Policy (NWSP 2010). 
The goal of the ASWA-SL programme is to achieve improved child health, survival rates and well-being 
and contribute to a reduction of diarrhoea incidence among children under the age of five by 
accelerating the achievement of MDG 7c through four major areas of focus: i) Accelerating sanitation 
and water coverage to meet MDG targets, ii) Strengthening national sector development, iii) 
Institutional strengthening and capacity building to enhance WASH sector service delivery, and iv) 
Ensuring the sustainability of systems and behaviours. 
1.3 Purpose and objectives of the evaluation  
This evaluation has two purposes related to accountability and organizational learning: First, in terms 
of accountability, to allow for reporting on the results achieved by the ASWA-SL programme vis-à-vis 
the donor (DGIS) but also accountability towards the populations targeted by the programme. Second, 
in terms of organizational learning, to document good practices and lessons learned from the 
implementation of the programmes to inform decision-making on scaling up the different approaches 
adopted during implementation and to formulate new strategies. According to the evaluation terms 
of reference (ToR), the specific uses of the evaluation are to: 
− 
Document best practices and lessons learned to inform future programming. 
− 
To support national authorities by using lessons. 
− 
Adjust district lead monitoring approaches to enhance quality programme delivery and 
development of district lead sustainability plans. 

2 
 
− 
Influence and inform future allocation of resources in the area of WASH. 
− 
Support partner Non-Governmental Organisations and Civil society organization to strengthen 
capacity where it is lacking. 
The evaluation also assesses the extent of coverage of the programme interventions in relation to 
WASH programme related needs in both terms of geographic coverage, numbers of children and 
women supported against actual numbers of women and children in need. The evaluation assesses 
the quality of the services provided in relation to relevant national and international standards and 
looks at the effectiveness of programme partnerships and coordination, particularly between UNICEF 
and implementing partners at national, district and local levels.  
1.4 Scope of the evaluation  
The evaluation focusses entirely on system-wide performance in the thematic area of WASH, and the 
sustained contribution to development results under this theme in the defined time period through 
ASWA-SL. Geographically, the evaluation focuses on the integrated WASH package delivered by 
UNICEF and implementation partners in the targeted communities of the following three districts: 
Bonthe, Koinadugu, and Falaba. The evaluation covers all the Programme’s  interventions 
implemented between 2012 and 2019.

1.5 Evaluation criteria and evaluation questions  
In order to fulfil its purposes and objectives, the evaluation assessed the programme against the 5 
OECD criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impact; with the additional 
criterion of gender, equity, and human rights. The evaluation covered 27 evaluation questions, see 
Chapter 7 for an overview and Error! Reference source not found. for detailed information.

1.6 Methodology 
The evaluation was a summative evaluation assessing whether ASWA-SL achieved its intended goals, 
objectives, outcomes, and impact. The evaluation was also formative by drawing out lessons learned 
for future programming of WASH implementation. The evaluation was based on mixed-method 
approach for data collection and analysis with a strong utilization focus. Qualitative and quantitative 
data was collected from end beneficiaries, key stakeholders, and implementing partners. The data 
collection included qualitative data from key informant interviews with sector stakeholders and focus 
group discussions with community level stakeholders, and quantitative data from observations of 
WASH facilities and an end-line survey. 
1.7. Findings and conclusions (by criterion) 
The findings are presented in Chapter 9 in relation to each one of the evaluation questions. The 
conclusions in correspondence of the different evaluation criteria are detailed in Chapter 11. 
Relevance 
ASWA-SL is an exemplar of integrated rural WASH programming that fitted clearly within Sierra Leone’s 
national policy framework and goals, as well as within UNICEF’s global approach to WASH. While 
ASWA-SL reached specific groups including women, girls and boys, and people living with disabilities, 
more attention could have been paid to the specific strategies required to reach vulnerable groups. 
The intervention strategy’s link to outcomes and impact was weak and programme assumptions were 
not clearly identified. In some cases, there was not sufficient clarity on the indicator definitions for 
measuring achievements and different wordings were used in programme document and progress 
reports. 
Effectiveness 
ASWA-SL achieved good results in a challenging environment. Broadly, the targets were reported to 
be reached or even exceeded; however, limited clarity on the indicator definitions and findings from 
the field indicate that the achievements could be less than reported. ASWA-SL was successful in raising 
awareness on hygiene and reducing open defecation in the communities, as well as improving WASH 
facilities and hygiene in schools. However, the evaluation findings indicate that the quality of the water 
facilities was uneven, with some facilities not functioning or being seasonal. The extent to which 
ASWA-SL contributed to creating enabling environment for the WASH sector in Sierra Leone is not 
easily measurable. ASWA-SL made a tangible contribution to improving monitoring and district level 
coordination of the rural WASH sector in Sierra Leone. 
Efficiency 
Overall, ASWA-SL was implemented efficiently with the reported unit costs in line with WASH costs 
normally found in Sierra Leone; although this cannot be firmly established by the evaluation team due 
to the limited information available and the inconsistencies in the interpretation of indicators for 
calculating beneficiaries’ access to WASH services as a result of the ASWA-SL interventions. The 
resources available for the ASWA-SL implementation were generally adequate, although some 
interventions were not optimally costed, which led to implementation challenges such as delays in 
completing facilities. The quality of the facilities construction was generally fair to good, but there were 
some areas of weakness related to siting of hand-dug wells and design of piped systems. Implementers 
broadly expressed satisfaction with the support provided by the UNICEF staff to facilitate 
implementation. However, in some cases UNICEF procurement procedures and disbursement 
requirements caused some implementation delays.  
Sustainability 
Overall, ASWA-SL had some success in terms of achieving sustainability, as communities are generally 
willing to pay for WASH services and pay either on a monthly basis or when there is a need for repairs. 

4 
 
There is evidence that hand pumps are maintained in some communities, although difficulties in 
accessing skilled mechanics and spare-parts exists. The ability to pay at the community and school level 
for O&M remains insufficient, as well as the ability to pay for replicating toilets. The sustainability at 
the community level in terms of behavioural change and maintaining ‘Open Defecation Free’ (ODF) 
status continues to be a challenge in some communities. The approaches around the sustainability 
framework were commendable and appropriate, but there is only limited support from district 
authorities to the communities to continue WASH activities and limited resources for the Districts to 
carry out the WASH monitoring and support activities. 
Gender, Equity and Human Rights 
ASWA-SL was successful in ensuring equal participation and representation of women and men in 
WASH decision-making and management. However, ASWA-SL was not equally successful in ensuring 
participation of vulnerable groups, such as persons living with disabilities, poorer households, and 
children. Positive responses were made on the achievements on safety for women and children to 
access the WASH facilities. The integration of education and child protection strategies with WASH 
programming was informal at the strategic level, but local implementing partners used their own 
expertise to contribute to child protection strategies, including awareness raising on sexual 
exploitation. The sanitation facilities implemented in schools were appropriate and according to the 
national standards with separate toilets for boys and girls and appropriate facilities for disabled access 
and menstrual hygiene.  Positive results were achieved in terms of reducing the work-load for 
collection of water, women’s control of finances through the ‘Village Saving and Loan Associations 
(VSLAs), female representation and participation in decision-making, as well as the perception of the 
roles of girls and boys. ASWA-SL succeeded in reducing community-level equity gaps in terms of 
women’s and other vulnerable groups’ access to WASH services. However, equity gaps in terms of 
rural/ urban access at national level are generally widening. UNICEF and ASWA-SL were found to have 
had a positive impact on the inclusion of gender equity, child protection and the participation of 
vulnerable groups in the national sector guidelines and policy documents. 
Impact 
Although it is not possible clearly to attribute improvements or changes in health conditions to ASWA-
SL, the stakeholders generally agree that health conditions and living standards were affected 
positively by ASWA-SL. The stakeholders also find that school absenteeism has reduced due to better 
access to WASH facilities. ASWA-SL was found to have contributed to improving national WASH 
governance vis-à-vis WASH M&E and the National Strategy on Sanitation and Hygiene, and  sanitation 
and coordination at district level. However, ASWA-SL was not able to influence funding allocations 
significantly as the GoSL funding for WASH from internal sources remains low.  
ASWA strengths and weaknesses 
Strengths: ASWA-SL made a significant direct contribution to improving the access to WASH services 
in the districts covered, and indirectly broadly in rural Sierra Leone through its contribution to 
improving national capacities, supporting the achievement of GoSL’s objectives and SDG targets of 
improving WASH coverage and reducing the equity gap. Despite the challenging environment with 
poor accessibility and disruption by an Ebola outbreak, ASWA-SL appears to have been able to reach 
or even exceed its targets, although there is uncertainty about the number of people actually reached. 
Several of the communities covered reached ODF status. The WASH infrastructure installed was mostly
