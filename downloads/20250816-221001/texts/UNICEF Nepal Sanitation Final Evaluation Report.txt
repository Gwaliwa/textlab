Executive Summary  
Access to water and sanitation is recognized by the United Nations as a human right; 
fundamental to everyone’s health, dignity, and prosperity. In accordance with the key 
priorities of Country Program Action Plan (CPAP), the main purpose of UNICEF 
Nepal’s sanitation programme for 2018-2022 was to ensure people access to basic 
sanitation facilities for 500,000 people. 70 percent of the target population hailed from 
Madhesh Province and the rest of the target population resided in Province 1, Bagmati, 
and other provinces. During the period 2018-2020, UNICEF and the Government of 
Nepal reached 547,643 households that were provided access to basic sanitation 
services. The number of people reached were more than 500,000 as planned in 
UNICEF’s country programme for 2019-2022. The total fund utilized for achieving 
access to basic sanitation facilities was US$ 2,210,000, including technical assistance 
of about US$ 1,000,000. In supporting the government’s efforts to end open defecation 
UNICEF’s major activities included coordination and collaboration with the WASH 
stakeholders working in the districts for joint planning, facilitation, triggering, social 
mobilization, monitoring and review of the sanitation status at district and palika levels. 
The main purpose of the evaluation was to utilize the crafted lessons and 
recommendations for more effective future plans and interventions for sustainable 
ODF Nepal. Specific objectives of the evaluation were: 
 
 
• To evaluate the performance of the sanitation programme in their relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability.  
• To assess and compile good practices and lessons learned and to draw a 
comprehensive situation overview.  
• To provide practical and feasible recommendations with strategic direction towards 
sustainable outcomes. 
 
The evaluation was undertaken between April - May 2022 by CLTS Foundation Global, 
based in Kolkata India and Citizen Development Solution (CDS) based in Kathmandu 
Nepal.  
 
Through the application of a valid sampling approach and covering a representative 
sample, the evaluation accessed multiple and diversified data sources. The evaluation 
team was composed of a gender-balanced, multi-disciplinary team of international and 
national experts of core consultants and twenty-six (26) survey enumerators who were 
engaged in the data gathering process. For the collection and gathering of data and 
information both secondary and primary sources were explored. Using a participatory 
and mixed method approach, the gender and age disaggregated multiple methods of 
primary data collection were applied. The evaluation covered a total of 3,042 
respondents amongst which 40 percent were Dalits, other vulnerable and 
marginalized population groups. In addition to conducting a household level 
Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey, the evaluation conducted a total of 
eighty (80) qualitative data collection activities through application of Focused Group 
Discussion (FGD), Key Informant Interview (KII), Semi Structured Group Interview 
(SSGI), Direct Observation, Province level Validation and Lessons-Learnt session,

and a National-level validation session. Most data gathering activities involved a multi-
stakeholders participatory group-based approach, which not only eliminated biases 
but also ensured continued validation, transparency, data authenticity, and reliability. 
The methodology included analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data; gathered 
from both primary and secondary sources. Triangulation was done both in quantitative 
and qualitative parameters to verify opinions and ideas provided by different 
stakeholder categories.  
 
The evaluation found the project strategies and interventions were relevant to convert 
OD practising communities into ODF but were inadequate in making post-ODF follow 
up to address the issues that led to slippage to OD again. The elements of sustained 
behaviour change were not addressed adequately. Post ODF follow-up was very 
weak. Despite the lack of systematic gender mainstreaming into the programme cycle, 
one of the main strengths of the programme was the active participation of women 
and girls in promoting improved sanitation and hygiene services in their communities. 
 
 
In terms of effectiveness, the evaluation confirms that the interventions delivered by 
the project are credible in building thousands of new household toilets. The project 
has successfully created desired output in creating access to basic sanitation services 
for a population of 580,956. The programme also made remarkable achievements in 
developing the capacity of the sector to legislate, plan, and budget for the improvement 
of WASH systems, including mainstreaming disaster risk management. However, the 
evaluation divulges that increased access to sanitation facilities did not produce 
desired outcome of reducing the practice of OD. Although access to basic sanitation 
on a larger scale was promising but drilling down to the status of toilets and their 
usages revealed a more complex picture. Although 78.8 percent of households having 
their toilets but 37.30 percent of those toilet pits are already filled with sludge and have 
therefore been rendered useless. It was recognized that 15 percent of these 
households built new latrines, but 22 percent went back to the practice of OD. Further, 
69.40 percent of households having person(s) with disabilities (PWD) did not build 
toilets that provide access and services to PWDs.15 percent of household toilets did 
not have a drop-hole lid to cover the pit, which led to emission of foul odour and 
infestation of flies. 36.8 percent of households rarely cleaned their toilets resulting in 
faeces often being visible in the toilet pan and on the floor. As the JMP 2021 estimated 
unimproved sanitation facilities in Nepal were 3 percent thus this percentage in the 
category of unimproved latrines was greater than the national average. Percentage of 
the population practicing Open Defecation were 16 which increased to 22.7 percent 
during the time of this evaluation. Similarly, there was little effect on hand washing 
practices at the household level. The findings revealed that 54.70 percent of 
households’ (HHs) latrines did not have hand washing facilities and 44.2 percent of 
the HHs had no hand washing stations alongside the toilet. While 60 percent of the 
population used soap to wash hands then 40 percent had water only for hand washing.  
 
Regarding efficiency, due to the emergence of COVID-19 the programme faced grave 
difficulties in delivering interventions which were further aggravated by the non-
functional mechanism of WASH-CCs at different levels after federalization. Despite 
these gigantic operational challenges, the programme has been able to achieve high 
operational efficiency. With the Project Direct Investment (PDI) of US$2,210,000, the 
programme was not only credited with providing 580,965 people access to basic 
sanitation but also humanitarian WASH services to a population of 383,353. Further, 

 
 
 
6 
the PDI not only catalysed counterpart financial support by the federal government to 
Palikas but also catalysed construction of thousands of toilets by the community 
members who invested on an average of about US$100 per toilet. Unfortunately, in 
terms of transformation of costs and inputs into sustained ODF outcomes, the cost-
effectiveness of the programme has diminished. However, the evaluation firmly 
recognizes that the policy guides and Management Information Systems (MIS) that 
have been developed and operationalized would have continued utility value in the 
long term and added value to the fund invested. 
 
The Sanitation and Hygiene Master Plan (Master Plan 2011) of the Government of 
Nepal described the following indicators/criteria for an ODF area (a village, ward, and 
municipality). 
• There is no OD in the designated area at any given time. 
• All households have access to improved sanitation facilities (toilets) with every 
member of the family using it and being responsible for its repair and maintenance. 
• 
All schools, institutions, and offices within the designated areas must have toilet 
facilities. 
 
Following the above-stated criteria, a large percentage of villages and wards achieved 
ODF status during the period 2018-2019. However, those villages and wards were 
unable to sustain the ODF status at a later stage. Due to several constraints such as 
access to toilets, proper usage, maintenance of facilities, and sustained improved 
hygiene practices, a significant proportion of the population returned to the practice of 
OD. In all the ODF declared municipalities, including three Dalit communities, the 
evaluation team intensively observed 19 villages and found that 15 villages failed to 
retain the ODF status. Internal factors that affected the retention of ODF status are: 
 
• Inadequate intervention towards sustaining the achievement of ODF status and 
steering the progress further. 
• Weak monitoring of processes and changes. 
• Lack of post-ODF interventions. 
• Inadequate interventions for collective behaviour change. 
• Inadequate attention to address the special needs of Dalits. 
• Inefficient faecal sludge disposal. 
• Inadequate rolling out of the process at the Ward WASH-CCs after 
federalization and addressing the legacy of WASH-CC has become weak. 
• Inadequate inputs for capacity development. 
 
Besides the emergence of COVID-19, other external factors affected the retention of 
ODF status are: 
 
• Low investment capacity of 50 percent HHs to obtain and maintain government 
prescribed latrines. 
• Lack of access to water in hilly regions.  
• Negative impact of an unhygienic and dirty toilet in schools and other public 
institutions.  
• Lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities amongst the staff of the three 
tiers of government.

In relation to making the sanitation programme more effective and to create 
sustainable ODF outcomes, the evaluation put across the following strategic lessons: 
• Creation of a sustainable sanitation outcome requires an equal emphasis on 
building synergistic ties between all stakeholders including the local government 
and civil society etc.  
• Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) strategy must focus on sanitation as a 
public good. 
• Inclusive and equitable sanitation demands strategizing 
elimination of 
discrimination of caste and other vulnerable groups.  
• Cost effectiveness could be enhanced by equally emphasising collective behaviour 
change and sanitary hardware.  
• Deliberate intervention is required to reverse the prevailing perception that 
sustenance of ODF status is directly dependent on external funding.  
• Communal sanitation facilities will not serve the purpose unless strategies and 
mechanisms of maintenance are introduced beforehand.  
• Programme designs need to explicitly include Gender Equity and Social Inclusion 
(GESI), Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). 
• It is important to have a strong and systematic programme monitoring system 
capable of taking corrective measures while monitoring ODF sustainability. 
• Based on the principles of collective behaviour change training and capacity 
building of local government / WASH CCs is essential.  
• To promote ownership within the local government/municipalities it is essential to 
allocate a dedicated budget.  
• Existing human resource at the relevant government departments and local 
government is extremely inadequate to facilitate the Participatory Assessment 
Planning Implementation and Review (PAPIR) process with the communities. For 
collective behaviour change and community empowerment, it is essential to 
engage local NGOs as partners for Palikas. 
Based on the findings and lessons stated earlier the evaluation recommends the 
following for the future programme to be more effective: 
• Training and Capacity Building at all levels need to be based on the principles 
of collective behaviour change process which does not exclude the outsiders. 
• Addressing sociocultural variations through Institutionalizing Participatory 
Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Review (PAPIR) process at the 
villages/wards as the way forward. 
• Ensure dedicated budget allocation, action plan and ownership of local 
government to sustain the already achieved ODF status in Nepal by 2030. 
• Encourage local NGOs, CSOs, Users Committees, Cooperatives, and 
Women’s Self-Help Groups etc. to get involved as equal partners in addressing 
the human resource needs of Municipal WASH- CCs. 
• Intensify interventions through formulation of well-defined strategies for 
maintenance of sanitation facilities and usage. 
• Adopt a clear and systematic mechanisms for sustaining and managing the 
sanitation services safely 
• Apply the policy of positive discrimination for gender and inclusion

• Systematize programme monitoring. 
The evaluation team concludes; most communities, wards, and municipalities in the 
programme- focused districts achieved ODF status in 2019, could not retain the status 
as they slipped back to the practice of OD. The key lesson learnt is that “an external 
agency-led social movement coupled with free/ subsidised sanitation hardware supply 
driven approach could be successful in achieving ODF status temporarily but may not 
necessarily retain the same without a collective behaviour change ingrained amongst 
the local communities”. The local communities must learn the essential need to stay 
away from the practice of open defecation forever. For many reasons, as explained, 
sustaining the improved hygiene behaviour change among members of the community 
depends on prevailing conditions, including the well-being of the entire community. 
Inability to cope with time and move up along the sanitation ladder in time needs 
individual household investment or support from the government/external agencies. 
This is more relevant for the poor families living in remote areas. It appears that it 
would be extremely difficult to achieve sustainable ODF status without empowering 
the communities in collective action-reflection, along with taking action to improve their 
sanitation status within their communities. This requires a shift in the role of WASH-
CCs from implementers to facilitators, working to empower communities to improve 
their sanitation and realize the right to live in an ODF environment.
