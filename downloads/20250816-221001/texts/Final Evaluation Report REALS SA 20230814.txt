PREFACE 
South Africa spends 6.2% of its GDP on education2 - the largest allocation compared with other sectors – 
but its learning outcomes have not been commensurate with this level of spending. The challenge is not 
enrolment – the country has achieved near universal access to education, with gender parity, at primary 
and secondary levels. To address historical inequalities of a highly unequal education system inherited from 
colonialism and Apartheid, the government has prioritised education as a key area of investment and 
implemented policies and programmes, including the promotion of gender parity in education, i.e., equal 
access to quality education for all citizens, regardless of their gender. Despite progress, systemic 
challenges remain, and outcomes are extremely unequal. The majority of primary schools in South Africa 
are severely under resourced. Other serious challenges in the sector are a lack of accountability and 
technical capacity in the system. One of the outcomes of concern are literacy: almost a third of South African 
learners are still functionally illiterate in English by the end of Grade 6. 
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to make the already glaring inequalities in South Africa 
even worse. As part of the nationwide lockdown on the economy and social activities, schools in South 
Africa were closed, with some later shifting to online learning to compensate for the time that had been lost 
in the school year. While this may not have been a difficult shift for higher-income (quintile 4-5) schools, 
approximately 74% of children in South Africa attending lower-income (quintile 1, 2 and 3) schools and 
have limited access to IT resources and internet. Thus, school closures resulted in a devastating loss in 
teaching and learning time. 
In spite of schools reopening, the challenge with learning losses remains and will be difficult to recover. For 
example, learners who were in Grade 1 in 2020 and lost approximately 4-6 months of learning time. Those 
same learners would have ideally been in Grade 2 in 2021, and again lost a significant amount of learning 
time. These losses are already anticipated to have displaced learners and their levels of literacy, especially 
in relation to previous generations. Even as children returned to school, the need for continued educational 
and gap bridging support remained a major imperative. 
Through a programme called the Reading and Leadership Strengthening in South African Schools for 
Learning during COVID-19 and Beyond (REALS-SA) Programme, UNICEF partnered with the South 
African Department of Basic Education (DBE) to support the continuation of learning, particularly in lower 
quintile schools; as well as to contribute to the achievement of the DBE’s pre-existing strategic ambitions 
around teaching capacity development and assessment. This is in alignment to UNICEF’s cooperation with 
the DBE on achieving “quality basic education by improving the key determinants that impact the quality of 
education and educational outcomes…to confront South Africa’s reading and numeracy challenges” 
(UNICEF, 2022). The European Union was the main funder. The National Education Collaboration Trust 
(NECT) and three other South African entities acted as implementing partners. The programme focused on 
three of South Africa’s nine provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and the Eastern Cape) with direct support 
to 650 schools in total. The programme consisted of four sub-programmes with mutually reinforcing 
objectives: Leadership and Management; Recovery curriculum; Reading Recovery; and Assessment for 
Learning. The programme was implemented from 2021 to 2023. 
 
The evaluation was conducted in early 2023, i.e. towards the end of the implementation period, and focused 
on the design and implementation of the programme. A mixed-methods approach was employed, drawing 
on programme documentation and data; seven school case studies; and interviews and focus groups with 
stakeholders. The report makes recommendations for the final stages of REALS-SA implementation as well 
as future similar initiatives that may be undertaken by UNICEF, DBE, NECT or others.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Background 
The Reading and Leadership Strengthening in South Africa (REALS SA) Programme was conceptualised 
and implemented in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education system and 
learners. The South African education system was already struggling with underperformance and inequality 
when Covid-19 crisis and school closures hit, exacerbating the challenges. The loss of learning time, 
combined with systemic factors and the unprecedented nature of the situation, highlighted the urgent need 
for support interventions to ensure continued learning. Informed by, and in an attempt to correct this, the 
REALS SA programme was launched in 2021 in collaboration with the Department of Basic Education 
(DBE), the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) and the European Union (EU), with the aim of 
improving literacy rates and strengthening leadership in the education sector, particularly during times of 
crises. 
 
The programme focused on quintiles 1, 2, and 3 schools in South Africa, and had several objectives. First, 
it aimed to support the DBE’s efforts to continue learning through both traditional and innovative 
approaches. Second, it sought to support curriculum trimming as part of a larger curriculum recovery 
programme, with a focus on developing a quality assurance framework and capacity building. Third, the 
programme aimed to develop training and coaching programmes for school leadership, governance, and 
districts, with a focus on accountability, emergency response and parental involvement. Given that this 
programme was intended as a recovery programme, it did not exclusively work with education officials, but 
instead focused on building the capacity of caregivers and stakeholders involved in teaching and learning 
such as principals, teachers, SMT members and education officials. The 4 main workstreams or pillars of 
the programme were: Reading Recovery; Recovery Curriculum; Assessment for Learning (AfL); and 
Leadership and Management. 
 
Evaluation objectives 
The evaluation focused on the design and implementation of the REALS SA programme, with an aim to 
understand whether the programme was designed and implemented in a way that would contribute 
meaningfully to achieving its intended outcomes and inform future educational programmes of a similar 
nature. The evaluation did not assess the impact of the programme as this is not feasible given the timing 
of the evaluation and the design of the programme.  
 
Methodology 
This was a theory-based evaluation which applied participatory, utilisation-focused and equity approaches. 
A Theory of Change (ToC) and logical framework were employed to construct the evaluation matrix, which 
facilitated the tracking of implementation results. A subset of OECD-DAC evaluation criteria (relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability) were applied with a gender and equity analysis framework to 
capture and report on both dimensions.  
 
The evaluation employed a mixed method approach of both primary and secondary data collection. The 
evaluation conducted desk reviews of programme documents and wider literature, and conducted focus 
groups and interviews conducted at both programme and school case study levels, and an online survey. 
The biggest challenges faced were limited programme monitoring data and documentation, and poor 
engagement from education officials.
