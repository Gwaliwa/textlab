Executive Summary  
1. This report summarizes results of the final evaluation of a three-year (2018-2021) 
Adolescent Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) Intervention that UNICEF, the Ministry of Health’s 
Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS (DNHA) and Reproductive Health Unit (RHU), 
Ministry of Education (MoE) and their partners implemented with US$250,000 support 
from the Global Thematic Funds through the Netherlands grant. This funding, when 
provided in 2018, targeted 12 per cent of adolescent girls 10-19 years in Salima, 
Dedza and Mangochi districts, which translated to 35,000 girls - 24,500 in school and 
10,500 out of school. In line with Article 24 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child 
(CRC), the goal was to prove the concept of whether anaemia as high as 35.3 per 
cent in Malawian adolescent girls can be reduced by complementing diversified diets 
with IFA supplementation and deworming. Salima, Dedza and Mangochi were 
selected because they were the core of the problem and were part of the first six 
districts (others were Lilongwe, Machinga and Dowa), which piloted the IFA 
supplementation in 2019, with resources from the Department for International 
Development (DFID).  
2. Key activities of the Netherlands-funded Adolescent IFA Intervention in Malawi were 
the provision of weekly IFA tablets to adolescent girls in and out of school, deworming 
with albendazole biannually and nutrition education with emphasis on the Malawi six 
food groups to improve diets and intake of iron. School Health and Nutrition (SHN) 
teachers and Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) were the ones administering 
tablets in schools and communities respectively. 
3. The evaluation assessed the intervention using 18 key evaluation questions 
formulated based on the standard Development Assistance Committee (DAC) 
evaluation criteria of coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. It 
integrated human rights, gender and equity under each evaluation criterion and 
question in the data collection tools. Field work took place between 11th and 24th 
February 2022 in all the three targeted districts.  
4. Quantitative and qualitative data, both primary and secondary, came from: 
▪ A review of key documents, including the project proposal, situation analysis 
report, minutes of review meetings and various policies among others.  
▪ A survey of 662 adolescent girls in and out of school. 
▪ An anthropometric survey of 662 girls to assess their nutritional status.  
▪ A total of 14 focus group discussions (FGDs) across the districts.  
▪ 58 key informant interviews (KIIs) with Principal Nutrition, HIV and AIDS Officer 
(PNHAOs), District Nutrition Officers (DNOs), SHN coordinators and teachers, 
head teachers, district pharmacists, HSAs, community health nurses (CHN), and 
staff from UNICEF and its government partners. 
5. A multi-stage cluster sampling, involving purposive, stratified and random sampling, 
was used to select 20 schools for the evaluation. The plan was to select and interview 
4 girls in each of the eligible classes (standard 4-8), making a total of 20 per school. 
Girls out of school were stratified by age (corresponding to classes they would have 

xii 
 
been in) and selected from each stratum using random sampling to participate in the 
study. Girls remaining in the strata participated in focus group discussions (FGDs) and 
other Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) sessions to triangulate the findings. 
6. The intended users of the evaluation include the Government of Malawi (GoM), line 
Ministries of Health, Education and Youth, concerned district assemblies, country and 
regional offices of UNICEF, UN agencies implementing the JPGE programme (WFP 
and UNFPA), the Netherlands Government as the donor and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) involved in health and nutrition programming in the country. 
7. Key findings from the evaluation are summarized below in accordance with the DAC 
criteria that was used. 
8. Evaluation criterion 1 – Coherence: In Malawi, the Netherlands-supported IFA pilot 
intervention is the first of its kind. The intervention was implemented in districts where 
the need was greatest, evidenced by high rates of anaemia in women of reproductive 
age (WRA) 15-49 years.  
9. Evaluation Criterion 2 – Efficiency: Efficiency of the Adolescent IFA Intervention 
was assessed to be highly satisfactory. Between 2018 and 2021, the intervention has 
invested US$ 59,332 to procure 182,000 blisters of Iron 60mg (as Ferrous Fumarate 
185mg) and Folic Acid 400mcg Remodia-Chypre and provided 52 tablets per girl in a 
year. Every girl received 26 blisters in the whole year, each with 10 tablets and had to 
take 1 tablet per week. Compliance, defined as adhering to a weekly regimen, as 
reported by adolescent girls themselves, was high at 79 per cent because they were 
taking tablets in the presence of SHN teachers, HSAs and parents, if at home.  
10. Evaluation Criterion 3 – Effectiveness: A study on anaemia is scheduled to be 
conducted later in 2022 by the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey (MDHS) 
commissioned by the National Statistical Office (NSO). However, trends from other 
countries that have implemented similar interventions show significant reductions of 
anaemia among adolescent girls only in 8 to 14 weeks of IFA supplementation for 
example, from 49 to 5 per cent in Tanzania, 20 to 5.7 per cent in Indonesia, 70.1 to 
13.4 per cent in Nepal and 29.8 to 0 per cent in Thailand. The impact of the Adolescent 
IFA Intervention on reduction of anaemia in Malawi is therefore anticipated to be huge. 
11. Descriptive analysis of anthropometric data shows that the prevalence of underweight 
(defined as Body Mass Index, BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) in adolescent girls 10-19 years old 
has decreased from 12.9 per cent reported by the MDHS of 2015/2016 to 10.4 per 
cent in February 2022 when field work for this evaluation took place. In younger girls, 
10-14 years, underweight prevalence has declined by 4.1 percentage points from 21 
per cent to 16.9 per cent, as reported by MDHS. When compared to the prevalence 
reported by the situation analysis study that was conducted to establish baseline 
information for the six pilot districts, the decrease is much higher at 20.3 percentage 
points in Salima, Dedza and Mangochi from 30.7 per cent to 10.4 per cent on average. 

xiii 
 
12. Between 2010 and 2016, the prevalence of underweight and thinness deteriorated in 
Malawi, with underweight rising from 14 per cent to 21 per cent and thinness from 2 
per cent to 8 per cent among adolescent girls aged 6-12 years old for which data is 
available. These figures mean that underweight prevalence increased by 50 per cent 
and thinness by 300 per cent. By implication, reductions observed in this evaluation 
represent the beginning of positive trends that need to be nurtured and scaled up. 
13. Through community radios, community sensitization and door to door campaigns, 
available data by the Story Workshop Educational Trust (SWET) show that the project 
has managed to reach 54,826 adolescents (32, 354 girls and 22,472 boys) with 
messages of IFA supplementation and diets. Adolescents have also been receiving 
nutrition education, particularly on the Malawi six food groups from SHN teachers and 
HSAs in schools and communities. 
14. More than half (51.4%) of the adolescent girls surveyed in this evaluation reported to 
have attended nutrition education classes. In-school girls were more likely to have 
attended a nutrition class (54.3%) compared to out-of-school girls (40.3%). 
15. As a result of these efforts, adolescent girls and boys consistently demonstrated 
knowledge of the Malawi six food groups’ model, including recognition of the individual 
groups, and the foods contained therein. Nearly two-thirds of them (65.5% - 67% in-
school and 60% out-of-school) were able to name all six food groups in the model 
diagram when displayed in front of them during interviews. 
16. In the 24-hour dietary diversity survey conducted, 68.4 per cent of the girls reported 
to have consumed various meat and meat products compared to 47 per cent reported 
by the situation analysis study three years ago. Consumption of dark green leafy 
vegetables, which are also a good source of iron, has increased as well from 89.5 per 
cent to almost 100 per cent (99.1%), legumes from 49 to 50.9 per cent and fats and 
oils from 70 per cent to 87.9 per cent. Vegetables were abundant during the time of 
the evaluation due to the rains and with the acquired nutrition knowledge adolescent 
girls consumed them regularly as part of their diet. 
17. From 2018 to 2019, the intervention trained 1,810 government frontline workers (665 
SHN and head teachers and 1,145 HSAs) in areas of supply, administration, 
management and IFA supplementation as reported by district staff. Teachers can now 
administer IFA tablets to pupils competently which will continue to reduce workload 
for HSAs and increase coverage of the intervention. Interviews conducted showed 
that HSAs and SHN teachers are able to order supplies from district pharmacy stores, 
manage them and provide reports for compliance with minimal supervision, which are 
all indicators of ownership necessary for long-term sustainability of the intervention. 
18. Besides IFA supplementation, close to three quarters of all adolescent girls (65.2%) 
interviewed indicated to have received albendazole tablets within the last 12 months. 
A total of 98 per cent of these girls ingested the tablets, with the majority in Mangochi 
(36.7%) and girls in school at 81.4 per cent, taking them twice (mean=1.53) on 
average. Interviews with health workers in all the three districts revealed that the 
Adolescent IFA Intervention did not provide any albendazole to the schools and health 
centres to deworm girls. Albendazole was provided as part of the Bilharzia program 
by the district hospitals to deworm masses.  
19. Gender and Human Rights: By implementing these activities, the Adolescent IFA 
Intervention in Malawi has upheld rights to health, nutrition and education, including 

xiv 
 
but not limited to those outlined in the CRC, not only for adolescent girls in and out of 
school, but also boys who are sometimes left out by humanitarian and development 
projects. The intervention made deliberate efforts to train both female and male 
frontline workers to ensure equity and inclusiveness in capacity building and service 
delivery, which has resulted in tangible results registered.  
20. Challenges faced: Despite numerous successes registered, the Adolescent IFA 
Intervention faced many challenges during the three years of its implementation. The 
main challenge was addressing misconceptions as IFA tablets were perceived as 
either family planning pills to curtail population growth, COVID-19 vaccination or the 
medication for cancer in Salima. This is likely to continue if no mass awareness is 
conducted within communities, local leaders, parents and girls in the future. The other 
challenges were related to the COVID-19 pandemic (hence the misconception above) 
and frequent political violence during the disputed presidential elections in Malawi. 
Project officers worked remotely for a good part of 2020 in fear of the consequences. 
Activities that were intended to be implemented during this period were interrupted. 
The aforementioned delays affected the project’s impact. 
21. The following are the key recommendations for the Ministry of Health (DNHA and 
RHU), Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Youth (MoY), UNICEF and the 
concerned districts - to be implemented by December 2023: 
1) UNICEF, as one of the agencies championing the sector, should leverage on the 
existing projects and scale up IFA supplementation to additional four of the 
remaining eight districts in the country (namely Ntchisi, Nkhotakota, Nkhata Bay, 
Mzimba, Karonga, Balaka and Mulanje) by the end of 2023. 
2) DNHA and RHU, MoE, MoY, UNICEF and concerned district councils should 
address the existing misconceptions surrounding IFA supplementation to increase 
acceptance and compliance.  
3) Train 4 SHN teachers at each school from standard 4 to 8 to reduce the access 
work load and interruption of classes during IFA days. 
4) Collaborate with the World Health Organization (WHO) and explore the possibility 
of leveraging resources and efforts around procurement and distribution of 
albendazole for the Adolescent IFA Intervention. 
5) Provide adequate fuel (at least 130 litres per quarter) to each district to allow district 
teams carry out joint monitoring and supervision of activities. 
6) Provide resources and introduce quarterly review meetings for the district teams 
to look at the district performance, identify bottlenecks on time, and plan for 
activities for the next quarter. 
7) Improve the collection of IFA compliance data. Train data entry clerks already 
available at district hospitals to enter the data into the District Health Information 
System (DHIS2). 
8) Provide clear roles to address current tensions between PNHAOs and DNOs. 
9) Integrate the IFA supplement supply chain within the Ministry of Health (MoH) and 
Central Medical Store Trust (CMST) system to strengthen capacity and 
sustainability. Table 17 at the end of this report provides a summary of specific 
recommendations, implementers and the timeframe required.
