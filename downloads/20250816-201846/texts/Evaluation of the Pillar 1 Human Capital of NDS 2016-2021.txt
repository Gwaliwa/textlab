EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1. This Evaluation Report is for the end of cycle evaluation of the Human Capital1 Pillar of the 
Kosovo National Development Strategy 2016-2021 (NDS HC1).   This evaluation is 
commissioned by the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) within the Office of the Prime Minister 
(OPM) of Kosovo and supported by UNICEF Kosovo and will cover the period from 2016-
2021.  The timing of this evaluation aims to inform the Kosovo Institutions and the Office of 
the Prime Minister, and other stakeholders on the progress of the NDS HC1, lessons learned 
and to present recommendations for informing the design and development of the next cycle 
of the NDS (2022-2030) HC1. 
2. The expected users for this evaluation are the SPO/OPM, Kosovo government and other 
partners, notably related to adjustments in NDS Human Capital Pillar implementation 
and/or design, and to support discussions with stakeholders regarding the elaboration of the 
next NDS for Kosovo. The evaluation will also serve to inform the Kosovo Government and 
an array of Ministries, Departments and Offices, the United Nations Agencies, donors, and 
CSOs on the lessons learned from the NDS HC1 and to present recommendations for future 
NDS based on the essential findings.   
National Development Strategy 
3. The Kosovo Government developed its first NDS, which serves as a strategic document for all 
planning in Kosovo, in 2016. The NDS aimed to develop a list of priorities under an umbrella 
strategy which would allow building synergies between initiatives, prevent institutional 
overlap, and yield higher performance efficiency, orientation of support of the development 
partners, and establish a basis for public accountability.  The NDS is organized across four 
thematic pillars:  human capital, good governance, industrial development, and 
infrastructural development.  As a supplement to the NDS, the NDS roadmap, prepared in 
2017, outlined a more detailed implementation plan which included costing, as well as 
implementation and activity indicators. 
4. The Human Capital Pillar, the focus of this evaluation, places a strong emphasis on measures 
seeking to strengthen the education system and to strengthen its connection and 
applicability to the labour market and the economy.  These are articulated through seven 
distinct measures and 32 associated activities.  The pillar is oriented around the promotion, 
creation, and sustaining of a productive, skilled, and innovative labour force.  The underlying 
logic is that this is a determining factor for successful national development.  This is 
predicated on assumptions that as the labour force acquires higher skills, there will be a 
subsequent increase in incomes and a general improvement in the economy.  Skills are not 
only defined as technical skills, but also include cognitive skills, such as logic and reasoning, 
as well as ‘soft’ skills such as interpersonal skills or values.  Building these skills is seen as 
heavily linked to the education system and the quality of education provided pre-workforce 
entry, although labour market skill increases may also come from migration to other settings 
and subsequent ‘brain gain’ from diaspora returnees. 
5. The leading stakeholders involved in the implementation of the NDS Human Capital Pillar 
involve three key Ministries as well as a range of supporting institutions.  The key Ministries 
were the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Ministry of Labour and 
Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Diaspora.2   
 
1 For the purposes of this evaluation, Human Capital is defined to be the collection of skills, knowledge and experience in a 
population and is viewed in terms of its contribution and value to Kosovo economic development. 
2 These ministries have been restructured in 2020 as part of an overall ministerial reform.  The titles here refer to the titles as of 
the time of design.

Methodology 
6. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, drawing on pre-existing documentation, 
pre-existing quantitative data, and combined with qualitative interviews with key 
stakeholders.  In total, 56 persons (65 percent women) were interviewed during the 
evaluation representing a mix of government, UN, donors, and civil society members.  In 
addition, more than 100 documents were reviewed that were made available from the SPO 
and respective ministries.     
7. The evaluation team was composed of two evaluators. The evaluation team was also 
shadowed by six student volunteers to amplify youth participation and as capacity building 
for the youth. The student volunteers participated in the virtual interviews, supporting the 
evaluation team (ET) with notetaking in the data analysis and writing up their impressions 
and thoughts on UNICEF's programme and evaluation process.  The youth volunteers also 
participated in the debriefing sessions and data analysis exercises and helped build the 
conclusions and recommendations for the evaluation. 
8. The evaluation approach had to be adjusted to account for the COVID-19 pandemic and the 
subsequent travel restrictions. These restrictions meant that the evaluation shifted to a fully 
remote approach in which all the interviews were carried out through virtual platforms. 
Three in-person learning workshops were carried out during the inception phase and initial 
data collection phase including an initial training on the principles of evaluation and 
application for government with the SPO, a presentation of preliminary findings and 
recommendations to a workshop with representatives from the OPM, and a presentation to 
the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG).   
Findings 
9. Relevance:  The NDS HC1 design process was rigorous, and evidence based.  The priorities 
identified in the NDS HC1 are relevant, although perhaps not sufficient to cover all 
development needs.  The NDS HC1 has the potential to serve as an important medium-term 
instrument between mandates and could provide an important mechanism for orienting 
towards external frameworks such as the SDGs and the EU ascension agenda (termed the 
Programme for the Implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)).   
10. In terms of challenges, the activities, and measures in the NDS HC1 focus almost exclusively 
on economic growth aspirations through strengthening education and enhancing 
employability.  Other wellbeing considerations such as health, culture, or social cohesion are 
not present.  Finally, the strong economic growth orientation of the NDS HC1 limits the 
degree to which transversal equity themes are able to be considered and as such, gender and 
access considerations are not strongly visible in the NDS HC1 and this is a critical gap. 
11. Effectiveness:  There has been some progress made against the measures and activities, 
but there has been lower rollout than anticipated as per the targets set.  Out of the 101 KPIs, 
23 have made good progress or were completed, 30 have made some progress while 48 were 
rated as having limited or no progress yet.  The measures and activities that have the highest 
rates of success are those which were resourced by donor support. 
12. The implementation rate of the measures that attracted substantial donor funded projects 
was higher than for those that relied more broadly on government funding for three reasons.  
First, the donor funded projects tended to have standalone planning processes including the 
development of targets, the definition of specific responsibilities for implementation, and the 
development of a structured timeline for implementation.  Second, the donor funded 
projects within the measures used a specific resourcing framework with the funds for the 
project activities allocated and earmarked for specific use even if conveyed through the 

 
 
vii 
government.  Finally, reporting processes were regular, focused specifically on the outlined 
project activities with factors provides for any delays in implementation.     
13. The macro-level economic indicators have improved modestly since 2016, but the NDS HC1 
contributions to these gains is likely to have been minimal due to the relatively low 
completion rates of activities and the fact that there are declines in the outcome level 
indicators related to the respective measures.  If almost half of all KPIs are reported as 
having had no progress and if the indicators at Measure-level that do exist for the NDS HC1 
tend to show declines from 2015 even as the macro-level indicators show gains, then it is 
reasonable to assume that modest macro-level progress is being supported from other 
sources than NDS HC1 activities per se.  
14. Efficiency:  It is not currently possible to answer the TOR evaluation question on how the 
financial resources were used for the NDS HC1 implementation because of the structure of 
the budgeting and resource allocation process.  The NDS HC1 action plan in 2017 did 
develop a costing estimate disaggregated to the level of activities including a description of 
which percentage of costs would come from government of Kosovo and which percentage of 
costs would come from donor contributions.  However, the way that financial resources are 
recorded in the Ministerial reporting does not identify resourcing allocations by NDS HC1 
activity.  Sectoral workplans disaggregate by other dimensions.   
15. Based on the available evidence, the allocations to NDS HC1 activities were not 
commensurate with the costing estimates in the NDS HC1 action plan and NDS activities 
tended to not receive priority during budgeting.  The NDS HC1 measures were not 
harmonized enough with budgetary allocations linked with budget law and ministries were 
not under obligation to allocate funding per the NDS HC1 activities even though this was 
requested from the SPO.  While some of the ministerial budgets were connected to the NDS 
HC1 activities, there was no internal requirement in government for the NDS HC1 identified 
activities to receive priority in funding.  As a consequence, NDS HC1 activity progress is 
highly aligned with voluntary commitments – especially donor commitments.   
16. Sustainability:  within the frame of a policy evaluation focuses on two dimensions:  1) To 
what degree can the NDS HC1 itself be sustained within the processes and frameworks of 
government? And 2) to what degree can the results that were achieved in the past NDS cycle 
be sustained going forward.   
17. For the first component, sustainability would involve the degree to which the NDS HC1 is 
integrated with external and internal frameworks (synergies), including the degree to which 
the NDS HC1 is aligned with, and integrated into, existing government processes and 
mechanisms.   Compared to the 2018 mid-term review, the NDS HC1 performance through 
the second half of the cycle has declined slightly in the subsequent years.  This is because the 
NDS HC1 is not well integrated into other government processes which reduces the degree of 
prominence that the NDS HC1 have in shaping policy, strategies, and implementation of 
government workplans and orienting government priorities.  Government turnover has 
increased during the NDS period as well with four different Governments taking power since 
the inception of the NDS.    
18. The second component considers the degree to which the results of the NDS can be 
sustained.  Sustainability of results in the case of the NDS HC1 would involve three levels:  i) 
whether there is a sufficient legal or regulatory framework in place; ii) whether there are 
sufficient systems, processes, or assets developed; and iii) whether there is sufficient human 
technical capacity development related to the systems, processes, or assets including both 
contracting and training human resources.   
19. For the NDS HC1 overall, achievement rates at any level have been relatively low.  Over the 
entire NDS HC1 activities, 28 percent of the listed level 1 activities (laws and regulations) 

 
 
viii
were achieved.  Level 2 activities had a similar achievement rate (24% achieved or good 
progress) related to establishing centres or building infrastructure or systems.  The lowest 
achievement rates were related to those activities connected to trainings or contracting 
people (15%).  This is triangulated from stakeholder observations in interviews.   
20. The implications for sustainability of the results is that the results of the NDS HC1 are not 
likely to be able to be sustained.  The most gains have been in the foundations established by 
the creation of the necessary draft laws and regulations and the beginning of the 
establishment of systems and assets accompanying the measures.  However, there remains 
more to be done in terms of training and contracting the people – to build the requisite 
technical capacity – to manage the assets or implement the laws.     
Conclusions and Recommendations 
21. Based on the patterns in the findings, a few key observations stand out as important 
regarding the first NDS HC1 for Kosovo and implications for the next design process. 
22. Build on the achievements of the existing NDS HC1.  Although slower than 
anticipated, there has been progress towards a number of the current NDS HC1 measures 
and activities.  A new NDS HC1 should include a review of progress milestones to date in the 
respective measures including an overview of the state of progress towards each measure.    
23. Reframe the NDS HC1 towards a more strategic, human development 
orientation.  This includes restructuring the NDS HC1 architecture towards a ‘strategy of 
strategies’ rather than a prioritization of priorities.  Reorienting the NDS HC1 towards 
human development rather than exclusively on human capital.  Because a national 
development strategy should involve all aspects that connect to quality of life for citizens, the 
strategy should encompass more than economic growth.  The NDS HC1 should maintain a 
multi-year scope for bridging mandates and should continue to be aligned with the 2030 
agendas of the EU and the SDGs.  The strategy should integrate transversal priorities of 
gender, equity, access, and environmental sustainability more visibly across all pillars 
measures and activities. 
24. Integrate the NDS HC1 more closely into existing government systems.  This 
includes ensuring the integration of the NDS HC1 sectoral strategies and workplans through 
a stronger cross-check mechanism.  Establishing Administrative Instructions for the Budget 
Department of the Ministry of Finance, Labour, and Transfers (MFLT) on NDS HC1 costing 
opinions and resource prioritization and revising the budget law for clarifying roles and 
responsibilities in ministry budget departments.  Finally, consider establishing 
Administrative Instructions from the Ministry of Local Government to Municipalities for 
prioritizing budgeting for NDS HC1 activities at the municipality level.     
25. Increase the mechanisms for accountability and reporting against the NDS HC1.  
This includes developing systems for tracking progress against the NDS HC1 activities 
including reporting on the completion of NDS HC1 activities in Ministry workplans.  Develop 
monitoring and reporting templates that disaggregate achievements and expenditures by 
NDS HC1 measures and activities which should be shared with the OPM and Assembly 
annually.  Increase the alignment of existing management data through linking databases 
and increased sharing of data between Ministries and departments.  Increase public 
monitoring of the NDS HC1 through publishing of raw data for public dashboards.  
26. Systematize high level political ownership of the NDS HC1.  The NDS HC1 currently 
is highly dependent on individual motivations which can fluctuate through government 
transitions.  Political will for supporting the NDS HC1 should seek to be strengthened 
through systematizing the NDS HC1 ownership including broad based political 
representation at supervisory and management levels beyond the OPM and SPO itself.  One 

 
 
ix 
way to do this would be through the formation of an expanded NDS HC1 Steering Committee 
comprised of a combination of OPM and Assembly representation and including civil society 
to build increased external accountability and ownership of the NDS.  This committee would 
have to have a mandate for annual review of the NDS HC1 progress. In addition to the legal 
alignment cross-check mechanisms referred to earlier, this could include empowering the 
SPO for coordinating with other government bodies responsible for the elaboration of 
government workplans and resourcing to enforce greater attention to the integration of NDS 
HC1 activities and measures in government resourcing, workplans, and reporting. 
27. Recommendations:3 
28. The following recommendations are focused on the HC1 pillar only as this is the scope of the 
evaluation.  However, the overarching recommendations would have relevance for informing 
the overall NDS as well. 
Recommendation 1: NDS HC1 Measure Progress Review. The SPO/OPM should support a review process in 
the design of the new NDS HC1 that describes existing milestones achieved in each measure and identifies which next 
steps are required in each measure.  This could be part of a SWOT analysis for the upcoming NDS design but could 
also be based on the data provided in this evaluation report.    
 
Recommendation 2: Strategy of Strategies Architecture. The SPO/OPM should re-orient the NDS HC1 focus 
towards emphasizing the NDS HC1 as a strategic compass to orient other sectoral strategies.   
 
Recommendation 3: Sustainable Development Orientation. The SPO/OPM should re-orient the NDS HC1 
focus not solely towards economic growth but to also include a more holistic development agenda that visibilize 
sustainability and wellbeing elements.    
 
Recommendation 4: External Frameworks Alignment. The SPO/OPM should refine the alignment of the NDS 
HC1 with the SDGs and Implementation of the SAA frameworks through better integration and monitoring of these 
frameworks.  The NDS HC1 could become the overarching tool for the localization of the SDGs in line with the SDG 
Resolution.    
 
Recommendation 5: Strategic Results and Action Plan. The SPO/OPM should maintain the existence of an 
NDS HC1 Action Plan and Performance Results Framework in the new NDS HC1, but these should be aligned with the 
strategic re-orientation of the NDS HC1 to be more a strategic compass rather than a project action plan.   
Recommendation 6: Sectoral Planning Integration. The SPO/OPM should strengthen how the NDS HC1 is 
integrated into the ongoing national planning system and the NDS HC1 should serve as the basis for the development 
of sectoral strategies and workplans.    
 
Recommendation 7: Sectoral Cross-check mechanism. The SPO/OPM should update the guidelines and 
Administrative Instructions for strategy development to establish a strengthened cross-check mechanism to ensure 
that sectoral strategies and workplans are in alignment with the NDS HC1.   
 
Recommendation 8: Resourcing Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened mechanism to 
ensure funding of NDS HC1 activities through Ministerial budget allocation.   
 
Recommendation 9: Sub-national Integration. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened mechanism to 
ensure the linkages of the NDS HC1 strategies with municipal planning and resourcing.   
Recommendation 10: Strengthened internal monitoring. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened 
mechanism to ensure the systematic internal monitoring of NDS HC1 progress through mandated data collection 
exercises related to both financial allocations and expenditures and activity progress.   
 
Recommendation 11: Establish a civil society monitoring of the NDS HC1. The SPO/OPM should establish 
a mechanism to ensure there is a public monitoring of NDS HC1 progress.   
Recommendation 12: Political Ownership Structures. The SPO/OPM should establish a strengthened 
mechanism to ensure there is sufficient political ownership of the NDS HC1 by including both broad-based political 
representation from different levels in steering committees commissioned to review progress against the NDS HC1 
and instruct follow-up when implementation delays occur.   
 
 
3 Recommendations in the executive summary only include key headlines.  The recommendations in table 13 provide the more 
detailed sub-recommendations as part of the overall action plan.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1. This Evaluation Report (ER) is for the end of cycle evaluation of the Human Capital4 Pillar 
(HC1) of the Kosovo National Development Strategy (NDS) 2016-2021.   This evaluation is 
commissioned by the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) within the Office of the Prime Minister 
(OPM) of Kosovo and supported by UNICEF Kosovo and covers the period of the NDS from 
2016-2021.  The timing of this evaluation aims to inform the Kosovo Institutions and the 
Office of the Prime Minister, and other stakeholders on the progress of the NDS and lessons 
learned and to present recommendations for informing the design and development of the 
next cycle of the NDS (2022-2030).   
2. Inception Phase. During the inception phase (April-July 2021), the evaluation team and 
evaluation manager (EM) gathered relevant background information on the NDS and the 
context in which it is being implemented; as well as identified different stakeholders for 
interviewing regarding their priority areas of learning from the evaluation; and to begin 
making detailed plans for the data collection and analysis phases of the process. Desk review 
of shared documentation were reviewed prior to the finalization of the Inception Report (IR).   
3. Representatives from different stakeholder groups were consulted during the inception 
phase, including the Strategic Planning Office (SPO) in the Office of the Prime Minister 
(OPM) and UNICEF.5 One significant issue identified during the inception mission has been 
that the drafting of the next NDS was already ongoing.  As a consequence, the evaluation 
process would need to take measures, such as the sharing of preliminary findings to feed into 
the new NDS design process, even before the evaluation exercise could be completed.  The 
inception phase also identified the importance of a learning-focused approach in the 
evaluation including planning for the elaboration of two workshops for capacity 
strengthening;  one just after the inception phase for technical staff regarding general 
evaluation principles, and one during the reporting phase to facilitate the development of 
management response and action steps based on the NDS HC1 evaluation recommendations.  
These are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this ER.  As part of the learning-
focused approach, the NDS HC1 evaluation process included the participation of youth 
volunteers who accompanied the evaluation process as part of a practicum process and for 
professional development.  This youth-accompanied component is described in more detail 
in section 4.2 and the Terms of Reference is included in Annex 11.   
Context Description 
4. Kosovo is categorized as upper middle-income with a GDP per capita in 2021 estimated at 
US$4,312.6  According to the World Bank, Kosovo is “one of the four places in Europe that 
have experienced economic growth since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.”7 
Despite the growth trend, inequality is high, and children and youth are particularly 
vulnerable.  With 18 percent of the population living below the poverty line, Kosovo remains 
to be the poorest in Europe.8 Kosovo has one of the highest percentages of economically 
inactive populations in Europe 9According to the 2020 (Third quarter) Labour Force Survey 
(LFS), the inactive workforce in Kosovo is considerably high at 69.9 percent, with a major 
disparity between women (85.6 percent) and men (53.8%).10 The general employment rate is 
 
4 For the purposes of this evaluation, Human Capital is defined to be the collection of skills, knowledge and experience in a 
population and is viewed in terms of its contribution and value to Kosovo economic development.

The non-tradable sectors dominate the economy and the jobs market followed by industry 
(17.5% of GDP), manufacture (11% of GDP), and agriculture (8% of GDP).12 Kosovo’s 
economic growth is also heavily reliant on remittances. The rural areas have lower economic 
and social indicators and thus are more vulnerable than the urban areas.13 Table 1 presents 
an overview of Kosovo’s key indicators.

5. Administratively Kosovo is divided into 38 municipalities. A strong focus of the government 
in the last decade has been over the decentralization process as a way to improve services at 
the local level, increase local representation and defuse ethnic tension.15 The decentralization 
has however highlighted discrepancies in full and equitable child rights such as variable 
quality in resourcing for educational attainment and access to health services and lack of 
capacity at the local level to implement various reforms.16 In terms of reforms, Kosovo has 
signed a number of key EU agreements including the EU-Kosovo Stabilization and 
Association Agreement (SAA) in late 2015 and is implementing the European Reform 
Agenda (ERA) since 2016 as “a useful tool to guide the implementation of EU related 
reforms in the SAA context .”17 The 2019 EU Report on Kosovo emphasis the progress made 
by Kosovo in aligning to EU legislation and implementing certain EU-related reforms. 
Kosovo has shown also good regional collaboration and participation in most regional fora.  
6. Overall public expenditure on social services has increased over time but remains relatively 
low and insufficient to ensure universal access and coverage.  Education and health, two of 
the significant building blocks for the development of human capital, are underfunded, and 
this is a key reason behind the Human Capital Index (HCI) score of 56 percent.  The HCI 
indicates that children are only reaching 56 percent of the potential they would have had 
with complete education and full health.  This is a loss of 44 percent of their potential 
earnings because governments are not currently making effective investments in their people 
to ensure a healthy, educated, and resilient population ready for the workplace of the 
future.18 
7. Currently, social services in Kosovo are decentralized at the municipality level, however, the 
funding, as well as several services such as the services for children without parental care, 
services for people with disabilities, and others, remain centralized at the national level. The 
fund allocation for social services in health and education is below the EU average. The 
spending on health is 3.8 percent of the GDP, which is significantly lower than the EU 
average of 7.1 percent.19 Similarly, the spending on education is comparatively low at 4.1
