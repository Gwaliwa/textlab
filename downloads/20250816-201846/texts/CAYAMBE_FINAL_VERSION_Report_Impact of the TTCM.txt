ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
This report provides an independent formative evaluation of the Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) 
project conducted by CERD and UNICEF from 2017 to 2021 in order to transform in-service training for public 
school teachers.  
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Lebanon Country Office in consultation with CERD, produced by 
CAYAMBE and relied upon consultation and input from a wide range of stakeholders. The evaluation team 
wishes to thank every contributor for their valued input and support. 
Appreciation goes first to the CERD at the central, regional and local level, with particular thanks to the PITB for 
their time and commitment.  
Throughout the assignment, the CAYAMBE team benefitted from the continuous support and guidance of 
UNICEF and its implementation partners; in particular, MEHE officials, DOPS and other field stakeholders as well 
as other donor organizations. Their input was instrumental for the overall fieldwork organization and access to 
information.  
We would like to give a special thanks to the following individuals who allocated a significant amount of time 
and support to the organization and follow-up of this evaluation: Dr Ghinwa Itani, Education specialist; Mr. 
Justus Kawesigye, Evaluation specialist and Dr Tamara Nassereddine, Evaluation officer; Mr George Haddad, 
Planning, Research, Innovation, Monitoring & Evaluation specialist at UNICEF Lebanon; Mrs Rania Ghouassoub, 
Head of Pre-service and In-service Training Bureau (PITB); Mrs Farha Wehbe, training coordinator; Mrs Rima 
Gedeon, Financial manager at CERD; and Mrs Hilda Khoury, Director of DOPS at MEHE. 
Our gratitude also goes to all school directors in the surveyed governorates for having largely facilitated the 
organization of site visits and class observations at the sub-national level in the difficult context of the COVID-
19 pandemic and fuel crisis. 
Finally, we would like to recognise all other Development Organizations who also committed part of their busy 
schedule for this evaluation, for their valuable input concerning competency-based teaching and learning in the 
RACE II context. 
The CAYAMBE team as a whole, including the evaluators, offers its most sincere thanks to all those who 
contributed in varying degrees to this evaluation. In the context of ongoing education reforms, we hope that 
this report can offer an objective picture of the significant work carried out to allow every child in Lebanese 
schools to fully enact their right to quality education and open new perspectives for future improvements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The context of the Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) and its objectives 
The multi-layered crises facing Lebanon (Syrian refugee crisis, political unrest, economic collapse, COVID-19 
pandemic, Port of Beirut explosion) have further challenged the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Higher 
Education (MEHE) to maintain a highly qualified and well-trained teacher corps. 
In 2017, CERD partnered with UNICEF to re-design the national teacher training curriculum in accordance with 
the recently adopted competency frameworks for teachers, trainers and other education staff. Given the 
fragmented teacher education system, and the lack of clear understanding of the competency-based teaching 
and learning approach among main education stakeholders, the rationale of this partnership was to adopt a 
global curriculum approach to teacher professional development.  
The TTCM was meant to provide a national theoretical backbone and a common framework for the planning of 
training modules in all training centres under the Pre-service and In-service Training Bureau (PITB) in Lebanon. 
The design process allowed to clearly link each module, face-to-face on online and self-paced, to a teacher 
competency or competency component of the 2017 framework. A Training Management System (TMS) was 
also developed for data-sharing among relevant education stakeholders (inspectors, coaches, administrators) 
that supports efforts to build a coherent and uniform teachers’ professional development structure at the 
national level.  
In its preface, the TTCM Teacher Training Handbook, describes the objectives of the TTCM project as follows: i) 
to Improve the quality of the training design to target the competency framework for teachers and transfer to 
classroom practices, to respond to the specific needs of teachers and address attitude towards cross-cutting 
themes in education; ii) to improve the capacity of the PITB to track and disseminate attainment of competency 
building per teacher and attitude change towards cross cutting educational themes; iii) to improve the quality 
of teacher training to address the specific needs of new teachers in the public schools system; iv) to improve 
the competencies of trainers; and v) to improve the quality of training within the training centres. 
Maximized transfer of acquired competencies into teachers’ routine professional practice was targeted 
through the adoption of a specific instructional planning approach called “Understanding by Design (UbD)”. As 
teacher training takes place outside of the school environment in Lebanon, the expert committee set-up for the 
project adapted this school-based approach to national teacher training institutions practices and culture. 
Objectives of the evaluation 
The evaluation of the joint CERD-UNICEF Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM) project was entrusted to 
CAYAMBE in June 2021 and took place over a seven-month period between July 2021 and January 2022. The 
purpose of this evaluation is contributing to the evidence generation around the -based adaptation of the TTCM 
in order to increase its use and effectiveness within Lebanon’s new competency-based teacher training vision. 
This evaluation is expected to generate recommendations that will help the Government of Lebanon and its 
partners to build upon the major achievements and successes of TTCM while identifying necessary 
improvements and further actions needed to maximize its impact on teacher quality.  
Evaluation scope  
The evaluation covered activities and developments of the TTCM project since its adoption in 2017 to 2021 
leading to an overall cost of 3,074,357 USD, with activities still ongoing after this date. Its scope included existing 
TTCM methods, materials and measurable outcomes, namely:

/ 
The Process adopted for TTCM design, training delivery and co-construction; 
/ 
The Content of the TTCM materials1 and their adaptation into self-paced modules; and 
/ 
The Results of the implemented training. No Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability and Learning 
(MEAL) guidelines, indicators and an agenda of activities were however initially set out in a logical 
framework, so results could not be assessed according to fixed targets. 
The general approach used in this evaluation 
This evaluation was formative and process-based. It was conducted using a human rights and gender approach 
with focus on the right of every child to quality education, with unequivocal regard to gender equality, equity 
and inclusion in public schools. It adopted a mixed method approach, using qualitative and quantitative data 
collected at national and sub-national levels in cooperation with a wide range of education sector stakeholders, 
including MEHE, CERD, education experts, school teachers and staff, UNICEF staff and donor agencies. The 
evaluation’s field visits took place between mid-June 2021 and the end of January 2022.  
Two complementary evaluation approaches were used: The Beneficiary Assessment and Outcome Harvesting. 
These approaches helped the evaluation team find their way within the relatively complex set of TTCM 
documentation, addressing the main challenges of the evaluation and overcoming the limitations of the context 
(pandemic and social crises, fuel crisis, strikes, etc.). The pandemic and social crises made it impossible to 
perform randomized controlled trials (RCT) based on an experimental group in order to estimate the net impact 
of TTCM training on teachers or students. Therefore, the team focused on retrospectively identifying emergent 
impacts of these trainings by collecting evidence on what teaching practices have changed (step1) and then, by 
working backwards, determining if and how an intervention has contributed or not to these changes. 
Main findings 
• 
Relevance 
The evaluation team concludes that the TTCM project was relevant, with general objectives established based 
on a preliminary identification of stakeholders’ needs, including teachers, trainers and indirectly students. This 
preliminary identification of needs, although conducted informally, singled out areas of focus that broadly 
respond to recognized transversal teachers’ needs such as differentiated instruction, blended learning, 
classroom management and competency-based teaching and learning. The roll out of training modules on 
Teaching with Technology (TwT) and remote/online training approach played an important role in overcoming 
the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet a limited number of teachers enrolled and completed 
the self-paced modules. The study reveals an overall positive perception by various stakeholders (teachers, 
principals, trainers, Guidance and Counselling Directorate (DOPS), experts) over the relevance of TTCM training. 
The TTCM project established a twofold innovation: a new competency-based approach to training on the one 
hand addressing the competency framework, a “new instructional framework” (UbD) on the other hand, 
targeting improved transfer. This double change rendered the training design process more complex and 
somehow less relevant for the trainers and training development and implementation more difficult with 
several confusing misalignment of teachers vs trainers tools and approaches.  
• 
Effectiveness  
The TTCM project was effective, achieving most of its expected general objectives. The proposed modules and 
content successfully addressed the national competency frameworks adopted in 2017, as recognized by more 
 
1 As per ToR, the content includes 5 Core training modules (TWT, LAC, CP, Inclusion and Gender), Teacher Training Induction Curriculum design 
and theory, Trainer’s competency building and curriculum development

than 86% of trainers. The Training Management System (TMS) was designed to be a purposeful and modern 
tool for monitoring teachers’ professional development from a lifelong learning perspective. The TMS provided 
the trainers with a holistic view of attendee profiles, the prerequisites for attending the training, the content 
material, and successfully supported the design and implementation of training sessions. However, it was not 
fully operational over the project implementation period due to power cuts and the inability to turn on the 
servers. Among the challenges that emerged were the time needed for trainers to plan performance tasks (key 
evaluation tool according to the TTCM), the inability of the trainers to follow up on attendees in their classrooms 
as well as the limits of the TMS for archiving lessons for future reference. Approximately 20% of trainers 
considered that the allocated time for the training was not sufficient. Most of the trainers stated that the five 
core modules developed were clear, helpful to improve the quality of education and valuable for tackling 
important challenges in Lebanon (forced shift to online teaching as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Syrian 
refugee crisis). The Teacher Induction Curriculum (TIC) for novice teachers was not tested, making it impossible 
to perform an effectiveness analysis.  
• 
Efficiency  
The average unit cost of training one person under the TTCM over the five years of the project is 96 USD per 
person (USD 3.07 million / 32,162 trainees). However, this average is to be interpreted with precaution as it 
combines both the average cost of the online training (during 2020 and 2021) and the in-person training (during 
2017-2019). The unit cost for 2017 was approximately 645 USD, but this high unit cost is mainly explained by 
the inclusion of the development costs associated with the TTCM framework and training modules that meant 
only the trainers were attending training sessions during this first year. Moreover, the sessions mainly consisted 
of Training of Trainers (ToT) and coaching workshops, which are usually considered as relatively more expensive 
than teacher training. The unit costs in 2018 and 2019 are more representative of the average cost of teacher 
training (112 USD and 93 USD respectively) and the teachers accounted for more than 96% of the training 
population. In comparison to other international in-service teacher training initiatives, this cost is reasonable 
and close to the expected cost of 100 USD per teacher foreseen in the RACEII logical framework. 
• 
Impact 
No formal macro- or meso-level impact assessment was conducted between 2017 and 2020, so the evaluation 
focused on micro-level impact of the DIFA module and interpretation of meso-impact level on teaching 
practices. The team observed lasting impact of the training on teacher behaviours and practices to varying 
degrees. Significant change was observed in teacher behaviour towards inclusion and child protection issues. 
For example, trained teachers implemented the key concepts of the child protection module in all the classes 
observed. The modules concerning inclusion and differentiation were observed as being generally applied in 
classes containing learners with academic difficulties or special needs. Regarding teaching with technology 
(TwT), certain teachers attributed their weak use of ICT to the lack of technological tools in their schools and 
others mentioned power cuts as a major barrier to teaching with technology. 76% of trainers asserted that the 
TTCM improved the quality of the training but stated that refresher training is essential to ensure a long-lasting 
impact. Concerning the most important hallmarks of the TTCM design, the UbD tools (performance tasks, 
rubrics, backward design) seemed to be considered more impactful by the trainers than the competency-based 
approach.  
• 
Sustainability 
In terms of sustainability, the TTCM proved notably adaptable to considerable unforeseen circumstances 
including health, political, and socio-economic crises. However, the vital role of external technical experts holds 
potential for concern, considering the highly theoretical and conceptual complexity of most methodological 
documents. The project triggered promising partnerships between CERD-PITB and MEHE-DOPS since some of

practice in public schools

the DOPS were also trainers with the PITB. However, coordination and alignment issues were perceived among 
donor-supported initiatives targeting education quality. Better understanding and coordination of pre-service 
teacher training is also recommended. The TTCM team purposefully studied the potential for coordination 
between TTCM and pre-service training offered in universities, but unfortunately this aspect of the study was 
not used for action. Two concerns were regularly raised by the beneficiaries of the project: the need to carry 
out post-training follow-up and the need for a system of recognition or motivation for the trainees. 
 
Conclusion 
Undoubtedly, the TTCM project was pioneering in the implementation of a new vision for teacher continuous 
training in Lebanon, following-up on the modernization process triggered by the adoption of the teacher 
competency framework. It fostered new tools and new approaches for teacher training quality with an explicit 
aim to ensure a real shift from teacher training quality into efficient teaching practices in the classroom. This is 
a highly important step to advocate for improved and more frequent impact assessment practices in teacher 
training. In order to ensure sustainability of the results and further improve the process, four key points should 
be kept in mind, and these four key points were used to frame the strategic and operational recommendations: 
1) The successful teacher training modernization process confirmed by the TTCM leads to a better 
understanding of the teacher competency framework as key leverage to foster quality education. However, 
teachers’ classroom practices cannot be deeply and sustainably changed if the different components of the 
school curriculum are not coherent and competency-based (curriculum, teacher pre-service and in-training, 
evaluation guidelines); 2) Such a reform process should seek to preserve diversity among teachers’ classroom 
practices, therefore training approaches ought not to be limited to the socio-constructivist paradigm. Teachers 
remain free to choose the best teaching methods and approaches, including transmissive pedagogies, to adapt 
to the needs of a specific class or pupil. Irrespective of the benefits of direct transmission, constructivism, active 
and passive teaching strategies, the effectiveness of any teaching practice depends on how teachers implement 
it in the classroom; 3) The adaptation of the UbD model to adult learning and teacher training institutions raised 
several methodological and pedagogical issues to be addressed before further development; and 4) The present 
evaluation paved the way to anchoring impact assessment as a key feature of training design and development 
at CERD learning from existing evidence. 
Overall, the collected evidence is suggestive of the TTCM project being a factor associated to inclusive 
Education. Therefore, the project contributes to the fulfilment to children rights to education reflected in the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The DIFA module particularly addressed the needs of 
marginalized children through a rights-based approach. It succeeded in providing teachers with new tools and 
approaches to differentiate their teaching and better address children’s heterogeneity. 
Strategic recommendations: 
REC #1: The Government should seek permanent coherence and generalized reference to competency-based 
teaching and learning, especially in a context of revising the Lebanese curricula, targeting increased coherence 
in education (teacher training (both initial and in-service), curriculum, assessment methods for teachers, 
exams).  
REC #2: CERD and UNICEF should revise and simplify the TTCM framework and tools and extend the present 
tools to teaching practices outside of the socio-constructivist paradigm. Teachers to remain free to choose their 
pedagogies, including transmissive ones. Unnecessary complexity should be avoided in professional and 
methodological documents. Assessment tools should not be limited to project-based approach.  
REC#3: PITB and UNICEF should consider referring to a Lebanese backward design approach based on 
performance tasks rather than to an international registered trademark and make sure that intellectual
