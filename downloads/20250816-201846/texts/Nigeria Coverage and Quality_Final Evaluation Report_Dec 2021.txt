PREFACE
In 2018, UNICEF undertook an evaluation of the coverage and quality of its response to complex 
humanitarian emergencies, and as part of this developed 11 country case studies. The purpose 
was to generate, through robust and systematic analysis in a range of country contexts, 
information on how UNICEF could improve the coverage and quality of its humanitarian response. 
Both the evaluation process and its findings have contributed to a body of evidence and learning 
regarding the enablers and barriers to delivering high-quality humanitarian action in complex 
humanitarian emergencies; these have shown how such barriers have affected UNICEF’s 
performance and its ability to reach the most vulnerable populations. 
While the country case studies were internal documents, the Nigeria Country Office (NCO) was 
interested in expanding and updating its analysis to get an in-depth assessment of the coverage 
and quality of UNICEF’s humanitarian response in the country, while identifying enabling and 
inhibiting factors and good practice. The decision to develop and update the 2018 country case 
study into a fully-fledged evaluation has proved a valuable one, including conducting the second 
data collection mission to Nigeria, which was made possible despite the constraints caused by 
Covid-19. 
This evaluation reveals that UNICEF has been among the largest and most important providers 
of humanitarian assistance and protection in north-east Nigeria over the periods 2015–2018 
and 2020–2021. UNICEF has been successful in meeting targets, and its generally pragmatic 
approach to programme quality has resulted in positive feedback from its beneficiaries. UNICEF’s 
broad range of partnerships with both government and non-government partners, alongside 
its systematic and generally successful approach to resource mobilization, have put it in a 
strong position to deliver humanitarian programmes at scale. The report, however, also sheds 
light on areas that require improvement. These include: UNICEF’s approach to target-setting, 
which provides little indication of actual performance vis-à-vis humanitarian needs; its siloed,

sector-oriented programming; limited and unsystematic community engagement practices; the 
complex and challenging issue of a government–United Nations strategy of restricted access to 
unsecured areas, which impacts on the equity principle for delivery of humanitarian assistance 
in conflict contexts; weak use of digital tools for collecting, analysing and visualizing monitoring 
data and information on coverage and quality; and delays in establishing and renewing partnership 
agreements, among others.
The evaluation was carried out by an independent team from Itad. On behalf of the Evaluation 
Office, I would like to thank Clemens Gros, the team leader, and Pierre Townsend, together with 
Monye Chinedu and Esther Igube, for their dedication, expertise and professionalism during the 
evaluation process, together with the Itad project management team that made this evaluation 
possible. 
I would also like to join the evaluation team in thanking Peter Hawkins (Representative), Rushnan 
Murtaza (Deputy Representative), Robert Ndamobissi (Evaluation Manager) and Andrea Malatesta 
(Emergency Manager) of UNICEF’s Nigeria Country Office for their support during the second 
phase of the evaluation. Thanks are also due to the former Representative Mohamed Malick Fall 
and Former Emergency Manager Gillian Walker for their assistance in support and oversight of 
the first phase of the evaluation in 2018. We are also grateful to UNICEF staff and partners in 
Maiduguri and Abuja for their participation in this exercise, namely: Phuong T Nguyen (Chief Field 
Office Maiduguri), Boris Matous (Emergency Specialist Maiduguri), Chukwuemeka Henry Okoli 
(Monitoring Specialist Maiduguri), Opiyo Nixon (Chief Field Office Abuja), Christina Valderrama 
Maya-Alfirev (Emergency Manager Abuja), Olayinka Afolabi (Emergency Specialist Abuja), and 
all Section Chiefs and members of the Operations & Security Team of UNICEF Nigeria Country 
Office. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Evaluation Office who managed this 
work, namely Jane Mwangi, supported by Carlotta Tincati, and Uyen Kim Huynh and Andres 
Ochoa Toasa, who prepared and analysed the U-Report survey data. I would like to thank Celeste 
Lebowitz, Geeta Dey and Dalma Rivero for their administrative support throughout the process, 
and ProseWorks for managing the editing of this report.

Introduction and context
Purpose of the evaluation
The objectives of the evaluation were to 
assess UNICEF’s performance in achieving 
coverage and quality in Nigeria between 2018 
and 2020. The evaluation aimed to identify 
internal and external enabling and inhibiting 
factors that influenced the delivery of high-
quality humanitarian action, and to capture 
good practice and innovation.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Methodology
The evaluation was conducted in two phases. 
Nigeria was a case study for the global thematic 
evaluation of UNICEF’s coverage and quality 
in complex humanitarian situations (phase 
1), which covered the period 2015–2017 and 
was published in 2018. In the second phase, 
conducted in 2021, the Nigeria case study was 
updated with a view to publishing a fully-fledged 
evaluation report. Throughout both phases, 
the team used a mixed-methods approach for
