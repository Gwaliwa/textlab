About CEI 
The Centre for Evidence and Implementation (CEI) is a global, not-for-profit evidence 
intermediary dedicated to using the best evidence in practice and policy to improve the 
lives of children, families, and communities facing adversity. Established in Australia in late 
2015, CEI is a multi-disciplinary team across four offices in Singapore, Melbourne, Sydney 
and London. We work with our clients, including policymakers, governments, practitioners, 
program providers, organization leaders, philanthropists and funders in three key areas of 
work: 
• 
Understand the evidence base 
• 
Develop methods and processes to put the evidence into practice 
• 
Trial, test and evaluate policies and programs to drive more effective decisions 
and deliver better outcomes 
About SeConS 
SeConS Development Initiative Group is an independent think-tank organisation of experts, 
established in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2005 with the aim of contributing to long-term socio-
economic development and improvement of living conditions of individuals and social 
groups in Serbia and the region. As a policy and research-oriented NGO, SeConS gathers an 
inter-disciplinary group of experts focused primarily on study of policy issues related to 
inclusive development. 
Acknowledgements 
We are very grateful to all those who participated in evaluation interviews and who shared 
their experiences, analysis and insights with us. We thank the UNICEF personnel in the 
Serbia Country Office and in the Regional Office who supported this evaluation, in 
particular the three teams whose models were the focus of the evaluation and Ana 
Prodanovic whose commitment, support, insight and advice throughout the project has 
been invaluable. We are very grateful to the external reference group (Kerry Albright, John 
Gargani and Carlos Acosta) for the advice and support they provided to the evaluation 
team. Finally, we are also grateful to colleagues at CEI and SeConS who provided support 
at different stages throughout the project.

Evaluation of Models for Scale-up Potential in Serbia 2016-2020 
1 
Executive Summary 
Introduction 
This report presents the findings of an evaluation of UNICEF’s modelling activity, which 
was commissioned by UNICEF to support their work to test and scale-up models. 
Modelling means piloting an intervention in new contexts to demonstrate its replicability 
and effectiveness1. Between 2016-2020 UNICEF initiated or continued to develop a 
number of models in the areas of health, child protection, education and adolescent 
wellbeing. A set of 10 necessary conditions or ‘Sine Qua Non’ (SQN) for modelling is 
intended to guide this work.  
In this evaluation, modelling was examined through five exemplar models, each at a 
different stage in modelling and work towards scale-up: 
• 
Family Outreach Worker (FOW): an intensive family support service for families 
with children with multiple and complex needs, intended to improve the capacity 
of families to support children’s development and to avoid out-of-home care. 
Modelling took place from 2013-18 in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac and Niš. 
Delivery ceased after the end of modelling except in Novi Sad. Amendments to 
legislation required to take the model to national scale have been drafted but not 
adopted. 
• 
Intermittent Foster Care (IFC): periodic family-based respite care for children with 
disabilities, to support families and improve care for children, and connect 
families and children with their local community. The model was implemented in 
2015-2016 in Novi Sad, Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis by regional Centres for 
Foster Care and Adoption, working with Centres for Social Work.  
The amendments to law required for scale-up have been drafted but not enacted. 
The model continues to be used in Novi Sad, and elsewhere some families from
