EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
Executive Summary 
About the evaluated programme 
UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme consists of three pillars, equivalent to those of RACE II. It aims at 
supporting education services that respond to the needs of the most vulnerable children and adolescents in 
Lebanon. It consists of three pillars: (I) Improve access to public education; (II) Improve quality of public 
education; (III) Improve the governance of public education. The pillars are articulated around specific 
outcomes, indicators and targets. These were to be achieved through a plethora of activities, such as subsidies 
for formal and non-formal education, transportation assistance, education supplies, textbooks, hygiene 
supplies, community outreach and engagement, and cash for well-being as well as school rehabilitation and 
construction (in the context of the Beirut blast).  
Evaluation methodology 
The evaluation followed a theory-driven design and a mixed-methods data collection and analysis approach. 
quantitative component, the evaluation relied on the identified statistical data already available.  
For the qualitative component, desk research and primary qualitative data collection was conducted at the 
national and regional levels. The latter included individual interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions 
(FGDs) at the national level, as well as deep dives during local field visits in schools. These deep dives involved 
both IDIs and FGDs, as well as Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) sessions and observations. 
At the national level 29 IDIs were conducted with 34 people representing UNICEF and other UN agencies, 
donors and the Lebanese government. Two focus groups were also carried out with representatives of NGOs, 
with 10 people overall.  During local fieldwork, 8 schools were visited. These were selected based on criteria 
such as geographic distribution, refugee population in the area, participation in the Inclusive Schools Pilot or 
school rehabilitation/reconstruction activities, type of school (boys, girls, mixed). Overall, country experts 
conducted: 8 IDIs with school principals; 8 REM sessions with 44 teachers, including 41 women and 3 men; 8 
FGDs with 50 parents, including 39 women and 11 men, 33 Lebanese and 17 non-Lebanese; Observations 
on school premises with a filled-out observation sheet; 6 IDIs with local authorities. 
Findings  
Relevance 
UNICEF's education program in Lebanon (LCO-EP) is strongly aligned with global priorities. It adheres 
to international human rights standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (UNCRC) and the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). 
The program's focus on gender parity corresponds with SDG 4's objective to provide inclusive and quality 
education for all. The program is also consistent with UNICEF’s broader mandate, emphasizing core 
commitments to children and the Strategic Plan for 2022-2025, which promotes quality learning opportunities 
inclusive of modern skills like digital competency. Furthermore, the LCO-EP is in harmony with the Lebanon 
Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), emphasizing equitable access to basic services. On a grassroots level, 
Lebanese parents, regardless of origin, underscore the significance of education as a protective factor for their 
children, especially amidst the country's ongoing challenges. 
The programme is crucially relevant to Lebanon's context, particularly in addressing the multifaceted 
challenges the country faces in its education sector. UNICEF has recognized access to education as 

/ 9 
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021  
vital, given the increased migration of Syrian families and the compounded vulnerabilities that subsequent 
crises brought to both Syrian refugees and Lebanese communities. Although the subsidization of enrolment 
for Syrian children is relevant, there have been discussions about its effectiveness in retaining students, 
suggesting a focus on attendance might be more effective. UNICEF recognized the need to intensify non-
formal education (NFE) initiatives, especially to aid Syrian children who might be entering the education system 
for the first time. However, transitioning from NFE to formal education (FE) has proven to be a challenge, partly 
due to external factors such as political priorities. Though some stakeholders are uncertain about UNICEF's 
exact role in improving education quality, its primary focus appears to be on ensuring equality, inclusion, and 
child protection, as opposed to solely academic outcomes, which is in line with UNICEF’s mandate and local 
needs.  
LCO-EP aligns closely with the country's official education priorities, as articulated in the 5-Year 
General Education Plan 2021-2025 and previously in RACE I and II. However, there seems to be an 
ambiguity in differentiating LCO-EP from RACE I and II among respondents, indicating a potential 
communication gap within the organization. While policy alignment exists in theory, practical alignment 
diverges, especially concerning the integration of refugees. Political reluctance is rooted in concerns about 
demographics and power dynamics in the country. The strong anti-refugee sentiment in society and the 
government's reluctance to adopt relevant reforms present challenges for UNICEF. Interviewees believed that 
UNICEF should exert more pressure on the MEHE, leveraging its long-standing relationship and in-depth 
knowledge of Lebanon's education system to advocate for systemic reforms, ensuring sustainability and self-
sufficiency in education.  
In addressing inherent equity gaps in Lebanon, UNICEF has actively sought to support the most 
vulnerable groups, including Syrian refugees and children with special educational needs and 
disabilities. Notably, UNICEF launched the Inclusive Education Pilot Project in 2018, targeting learners with 
disabilities, particularly those with learning difficulties. UNICEF's financial support in Lebanon's education 
sector, including covering operational costs, subsidizing enrolment, and providing cash assistance to 
vulnerable children, has been largely praised for increasing enrolment rates, especially during crises like the 
Beirut Blast and the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, UNICEF's efforts to improve education quality, such 
as organizing teacher training sessions, have faced scrutiny due to challenges in measuring their impact. 
Concerns were also raised about the proportion of results achieved relative to the funding provided. 
In response to the changing Lebanese context, marked by political instability, the Beirut Blast, COVID-
19, and economic downturns, UNICEF has exhibited significant flexibility in tailoring its activities. Key 
initiatives included covering the majority of operational school costs to ensure educational continuity during 
the economic crisis and devising a Learning Continuity Plan as a safeguard against potential teacher strikes. 
After the Beirut Blast, UNICEF immediately supported the rehabilitation of schools, replaced damaged 
infrastructure, and facilitated both financial and psychological assistance to affected children and families. In 
relation to mental health, there were noted inconsistencies in the presence and effectiveness of PSS 
(Psychosocial Support) counsellors across schools, revealing a pressing need for comprehensive 
psychological support for students in both shifts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF provided non-
formal education tools, hygiene materials, and collaborated with MEHE to devise a remote learning strategy, 
ensuring continued access to education. Some stakeholders, however, expressed concerns that UNICEF's 
emergency-centric approach detracted from their focus on core educational interventions, suggesting a need 
for a more sustainable long-term approach to emergencies. 
Effectiveness  
LCO-EP operated in a highly volatile political and social climate, impacting the achievement of initial 
goals and necessitating modifications. Constant adaptation to current circumstances was required, with a 

/ 10 
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
focus on addressing emerging issues instead of sticking to the original objectives. Significant challenges were 
encountered in collecting data to monitor progress toward established targets. Reliance on government data 
with questionable credibility posed a challenge. Inadequate monitoring tools in certain intervention areas 
impacted alternative data collection. Indicators chosen for tracking progress were not always optimal. 
UNICEF support was critical for guaranteeing access to education for many vulnerable children in 
Lebanon. UNICEF's involvement led to a significant decrease in out-of-school non-Lebanese children, 
especially Syrian refugees, dropping from 49% in 2015 to 31% in 2019. However, the COVID-19 
pandemic and Beirut's subsequent financial crises reversed this trend and saw an increase in out-of-
school Syrian children, reaching 47% in 2021. While UNICEF exceeded its support targets for Lebanese 
children, subsidizing the education of 272,515 in 2021 compared to the projected 149,831, it finally fell short 
of its goal for non-Lebanese children, assisting 191,398 against a target of 251,474. Transportation subsidies 
were slightly underachieved due to potential prolonged school closures and declining demand amid crises. 
Distributing free textbooks was a significant achievement, benefiting over 506,000 students in 2021. However, 
in 2022, this type of support was notably reduced, which was a major concern voiced by school communities 
during their fieldwork. On infrastructure, UNICEF has initiated rehabilitation works for several schools and 
plans to construct new ones, although some challenges have caused delays. Field reports praise UNICEF's 
renovation efforts but also highlight concerns about the quality of some works undertaken and certain 
maintenance problems. 
The effectiveness of UNICEF activities in improving the quality of education remains ambiguous due 
to a lack of reliable data. Progress has been observed in certain intervention areas; however, there is 
still no visible improvement in students' learning outcomes. UNICEF's involvement in improving 
education quality primarily focused on teacher training, including through the Teacher Training Curriculum 
Model (TTCM), with positive feedback from participants and positive changes in teachers' attitudes observed 
during fieldwork. Behavioral changes seem to be stronger in the case of teachers' attitudes towards Lebanese 
students than towards Syrian students. UNICEF, in collaboration with the MEHE, implemented the Child 
Protection policy and internal and external referral pathways were developed. However, there is a lack of data 
regarding the number of reported cases and their effective management on the ground. Findings from the 
fieldwork indicate that school staff is unaware of the existence of referral systems, and reported cases are 
being addressed at the school level. 
UNICEF's actions in system strengthening have yet to bear fruit. Limited successes over the evaluated 
period were also related to the high turnover of MEHE staff. Amid a financial crisis that saw a surge of 
students from private to public sectors, UNICEF shifted its primary attention to ensuring access to education, 
sidelining other initiatives such as capacity-building. This pivot was further influenced by frequent staff changes 
and challenges within MEHE. While the partnership between UNICEF and MEHE produced essential policy 
frameworks for a better educational environment, its practical implementation rests mainly with MEHE. The 
introduction of TREF has been a positive step, focusing on crucial education priorities, and recognizing key 
capacity-building needs of MEHE, especially in transitioning to institutionalized structures such as an IT 
department. 
UNICEF's support of the education programme in Lebanon had some unintended consequences, 
including the reinforcement of a two-shift school system and improvement in quality, but also limited 
access to some NFE activities. While the two-shift system accommodated the influx of refugee students, it 
inadvertently reinforced segregation, as most Syrian students were channelled into these second shifts. These 
schools operate for fewer hours and have teachers on temporary contracts, with a slightly modified curriculum 
that excludes extracurricular activities. Consequently, students receive what some considered a "second-rate" 
education. This separation further entrenched prejudiced notions, making integration for Syrian students more 
challenging. Stakeholders had mixed feelings: some viewed this as a necessary compromise, while others 

/ 11 
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021  
saw it in a more negative light. The work on NFE together with MEHE also brough about some unintended 
effects. While it led to standardized NFE programs and potential quality improvements, it also imposed stricter 
entry criteria, effectively sidelining various NGOs and barring numerous children from these educational 
opportunities. The rigid structure of the NFE system and additional requirements, such as the Accelerated 
Learning Program (ALP) certificate, further impeded many children from accessing formal education. 
LCO-EP have seen notable success in the realm of inclusive education for children with disabilities 
(CWD). Two significant milestones in this area include the creation of the Inclusive Education Policy draft and 
the National Action Plan on Inclusion, both of which have focused on ensuring equal education opportunities 
for CWD. The launching of the Inclusive Schools Pilot in 2018 has been particularly influential, nevertheless 
mainstream schools still remain largely unadopted for children with special educational needs. Though gender 
disparities are not pronounced in Lebanese education, some challenges still persist. Disparities emerge in the 
later stages of education, with a slightly higher enrolment of girls in upper grades and a tendency for boys, 
especially from impoverished backgrounds, to drop out earlier. 
Efficiency 
From 2018 to 2022 the LCO-EP funding amounted to $787.3 Mn. Most of the funds were allocated to 
pillar I – $728.9 Mn (92.6%), with pillar II receiving $39.8 Mn (5.1%) and pillar III – $18.6 Mn (2.4%). Having 
gained attention from donors, LCO-EP grew until 2019-2020. Since then teachers’ strikes, closed schools, 
crashing economy have contributed to donor fatigue. Most notable changes in allocations are visible when 
comparing 2021 and 2022. Pillar III funding decreased from 2018 to 2021, then increased by 576% ($7.9 Mn). 
Pillar II funding increased by 138% ($6.4 Mn), while pillar I – 14%.  
Support to education of Syrian refugees was managed by the PMU, while support to education of 
Lebanese children by the MEHE Directorate General (DG). This set up was not working optimally for all 
stakeholders because of issues linked to duplication of structures and centralization of functions. In addition, 
high turnover in positions in both MEHE and UNICEF hindered efficient delivery of LCO-EP. Issues with the 
transparency and accountability mechanisms in place during the period of the RACE II modality have been 
identified. Solutions adopted in TREF are viewed as better suited for timely monitoring of results and financial 
transfers, as well as overall accountability. Interviewees expect that once all mechanisms are implemented, it 
will be easier for UNICEF to monitor progress and communicate results to donors.  
There has been challenges with data collection and analysis regarding the programme performance. 
MEHE has been unable to develop a national data management and analysis framework that would have 
predictably reported on the health of the public education system (teachers, students). UNICEF has served an 
interim/supporting role, but data issues have negatively impacted the programme’s monitoring and relevant 
payments. Integration of databases and development of a uniform, clear and error-free information system 
should have been a key prerequisite for efficient implementation of LCO-EP. VASyR and the online Inter-
agency education sector dashboard evidence that social- and gender-disaggregated data are collected.  
TREF presents a shift in resource management and model of fund distribution aimed at increasing 
efficiency. Its implementation goes along the restructuring of UNICEF education section and stabilization of 
human resources. The finances are managed directly by UNICEF and are delivered to recipients, which is 
viewed as more flexible and adequate in the economic crisis. Stakeholders have a better understanding of 
where the funding goes, but this also creates an additional administrative burden on UNICEF. At the same 
time, scarce resources of MEHE limit possible capacity building and transferring tasks (payment distribution, 
data management).

EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
Coherence 
The LCO-EP demonstrates an ability to align with varying priorities among donors and stakeholders, 
encompassing different educational pillars, sectors, and target groups. Its broad scope acts as a 
beneficial factor, allowing LCO-EP to serve as a hub for coordinating educational investments and activities. 
However, coherence is somewhat diminished when it comes to NFE. Multiple interventions are conducted 
nationwide by different entities, leading to fragmented resources and increased coordination needs. 
Additionally, there is ambiguity for donors regarding how TREF’s window II aligns with their priorities, as its 
conceptual framework remains undefined. 
UNICEF's initiatives under the LCO-EP synchronize effectively with external partners in the 
educational domain. A noteworthy synergy exists between UNICEF and UNHCR, with the latter focusing on 
community-level actions and the former having a more centralized approach. UNHCR enhances the 
implementation and impact of UNICEF's work in the access domain. Collaborations with the QITABI program 
and UNESCO further highlight the focus on education quality and system strengthening, although a call for 
better coordination is evident to maximize synergy. In future initiatives, UNICEF's association with the World 
Bank could be pivotal, especially in advocacy and strategic reforms. While UNICEF is recognized for its 
leadership in access to education, it could redefine its quality focus towards themes like equality, diversity, and 
inclusion, considering the presence of other influential players, such as QITABI and UNESCO, in the 
educational outcomes domain. 
Impact 
The LCO-EP's impact on educational quality is debated. The education system has grown more 
inclusive and equitable, with many non-Lebanese children receiving formal education for the first time. 
However, the tumultuous political and economic climate in Lebanon posed challenges to effecting 
structural changes in the education system. The partnership between MEHE and UNICEF has emphasized 
inclusivity, especially for CWD. However, the program faced challenges in system strengthening, largely 
managing the LCO-EP independently due to high staff turnovers at MEHE. This resulted in a parallel 
management structure that may not be sustainable long-term. Some data suggest a decline in educational 
outcomes between 2016 and 2019, while others highlight the promise of the TTCM introduced by UNICEF and 
CERD. 
UNICEF’s most pronounced strength is its capacity to offer educational access to vulnerable 
populations, particularly Syrian refugees. UNICEF's multidimensional approach, which involved partnering 
with the government to craft suitable educational pathways for non-Lebanese children and directly addressing 
barriers refugees face, e.g. high enrolment fees and transportation challenges, was effective. If not for the 
persistent crises, it is probable that Syrian children's enrolment in Lebanese schools would have continuously 
risen. Stakeholders also commend UNICEF's initiatives regarding child protection policy and programme 
development, recommending their expansion nationwide. Several innovative initiatives were also introduced 
by LCO-EP in 2022, such as remote learning hotlines and summer schools. Preliminary results from these 
efforts are promising, but continued observation is crucial to gauge their scalability.
