Executive summary 
This report is prepared by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) and presents the findings 
of the midline evaluation of the scale up of the Catch-Up programme of remedial learning in Zambia.  
Several challenges remain despite continued efforts by the Government of the Republic of Zambia to improve 
the education system in the country. Learners in different grades are not learning enough, as displayed by 
national and regional assessments, such as, the 2016 Grade 5 National Assessment and the Southern and Eastern 
Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) III).  Findings from the PISA for 
Development (PISA-D) study reveal that in Zambia only 5% and 2% and of the learners achieved the minimum 
level of proficiency in reading and mathematics respectively. Among OECD countries on average, learners’ 
minimum level of performance is 80% in reading and 77% in mathematics1. Although more recent assessments 
from 2018 point to a marked improvement in the learning levels of learners, such as Early Grade Reading 
Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Mathematics Assessment (EGMA), there still remains a lot of ground to 
cover. The Ministry of General Education (MoGE) has been focused on improving learning at the foundational 
level, particularly at Grades 3, 4 and 5. It has partnered with USAID, UNICEF, Pratham (an Indian NGO 
working in the area of education) J-PAL, TaRL Africa and VVOB to implement the Catch Up programme of 
remedial learning. The programme follows Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) methodology adapted 
suitably to the Zambian context. Under the programme, three different approaches of TaRL were piloted before 
finalising the one-hour per day model during regular school. The model was scaled up to cover 1,780 schools 
in the Eastern and Southern provinces during 2017–2020.  
The objective of the evaluation was to provide external, independent assessment of the Catch-Up programme 
in meeting its intended objectives of remedial learning in Grades 3, 4 and 5. More specifically, the objective of 
the evaluation was:  
• 
to assess the extent to which the programme is achieving its objective of improving literacy and 
numeracy skills for all learners and for those further behind; 
• 
to assess the extent to which the programme is being implemented as designed, including effectiveness 
of partnerships and sustainability mechanisms; 
• 
to assess the sufficiency of resources to implement the Catch-Up Programme, while still maintaining 
effectiveness; and 
• 
to assess the enablers and factors contributing to the positive and negative effects, if any, of the Catch 
Up programme. 
The overall objective of the evaluation was to provide policymakers and stakeholders, namely MoGE, UNICEF, 
USAID, TaRL Africa, J-PAL, Pratham, and The Flemish Association for Development Cooperation and 
Technical Assistance (VVOB), with useful insights on the implementation of the programme, its efficacy for 
improving foundational learning among the children of Zambia, the challenges encountered and the measures 
taken to overcome them. The evaluation aimed to specifically investigate the effectiveness, efficiency, 
relevance, sustainability and the equity aspect of the Catch-Up programme. 
The duration of the evaluation was originally planned between September 2019 and May 2020. However, 
because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation period was extended to August 2021.  The 
extension was necessitated by several factors, such as, indefinite closure of schools, changes in the school 
calendar, and disruptions in the Catch-Up classes owing to the closure of schools.2 The data collection was 
further delayed because a minimum number of weeks of Catch-Up classes needed to be conducted before 
assessing the learning outcomes of learners. The disruption in Catch-Up classes due to the pandemic may have

2 All schools closed due to COVID 19 on 18th March, 2020. Examination classes reopened on 1st June, 2020. Non 
examination classes reopened on 21st September, 2020. All schools closed for the last term in December, 2020. For the 
academic year 2021, the reopening of schools was delayed by 2 weeks in January 2021. Instead of opening from 18th 
January the schools started from 1st February, 2021. Schools closed on 17th June 2021 for an initial 21 days and then 
reopened again on 23rd August, 2021.

a bearing on the findings pertaining to the assessment of students and hence need to be considered with caution. 
Furthermore, the COVID-19 protocols posed some challenges in the field in terms of the availability of adequate 
number of respondents in a few instances. The timing of the data collection (February–March 2021) was also 
not ideal as 8 schools out of 35 could not be reached because of flooding. To mitigate such challenges, schools 
and respondents were replaced as and when necessary. 
The evaluation was managed by a team from UNICEF and the MoGE. Technical support was provided by a 
reference group comprising of members from UNICEF, USAID, MoGE and VVOB. The evaluation focuses on 
outcomes obtained by the programme interventions after 20 months of implementation since its initiation. 
Methodology 
The evaluation followed a theory based approach in line with the requirements of the ToR. A theory of change 
for the Catch Up programme (see Figure 1) informed key evaluation questions, and the methodology was 
aligned to the evaluation questions. The evaluation relied mostly on primary research with secondary research 
only being used to develop the tools and to prepare the background of the report. 
The scale up of the Catch-Up programme covered 
1,780 schools during 2017–2020. 3  However, the 
evaluation was conducted on a purposively chosen 
sample of three districts from each province, Eastern 
and Southern. Thus, Chipata, Katete and Mambwe 
were selected from the Eastern province, and 
Monze, Zimba and Kazungula were selected from 
the Southern province. 
A total of 35 schools were selected from the six 
districts in the two provinces. From the 35 schools, 
1,053 learners, 96 teachers, 31 monitors and 34 head 
teachers were interviewed. In addition, 25 Zonal In-
Service Coordinators (ZICs), 6 District Resource 
Centre Coordinators (DRCCs) and 2 Provincial 
Resource Centre Coordinators (PRCCs) were 
interviewed. 
Furthermore, 
at 
national 
level 
representatives of MoGE, UNICEF, USAID, VVOB, TaRL Africa, J-PAL and Pratham were also interviewed 
to get a perspective of the programme planners, technical assistance providers and implementers.      
The data collection team was trained through a three-day session involving classroom lectures, role plays, 
question and answer sessions, and finally the field-testing of tools. Owing to the travel restrictions, the Team 
Leader trained the enumerators and supervisors online using the Microsoft Teams platform. The training on 
TaRL assessment methods and tools was conducted in a one-day face to face session by representatives of 
MoGE in both the provinces.   
Following the data collection, the data was analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. 
Key findings 
Key findings from the evaluation have been summarised against the criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, 
relevance, sustainability and equity. 
Effectiveness 
Effectiveness of the programme was measured against parameters, such as literacy and numeracy outcomes of 
learners, effectiveness of training on the TaRL methodology, proportion of teachers finding the TaRL 
 
3 MoGE 
The Catch-Up programme districts were selected by 
MoGE on the basis of a set of indicators reflecting 
poverty levels and learning outcomes in English and 
Math. Schools in each district were chosen by the 
District Education Boards (DEBs), using pre-agreed 
criteria. These included:  
• 
performance levels (to enable diversity in 
learning levels); 
• 
geographical considerations (to include both 
rural and peri-urban); 
• 
grade offering (G1–G7 only); 
• 
school running agency (both Government and 
community); and   
• 
clustering of schools into Zones (around 5 
schools per zone).

methodology useful in eliminating learning difficulties among learners, and challenges faced in implementing 
the programme.  92 % of the survey respondents agreed that the remedial teaching activities of the Catch-Up 
programme generated interest among the teachers and learners. 
The literacy assessment does not show much variation in the proportion of learners among the levels from 
baseline to midline assessment, except at the beginner level. There is a 19% increase in the proportion of learners 
who cannot identify even a single letter. When queried, most teachers attributed this to the disruption in regular 
school and Catch Up activities owing to COVID-19. Irregular Catch-Up classes resulted in learning losses as 
the learners found it difficult to retain their learnings over extended periods of break in the school calendar.  
In numeracy, the assessment results show that 85% of the learners can recognise numbers of two or more digits, 
showing that they were ready to start with numerical operations. However, there continues to be a large group 
of learners who are not able to do basic mathematical operations of addition and subtraction. This group reduces 
in size as the learners’ progress across levels. Changes between baseline and midline assessment data shows 
that there has been a distinct increase in proportion of learners attaining higher levels in mathematics with both 
the Southern and Eastern provinces reporting an 18% and 17% increase in the proportion of learners respectively 
who could do division and multiplication. 
As far as the training on TaRL methodology is concerned, all 96 teachers who were interviewed reported having 
received the training. 98% of the teachers found the training to be useful which introduces the use of 6 different 
teaching methodologies that helps reduce learning difficulties among learners. 82% of the teachers stated that 
the Catch-Up programme was implemented effectively as per schedule. Effective implementation of the 
programme was attributed to complete ownership of the programme by MoGE and training and mentoring 
provided by UNICEF, VVOB and other partners. 
Some of the key challenges in implementing the programme, as reported by teachers and other stakeholders, 
were large teacher learner ratio, poor quality of teachers in some instances, limited funds for travel for reporting 
purposes, lack of infrastructure, and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Efficiency 
The programme was perceived to be implemented in a cost-effective manner and 65% of the teachers, Head 
Teachers, and MoGE staff reported that the classes were held as per schedule. The primary reason for the 
programme being cost effective, as reported by the school administration and MoGE, was that the TaRL 
methodology was least resource intensive and most of the material required to conduct the classes was available 
within the school. The training and mentoring support were frequent, and the summary reports were perceived 
to be useful by 89% of the respondents. However, in terms of the sufficiency of resources, there is a gap in 
understanding between programme participants and stakeholders. While all school administrations reported that 
the resources were sufficient, 35% teachers stated that more resources were required, such as reading material 
for higher levels. The stakeholders’ perception was that the programme did not require much resources but the 
implementers suggested that there is a need for more resources, particularly as learners reach higher levels of 
achievement. 
Relevance 
The programme was perceived to be extremely relevant to the Zambian context by an overwhelming 98% of 
the stakeholders. The programme is perceived to be extremely important in achieving foundational literacy and 
numeracy by the teachers, school administrators, MoGE as well as USAID, UNICEF, TaRL Africa, Pratham 
and VVOB. The overall goals of the programme are perceived to be in line with the strategic priorities of MoGE. 
Finally, stakeholder participation in terms of providing feedback is quite high and the feedback provided is 
regular and perceived to have been taken on board. 
Sustainability 
67% of the stakeholders reported the programme to be sustainable. The engagement of MoGE with the 
programme is quite high. Officials in the system are incorporated into the programme as monitors and trainers. 
Furthermore, there is buy-in from the Government on incorporating the programme into the education system 
and scaling it up nationally. Sufficient capacity and confidence are perceived to have been built up so that the
