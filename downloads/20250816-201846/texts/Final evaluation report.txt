EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
INTRODUCTION 
The Educational Environment Improvement Project in Kilinochchi District (hereafter: the Project) 
was funded by KOICA for a total amount of USD 6,750,000 over the period October 2018 – 
December 2022. The Project Goal was to enhance learning outcomes in targeted poor-performing 
schools through both hardware (infrastructure) and software interventions in Kilinochchi district.  
The primary target of the project was 13 schools and Zone and Province-wide activities were also 
implemented. The project was managed by UNICEF in coordination with national agencies and 
implemented by Province and Zone authorities and services and selected civil society organisations, 
private sector organisations and the University of Jaffna.  
The purpose of this evaluation is threefold: (i) To determine the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, 
and sustainability of the Project; (ii) To assess cross-cutting issues of equity, gender equality, human 
rights, environment, and technology (ICT) applied in the project planning and implementation; (iii) 
To draw recommendations for future anticipated project design and advocacy for scaling up. The 
evaluation criteria and questions are articulated around four DAC-OECD evaluation criteria 
(relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability) and one additional cross-cutting issues 
criteria.  
This evaluation report is based on a methodology with strong limitations, as the Sri Lankan firm 
recruited to conduct the evaluation produced evaluation drafts deemed of insufficient quality by 
UNICEF. Another consultant was hired to re-write the report based on available data (17 interviews 
and 21 focus group discussions). The evaluation tools used by the initial team to collect data had 
significant gaps. Wherever possible, this report draws from the endline studies (general endline and 
KAP endline) to fill in the gaps. The writer acknowledges that she was involved in some M&E 
activities of the project (endline study) but was not involved in any activity on the ground. 
FINDINGS 
RELEVANCE 
Overall, the objectives and design of the Project were sensitive to the economic, environmental, 
equity, social, political economy and capacity conditions in which it took place and the activities 
were relevant in achieving the project objectives. The project design and activities have contributed 
to addressing key educational shortcomings in Kilinochchi in terms of infrastructure, teacher quality, 
dropout rates and learning outcomes. Project activities and inputs were needs-based and relevant to 
the diverse needs of target schools. The project implementation strategies were relevant to the 
significant changes that took place throughout implementation due to the pandemic and 
subsequent economic, political and social crises. Adaptative strategies to respond to the pandemic 
and economic crisis context were found relevant by local authorities and implementing partners. 
EFFECTIVENESS 
The project achieved all its indicator targets. The project contributed to: 
• 
Significantly improving the project schools’ learning environments (physical environment, 
equipment, learning materials, hand washing stations), which increased students’ safety in 
school and increased their motivation for learning and participation in physical education. 

6 
• 
Positive changes in terms of increased capacity and adoption of child friendly teaching and 
learning practices (hands-on an experiential learning, activity-based approaches, improved 
knowledge, skills and attitudes of teachers regarding child-centred practices, improved IT skills, 
improved support to low performers). 
• 
Positive changes for students (attendance, motivation, learning outcomes, wellbeing), teachers 
but also principals, School Development Committees, parents, some non-project schools, ADEs 
and ISAs.  
• 
Improved exam results in the 13 project schools and the Kilinochchi district for the G5 exam and 
the GCE/OL Exam. 
All evaluation stakeholders make clear causal links between project’s inputs and outcomes. The 
project provided several types of inputs that, combined together, contributed to some of the above 
reported achievements and changes. Key effectiveness strategies included (i) the combination of 
hard and soft inputs (capacity building and community mobilisation); (ii) the participation of 
different subject teachers from both primary and secondary schools to capacity building activities, 
which created a critical mass of trained teachers in schools; and (iii) the consistency of key points 
and messages conveyed to various target audiences at community, school, zone and province levels.  
There were some limitations in the quality assurance approach of the project set up for the capacity 
building component, which initially planned to rely on existing zonal tools and procedures which 
were difficult to identify and were further constrained by the pandemic which did not allow for 
school monitoring visits by zonal staff.  
EFFICIENCY 
Coordination mechanisms were deemed efficient by UNICEF and education authorities. UNICEF 
demonstrated efficient resources management strategies, being agile with budget fluctuation and 
strategic in how to use additional funding generated by the depreciation of the US dollar. The 
Project was of sufficient duration for all planned activities. Despite some delays for the construction 
component, the project overall adapted quickly to the time constraints created by the pandemic. 
UNICEF learned from implementation, as illustrated by the approach to M&E, for which the capacity 
was strengthened after the baseline to strengthen data collection processes. 
SUSTAINABILITY 
There is a strong ownership of the project by zonal and provincial authorities. The province and zone 
offices have taken several steps to ensure sustainability (i) encouraging project schools to share their 
resources and facilities and to strengthen their school-based professional development activities, (ii) 
identifying the key elements to put in place to sustain the project, such as monitoring and teacher 
mentoring, documenting activities; (iii) developing action plans to implement some of the learning 
from the Korea study tour. Some schools have also: (i) committed to continue some activities with 
their own funds, (ii) developed maintenance strategies for the equipment received. In addition, the 
Principals’ and ADEs’ training modules will be endorsed by the PDE and widely shared across the 
Province and the teacher training modules, which are owned by Zone offices, will serve for future 
training events. 
Key constraints to sustainability include (i) the overall lack of resources in the context of the 
economic crisis, (ii) the anticipated costs that will be needed to upgrade and renew the IT equipment 
overtime, (iii) the absence of parental engagement activities in the provincial and zonal action plans 
and initial commitments to sustain project outcomes, and (iv) concerns over the capacity of SDCs to 
take over the community mobilisation component in its entirety. 

7 
CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES 
The project promoted the principle of sustainable environment in the construction component. The 
Project was relevant to and addressed the various needs of various sub-groups of children, 
particularly girls, children with disabilities and low performers, but lacked a gender and inclusion 
lens to develop gender sensitive and disability sensitive implementation strategies. A promising 
element is the integration of special and inclusive education as one of the 3 objectives in the 
provincial action plan developed as a follow-up of the Korean study tour. 
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED 
The main conclusions are: 
1. The Project has made a significant contribution to improving access to education and learning 
outcomes in Kilinochchi. 
2. Project results have made and will make a difference for students in one of the poorest districts 
of Sri Lanka. The project has made significant efforts to sustained activities and results, yet there 
are some potential constraints on sustainability due to the current economic situation. 
3. The Project’s relevance has increased throughout implementation due to the unexpected 
context within which the Project took place, i.e. a global pandemic and a severe national 
economic, social and political crisis. 
4. The Project has modelled a combination of support activities and implementation strategies that 
have enhanced its overall effectiveness. 
5. The Project has paved the way for promising educational developments in the Kilinochchi Zones 
and Northern Province in future years. 
6. UNICEF and the project team have demonstrated adaptability, agility and resilience throughout 
implementation and have increasingly strived to support system strengthening. 
7. The Project’s approach to capacity development would have benefited from a stronger 
theoretical approach in its initial design, encompassing not only individual capacity at school and 
zone levels but also organisational and institutional capacity to build in sustained capacity 
change at the onset. 
8. Quality assurance mechanisms and monitoring capacities remain a gap at zone level. 
9. UNICEF and ZEOs have not fully harnessed the potential of the promising community 
mobilisation model developed by the Project and which has led to proven results in terms of 
knowledge and attitudinal changes. 
10. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been little improvement in terms of overall social 
cohesion. 
The key lessons learned are: 
• 
Using locally available materials is important for cost-benefit purposes but also for contributing 
to the local economy and reducing the carbon footprint of the infrastructure developed. 
• 
Multipurpose facilities are appealing to respond to schools needs but are not always fit for 
purpose.   
• 
Explaining and mediating to schools, communities and building contractors the goals of a 
project, its innovative infrastructure technical specificities, its environmental impact mitigation 
requirements and its budget constraints is a time-consuming process. 
• 
Offshore procurement is a time consuming and complex matter due to tax exemption 
administrative processes. 
• 
The Project benefited from harnessing the potential of local and national expertise, by going the 
extra mile to identify the right people with the necessary expertise. 

8 
• 
Training teachers the way they are expected to teach students is fundamental, that is using a 
learner-centred hands-on approach to teacher training. 
• 
It cannot be expected that trained teachers (or staff) are de-facto trainers themselves and able 
to share their new learning and skills meaningfully with their peers. This requires support.  
• 
Awareness of contextual constrains preventing teachers from implementing their newly 
acquired knowledge and skills is critical to induce a cultural shift amongst teachers. 
• 
Community engagement for education requires a comprehensive approach, targeting parents, 
community leaders and groups, and school stakeholders such as SDCs. 
• 
Social cohesion improvement is a complex matter that requires understanding the underlying 
causes of social division and the psychological processes and psychosocial dynamics involved. 
• 
Strong M&E expertise is required at the onset and throughout implementation for a project of 
this scope and size. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
FOR UNICEF 
1. Strengthen inclusion programming principles in future project design and implementation 
(gender, disability). 
2. Strengthen organisational (structures, processes and procedures, policies and plans, roles and 
responsibilities) and institutional capacity development (legislation, regulations), such as costing 
studies to support discussions on sustainability and scale up.  
3. Ensure and maximise the re-use and re-purposing of project outputs and materials internally and 
externally (KAP studies, community mobilisation training materials). 
4. Take a leadership role in supporting government authorities nationally and locally to develop 
and sustain digital environments in schools. 
5. Continue to feedback key learning from the project into national strategic programme support 
and advocacy. 
FOR THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 
6. Include project models, practices, lessons and recommendations in on-going education reforms 
and education planning activities. 
7. Engage in long-term systemic support to inclusive education. 
8. Engage in long-term systemic support to digital learning and ICT in education. 
FOR THE ZONE OFFICES AND PROVINCE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
9. Ensure dissemination and sustained use of project outputs and results. 
10. Consider re-packaging some of the capacity development courses into online self-paced courses 
that could be taken on a modular basis by zone staff and teachers. 
11. Integrate best practices in infrastructure development from the Project into the Provincial 
standards and criteria for school buildings. 
12. Develop a teacher professional development plan at province and zone level. 
13. Develop a province and zone staff professional development plan. 
14. Strengthen education quality assurance mechanisms.

1.1.2 Project overview 
CONTEXT 
The Educational Environment Improvement Project in Kilinochchi District (hereafter: the Project) 
was funded by KOICA for a total amount of USD 6,750,000 (Programme costs: USD 5,694,444 and 
Indirect support costs: USD 455,556) over the period October 2018 – December 2022. The total 
budget includes 600,000 USD added by KOICA in 2020 in response to the pandemic. 
Kilinochchi is one of the 5 districts in the Northern Province. When the Project was designed, the 
Province had the highest Poverty Headcount Index of the country (7.7%) (World Bank, 2015), and 
Kilinochchi was the poorest district in the country with 18.8% Poverty Headcount Index (Ministry of 
National Policies, 2016). Kilinochchi was also in the top 5 districts nation-wide with the lowest Gini 
coefficient (Ministry of National Policies, 2016). In 2019, Kilinochchi had 17.6% of its population 
vulnerable to poverty, making it one of the top five districts with the highest proportion of 
population vulnerable to poverty in the country (Ministry of Economy, 2019).1  
OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED RESULTS 
The Project Goal was to enhance learning outcomes in targeted poor-performing schools through 
both hardware (infrastructure) and software interventions in Kilinochchi district. The main 
objectives were:  
1. To improve the physical learning environment through construction/renovation of 
classrooms/facilities and equipping of the targeted schools. 
 
1 using a multidimensional measurement of poverty comprising 10 indicators reflecting the deprivations faced 
by people at household level 

10 
2. To build the capacity of teachers, principals and in-service advisors to provide better quality 
education services in the targeted schools that promote improved learning outcomes and social 
cohesion. 
3. To increase community awareness on the importance of education and the role of parents as 
part of the school community. 
The Project was amended in 2020 to support an additional objective:  
4. To provide a safe environment for and quality education during and after the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
The Project’s expected results were as follows: 
• 
Outcome 1: Children have access to improved physical learning environments and materials in 
the targeted schools 
o Output 1.1: Enhanced quality of and types of facilities available in the targeted schools 
o Output 1.2: Increased availability and use of quality learning materials in the targeted 
schools 
• 
Outcome 2: Children benefit from improved teaching and learning approaches adopted by 
teachers in the targeted schools 
o Output 2.1: Increased capacity of teachers, principals and in- service advisors to use 
more effective teaching approaches and provide psychosocial support 
o Output 2.2: Increased community awareness on the importance of education and social 
cohesion 
• 
Outcome 3 (per Amended Agreement signed on 29 June 2020): Children benefit from a safe 
environment and quality education during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
o Output 3.1: Safe School Operations during and after the COVID-19 pandemic 
o Output 3.2: Increased capacity of teachers, principals and in-service advisors to provide 
needs-based education during the COVID-19 pandemic 
The Project aimed to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goal 4 and particularly: (i) target 
4.1 (Universal primary and secondary education); (ii) target 4.4 (Relevant skills for decent work); (iii) 
target 4.5 (Gender equality and inclusion); (iv) target 4.a (Effective learning environments) and. (v) 
target 4.c (Teachers and educators). 
PROJECT COMPONENTS 
The Project’s main components are summarised below. Components 1 to 3 were included in the 
initial Project Proposal and Components 4 and 5 were added in the 2020 Amendment Agreement in 
response of the COVID-pandemic and then in response to the 2022 economic crisis.

Northern Province to ensure continuous learning for children, including the most 
disadvantaged, amidst the ongoing economic crisis. 
 
GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE 
The primary target of the project was 13 schools in Kilinochchi Education Zone. Following the 
division of the Kilinochchi Education Zone into Kilinochchi North Education Zone and Kilinochchi 
South Education Zone, 5 project schools fell under the North Zone and 8 under the South Zone.

In addition, Zone and Province-wide activities have also been implemented. Teachers from non-
project schools took part in selected training activities. Additional schools benefited from some 
materials (learning material and health equipment and materials during the pandemic), support to 
students’ activities and from capacity building interventions for principals and SDC. Professional 
development activities targeting ADEs, ISAs and other education officials and communities have also 
benefited non-project schools. To this end, the KOICA project supported a Provincial Capacity 
Development Strategy, to which KOICA-funded interventions contributed to.  
IMPLEMENTATION MODALITIES 
The project has been managed by UNICEF Sri Lanka and implemented, in cooperation with the 
National and Provincial Ministry of Education and National Institute of Education, through: 
• 
Provincial and Zonal Education Authorities (needs assessment, project coordination, teacher 
training, liaison with schools, monitoring); 
• 
Provincial and Zonal Building Departments (coordination of the construction component, needs 
assessment, contractor selection, monitoring and compliance with MoE standards); 
• 
Zonal Health and Probation and Childcare Departments (involvement in community mobilisation 
component for WASH and nutrition and importance of education, involvement in activities 
related to COVID-19 response such as washing stations, safe school re-opening protocols, etc.); 
• 
Private contractors (particularly building contractors); 
• 
School Development Committees (SDCs), for the community mobilisation component; 

12 
• 
Selected Civil Society Organisations as implementing partners (reading habit and library 
component, community mobilisation component, teacher training activities, school-based 
activities, data collection and M&E). 
Key project indicators are in Annex 2. 
1.1.3 Project implementation context 
During the implementation of the KOICA Project there were many important contextual changes. 
The COVID-19 pandemic hit early 2020, leading to months of school closure for most students. There 
were attempts of re-opening schools for secondary school students in summer 2020, with mixed 
success, and primary schools remained closed. A gradual reopening of schools occurred from 
summer 2021, hindered by teacher strikes and the first signs of an economic crisis, which increased 
throughout the year and 2022, combined with fuel shortages and very high inflation rates and food 
price rises. Early 2022 was marked by an economic, social and political crisis, which led to more 
school closure and disruption. Schools gradually reopened from the June 2022 onwards.
