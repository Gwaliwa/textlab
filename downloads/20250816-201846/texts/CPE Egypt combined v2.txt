EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1. The Country Programme (CP) 2018 – 2022 of the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) in Egypt aims to support the efforts of the Government of Egypt (GoE) to promote 
the child’s rights and reduce inequalities in the child related indicators. To do so, the Country 
Office (CO) has focused its Programme on interventions that have proven potential benefit to 
the children in vulnerable situations. 
2. This report presents the findings of the final evaluation of UNICEF Egypt CP. It has been 
commissioned by UNICEF CO in Egypt and managed by UNICEF in the Middle East and 
North Africa Regional Office (MENARO) in close collaboration with UNICEF CO in Egypt. 
The partners of UNICEF from the GoE during this process are the Ministry of International 
Cooperation, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education (MoETE), the Ministry of 
Health and Population (MoHP), the Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoYS) the Ministry of 
Social Solidarity (MoSS) and the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM). 
This strategic evaluation complements the sectoral evaluations and studies carried out by 
UNICEF and external experts. 
Purpose of the evaluation  
3. The main purpose of this evaluation is for learning and accountability. It aims to produce 
an independent, objective and useful assessment of the CP achievements, to demonstrate 
accountability to the stakeholders, draw lessons learnt and provide recommendations. The 
specific objectives of the evaluation are the following: 
− Assess the coherence, relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the Programme; 
− Assess the contribution of the CP to upstream policy, strategy and other system level 
support towards contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG);   
− Document key factors that have facilitated or hindered the achievement of results;  
−  Assess the CP sustainability and its performance in reaching more children in vulnerable 
situations, 
− Document key Programme learnings as an alternative delivery modality;  
− Assess the extent the design and the interventions of the Country Programme 
Document (CPD) integrate cross cutting issues such as gender, youth, child rights, 
children with disability, equity and provide concrete recommendations to improve the 
design and relevance of the CP.  
Evaluation methodology

4. The evaluation was focused on high-level key questions which provide framing for more 
specific evaluation questions based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development and Development Assistance Committee criteria comprising coherence, 
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.   
5. The evaluation included assessment vis-à-vis other criteria comprising: Human Rights-
Based Approach (HRBA); equity; Gender Equality, and Empowerment of Women (GEEW).  
6. The evaluation complied with UNICEF-adapted United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) 
norms and standards including the UN System-Wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP)2. It used both 
quantitative and qualitative information and applied triangulation methods using systematic 
document review, quantitative data analysis, semi-structured online interviews. The 
participants of the Key Informant Interviews (KII) included UNICEF Management Team and 
specialists, Government officials, donors and implementing partners. 
Key Findings 
Coherence 
7. In 2017, UNICEF CO in Egypt designed a CPD 2018-2022 that was aligned with the 
Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) of the GoE. The CPD is also aligned with the 2018-
2022 Government Action Plan and other national sectoral strategies, aligned with many SDG 
as well as with the African Agenda 2063. It intended to achieve UNICEF Strategic Plan while 
making important contribution to the United Nations Partnership for Development Framework 
(UNPDF) outcomes. The CP was effective in supporting the Coronavirus Disease  
(COVID-19) response in timely manner as well as addressing issues faced by refugee and 
migrant children in Egypt.  
Relevance 
8. The CPD was developed using evidence-based data from Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) and other reliable data sources. The Programme intended results were highly relevant 
for enabling UNICEF to better align and respond to the GoE priorities, especially in regard to 
boys’ and girls’ needs. 
9. The initial result matrix of the CP was enriched during the implementation phase. However, 
the CP had not developed a complete a Theory of Change (ToC) for the CP.  
 
2 Upon expiry of the initial UN-SWAP duration, a second generation of the UN-SWAP was developed with widespread consultation across UN system entities and 
launched in 2018). https://gendercoordinationandmainstreaming.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/UN-SWAP%202.0%20Brochure%202021.pdf

Efficiency 
10. 
The budget utilization rate is about 87 per cent. The European Union (EU) is discussing 
with the GoE on its cooperation framework and is likely to decrease its financial support to 
UNICEF in the coming years. Consequently, UNICEF will potentially face a budget gap in the 
new CP as EU is one of its important donors. 
11. 
In the nutrition sector, a study on the cost-of-service delivery was carried out to help 
policy makers understand the potential benefits of scaling up key interventions and to identify 
and prioritize the most cost-effective package of interventions. Another cost-effective analysis 
was conducted on the Early Childhood Development (ECD) nursery model.  
Effectiveness 
12. 
Overall, the CP has good performance on effectiveness and the majority of outcomes and 
outputs are achieved or are likely to be achieved.  
13. 
The CP was successful in strengthening the Primary Health Care (PHC). It supported in 
timely manner the COVID-19 response of the GoE. In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic seems 
to be under control. However, given that the COVID -19 pandemic has already impacted 
households living in vulnerable situations and their children, the evaluation suggests that 
UNICEF continues to support the GoE in mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic. 
14. 
 UNICEF supported MoSS to extend the social protection programme, Takaful and 
Karama Programme (TKP) along with a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) 
system to address the high levels of poverty which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. 
UNICEF also supported the TKP in establishing a national parenting programme contributing 
to reduce the intergenerational poverty cycle. 
15. 
The CP is supporting the Education 2.0 reform program through mainstreaming the Life 
Skills and Education Citizenship Education (LSCE) framework, digitalization and 
mainstreaming the Community-Based Education (CBE). The National Plan of Action (NPA) 
of Ending Violence Against Children (EVAC) was finalized by a taskforce with UNICEF 
support. UNICEF continues its efforts for addressing Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). 
Furthermore, UNICEF supported NCCM and the National Council for Women (NCW) to 
launch the first National Girls’ Empowerment Initiative, Dawwie focusing on addressing the 
root causes of harmful practices in Egypt.

16. 
 In terms of gender mainstreaming, few gender analysis were conducted during the 
design of the CP. In addition, sex-disaggregated data were not reported systematically in the 
annual reports and, different services were not delivered for girls and boys except for Child 
Protection. Nevertheless, for the first time a gender transformative programme, Dawwie, has 
been launched by the GoE with technical and financial support of UNICEF.  
17. 
UNICEF has set functioning sectoral task forces. However, there are rooms of 
improvement regarding coordination mechanisms. For instance, cross sectoral activities were 
implemented at a relatively slow speed as each sector is focus on its own priorities.  
18. 
The following pilot models are promising, but given their nature and magnitude, such 
pilot interventions have not yet showcased enough results to positively influence impact 
indicators.   
− The ECD nursery pilot model is successful as it is based on a case investment study in ECD.  
− UNICEF also continues its advocacy with MoSS to institutionalize the case management 
system to protect children. This pilot case management system is part of the national alternative 
care strategy was informed by two gap assessments on foster/alternative care systems and two 
executive regulations introducing structural reforms to institutional childcare.   
− The Meshwary pilot project that trained adolescents and youth to become 
more economically and socially empowered is also a success. It has a potential to support key 
adolescent development outcomes and has gained endorsement from the Prime Minister. 
− The Dawwie program is expected to be expanded into a wider range of communities in order 
to combat harmful practices such as FGM, child marriage rooted in social norms. As the 
program has a great potential to positively influence impact indicators with a favorable echo 
especially in rural community, UNICEF is currently working to establish a partnership with 
the Haya Karima Presidential Initiative in coordination with NCW and United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) to scale up the Dawwie program.  
− The positive parenting programme model proved to be very much welcomed by the GoE 
and after being mainstreamed in the TKP is currently adopted by MoHP for the Primary Health 
Units and will be mainstreamed in all Haya Karima villages. 
Sustainability 
19. 
The CP has shown good sustainability and a substantive contribution to the development 
and improvement of the legal and policy framework in all focus areas of the CP. Evidence of 

Evaluation of Government of Egypt - UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation, 2018-2022 – Report 
 
 
xii 
sustainability should be more evident after the end of CP, but there are results across outcomes 
which are already showing good sustainability prospects. 
20. 
Support from UNICEF to the COVID-19 response and support to refugee children and 
migrant in learning opportunity are examples of humanitarian-development nexus. The 
frequency and complexity of humanitarian crises urge having a better risk-informed 
programming and stronger systems for prevention, response and early recovery and then, 
prevent being reactive in responding to emergency issues. The positive note is that UNICEF 
Egypt CO has already developed a strategic framework for emergency preparedness which 
explicitly connect shock responsive interventions and long-term development initiatives 
especially for communities living in vulnerable situations.  
Lessons Learned 
21. 
Lessons emerge from the issues highlighted in this evaluation could be capitalized. 
1) Looking through the COVID-19 window of opportunity for example in harnessing the 
power of technology for learning and training purpose and Real Time Monitoring (RTM); 
2) Well-functioning task-forces and other internal coordination mechanisms that UNICEF 
has successfully implemented have facilitated the progress toward results should continue 
and be strengthened 
3) Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, many external factors have facilitated the progress 
toward results such as legislative reforms and presidential initiatives 
4) Pilot models through UNICEF’s support were successful in such a short timeframe. 
Depending on budget availability some of those pilot initiatives should be continued and 
scaled up. 
Recommendations 
Recommendation 1: Improve the documentation of the CP by (a) developing a comprehensive 
ToC for the entire new CP; (b) setting up all baseline and target indicators and (c) develop 
strategic notes for Programme components.  To fill data gaps the office should conduct a 
evidence gap mapping exercise and plan for relevant research to fill these gaps.  
Recommendation 2: Strengthen the ability of UNICEF to leverage funds for children.  
Recommendation 3: Strengthen internal task forces and other coordination mechanisms to 
maximize the coherence and effectiveness of CO programming.  
Recommendation 4: Continue the effort in mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic 
through technical assistance and financial support and also support the GoE with systematic 
and long-term social and behavioral change programmes.
