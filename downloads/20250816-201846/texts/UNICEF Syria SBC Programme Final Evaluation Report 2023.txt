1. Executive Summary
BACKGROUND
As stipulated in the UNICEF Strategic Plan 
2022-2025 (E/ICEF/2021/25), there are several 
“change strategies” designed to accelerate 
medium-term results, and Social Behavior 
Change (SBC) and Community Engagement are 
considered one of those change strategies.  
SBC and CE are the means through which to 
contribute to positive social transformation and 
address challenges that cut across and go 
beyond sectoral programming.  The UNICEF 
Syria SBC programme started in 2015 mainly to 
respond to the polio outbreak and has evolved 
considerably over the years.  Currently, the 
UNICEF Syria Country Programme Document 
2022-2024 
(E/ICEF/2022/P/L.18) 
highlights 
how SBC is a social and behaviour change 
communication strategy that addresses the 
interrelated causes of social norms and 
practices that are harmful to children’s health, 
education, development and participation.”  
This report presents the formative evaluation of 
the SBC programme in the UNICEF Syria 
Country Office (CO).   
EVALUATION 
PURPOSE, 
OBJECTIVES, 
& 
SCOPE  
The purpose of the evaluation is to conduct an 
evaluation of UNICEF SBC programming 
focused on key strategic priorities (see below) 
for UNICEF Syria.  The evaluation is also 
designed to support: (1) oversight and 
accountability; 
and 
(2) 
organisational 
learning.   The objectives of the evaluation are 
to: 
1.
Review 
the 
design 
evolution 
and
achievements 
of 
UNICEF 
Syria 
SBC
programming by assessing the relevance,
effectiveness, and efficiency of specific
approaches, and materials, in particular
community 
engagement 
system, 
and
system strengthening;
2.
Assess the main enablers and drivers for
SBC in Syria as well as bottlenecks and
barriers for behaviour and attitudinal
changes at household and community
levels and identify recommendations for
programming approaches that are most
effective in this context;
3.
Identify 
opportunities 
for/adjustments
needed by programmes and corresponding
SBC material to support the achievement of
key results for children in alignment with the
UNICEF 
Syria 
Country 
Programme
Document 
2022-2024, 
Programme
Strategy 
Note 
Communication 
for
Development (C4D) 2022-2024 and UNICEF 
Middle East and North Africa SBC-CE
Regional 
Strategy 
and 
Programme
Guidance for 2022-2025, including an
assessment of the Results Framework (in
particular challenges of measurability and
attribution of results);
4.
Assess the common understanding of SBC
across 
UNICEF 
Syria 
programming,
including how UNICEF teams understand
and utilise SBC approaches to achieve
results and the added value of any
integrated approaches to date, with a view
to identifying areas of good practice and
scope for improvements; and
5.
As appropriate, provide real-time reflection
on any emergency SBC activities and
identify transferable learning and success
factors from recent responses.
The scope of the evaluation covers the 
period from 2018 to 2022 across the 14 
governorates in Syria and focuses on the 
following specific thematic areas:  
(1) Routine Immunisation (RI) of children;
(2) COVID-19 awareness and vaccination;

pg. 7 
 
(3) Cholera response; 
(4) Integrated SBC/WASH programming;  
(5) Child Protection;  
(6) Education; and  
(7) Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF).  
 
LIMITATIONS 
The evaluation’s key limitations include: 
• 
Limited perspectives from government 
stakeholders, as there have not been 
government partners who have engaged 
with SBC programming in a sustained way;  
• 
Staff absence and high staff turnover, 
which contributed to the lack of data 
regarding themes requiring institutional 
memory;   
• 
Skewed survey sample representing mainly 
women in spite of the intent to include half 
female and male; and 
• 
Limited 
data 
on 
partnerships 
which 
prevented a comprehensive analysis of the 
sub-question under KEQ #1.  
METHODOLOGY 
To understand how the achievement of the 
outputs contributes to behavioral objectives 
and, in turn, leads to corresponding outcomes, 
the evaluation is theory-based, using a 
theoretical framework as a guide.  In addition, 
the evaluation used a Process Evaluation 
approach to uncover the degree to which 
expected results have been achieved since 
2018.  The approach of utilisation-evaluation 
helped 
to 
generate 
forward-looking 
and 
actionable recommendations.  
The 
evaluation 
applied 
Organization 
for 
Economic 
Cooperation 
and 
Development/Development 
Assistance 
Committee 
evaluation 
criteria: 
relevance, 
effectiveness/impact, 
efficiency, 
coherence/coordination, and sustainability.  In 
addition to these criteria, the evaluation 
examined child rights, gender equality, and 
equity as separate standalone criteria. The 
evaluation used a mixed-method approach 
involving document review, interviews with 
duty bearers, and a survey and focus groups 
with rights holders.  Quantitative data were 
analysed using descriptive statistics, and 
thematic coding was used to analyse qualitative 
data. The findings from the qualitative and 
quantitative 
data 
analysis 
were 
thus 
triangulated by the source before concluding. 
The primary users of the evaluation are UNICEF 
and others interested in programming SBC in 
the Middle East and North Africa region.

FINDINGS 
RELEVANCE 
Since 2018, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme 
activities have been adapted to increase the 
effectiveness of multiple sectors within the CO 
programme, and as seen, SBC is endorsed 
institutionally from the strategic plan as well as 
the Country Programme Document.  The data 
confirms that the design(s) and implementation 
of UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities are 
adequately embedded into sectors at the 
strategic level, outlining exactly the role of SBC 
within 
UNICEF 
programming 
documents. 
Qualitative data from duty bearers and rights 
holders also shows positive perceptions about 
SBC activities. 
Moreover, stakeholder data indicates that there 
are clear steps undertaken to embed SBC into 
the sectors, including assessment, producing 
the 
Project 
Document 
(PD), 
coordinating 
activities, and collecting data for follow up.  
However, few documents have descriptions of 
operational models, staffing, resourcing, and 
partnerships involved in SBC programming in 
spite of conscientious steps to embed SBC 
activities 
in 
sector-specific 
programmes. 
There is subsequently mixed data regarding 
how SBC activities are carried out (linked 
to 
multiple 
interpretations 
about implementation).  For example, data 
indicates that there is no set schedule for 
SBC sessions, the duration of sessions varies, 
and there is uneven programme integration 
within the sectors. Such 
mixed 
data 
in 
SBC 
priorities 
and 
implementation 
created 
difficulties 
in 
identifying 
promising 
practices 
that 
reinforce 
programme relevance. 
EFFECTIVENESS/IMPACT 
The 
evaluation 
reviewed 
targets 
used 
to monitor progress from 2018 to 2022, and 
most indicators (six out of ten) included 
targets that were most likely used as 
management tools. A small 
number 
of 
indicators 
(three 
out 
of 
ten) remained 
relatively unchanged over the years.    
Another finding was that while the UNICEF 
Syria SBC 
programme 
has 
a 
Results 
Framework which 
includes 
qualitative 
indicators 
for expected knowledge and 
behaviour change for rights 
holders 
and 
duty 
bearers, 
these indicators are not 
used to track progress in a comprehensive 
manner.  Moreover, there is no Theory of 
Change (ToC) which connects SBC strategies 
to expected changes in knowledge, attitudes, 

pg. 9 
self-efficacy, and expected behaviour change.   
Nonetheless, not only would having a ToC 
better 
support 
the 
UNICEF 
Syria 
SBC 
programme’s future contribution to the CO’s 
programme portfolio, but a participatory 
process, involving the UNICEF sector staff in 
the development of the ToC, would support 
progress 
monitoring, 
management 
of 
expenditures, and evaluative efforts.   
Generally, the evaluation’s trend analyses 
from 2018 
to 
2022 
revealed 
that 
SBC 
programming 
has acquired strong gains in all sectors.  The 
results for each strategic priority are fully 
examined in the report, drawing from an 
analytical framework based on identified 
changes in rights holder’s: (1) knowledge about 
messages in a given sector; and (2) positive 
behaviours practiced as a result of engaging in 
programme activities.  The table below 
presents a short description of the overall 
results. 
SECTORS 
SBC’s CONTRIBUTIONS TO SECTOR RESULTS 
RI 
(including 
polio) 
There is some awareness about the need for RI, but polio ranks as the highest in 
increased awareness.
Knowledge: 
Behaviour 
change: 
SBC information and messages supported rightsholder’s decision-making regarding 
seeking RI for their child/ren. 100% of those sampled reported having immunised their 
child/ren. 
COVID-19 
prevention 
awareness 
and 
COVAX rollout 
Most (97%) of the evaluation sample had heard messages about COVID-19. 
Sixty-six percent (or 49 out of 74) of the evaluation sample had not been vaccinated 
against COVID-19. 
The response to COVID-19 and the rollout of COVAX is an excellent example of how the 
UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities were designed and implemented based on real-
time analyses of vaccine access, process, and supply. 
Cholera 
response 
Forty percent of sampled rights holders had heard about cholera from a health 
professional.   
Most (97%) of those surveyed who were aware of cholera understand the key ways to 
prevent it.   
SBC had a foundational role in UNICEF’s response to Syria’s cholera outbreak, which 
included engaging rights holders in awareness sessions about how to prevent cholera 
combined with the supply of water, soap, and hand sanitiser.   
WASH 
programming 
The programme ’s contributions to WASH could not be tracked due to limited data. 
Mine 
Risk 
Education-MRE  
The programme ’s contributions to MRE are inconclusive due to limited data. 
Back 
to 
Learning-BTL 
The report presents significant evidence about the extent to which the BTL raised 
awareness among caregivers about the importance of education.  However, the 
economic situation, child labour, and early marriage present significant barriers that 
prevent children from returning to school. 

pg. 10 
SECTORS 
SBC’s CONTRIBUTIONS TO SECTOR RESULTS 
IYCF 
The majority (73%) of rightsholders sampled know that a baby is exclusively 
breastfed for the first 6 months, (the correct answer), but approximately 17% do not 
have knowledge about breastfeeding, including its benefits.    
The majority (92%) of those surveyed “Strongly agreed” or “Agreed” with the statement 
“I used information (that I heard about breastfeeding) to decide to breastfeed my 
child/children”. 
UNICEF IYCF programme is a human rights-based programme and is relevant to the 
context of Syria.  However, the data is somewhat mixed about how much knowledge 
lactating mothers actually have about breastfeeding as a result of UNICEF SBC efforts. 
EFFICIENCY/COORDINATION 
There are two levels of funding which finance 
the overall UNICEF Syria SBC programme, 
including the programme effectiveness budget 
and inside each sector’s budget.  From 2018 to 
2022, the overall programme funding from both 
funding sources appears to be less predictable 
with strong annual fluctuations, especially in 
education, H&N, and WASH, thereby making 
planning (and budgeting) for longer-term SBC 
interventions very challenging.  Therefore, 
there ought to be a minimum amount of 
investment made available for SBC within each 
sector, when mobilising future funding from 
donors.   
Data indicated that there was also a continuum 
of staff perspectives about how well SBC is 
understood.   For example, on the one hand, 
there is a clear understanding of the role of the 
SBC Unit, the expertise that the unit brings to 
the sector’s work, and the need to monitor SBC’s 
efforts, 
separate 
from 
the 
sector’s 
achievements (although there is some overlap). 
On the other hand, however, there is a need for 
clarity in how the SBC and sectors’ activities 
ought to work together, and there are UNICEF 
staff member perceptions that some sector’s 
SBC budget should not be shared with the SBC 
Unit. In an SBC Unit meeting on 11 September 
2023, this theme was confirmed and also 
labeled a “blurred line” of operating.   
Moreover, apart from guidance, stakeholders 
recommended a form of basic training to 
address the conceptual and operational gaps 
identified, and that this training ought to be 
extended 
to 
UNICEF 
stakeholders, 
implementing 
partners, 
and 
government 
stakeholders. 
SUSTAINABILITY 
The UNICEF Syria SBC programme is already 
programmatically and financially integrated 
into the CO Programme portfolio, which in turn, 
enhances 
its 
operational 
sustainability. 
However, one main factor which ought to be in 
place to ensure programme sustainability is the 
resolution or reduction of the “blurred lines” 
between SBC and the sectors (Finding noted 
above). 
RIGHTS, GENDER EQUALITY, & EQUITY 
This report has also presented how SBC 
messages 
and 
activities 
addressed 
the 
challenges of those marginalised and the most 
vulnerable. The programme design has logic 
which fully considers child rights, gender 
equality, 
and 
equity 
concerns; 
The 
implementation of the COVID-19 and cholera 
responses and other programmes (i.e., BTL and 
IYCF) are just a few examples demonstrating 
the extent to which SBC has made positive 
contributions to specific vulnerable groups, 

pg. 11 
 
such as out of school children (BTL), pregnant 
and lactating women. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Three recommendations are presented in this report. 
RECOMMENDATION #1:  To broaden synchronised participation and clarify the different roles that each 
staff member needs to play within each programme to achieve synergies, it is recommended for the 
UNICEF Syria SBC Section to: a)  Provide training to increase understanding about SBC for sector-
level stakeholders and to support operations; b) Engage in a process of co-creating guidelines with 
a focus on sharing resources for SBC programming; and c) Develop a detailed articulation for how 
SBC programming specifically contributes to each sector’s results, thereby reinforcing the 
programme’s validity and added value to the CO programme portfolio.   
RECOMMENDATION #2:  The UNICEF Syria SBC Section should contract a research institution or firm to 
undertake broader FGDs with implementing partners to: a) Outline the current inconsistencies in 
implementation; and b) Determine the critical levels of human and financial resources required to 
deliver systematic approaches over the long-term. 
RECOMMENDATION #3:  The UNICEF Syria SBC Section should co-create the development of a multi-
sectoral ToC that includes: a) SBC Strategies; b) Outcome statements for each sector; and c) A list 
of indicators, linked to and aligned with guidance issued by UNICEF HQ, that could be used to 
measure the above and ensure regular follow up.
