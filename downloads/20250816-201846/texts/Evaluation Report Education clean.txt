EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This evaluation report is developed by the evaluation team (ET) of Junction Bulgaria at the reporting 
phase of the ‘Evaluation of UNICEF’s support to the education sector’, commissioned by UNICEF 
Ukraine. The aim of this report is to present the object, purpose, and scope of this formative 
evaluation (FE), the methodology (with details like evaluation matrix, criteria for sampling and 
interviewees) and data collection instruments that will be used, main findings, conclusions, lessons 
learned and recommendations. 
1.1. 
OBJECT, OBJECTIVES, PURPOSE AND PRIMARY USERS 
The object of this FE is UNICEF’s support to the Education Sector, outlined in the CPD 2018-2022. The 
programme component consolidates the innovations introduced in education settings as part of the 
humanitarian response in Eastern Ukraine, with a view to progressively shifting from supply-driven to 
quality-oriented interventions for the improvement of learning outcomes. UNICEF’s goal is to assist 
the government in shaping school curricula towards competency-based approaches and foster 
education opportunities that are more inclusive for vulnerable children. The key directions of UNICEF 
Education programme are: support to providing increased access to quality inclusive pre-primary 
education for disadvantaged children aged 3-6 years old, especially in rural areas; support to providing 
quality, competency-based primary and secondary education for children and adolescents aged 6-18 
years old and ensure inclusive, violence-free learning environment for all with special focus on 
children with disabilities; support to the completion of a full cycle of compulsory inclusive education 
for all children and adolescents, especially the most disadvantaged and those in conflict-affected 
areas, including their timely enrolment in grade 1; support to engagement and skills building so that 
adolescents and youth have skills and competencies to be adequately prepared for adult life as active 
citizens and for the world of work. 
The budget of the programme is 7 800 000 $, including regular resources (800 000 $) and other 
resources (7 000 000 $). It is expected that the period of implementation of the programme will be 
until 2022. The programme has a national scope in the whole territory of Ukraine. The stakeholders 
involved as major partners in the implementation are Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), 
World Bank, European Union (EU), subnational authorities, civil society organisations (CSOs), local 
community groups. 
The reconstructed ToC of the Education programme identifies the expected outcome that the 
intervention is seeking and the ways in which the interventions are expected to lead to the outcome. 
It includes major bottlenecks, UNICEF Core roles and contributions, risks and assumptions, outputs, 
and outcome. The major bottlenecks are: barriers to quality education for all, which results in 
inadequate skills in all domains; many children with disabilities appear marginalized from mainstream 
education; access to quality early learning remains problematic, particularly in rural areas; alarming 
gaps in access and results in education between rural and otherwise underprivileged children and 
those with high socioeconomic status; disruption of education for internally displaced children and 
children in conflict areas. The main areas of UNICEF contribution are: strengthening capacity of 
preschool, school staff and local educators on safe and inclusive educational environment; supporting 
evidence-based national policy and programming on quality preschool and inclusive education; 
strengthening the capacity of the education system to provide a violence-free and protective learning 
environment; improving the physical safety and rehabilitation of the education facilities and adjusting 
them to child-friendly and quality standards; increasing civic engagement and participation of 
adolescents and youth, strengthening their resilience and supporting youth engagement. These 
interventions are realised as a part of UNICEF’s core roles: advocacy, policy dialogue and advice, 
knowledge generation and child rights monitoring, capacity development of government and civil 
society, modelling, and testing innovations. 

10 
The main purpose of the evaluation is to generate substantive evidence-based knowledge by 
identifying good practices and lessons learned from the impact of Education Programme 
implementation in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and in fulfilment of the right to 
education. 
The main objectives of the FE are accountability and organizational learning in the field of education 
sector development for the primary purpose of improving UNICEF’s Education programme and 
fulfilment of the right to education of all children: in terms of accountability, the evaluation will 
independently assess overall progress towards intended outcomes, and, where possible, seek 
indications of possible effects on the most vulnerable groups of children (incl. children living in the 
rural area, children with disabilities, conflict affected children, internally displaced persons etc.), as 
well as serve for an indicative analysis of UNICEF’s added value to the education sector reform; in 
terms of organizational learning, the purpose of this evaluation is to identify, and document good 
practices and lessons learned from the implementation of the Education programme, inform decision-
making on scaling up the different approaches adopted during the implementation and review existing 
strategies. 
This evaluation will inform the relevant stakeholders up to what degree the planned outcome was 
achieved, in order to understand what works and what doesn’t work and will inform UNICEF on how 
to improve its endeavours to support the on-going reform in the educational sector and ensure the 
right to education of all children is fulfilled. The primary users of the evaluation are: UNICEF Country 
Office, Monitoring & Evaluation unit, Education Cluster, national and oblast level authorities, local 
authorities, partner non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other CSOs, donors and other 
development partners. 
The scope of the evaluation is the time period: 2018-2020, locations: Kyiv city, Kharkiv city, Kharkiv 
oblast, Donetsk oblast (government-controlled area (GCA)), Luhansk oblast (GCA). The population 
groups that are covered are: children at an early age, children with disabilities, children at a school 
age and adolescents, conflict-affected children, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), teachers and 
principals, parents and professionals, national stakeholders, and partner organisations. The data 
collection focuses on Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, since the initial review showed that in Kharkiv city 
and oblast there are no interventions for the period of evaluation. 
1.2. 
METHODOLOGY 
The conceptual framework includes the basic concepts and definitions, taken into account in UNICEF’s 
programme and used in the formulation of goals and tasks and design of interventions, development 
of the evaluation matrix, ToC and conduction of the evaluation. The basic concepts are inclusive 
education, child-friendly school, pedagogy of partnership, leave no one behind agenda, UN 
Humanitarian and development nexus. 
The evaluation criteria, used in this evaluation, are based on the updated standards of Development 
Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Assistance and Development (OECD-DAC), 
covering relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability, other criteria, 
cross-cutting issues, and humanitarian-development nexus (HDN). The goal is to understand the 
extent to which the programme is relevant and coherent to the needs and policies, achieves the 
planned outcomes at a low cost, ensures impact and sustainability. The key evaluation questions and 
sub-questions have been elaborated in an evaluation matrix. A set of indicators has been suggested, 
based on available information in the CPD, key evaluation questions, areas of evaluation and the 
specifics of the FE. 
The methods that have been used for data collection in this FE include, firstly, desk review of the 
following topics and groups of documents: general information on Education reform; information on 
Education Cluster with data; information and data concerning education in Eastern Ukraine; 
information mapping of all education sector interventions; information on COVID-19 impact in 

11 
education; research/studies supported by the Education Section; programme documents and report 
of Implementing Partners (IPs) and list of Program Documents (PDs) and reports. The second method 
is secondary data analysis, based on publicly available or provided data from the State Statistics 
Service of Ukraine, PISA datasets, UNICEF provided data, the Institute for education development, 
TransMonEE Database, Institute for Educational Analytics Ukraine, etc. Other methods used are in-
depth interviews (IDIs), focus groups discussion (FGDs) and observations. The total number of 
participants in IDIs and FGDs is 72 and there have been 9 observations conducted. The last method 
used is online surveys with students. 307 children from 20 schools participated in the survey, in a ratio 
corresponding to the ratio of schools for the three outputs. 
The methods for data analysis include recording, transcribing, translating, and coding the IDIs and 
FGDs in the NVivo software for processing qualitative information by extracting coding categories and 
generating coding trees. The quantitative data from the surveys has been analysed via SPSS using 
statistical methods. 
The human rights-based approach has been used as a cross-cutting approach to conduct the formative 
evaluation and understand the main features of the program. The evaluation focuses on equity and 
human rights aspects and is appropriate for analysing the gender equality, human rights issues, 
including child rights issues identified in the scope. The ET complies with ethical considerations, such 
as UNICEF's guidance on children in research, to avoid any form of stigma, discrimination or harm to 
children and all participants in research. It was ensured that the research complies with the UNICEF 
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis as well as Norms 
and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), integrating human rights, gender, and 
equity in accordance with the relevant UNEG guidelines (by including girls and boys/men and women 
equally in the research, as well as all vulnerable groups of children and their parents, following the 
UNEG norms in data collection and analysis, etc.). It should be pointed out that no conflicts of interest 
have been identified in this FE. An External Ethical committee has been established and it has 
consequently approved the ethical considerations in the data collection process in all of the 
components. 
Different issues and limitations have been identified, which have not affected the planned 
methodology and instruments for data collection and analysis, since mitigation strategies have been 
applied in order to follow the preliminary planned workplan. The data collection was conducted in the 
period May-August 2021. 
1.3. 
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
The relevance of UNICEF’s support to the Education Sector is analysed in view of the country’s needs, 
programs and policies, upstream and downstream interventions, UNICEF’s strategic plans, as well as 
the needs of children and parents, vulnerable groups in particular. The relevance is influenced by the 
contextual factors and situation in the country, related to the protracted armed conflict in Eastern 
Ukraine, political changes in 2019, as well as the recent COVID - 19 pandemic, all of which affect 
children’s rights and education in particular. UNICEF’s approach was adapted to the new emerging 
needs, but at the same time, the focus and effort to achieve the planned goals was kept. The 
interventions have been implemented at a national and regional level (in Donetsk and Luhansk 
oblasts) with a balance between upstream and downstream interventions. UNICEF has concentrated 
its efforts, where there is a combination of more than one factor of vulnerability, so the situation in 
the schools in these oblasts is difficult and they have a variety of needs, starting from renovations, 
material support and repairs and meeting current challenges related to the conflict to new models of 
working with children in relation to inclusive education and work with parents. The education 
component in the CPD is moderately relevant to the country needs, programmes, and policies, 
because the national reform and UNICEF Education programme have similar goals. However, UNICEF 
concentrates its efforts to vulnerable groups of children, while the national reform is wider in scope. 
Also, the correspondence between the national and UNICEF priorities is a bit questionable since there 

12 
is no formal mechanism to ensure alignment and sometimes communication is lacking. The level of 
internal consistency of the education component to the other goals and priorities of UNICEF is 
moderate. This component is based on outputs and outcomes in education that are a part of the 
Concept note and CPD but are not included in a separate Education programme document. 
Additionally, the education outcome is consistent with the other outcomes, but the outputs are 
redefined in the process of their realisation. Also, there is no specific ToC developed for education. 
The ratio between upstream and downstream interventions shows that most of them are in the 
‘middle ground’ and this provides an opportunity to affect a bigger number of right holders but is 
rather related to applying interventions than change in the policy context. There is a high level of 
relevance to the needs of children. When it comes to the schools, UNICEF’s contribution is relevant, 
but there is a risk of focusing too much on meeting the basic needs of the school system and ensuring 
a safe environment for children instead of securing access to inclusive and quality school education. 
UNICEF’s approach towards coherence includes working with 22 partner organisations, which have 
realised different project, mostly in conflict-affected areas in youth policy and material support. Their 
efforts seem to be complementary, although there is no coordination mechanism for it. The role of 
coordinator is of UNICEF that also sets the framework, in which these organisations would plan and 
realise their projects. The complementarity of efforts and avoiding overlap in the different areas is 
most clearly seen in education in emergencies, where there is a Ukraine Education Cluster. The 
conclusions are related to a moderate level of complementarity of efforts of different organisations, 
involved in implementation of activities, could be determined. It comes from, on the one hand, 
coordination between many different organisations, which has to be achieved without an internal 
mechanism for exchange of information. Additionally, there is a low level of participation of IPs in the 
decision-making about priorities and activities. It should be noted that there is an Education Cluster, 
which ensures coordination of the efforts in the area of humanitarian response. The complementarity 
between the different programs of UNICEF seems visible between social policy, health, and education, 
but with different dimensions. In child protection, it seems planned theoretically, but not always 
totally realised in practice, while in the health sector, it is realised in practice, but not so much planned 
in theory. 
The Education programme aims to improve the access of all children to quality education, with a focus 
on the most vulnerable. The achievement of this goal would mean there is an effectiveness of 
interventions. In order to achieve this aim, interventions in four main areas have been realised, related 
to: pre-school education, inclusive education, safe and violence-free school environment, 
competency-based learning, support for conflict-affected areas and youth policy. The achievement of 
the results is ensured by a complex systematic approach on behalf of UNICEF, including policy advice, 
technical assistance and data collection and management support, advocacy strategies and 
communication, as well as building capacity and modelling of interventions at the local level at the 
schools. Different enabling factors and bottlenecks were identified in the process of achievement of 
the planned outputs and outcome. They are mostly related to the consequences of COVID-19 and the 
development of the educational reform itself, as well as the challenges in the rural and conflict-
affected areas. The produced changes are most definitive in the fields of ensuring a safe environment, 
development of skills of teachers, students and parents, peer-to-peer mediation, and support, while 
in the fields of inclusive education and participation, they are in an initial phase of their development. 
The evaluation has found that, for the period 2018-2020, a different number of children, teachers and 
parents have been reached in the four outputs of the programme component. There is a difficulty in 
defining the level of achievement, due to encountering different data in different sources. Overall, in 
spite of this inconsistency, data shows that there is a progress in achieving the outputs. A serious 
attention needs to be paid to the tendency for achievement of the indicators of the outcome. The 
data shows that there is no change in relation to enrolment of children in primary education. Also, it 
is demonstrated from the data that the topic of out-of-school children is in an initial phase of 
discussion and planning. Young people are still not highly engaged in planning and realisation of all
