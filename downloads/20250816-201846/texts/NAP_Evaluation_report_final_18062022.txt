1. Executive summary 
This is the final report of the Evaluation of the National Plan of Action for Realization of Children’s rights 
in Turkmenistan for 2018-2022 (NAP) and UNICEF’s contribution to its design, implementation and 
monitoring. The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Country Office (CO) Turkmenistan to 
Dessislava Ilieva, individual international consultant based in Bulgaria. The evaluation was undertaken 
between Jul - Dec 2021. 
The objects of this evaluation are: 
• 
The National Plan of Action for Realization of Children’s rights in Turkmenistan for 2018-2022 
(NAP), with a Road Map for Its implementation and Indicator’s Framework.  
• 
UNICEF’s contribution to the design, implementation and monitoring of the NAP 
• 
Impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on the implementation of NAP 
• 
Contribution of the NAP to the implementation of SDGs. 
The NAP is based on the principles and provisions of the Constitution of Turkmenistan, Law of 
Turkmenistan on ‘State Guarantees of the Rights of the Child’ and other international agreements in the 
interest of children, to which Turkmenistan is a party. The NAP was adopted in 2015 and has been 
instrumental in implementing the majority of the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC). The Plan identifies key areas of state social policy in the interests of children based on the 
principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
The Government of Turkmenistan (GoT) is committed to advancing the 2030 Agenda, adopted the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2016 and has been working on integration of SDG targets and 
indicators into national programmes and plans of actions, including the NAP, as well as on design of an 
SDG monitoring system with technical assistance from the United Nations (UN).  
The NAP is significant in terms of bringing together the effort of UNICEF, national partners, other UN 
agencies and public organisations in delivering towards children’s rights. This is the first ever such a 
comprehensive and multi-lateral effort to ensure rights of the children of Turkmenistan and a 
comprehensive strategic document that is endorsed at the highest political level. 
 
The main purpose of the evaluation is to: 
• 
Generate substantive evidence-based knowledge by identifying good practices and lessons learned 
from the implementation of NAP.  
• 
Give adjustment necessary for the planning and implementation of support under the current UNICEF 
CPD 2021-2025 and a basis for the development of the new NAP 2023-2028. 
• 
Strengthening UNICEF contribution to the realization of child rights and protection of children’s 
access to quality services.  
The timing of the evaluation is critical as the new Country Programme of Cooperation with the UN and 
UNICEF was signed in 2020, current NAP will be completed in 2022 and the development of a new NAP 
2023-2025 will be started this year. Thus, the evaluation will help to shape the programming and 
policymaking in child-rights, including main elements of cooperation with UNICEF. 
 
Evaluation methodology 
The evaluation has both summative and formative dimensions and uses mixed-methods. The evaluation 
was guided by the participatory approach as it engaged all key stakeholders during all stages of the 
evaluation. The NAP result-framework is organised around children’s rights as per the UN Convention of 
the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The evaluation was performed along OECD DAC evaluation criteria: 
Relevance – The extent to which NAP is relevant to the context and needs of children and families. 
Effectiveness - The extent to which the NAP achieved its set goals. The objectives under each NAP 
priority area were used to measure progress. The evaluation also analysed NAP contribution to SDGs. 
Sustainability: The extent to which the achieved outcomes for children are likely to sustain after the 
programme period. 
The evaluation methodology involved a set of data collection methods (desk review, key informants 
interviews and focus group discussions) and analytical methods (stakeholders’ analysis, qualitative and 
content analysis).

Desk research: The desk research was based on the available sources of secondary information concerning 
children’s right interventions and gaps, data on achievements towards SDGs, available national data, 
evaluations, monitoring data collected, etc.  
Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) and Focus group discussions (FGDs): The data collection was 
conducted in the period 10 Oct – 31 Dec 2021. It comprised online interviews. The evaluator conducted 19 
interviews with key informants, individually and in a group. Data collection on velayat level was supported 
by 8 Young SDG ambassadors after receiving an ethical training by the consultant. The SDGs 
Ambassadors conducted 18 FGDs with children and parents. 
 
Key findings 
Relevance 
The context of planning of the NAP is that of modernising the care systems in Turkmenistan following the 
country’s independence, the ratification of the UNCRC in 1991 and other international human rights 
conventions and protocols. The state introduced a number of national programmes and regulative 
frameworks relevant to children’s rights regarding health, education, family upbringing, social support, 
protection of the child from economic exploitation, etc. Some targeted children specifically (e.g. Law of 
Turkmenistan on Promotion and Support to Breastfeeding, 2016; the law on State Guarantees of the Rights 
of the Child, 2014, National Programme of Turkmenistan on early development and preparation of children 
to school for 2011-2015, etc.). The NAP was approved by the Decree of the President of Turkmenistan of 
22.06.2018. The Plan was elaborated considering the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights 
of a Child (2015), with the participation of respective ministries and agencies, institutions and public 
organizations of Turkmenistan, together with the UNICEF CO in Turkmenistan. 
The evaluation did not identify government-led comprehensive needs assessments of children groups and 
their families, national programmes’ evaluation reports or impact assessments of legislation or policies that 
may have informed the design of the NAP. It had been informed by situational analysis conducted by 
UNICEF in 2019.  
The process of planning the NAP has employed a mixed approach to defining goals and objectives. On the 
one hand the planning was based on the rights of the children generally (benefitting all children), and on 
the other hand a focus was placed on certain groups in terms of vulnerability.  
The NAP is equipped with a results framework but it was formulated as insufficiently specific, measurable 
and realistic. Furthermore, the NAP has a wide strategic focus against a limited timeframe i.e. 5 years.  
The NAP is generally aligned to the strategic priorities of child-rights’ national strategies as well as 
strategic priorities identified in UN recommendations. The design of the NAP is moderately relevant to the 
needs of the children as it is oriented to all children but some vulnerable groups identified by the 
preliminary analysis as priority were not covered by the NAP on the level of objectives. 
 
Effectiveness 
The NAP priorities are organised under six goals areas with 36 objectives under these goals. An overall 
strategic goal is missing. There has been considerable progress in establishing an enabling environment for 
realising children’s rights in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan has built on previous effort for ensuring an 
environment for realization of human rights and child’s rights in the country in the area of human rights 
protection, gender equality, protection of women’s, children’s rights and rights of people with disability, 
youth policy, implementation of international conventions in the area of human rights protection. 
Turkmenistan made some progress in improving children’s health and contributing to the targets on 
children’s health such as high immunisation rates (achieved with UNICEF support), access to clean water, 
reduction of malnutrition. There is significant progress in reducing stunting and development of young 
children. Further effort is required to reduce mortality rates and prevalence of anaemia as well as enabling 
better access of children with disabilities to specialised healthcare.  
There is progress towards schools becoming more child-friendly, mostly in the area of early education for 
children. These efforts have produced a notable increase of the children attending pre-school and pre-
primary school but coverage is still insufficient. There is a conducive environment for increasing placement 
of children with special educational needs in boarding schools, often away from their families. Whilst such 
placement serve good educational purpose, it poses some limitations in exercising the child’s right to live 
with its family, especially for children with disabilities.

            ix                                              
 
There is no conclusive evidence that NAP interventions have contributed to better employment rates and 
living standards of families. For the most vulnerable children and their families, support is still insufficient, 
in particular single parents or parents with disabilities. Disability is a significant factor on the family 
income as well as in terms of social inclusion. Among the most significant changes during the NAP 
implementation has been the introduction of a modern concept of social services in the community and 
introducing the profession of social worker. This is an achievement of a number of programmes and 
interventions of which the NAP, being a national strategic child’s-rights document, is overarching. This has 
contributed to a more enabling environment for family-support programmes in the community and is a 
ground for developments in other areas e.g. child protection and child justice. 
An important step is the introduction of a specialised approach to children in contact with the law. 
Turkmenistan justice provides some essential elements of a child justice system in line with international 
standards. This needs to be built on by shifting the system orientation from ‘correction’ to ‘resocialization’ 
and ensue that interventions are based on interdisciplinary assessments which respond to the needs of each 
child, including psychological and emotional needs. The concept of coordination for effective governance 
of child protection and child justice is present but requires coordination mechanism for oversight of 
children’s rights to be operationalised, including by describing the functions of agencies and law 
enforcement bodies in terms of joint working and reporting. 
Child-centred systems are still in the process of understanding what child participation is. Turkmenistan 
has made the most progress regarding protecting the child's right to participation and the least progress in 
creating space for actual participation. 
In terms of COVID it should be noted that although some NAP interventions had to be readjusted, the 
government put efforts to ensure the overall implementation of the NAP. Importantly, with support of UN 
agencies, GoT did manage to sustain all essential health and education services in the country without 
interruption. 
 
Sustainability 
The NAP ensured high level of sustainability of child’s rights mechanisms specifically in terms of 
establishing the Ombudsman’s office.  
NAP is fully aligned with the SDGs which demonstrates the high Government commitments towards 
Sustainable Development Agenda. Data collection for children is strengthened in a sustainable way with 
UNICEF and UN sister agencies. UNICEF has contributed significantly through raising the country’s 
capacity to collect data on children. However, the culture to develop policies and services based on strong 
detailed specific and measurable results frameworks according to the principles of strategic planning is not 
yet fully in place. 
Universal inclusive services for young children are in place but their scaling up and full coverage depends 
on human resources investment and upgrading the capacity of education and healthcare. There is potential 
for sustaining the achievements in the child protection system, including child justice. General and 
specialised community-based support have a good replicable potential. The GoT has shown a commitment 
to updating its legislative and regulatory regimes in favour of children’s rights, including in the area of 
child protection and child justice. New laws on the treatment of victims of crime and defining the social 
work function show important momentum in this area. To remain on this promising course of action it 
requires the conceptualization of a robust child justice system capable of realizing the full rights for all 
children who come into contact with the justice system, whether as victims, witnesses, accused of a crime, 
or in a civil or administrative proceeding. 
 
Conclusions 
In terms of relevance to the context, the NAP is generally aligned to the strategic priorities of child-rights’ 
national strategies as well as international strategic priorities identified in UN recommendations. In terms 
of needs, there is moderate alignment between the needs addressed by the NAP and needs identified by 
CRC recommendations and situational analyses. The internal causal links between goals, objectives and 
interventions are mostly implicit. The result-framework is designed to capture outcomes for children 
mainly on the level of activities and needs to be strengthened to include more comprehensive and valid 
indicators on the level of goals and objectives. 
In terms of effectiveness there has been considerable progress in establishing an enabling environment for 
realising children’s rights as well as independent guarding of children’s rights e.g. establishing the

Ombudsman body. However, establishing permanent interagency body monitoring children’s rights in 
every sector has not yet been achieved.  
Significant progress was made in terms of data collection e.g. State Committee of Statistics of 
Turkmenistan has been instrumental in collecting data for MICS 2019 and the country completed a 
voluntary review on the achievement of SDGs. Yet there are still gaps in terms of data collection coverage 
and data accessibility e.g. disaggregated data on children in conflict with the law and child victims and 
witnesses of crime collected and shared systematically would greatly improve the planning of targeted 
response to children in need.  
Healthcare has improved in a number of areas e.g. immunisation, breastfeeding, nutrition, early childhood 
development, maternal mortality, etc. There is room for development in terms of accelerating the reduction 
of child mortality and further building on the existing achievements in the area of specialised care for 
children with disabilities. There is progress towards schooling becoming more child-friendly, mostly in the 
area of early education for children. However, there is a conducive environment for increasing placement 
of children with special educational needs in boarding schools, which prevents social inclusion being 
achieved for children with disabilities. Possible factors, among others, are social norms of parents, 
specialised skills in working with children with disability being more available in special schools vs. 
mainstream schools, community-based services for families of children with disabilities still not being 
widely available. Feedback from parents indicates that disability may be a great factor on the family 
income as well as on the level of social inclusion of children. The extent of this vulnerability requires 
further studies.  
Introducing the concept of social work and community-based services is one of the most significant 
changes during NAP implementation. Family separations are on the increase hence gaps are wider for 
families who face difficulties in taking care of their children and there is a risk of children being separated. 
Main factors are: underdeveloped network of family-support services to address difficult life situations, 
lack of reintegration services, and underdeveloped inclusive education combined with the lack of services 
for disabled children. Turkmenistan has made progress mostly in terms of creating a more enabling 
environment for family-support programmes. Components of a child-friendly justice system are in place 
and provide good ground for modernising the child justice system towards shifting from “correction” to 
“socialisation”; improving the coordination among law enforcement and child protection entities; 
developing effective prevention and response programmes based on all needs of children in contact with 
the law and children victims or witness of violence.    
In terms of sustainability there has been development towards child’s rights mechanisms e.g. establishing 
the Ombudsman’s office. Further promotion of child-friendly complaint mechanisms would strengthen the 
position of the Ombudsman as a voice for children’s rights. Child’s rights monitoring can be sustained by 
fostering data-driven decision-making culture and by introducing strong monitoring and evaluation results-
frameworks that allow for measuring progress for children in accordance with the principles of strategic 
planning. 
 
Lessons learned 
It is vital to support child-rights legislation along with developing other enabling factors. Legislation 
alone is not a guarantee that these rights will be automatically exercised without also addressing social 
norms and professional norms, capacity building of the systems around the child (healthcare, education, 
child protection and justice). 
High quality data is essential for priority setting, monitoring and achieving results. Continuous 
monitoring of children’s rights across all areas ensures timely identification and development of 
interventions addressing the most urgent bottlenecks. 
Children’s needs are complex needs and cannot be addressed by each sector separately or on its own. An 
integrated approach should be fostered when designing new services and, therefore, capacities of all child-
relevant systems need to be addressed simultaneously: education, health, child protection and justice. 
Importance of focusing on a limited number of priorities. Achieving strategic and long lasting impact is 
challenging if NAP pursues multiple and too broad goals, and is spread too thin. Within the limited 
timeframe of the NAP long-term vision and one strategic goal need to guide and steer the NAP. 
Strong partnerships and collaboration are essential to achieving strategic results. The nature of 
development challenges faced by Turkmenistan require extensive collaboration with various partners,

Public associations can be an indispensable partner to the GoT to assume the provision of services to 
children and families because they are closest to the communities and their needs. Social contracting 
legislation may boost nation-wide service providers as currently they largely depend on insecure own 
funding. 
Child participation is a clear principle to understand, yet, very difficult to operationalise. Decision-
makers should operationalise participation horizontally i.e. across various child-related areas e.g. when 
developing community-based social services, making schools more child-friendly, improving access to 
specialised healthcare for children with disabilities, etc. 
Recommendations 
Next NAP needs to preserve its comprehensive approach to children’s rights. At the same time, a vision of 
change, one overarching strategic goal of the NAP and a detailed Theory of change should be developed 
along with a high-quality result-framework with SMART objectives. ToCs development should become a 
truly analytical and participatory exercise engaging multiple stakeholders. 
The voice of children would be stronger in Turkmenistan if a permanent interagency body specifically 
coordinating the work of all agencies relevant to children’s rights. It could be established as a separate body 
or a specialised structure specifically responsible for children’s rights within existing human rights bodies 
such as ombudsman or Inter-agency commission.1  
The efforts in healthcare need to build on the work of the current NAP by extending access to specialised 
care for some groups of children (e.g. children with disabilities, especially in remote areas) as well as 
furthering the effort to reduce child mortality. Nutrition was reflected in the current NAP but there are still 
some gaps (e.g. reasons for anaemia prevalence) requiring further analysis to inform next NAP cycle. Next 
NAP needs to further address system changes that enable children with disabilities have better access to 
specialised healthcare and rehabilitation services close to their community. Early childhood development 
services need to be further developed and scaled up.  
Rehabilitation services for children with disabilities at school age, too, need to be designed in a way that 
meet their educational needs to enable their participation in mainstream school and prevent their placement 
in a boarding school away from their families. 
Any family-support services and child protection services (including child justice) need to be based on the 
concept of case management, which is currently being introduced in the country. The efforts towards 
creating the legislative environment for that as well as improving and expanding the workforce needs to be 
extended in the next NAP cycle. 
Next NAP should place bigger emphasis on inclusive education i.e. mainstreaming inclusiveness in the 
meaning that any school is able to respond to the needs of every child, including children with special 
needs. Social and professional norms need to be addressed through campaigning and promoting the right of 
the children to receive quality education and live in its family at the same time. 
Next NAP needs to extend its emerging good practices in child protection into the next period of planning. 
Building on the models for community-based services for children and families within JP, next NAP needs 
to address the need to scale these up. Service quality standards need to be elaborated in a way to include 
mechanisms for participation of children as one of the underlying quality principles. 
Follow-up child justice reforms need to consider strengthening the child justice legislative environment in a 
way that ensures that rights of children in contact with the law are protected at all stages. Consideration 
needs to be made to strengthening interagency coordination in the area of child justice; enhancing 
prevention (comprehensive juvenile delinquency measures based on assessed risk factors) and response 
(well-coordinated community-based child support programmes enhanced with professionally trained 
workforce and developed on data-based pillars). 
Data collection should be strengthened across all sectors of child well-being i.e. education, health, social 
protection and justice.  
It is vital that NAP encourages public associations of parents’ groups and grassroots organisations to be 
involved in provision of services through more enabling legislation and funding.

2. Background 
This is the final report of the Evaluation of the National Plan of Action for Realization of Children’s 
rights in Turkmenistan for 2018-2022 (NAP) and UNICEF’s contribution to its design, implementation 
and monitoring. It was developed after conducting an external evaluation commissioned by UNICEF 
Country Office (CO) Turkmenistan. The evaluation was undertaken between July 2021 to April 2022. 
 
This section lays out the broader context in which the intervention was planned and implemented, 
including a brief introduction to the regional context in which the interventions under evaluation took 
place.  
 
The National Action Plan (NAP) on Children’s rights was approved in 2018 and has been instrumental in 
implementing the majority of the recommendations. The Plan identifies key areas of the state social 
policy in the interests of children based on the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, to which Turkmenistan is a party.  
All goals and objectives included in the NAP on Children’s rights are aimed at the realization of rights 
and social safeguards for children, implementation of which requires an integrated approach, coordination 
and cooperation of state bodies and public associations.  The aim, objectives, policies and indicators set 
forth in the NAP on Children’s rights, represent an integrated ‘roadmap’ aiming at the implementation of 
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by Turkmenistan. NAP was developed with consideration 
of the UNICEF programmatic priorities and include all the areas of the UNICEF Strategic Plan and 
Country programme Development (CPD). The CPD 2021-2025 was developed for addressing the main 
priorities and challenges identified during implementation of the NAP. 
 
The current evaluation is part of the effort of the GoT and UNICEF to assess the progress of the country 
towards realisation of children’s rights and fine-tune further efforts in the next planning cycle of the NAP.   
2.1. Object of the Evaluation 
The objects of this evaluation are: 
• 
The National Plan of Action for Realization of Children’s rights in Turkmenistan for 2018-2022 
(NAP), with a Road Map for Its implementation and Indicator’s Framework.  
• 
UNICEF’s contribution to the design, implementation and monitoring of the NAP 
• 
Impact of COVID-19 global pandemic on the implementation of NAP 
• 
Contribution of the NAP to the implementation of SDGs. 
2.2. Theory of change 
The NAP was not based on a clearly stipulated Theory of Change (ToC). The Theory of change was 
reconstructed here, as requested by ToR, for the purpose of being tested during the data collection to 
better understand the logic behind the interventions. Additional emphasis was given at reviewing 
UNICEF’s core roles towards addressing bottlenecks in child’s rights implementation and improving 
effective coverage with evidence-based interventions. The evaluation findings will be used by UNICEF 
and Government of Turkmenistan to refine the paths of change to follow during the next implementation 
period of NAP. 
Turkmenistan created a favourable environment to realize rights of children and women. It ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women and aligned a 
number of national laws with the Conventions. The new Constitution recognizes the primacy of 
universally accepted norms of international law.  
However, at the time of inception of NAP there was not a separate governance entity specifically focusing 
on children’s rights in Turkmenistan, child mortality rate was still high and access to healthcare services
