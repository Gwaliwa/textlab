Executive Summary 
Generation Future Programme 
The Generation Future programme (referred to as 'the programme’ hereafter) was implemented by UNICEF 
Cambodia in 2021 as a pilot and continued in 2022 as a complete programme. It had the goal of engaging 
more young people as change-makers by providing them with the skills, confidence and opportunities they 
needed to create positive change in their communities. The budget of the programme in 2021 was about USD 
80,000 and that in 2022 just under USD 160,000. 
The programme had 15 mentees in 2022 (and 13 in the 2021 pilot). Each mentee was matched with a mentor; 
about half of the mentors in 2022 worked in the private sector. Each mentee implemented a social impact 
project on a social issue that they chose according to a plan that they designed. All mentees were given 
technical support, guidance and advice by their mentors, UNICEF Cambodia and other partners. Volunteers 
(95 in 2021 and 128 in 2022) were recruited by the mentees to help implement the projects. The programme 
organised training sessions on 19 topics for the mentees (and some volunteers in selected sessions) to help 
them develop 21st Century Skills; these sessions were provided by private sector contributors, UNICEF 
Cambodia and other partners. Each project had access to a seed fund of up to USD 2,000 for its 
implementation. 
The youth-led projects engaged young people both online (on UNICEF Cambodia communication channels 
and dedicated pages of the projects on social media platforms) and in-person (in events and in schools). A 
total of 5,752 youth ‘participants’ were directly and actively engaged by the mentee-led projects. 27,820 young 
people were involved as ‘supporters’ who promoted and/or encouraged others to engage in activities of the 
mentees’ projects. In the school implementation component of the programme, 6 of the projects went into 18 
schools in Siem Reap Province to conduct activities for a total of 898 students (counting towards the 5,752 
supporters) on the social issues that these projects addressed. These schools used a skills-based syllabus 
(i.e., Local Life Skills, or LLS), and the visits to them were arranged by UNICEF Cambodia.  
A large-scale event, the World Children’s Day celebration event, marked the end of a programme cycle; high-
profile figures from multiple sectors of the country were invited to attend the event that showcased the 
mentees’ projects. 
Evaluation of the Programme 
The evaluation is commissioned by UNICEF Cambodia and conducted by Dr Alvin Leung, an independent 
international consultant. It uses the six Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Assistance 
Committee’s (OECD DAC) evaluation criteria to assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, 
(early) impact and sustainability of the Generation Future programme. The evaluation includes an additional 
criterion on gender equality, equity and human rights. It adheres to the United Nations Evaluation Group 
Norms and Standards for Evaluation amongst other international guidelines for research and ethics. 
The evaluation examined the contribution that the private sector has made to the programme, the changes in 
the lives of the children and youth who have been part of the programme, and the impact that these youth 
have brought to their communities and other youth around them. Based on the findings, the evaluation 
provides key recommendations on (a) the value of the programme for UNICEF Cambodia; (b) the architecture 
of the programme; and (c) the best ways to scale, extend and sustain the programme in the future. The 
primary users of the evaluation are UNICEF Cambodia, programme implementing partners, mentors and 
mentees of the Generation Future programme (rights holders), the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport 
(MoEYS; particularly at the province level in Siem Reap) (duty bearer), and private sector contributors. 
The evaluation is based on the programme’s theory of change reconstructed by the consultant in collaboration 
with the core programme team at UNICEF Cambodia. The evaluation used contribution analysis approach, 
which used the theory of change to assess the relationships between programme inputs, outputs and 
outcomes. The evaluation adopted a non-experimental, mixed method research design. It also adopted a 
participatory approach in all its stages to ensure that young people and other stakeholders were adequately 
involved and informed.

v 
The evaluation collected primary data using feedback forms, interviews and focus group discussions with 139 
individuals, including mentees, mentors, youth volunteers, students and teachers at schools that used the LLS 
syllabus, officials of the MoEYS, private sector contributors, UNICEF Cambodia staff, and staff of the 
implementing partner. The data collection took place in January and February 2022; most of the data 
collection activities were conducted in person in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap of Cambodia, with a small 
number of them conducted online. The evaluation also reviewed programme documents, data and budget as 
well as relevant policy documents and literature. Primary data collected from various stakeholders and 
secondary data were triangulated in an iterative analysis process.  
Key Evaluation Findings 
Based on the data collected, the evaluation had the following findings, organised by the six OECD DAC 
criteria and the additional criterion on gender equality, equity and human rights. 
Relevance 
The programme was relevant and responsive to the key national policies on education and youth 
development, in particular the Education Strategic Plan and the National Policy on Youth Development. It was 
also relevant to the needs of adolescents and youth in Cambodia. Young people participating in the 
programme agreed that they developed 21st Century Skills and that these skills developed were what they 
needed and would be helpful in their study, work and daily lives. The youth-led approach has proven strong in 
ensuring relevance: most social issues chosen by the mentees were very relevant to the Cambodian youth, as 
demonstrated in the large number of participants and supporters that the projects engaged. A small number of 
social issues selected (e.g., introduction of IT sector jobs) were less relevant to young people in rural contexts, 
though. 
The programme was largely relevant to the programme’s mentors and its private sector contributors. The 
matching between mentees and mentors ensured that most mentors could work on relevant projects with 
young people with similar interests. Representatives of the private sector contributors interviewed opined that, 
by providing training sessions to young people, they contributed towards fulfilling corporate social 
responsibilities. 
Coherence 
The programme was coherent – and did not overlap – with similar programmes of other development partners. 
The Generation Future programme focused more on online campaigning, skills development for youth, and 
youth participation, while the programmes of other development partners emphasised more the provision of 
support to start-ups and promotion of entrepreneurship education.  
The programme had the necessary linkages with the private sector for contributing to achieving programme 
outputs and outcomes. These linkages benefited the participating adolescents and youth directly as well as 
helped UNICEF Cambodia build new relationships with private sector partners and provided them with an 
entry point to collaborate with UNICEF. Yet, the Phnom Penh-centric positioning of the programme could have 
been improved to provide valuable experiences to young people in the provinces where similar opportunities 
were very limited. 
The programme has been consistent with other interventions and activities of UNICEF Cambodia. The 
linkages that the programme had with multiple sections/strategy of UNICEF Cambodia were somewhat 
productive. The most productive linkage was the one with the Adolescent Development and Participation 
(ADAP) strategy, as the programme contributed to the work of ADAP by increasing young people’s capacity to 
participate meaningfully in their communities and by providing an enabling environment for participation and 
increasing youth engagement. The linkage with the Education Section was productive, but the contribution 
made by the programme to the Education Section was small in scale; the evaluation also found that the 
programme’s outputs and outcomes were not well aligned with those of the Education Section. 
Effectiveness 
The programme was overall effective in achieving its three outcomes. 

Evaluation of the Generation Future Programme – Final Report 
 
 
vi
First, young people were sufficiently engaged in actively addressing social issues that impacted them 
(outcome 1). Mentees were provided a high level of support from the core programme team as well as high 
quality training from UNICEF Cambodia, other development partners and private sector contributors on a wide 
range of topics. The available seed fund (up to USD 2,000 for each mentee-led project) was crucial to 
implement the projects. The mentors chosen for the mentees and their projects were suitable and highly 
relevant, and most mentor-mentee relationships were very productive. The technical expertise, seniority and 
influence of the mentors were conducive to project implementation, ensuring that the social issues were 
addressed and that the projects gained attention from young people in the country. Youth volunteers provided 
instrumental technical support to project implementation; they themselves also gained valuable skills and 
experience that would be useful for them not only for study and work but also to potentially lead actions that 
address social issues. The school implementation component and the online engagement very effectively 
expanded the reach of the programme. The programme to some extent inspired the school students to 
participate in addressing social issues more actively through their other learning activities in the LLS syllabus.  
Second, the programme was somewhat effective in improving access to stable employment opportunities for 
young people (outcome 2). The programme helped mentees gain confidence in creating positive change, 
broadening professional networks and improving knowledge in project areas or themes; mentees believed 
that these benefits would be useful in furthering their study and subsequently finding jobs. Volunteers, 
although less involved compared to mentees, also agreed that the skills and confidence gained would help 
them in studying. Since the skills gained were in demand in the labour market, it could be inferred that the 
programme was contributing to improving the access to employment through skills training. It is nonetheless 
worth noting that this outcome was limited to mainly mentees and volunteers because: (a) the training was 
provided only to them; and (b) the involvement from other target groups (i.e., participants and supporters) was 
not significant enough for the evaluation to conclude that their access to employment was improved.  
Third, the programme was effective in increasing opportunities for young people to contribute to civic decision 
making (outcome 3). This was primarily achieved by: (a) enabling and supporting (including on skills 
development) mentees and volunteers in running their projects (linked to outcome 1); (b) creating online 
spaces for youth participation; (c) raising awareness of social issues among young people; and (d) 
showcasing to stakeholders, including senior government officials and other influential members of society, 
young people’s success in addressing social issues through online platforms and in events and subsequently 
seeking to open more opportunities for youth participation.  
Efficiency 
The economic efficiency of the programme was high considering the large number of young people reached 
(33,000+) by the programme and its relatively small budget (< USD 160,000). The evaluation found that the 
seed fund and mentoring together brought the most impact on young people and children in the most cost-
efficient manner. The training bootcamp, wherein intensive skills development sessions were provided, also 
offered great value for money.  
The operational efficiency in implementing the programme across sections needs improvement. In particular, 
the cross-section linkages appeared to have been hampered by the unclear responsibilities of the sections of 
UNICEF Cambodia involved; this caused minor delays in implementation and frustration among the staff 
involved. Moreover, the implementing partner was not managed properly, resulting in failures in recruiting 
volunteers from a multi-provincial youth organisation and in seed fund management.  
 
(Early) impact 
The programme successfully formed a network of talented young people who are agents of change; they are 
equipped with the right skillsets and hands-on experience to make changes in communities. This network can 
be useful for UNICEF Cambodia in furthering its work on youth empowerment and participation. The 
programme also built work relationships with mentors, many of which are influential individuals in the 
government, private sector and NGOs. The programme experience of working with mentors and private sector 
contributors, on the one hand, demonstrated that the private sector in Cambodia can be engaged to provide

vii
very specific technical support and, on the other, provided an entry point for the private sector to collaborate 
with UNICEF Cambodia on youth development. Also, the unique strategies of the programme on enabling 
youth-led online campaigns and on creating online spaces for youth participation were very conducive to 
promoting youth participation and to reaching many young people in the country. Also, it can be inferred from 
the above that the programme improved UNICEF Cambodia’s brand visibility among young people and the 
private sector. 
That said, the contribution of the programme to the country programme of UNICEF Cambodia was evident but 
indirect, limiting the programme’s impact. The evaluation finds that the contribution was mainly  made to higher 
level goals but not to the specific outcomes (and their indicators) set for the work areas and sections of the 
country office. Another factor limiting the early – and potential – impact of the programme was the unrealised 
institutionalisation and scaling attempts, including that on building partnership with a multi-province youth 
network and that on connecting the programme with a government initiative on youth participation and 
volunteerism. 
Sustainability 
It is very likely that the programme’s contribution to mentees and volunteers on the individual level will sustain; 
such contribution includes the skills improved, knowledge acquired, confidence gained and networks 
extended. As for the impact made on students and other participants, the evaluation cannot conclude 
confidently that it will sustain because the programme’s interaction with them was relatively brief. 
Some youth-led projects may not continue and their impact may therefore not sustain; this was because some 
mentees needed to focus on their study and would like to discontinue their projects, despite some 
continuation support offered by the programme team.  
On the programme level, the planned – yet not materialised – institutionalisation efforts negatively impacted 
the programme’s prospect and sustainability. The sustainability of the benefits brought by the school 
implementation component of the programme was questionable mainly because the programme had no 
institutional partners in this regard. These weaknesses can be attributed to the programme’s short history and 
limited resources to create conditions for sustainability. 
Gender equality, equity and human rights 
Gender equality has been carefully considered by the programme in its design and implementation; it was 
evident that the programme contributed to ensuring gender equality: a few youth-led projects chosen had an 
explicit focus on ensuring gender equality and challenged gender norms and stereotypes that could limit girls’ 
and young women’s equal access to and participation in certain sectors of the economy of Cambodia.  
The programme’s design sought to use mechanisms to ensure equity (e.g., working with a multi-provincial 
youth network that engaged young people from disadvantaged backgrounds). Such attempts nonetheless 
were of limited success, and that negatively impacted the programme’s ability to directly engage young people 
from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds. Some human rights issues, such as climate change, 
children’s oral health and nutrition, were adequately addressed by the youth-led projects, but the evaluation 
found that some most urgent human rights issues identified in the country programme remained untouched by 
the programme.  
 
Key Conclusion and Recommendations 
Considering the programme’s achievements and results, the evaluation concludes that the Generation Future 
programme should be continued.  
The evaluation found that the most impactful programme components were the seed funds given to the youth-
led social impact projects and the mentorship provided by influential individuals in Cambodia. However, it is 
evident that the programme cannot be significantly scaled only by increasing the number of projects, mentees 
and mentors unless there is a major increase of human and financial resource input.

Therefore, in expanding and scaling the programme, UNICEF Cambodia should aim to: (a) reach more young 
people, particularly those in marginalised and disadvantaged communities and outside Phnom Penh, without 
overwhelming the mentees and the core programme team; (b) deepen the engagement with participants, in 
particular students in schools that used the LLS syllabus, given the success of the school implementation 
component; (c) utilise existing infrastructure of the government by stepping up the programme’s early 
institutionalisation efforts; and (d) devise plans to capitalise on the connections built particularly those with the 
private sector. 
Considering the above and based on the findings, the evaluation made the following 8 recommendations. 
Recommendations 1 and 2 are on volunteer recruitment. Recommendations 3 and 4 are on school 
implementation and the programme’s presence outside Phnom Penh. Recommendation 5 is on private sector 
engagement. Recommendations 6, 7 and 8 are on programme management. 
1. 
Map the youth networks in Phnom Penh and select provinces to support an improved outreach 
process. This will help the core programme team identify channels to better advertise volunteering 
opportunities under the social impact projects. Working with local youth networks can help establish 
longer lasting relationships and leverage their local knowledge to reach young people from 
marginalised and disadvantaged communities in volunteer recruitment. These networks can also be 
used in inviting applications for being mentees. 
 
2. 
Establish the connection between the programme and the Volunteer for My Community (VMC), 
a government initiative to promote youth development and participation. This will, on the one hand, 
help expand the reach of the programme and increase the diversity of the volunteers and, on the 
other, make an important step in institutionalising part of the programme. 
 
3. 
Introduce ‘quotas’ for mentees based in select provinces and strengthen core programme team 
support for them. This means that a fixed number of mentees chosen must be ‘from’ and residing in 
the select provinces during the implementation of their social impact projects. This is to ensure that the 
selected mentees – and hopefully their volunteers – are not all based in Phnom Penh (as this has 
limited the reach of the programme). More importantly, having mentees in the select provinces allow 
them to work with target schools much earlier and in multiple occasions. These mentees should still 
receive the same opportunities to attend the training bootcamp and benefit from mentorship and 
training sessions. 
 
4. 
Establish connections with Youth Councils in Phnom Penh and select provinces. The 
connections will further strengthen mentees’ projects, as the Youth Councils can be engaged and/or 
consulted with in multiple components (e.g., mentee recruitment, volunteer recruitment, campaigning, 
school implementation) to further expand the reach of the programme and diversify the backgrounds 
from which mentees and volunteers come. 
 
5. 
Study how to best capitalise on the connections built with the private sector by consulting with 
participated individuals and studying companies’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. The 
findings will contribute to devising a more relatable approach to engaging the private sector. It is also 
important to consider the long-term objectives of engaging the private sector in the Cambodian 
context. 
 
6. 
Position the programme either under the Deputy Representative Office (with one section acting 
as the Secretariat) or under ADAP (with a significant increase in stable funding to ADAP). One 
concern that the new positioning should address is the availability of funding and human resources 
that can be dedicated to the programme, as the programme cannot scale on the current allocated 
human resources (1.5 staff members) and budget (<USD 160,000). Another concern that this new 
positioning should address is the cross-section linkages (see the following recommendation) for better 
operational efficiency and accountability. 
 
7. 
Reinforce cross-section linkages. The aims of the reinforcement are to: (a) align the objectives of 
the programme with those of the projects/activities under the sections involved; (b) define the 
contribution to be made by the programme to the sections involved; (c) establish agreement on what 
and how the sections involved should contribute in return; (d) dedicate resources to keep to the 
agreement; and (e) ensure accountability.

8. 
Strengthen the partnership with the Child Rights Coalition Cambodia (the implementing 
partner). In response to the failures on volunteer recruitment and seed fund management, it is 
advisable to strengthen the partnership with the CRC-Cambodia (which managed a multi-provincial 
youth network) and improve the capacity of the partner. The CRC-Cambodia must also be given 
adequate resources; monitoring indicators must be clearly defined to ensure its accountability.
