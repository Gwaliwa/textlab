Executive Summary 
The Country Context 
Sri Lanka has a population of 21.8 million with a under 18 years of child population of about 6.2 million. The 
Gross Domestic Product per capita is USD 3,852. It has a high human development index with a life expectancy 
of 75 years. The ethno-political conflict from about 1983 to 2009 resulted in the death of thousands and 
devastation inflicting deeply felt consequences at the human, social, physical, and institutional level.  
Despite sound health indicators, nutrition in children under five remains a major public health concern, with 
high and persistent rates of undernutrition. Sri Lanka is unlikely to meet the SDG target on wasting. Access to 
safe water is almost 85% with about 44% with pipe-borne water supply. There is near universal access to primary 
education with gender parity. Learning outcome assessments find that there are large disparities according to 
language, subjects and geographic locations. Data on violence against children in Sri Lanka is limited, and there 
are no national data. Corporal punishment is widely practiced in schools and accepted by parents. Online child 
sexual abuse is a concern. The child protection system has weaknesses. Information on children with disabilities 
is very scarce. Social protection schemes in Sri Lanka are fragmented and does not focus on children. Gender 
parity in Sri Lanka is high compared with other countries in the region. 
The constitutional crisis (2018/19) resulted in Sri Lanka being downgraded to lower middle-income country 
(2020); the new governments in 2019 and 2020 did not explicitly give priority to peace and reconciliation. The 
Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to livelihoods and the economy. 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme for 2018-2022 is aligned with and constitutes UNICEF's contribution to 
the UN Sustainable Development Framework and is guided by a theory of change that is based on investing in 
the critical windows of early childhood and adolescence to contribute to increased cognitive capital which in turn 
will support Sri Lanka’s sustainable development. There are three outcome areas reflecting three lifecycle stages: 
Early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence; these are supported by two overarching outcomes in social 
policy and programme effectiveness. The current country programme represented a strategic shift from more 
emergency and service-delivery-focused implementation logic to a more upstream, policy-influencing and 
advocacy-oriented approach. 
The vision is to contribute to national efforts to accelerate the realization of child rights for all children in Sri 
Lanka, while promoting strategic investments in children and adolescents to enhance Sri Lanka’s cognitive 
capital. The Country Programme Document (CPD) identified three programming levels, viz., upstream (national); 
midstream (provincial) and downstream (community). 
The CPD has been designed with an indicative budget of USD 57,235,000, made up of USD 4,735,000 from 
regular resources and USD 52,500,000 from other sources. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the programmes 
have been adjusted to accommodate COVID-19 related work. 
Purpose and Objectives of the Country Programme Evaluation 
The CPE, covering the period 2018-2020, will provide information for the next country programme, assess 
performance of results and the adoption of the lifecycle approach for effective delivery. The CPE examined the 
Theories of Change and assessed results of a selected number of outputs. 
The main participants of the evaluation were stakeholders, who were mapped and identified in consultation with 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office (UNICEF SLCO). Altogether 46 (M-22; F-24) and 56 (M-29; F-27) stakeholders 
were identified for KIIs and the Perception Survey, respectively. 
Methodology: 
The evaluation was confined to a limited number of outputs, as agreed, and adopted a 
participatory and interactive approach; qualitative data were collected from interviews. A perception survey was 
undertaken using a group of stakeholders, which provided quantitative data on relevance and effectiveness, 
including stakeholder satisfaction of interventions. Forty-nine stakeholders (F-24; M-24) (or 88%) responded to 
the survey, Desk review was conducted using reports and other published materials. Based on an Evaluation 
Matrix developed, KII Guides were developed for different groups of stakeholders. 

vi 
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all KIIs were conducted online with 51 external stakeholders (M-28; F-23). 
Ethical norms and principles were followed during the interviews. This evaluation was guided by the minimum 
standards laid down by UNICEF and UNEG. The qualitative information collected was analysed and triangulated 
to derive trends and conclusions. Perception Survey data were analysed using SPSS software. 
The evaluation team adopted mitigatory actions to overcome the key limitations, which included the short time 
period available for the evaluation, meeting restrictions due to COVID-19, potential low response to the 
Perception Survey, and limited number of key informants. 
Relevance 
Programme alignment: In Nutrition and in Child Protection, initiatives align well with national priorities. Sri 
Lanka has “pathfinding” status with the Global Partnership to end Violence against Children, and the work 
assessed is directly linked with Sri Lanka’s commitment as a pathfinder country and is a priority in GoSL. In 
Education, outputs are aligned with the government policy at the time of designing; they also align with the 
Peacebuilding Priority Plan of GoSL. The programme interventions are more relevant at the community (school 
community) and require more attention towards the society leaders such as political leaders, parents and 
caregivers and village leaders. The outputs become relevant only when there is integration in the society. The 
Disaster Risk Reduction work is in line with UNICEF's Global Strategic Plan and has been found to complement 
GoSL efforts in DRR. The Social Policy and Social Protection work broadly covers GoSL welfare services and 
are very relevant especially for the low-income families and their children. Overall, the identified programme 
serves the needs of children and young people. 
Theory of Change: 
Analysis of Theories of Change reveal that there is a gap between outputs and very 
high-level national outcome indicators. The evaluation notes the UNICEF policy of linking with national 
indicators at the outcome level; however, the limited portfolio of work is unlikely to make any changes in national 
indicators. These national statistics are more apt for service delivery mode with large funding. Furthermore, most 
data for national level indicators are generated by GoSL and are generally not available in a timely manner. Also, 
many of the policies, strategies and tools supported by UNICEF SLCO are yet to be fully operationalised; the 
expected outcomes are unlikely to be demonstrated in the near future. Nonetheless, the evaluation notes the 
relevance at output level; yet the interventions are spread and small and depend on the uptake by the 
Government to truly become relevant. 
The evaluation notes that the CPD has included some of the key priorities identified in the Situation Analysis of 
2017. There have been good stakeholder consultations in the design of CPD. 
Positioning of UNICEF SLCO: 
The evaluation notes UNICEF SLCO's strengths as a respected partner with 
GoSL on child protection matters and as the only international agency with   expertise in child protection. In 
education also, UNICEF SLCO is well positioned within GoSL as having supported in many ways in the past. In 
health and nutrition, there are a few UN agencies working on different aspects of nutrition of children and 
mothers; the position of UNICEF SLCO is much less prominent. In Social Policy, GoSL considers agencies such 
as UNDP, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Labour Organisation as stronger 
partners than UNICEF SLCO. 
Effectiveness 
Reach and delivery of Results: 
In general, the programme effectiveness has been adversely affected due to 
implementation delays caused by the change of Government (2018 and 2019), Easter Sunday attack (2019), 
inadequate programme funding, and COVID-19 (2020 -). UNICEF SLCO implemented a variety of containment 
measures for COVID-19 pandemic, but normalcy of implementation is yet to return. 
In Nutrition, the interventions supported by UNICEF SLCO include formative research on infant and young child 
feeding and maternal nutrition practices in Sri Lanka, and introduction of national protocols for management of 
severe and acute malnutrition. The advocacy work led GoSL to allocate additional funding for production of 
supplementary food for children <5 y and pregnant mothers. The effectiveness of the nutrition component is 
hampered due to several reasons including non-implementation of the National Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action 
Plan, non-functional National Nutrition Secretariat, gaps between the Policy and grassroot level actions, and 
due to delays in delivery. Engagement with Ministry of Health has been limited, and their technical needs should 
reflect the national/local context   rather than experiences from other parts of the world. The evaluation did not 

vii 
 
find evidence for the notion of the stakeholders that the priority given to nutrition is less than that given for 
health, but because this notion was expressed regularly by external stakeholders, this needs further examination.  
In Child Protection, UNICEF SLCO led the development of the National Plan of Action to End Violence Against 
Children and the Alternative Care Policy. The momentum has since been lost and the platform for VAC is now 
inactive. The delivery of the pilot on life skills programme is delayed due to COVID-19, and government 
ownership has been limited.  Similarly, the parenting skills pilot is very delayed and is currently still at module 
finalization stage. Securing government ownership of pilots, towards achieving a scale up should the results be 
successful, is not consistent largely due to funding issues of GoSL. The results are unlikely to significantly 
contribute to outcome level changes. Whilst interagency coordination has been limited, frequent managerial 
changes in GoSL agencies have also caused delays.  
In Education, the programme supports an overall school curriculum that promotes social harmony. Whilst some 
work on curriculum development is delayed, GoSL has decided that all revisions to the curriculum should be a 
part of the ongoing education reforms, which are expected to be piloted partially in 2022.  In positive disciplining, 
work has progressed, and the package is expected to be rolled out in 2022. The social cohesion work piloted in 
selected schools is not properly monitored due to COVID restrictions, and the E-platform is fully implemented 
at only a few schools due to funding difficulties. The Music for Social Cohesion is an innovative strategy that 
could be upscaled, but there is an uncertainty in upscaling due to funding difficulties by GoSL. The national 
study on the issues of ragging and SGBV in Sri Lankan Universities by the University Grants Commission is also 
incomplete to assess effectiveness. Inadequate coordination between the education and child protection 
sections at UNICEF SLCO in delivering outputs on school violence is also seen by both GoSL and UNICEF SLCO 
staff as an issue. Pre-COVID-19 implementation delays coupled with post-COVID closure of schools and 
lockdowns have affected delivery. A proper assessment is not possible as the outputs need a coordinated effort 
of all deliverables to achieve the outcomes. The National Action Plan on Education for Peace and Reconciliation 
has not been implemented by Ministry of Education due to school closure since March 2020. 
The Child-Centred DRR programme has been piloted in several districts prone to disasters together with district 
child protection officials with a reach of about 3,500 children via the Children's Clubs. UNICEF SLCO has also 
taken the lead to reinvigourate the school safety guidelines originally drafted in 2016, and the Ministry of 
Education (MoE) has taken steps to formalise these guidelines within the school curriculum. Work relating to 
the safety of children in transition (from school to home) is appreciated by the GoSL partners.  
In Social Policy, the UNICEF SLCO-advocated National Monitoring Committee for monitoring child rights (CRC) 
is dormant since 2019. It is also supporting the Department of Census and Statistics to introduce the 
Multidimensional Poverty Index linking with SDG as a tool for measuring child poverty, and this work is ongoing. 
UNICEF SLCO has supported citizen friendly budget consultation processes, which has been implemented in the 
Eastern Province, and work on budget allocations for child sensitive initiatives. It has also provided an analysis 
of the national budget to assess inclusion of vulnerable groups. 
UNICEF SLCO, together with UNICEF ROSA technically and financially supported improving the national 
evaluation capacity, which included developing a curriculum for a postgraduate diploma in evaluation at the 
University of Sri Jayewardenepura which has been offered to about 100 GoSL and NGO staff, and training about 
60 Young and Emerging Evaluators in short-term courses. However, the effectiveness of the initiatives has not 
been assessed. The National Evaluation Bill, the development of which has been supported by UNICEF SLCO is 
pending the approval within GoSL. 
Despite providing advocacy on budget allocations, work on influencing increased budget allocation for children 
has not borne fruition, and the situation is exacerbated by the economic melt-down due to COVID-19. The 
concept of the Citizen's Budget, facilitated by UNICEF SLCO, has been embraced by the Eastern Provincial 
Council, and the Northern Provincial Council will follow suit. On Social Policy, the engagement with the 
Government agencies has been few and sporadic; stakeholders are of the view that a more concerted 
engagement is needed to influence GoSL policy. The CRC/NMC became inactive since its last meeting in 2018 
due to lack of political willingness and absence of a lead Ministry for coordination of its affairs. 
Sustainability: 
It is premature to assess sustainability for initiatives that are still being rolled out; nonetheless, 
in Nutrition, since the initiatives supported by UNICEF SLCO are already in the programmes of MoH, they are 
likely to be continued, subject to availability of funds. In Child Protection, the outlook for sustainability of the 

viii 
 
national partnership on VAC is currently limited due to challenges in engaging government stakeholders. Some 
early lessons show linkages to line ministries which have to be activated to develop a more streamlined system. 
In Education, there is a likelihood of interventions being scaled up once the changes in the Government 
agencies are stabilised. A worrisome situation is the reduction of funding for the Peace and Reconciliation Unit 
of the Ministry of Education, which has not received GoSL funds for activities. In Social Policy, UNICEF SLCO 
initiatives, some of which are also supported by other UN agencies, are embedded in the work programmes of 
the relevant GoSL agencies and are likely to be continued with the support of donors.  
Overall, GoSL commitments to sustainability and adoption of some of the measures advocated by UNICEF SLCO 
that require increased investments by the Government are dependent on improving the economic situation in 
the country. Nonetheless, some policy/strategy initiatives can be sustained with minimal investments. 
Timeliness of Delivery: 
One of the main challenges faced by UNICEF SLCO is timely delivery of the programme. 
There have been delays in implementing 2018-19 workplans due to delivery delays by both GoSL partners and 
UNICEF SLCO; COVID-19 exacerbated the situation relating to 2020 workplans from about March, 2020. Overall, 
most work in education and child protection have been delayed and are unlikely to be streamlined this year. 
Monitoring and Reporting: 
Review of the Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Plans for the three years 
show that some data gathering activities were postponed from 2020 to 2021, but for the large part most have 
been concluded or initiated, few seem to be dropped. The annual reporting differs somewhat from year to year 
due to changes in organization-wide reporting formats (RAM). The evaluation notes that reporting structures 
are complicated, and staff find reporting at outcome level challenging.  
Country Office Architecture: 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office is organised by thematic sections, with Zonal 
Offices in the Northern and Eastern Provinces and an outpost office in Uva/Central Province. In the current cycle, 
the lifecycle approach is used which is not in sync with office structure. Staff indicate that there too many 
meetings; yet external stakeholders find inadequate internal coordination. 
In the previous programme cycle, the UNICEF SLCO adopted a service delivery approach, and the staff capacity 
and competence were adequate for that purpose. With upstream policy dialogue and advocacy, a different set 
of skills for advocacy is needed in some thematic areas,  
The Zonal Offices function as UNICEF SLCO representative offices and have developed very close rapport with 
the relevant provincial administration. This arrangement facilitates identification of provincial needs, and to 
provide a feed-back. Overall, Zonal Offices and the outpost office are recognised as very useful. 
Funding: 
The evaluation notes inadequate funding as a major reason affecting programme effectiveness. 
The Country Programme is premised on the availability of USD 57 million made up of USD 4.7 million from Core 
Resources (RR) and USD 52.5 million from other resources (OR - donors). It is seen that UNICEF SLCO received 
only about 22% of the originally envisaged budget or about 33% of the prorated budget (for 3 years). There is 
a significant shortfall in funding as only 18% of the expected external funds (RR) have been realised as at Dec, 
2020. As of October, 2021, USD 25,770,000 (or 45% of the original budget) has been received and a part of this 
has been 're-phased' for 2022. 
Knowledge products and Outreach: 
The evaluation noted the need for rigourous quality assurance of 
knowledge products, especially publications, to meet the accepted standards to UNICEF. In regard to outreach, 
some senior GoSL partners were unaware of UNICEF SLCO's programme or the focus areas in the current cycle. 
Similarly, some partners were unaware of the results of work done – as a result, there was a show of disinterest 
in the overall outcome indicators by the partners. 
Partnerships: 
The evaluation noted that some of the Civil Society Organisations (CSO) engaged have long-
standing partnerships with UNICEF SLCO and have added value to UNICEF SLCO's work and provided valuable 
feed-back on the programme. Some GoSL and NGO stakeholders expressed reservations on the choice of CSOs 
as some of them lacked in-house capacity. Information sharing is an important element in the partnerships; 81% 
were 'satisfied' with the way UNICEF SLCO is sharing information. 
Engagement with the private sector is in a nascent stage and has moved slowly. Since 2018, USD 129,000 have 
been collected, largely for COVID-19 response. Private sector engagement guidelines are being prepared. It is 
evident that private sector can be attracted by offering custom-made programmatic packages to align with the 
core business of the company. Although some staff are not convinced on engaging with the private sector due 

ix 
 
to potential reputational risks, there is a case for UNICEF SLCO to work with businesses to achieve results for 
children. 
The perceptions of the stakeholders on general effectiveness in a number of areas show an overall rating of 
moderately satisfactory/satisfactory; however, about 20% show unsatisfactory rating for quality of work and 
timeliness of delivery. 
Programme assumption: The CPD is premised on a number of assumptions. However, some of important 
assumptions (e.g. changes in social services and budgeting, data management by GoSL, support for UN 
agencies) remain unaddressed. 
Coherence 
Much of the work is still in progress. The indications are that the current portfolio of work, when completed, is 
likely to show coherence with national programmes as they fit well and complement GoSL initiatives, albeit with 
limited effect. In regard to UN joint programming, the evaluation notes implementation has been very 
compartmentalised in participating UN agencies and have been treated as distinct sub-project components by 
them. The spirit of joint programming has not been demonstrated due to a number of challenges. Some of 
these have been recognised, and the UN Country Office, which leads joint programming has taken steps to 
improve the situation. 
Equity and Gender: 
The evaluation notes that the application of United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy 
and the UNICEF's Gender Action Plan across the programmes is uneven, largely due to funding constraints. 
There are gender aspects in nutrition that could be addressed. In social cohesion and bullying in schools, there 
is no specific reference to gender inequality; the University study on ragging does consider gender inequality. It 
would appear that a 'gender lens' has not been consistently used in project implementation and reporting, partly 
due to the limited understanding of gender equality aspects by the implementing partners.  
Although UNICEF SLCO has acknowledged the need for focusing on mainstreaming gender and disability in all 
outcomes, disability remains almost invisible in planning documents. Disaggregated data to show inequities and 
gender differences are not very evident in the portfolio. About 20% of the stakeholders rated UNICEF SLCO's 
work unsatisfactory in a number of gender-related areas. 
Lifecycle Approach 
Lifecycle approach was introduced to UNICEF SLCO during the current programme cycle. There is broad 
agreement that the theory behind this approach, a child-centred/holistic way of delivering results, makes much 
sense and is desirable. However, excepting health and nutrition, there is little support by UNICEF SLCO staff for 
continuing the lifecycle approach in the next country programme. In health and nutrition, there is better 
congruence with GoSL structures. The negative effects of implementation such as long and too many meetings, 
lack of staff time, loss of specificity, need to use sector-based indicators, misalignment with GoSL structures, and 
internal management difficulties are felt very strongly, while the positive outcomes are minimal. Any value added 
is limited to very few instances.  
Both the lifecycle meetings as well as the various working groups appear to mostly involve staff in Colombo 
though they include at least one field-based staff. The “Matrix Management”, creating linkages and reporting 
structures that reflect that one person’s work impacts other sectors, is still in its early phase.  
Lessons learnt 
The positive and negative lessons summarised below are from the analysis of evidence gathered during the CPE

The Outcome indicators, which use national indicators as a policy of UNICEF, are not realistic will not be 
useful to show results from the CP. Further, in most cases the required data are not available. Investments 
on supporting national fora and policies have not brought the desired results to fulfil indicators.

Due to funding constraints, the programme appears over-ambitious and generate wrong signals to others.

• 
The disability and gender aspects are not mainstreamed adequately in programme planning, and the 
understanding of these concepts by implementing CSOs is limited, providing a lesson for the next cycle. 
• 
The UN Joint Programming assessed during the CPE does not demonstrate that the agencies have 
understood the spirit of UN Joint Programming. The joint programmes have worked in isolation without 
much coordination.

Some of the implementing CSO partners who have had long-standing engagement with UNICEF SLCO have 
added value to the programme; these lessons are useful for strategically selecting CSOs. There is also 
potential for engaging new partners to bring new perspectives. 
Recommendations 
Programme Strategy and Design 
1. The new programme should be based on clearly identified priorities and should be based on the 
availability of funding. A package of actions may provide outcomes at local level. If full upstream 
portfolio is adopted, suitable indicators to measure policy and advocacy rather than child 
wellbeing should be used 
2. In regard to equity and gender equality, UNICEF SLCO should focus on disaggregated data collection in 
programmatic work, and support cyber space issues (gender), and addressing issues of children in special 
situations (equity).  
3. The Theories of Change in the new Programme Cycle should clearly articulate the convergence of 
interventions to higher level results. The outcomes and outputs should be measurable with available data.. 
4. In the new programme, more attention to nutrition is needed. The nutrition regimes should be customised 
to localities. CRC work should be the responsibility of Child Protection Section, Protection work on education 
requires collaboration between Education and Child Protection sections. Several programmatic areas are 
identified for consideration in the next cycle. 
Programme Delivery 
5. In the new programme cycle, discontinue the lifecycle approach in its current form and introduce other 
methods to increase internal collaboration.  
6. In the new programme cycle, reprofile/reskill the staff competences for upstream policy dialogue and 
advocacy to enable high-level engagement with GoSL.  
7. The Zonal Offices (Kilinochchi and Batticaloa) and the Outpost Office (Uva) should continue, but their scope 
of work and staffing should be revisited once the new programme priorities and funding are determined in 
the new cycle.  
8. In partnerships, review the selection criteria for identifying CSO partners; jointly review the delivery of 
previous UN Joint Programmes to introduce new mechanisms to improve delivery, and ensure regular 
dialogue with GoSL partners particularly on policy matters. work. 
9. Ensure that reporting in the Annual Reports and RAM is consistent and help in tracking progress; develop 
tools to track progress on indicators and for early detection of delays; and assess the outcomes of building 
the national evaluation capacity.  
Sharing of Results and Knowledge 
10. UNICEF SLCO should strive to periodically inform its implementing partners, including GoSL partners on the 
country programme content and results.

1. Introduction 
In accordance with the UNICEF Evaluation Policy, it is necessary to conduct a Country 
Programme Evaluation (CPE) at least once every two programme cycles or once in a 
programme cycle if monitoring and audit information points to a significant shift in the 
programming context or a significant increase in the level of risk. The previous CPE for Sri 
Lanka was for the 2002-2006 cycle.  
This CPE commenced in September, 2021 
1.1. 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme 
UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Programme for 2018-2022 is aligned with and constitutes UNICEF's 
contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDF), 2018-2022. The UNSDF 
brings together 13 UN agencies working in Sri Lanka, and reflects global, national, provincial 
and UN priorities, including the SDGs.  
The country programme for 2018-2022 is guided by a theory of change that is based on 
investing in the critical windows of early childhood and1 adolescence to contribute to increased 
cognitive capital which in turn will support Sri Lanka’s sustainable development. ‘Cognitive 
capital’ represents the complete set of intellectual, socio-emotional and executive function 
skills that allow for creativity, flexibility and ability to work collaboratively2. 
Overall there is a primary orientation towards creating change for children of different age 
groups rather than creating change by sectoral area. The Country Programme has three 
outcome areas reflecting three lifecycle stages: Early childhood (0-5 years), middle childhood 
(5-9 years), and adolescence (10-18 years). This ‘lifecycle approach’ is thought to promote 
convergence across sectors and create a more child-oriented perspective. Under each 
outcome, key sectoral contributions are merged towards creating a change in the lives of 
children. To support these three outcomes, two complementary and overarching outcomes 
were developed: Social policy and child rights monitoring; and Programme effectiveness 
(ensuring that the country programme is efficiently implemented, monitored, and supported 
to achieve results). 
In addition to the new lifecycle orientation, the current country programme represented a 
strategic shift from more emergency and service-delivery-focused implementation logic to a 
more upstream approach with focus on advocacy and influencing policy, aligning with 
UNICEF’s programming approaches in middle-income countries. In line with the UNICEF 
Strategic Plan 2018-2022, the following intervention strategies were to be given priority across 
all programming areas: Strengthening systems to improve service delivery particularly to the 
most disadvantaged; leveraging resources for children; and supporting children and 
adolescents as agents of change.  
Three different levels of programming were envisaged: (1) upstream - national; (2) midstream 
- sub-national (provincial and district) and (3) downstream - community (parents, caregivers, 
immediate service providers, children and adolescents themselves)3. Interventions were to be

guided by a 'vision' of change as well as evidence generated from piloting, to advocate for 
and inform the generation of strengthened policies, standards and guidelines; as well as 
support the implementation of these measures “to benefit the most disadvantaged children, 
parents and their communities”. Support to the roll out of national plans, policies and 
legislation was considered “instrumental in strengthening child-friendly, gender-responsive and 
quality service delivery at the subnational level”. The programme was to “demonstrate 
affordable, integrated and innovative solutions to tackle inequalities (including gender 
inequalities) at the provincial and district level, while national policy and budget advocacy will 
ensure replication and sustainability”. To support social and economic policy development and 
legal reforms, UNICEFs role would be critical in provision of high-quality technical assistance, 
generating evidence on the situation of children and adolescents, and strengthening linkages 
to global knowledge and best practices. 
The CPD, whilst focusing on national efforts to upstream policy and advocacy, was expected 
to continue its mid-stream and down-stream work in the four Provinces, Northern, Eastern, 
Uva, and Central Provinces (see Fig. 2.1). 
In early childhood, the country programme aimed to reduce neonatal mortality and 
morbidity, address undernutrition, increase access to quality early learning and development 
services, improve child protection services to identify, record and refer child abuse cases, and 
support efforts to create national action on early identification of disabilities and intervention 
services. Key strategies to achieve this included (i) support systems strengthening to improve 
quality of neonatal care, including interventions such as promoting mainstreaming of the Early 
Childhood Care and Development Programme, using the 1000 day approach to good nutrition, 
“tackling malnutrition”, and family and community support; (ii) contribute to strengthening of 
the CP system to prevent and respond to child abuse, neglect and violence through 
interventions such as modeling of CP mechanisms, building capacity of actors, improving 
functions and resources of the CP system in target districts, mitigating the unnecessary 
institutionalization of young children; and (iii) support government authorities at national and 
subnational levels to provide early learning and school readiness services, through 
interventions such as strengthening capacity of parents, caregivers and preschool teachers; 
identifying gaps in preschool curricula according to global standards and develop and pilot 
new materials including for children with disabilities in targeted districts, and advocacy for 
increase in public investments in early childhood development.  
In middle childhood, the programme aimed at “ensuring that children, especially the most 
deprived, benefit from healthy, nurturing, protective environments and live free from violence”. 
Key strategic priorities include (i) increasing skilled human resources in school, strengthening 
institutional care settings and increasing the capacity to address WASH, nutrition and health 
issues towards improved quality of services – backed by guidance and technical advisory 
support; (ii) support holistic and child-centred learning in primary schools, through working 
with stakeholders to develop and apply policies, strategies and budgets that are equity-
focused and grounded in evidence; (iii) accelerate national action to address violence against 
children, through interventions such as the establishment of a national coalition to generate 
awareness, building resilience among children for prevention, and improving skills and 
knowledge of parents and community members and generating demand for services.  
In adolescence, the programme aimed at “ensuring that adolescents, especially the most 
deprived, use high-quality basic social services in a safe, supportive and protective
