SEVENTH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN MID-TERM REVIEW

2020
Foreword
The Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP) 
aims to accelerate development efforts towards 
Vision 2030 without leaving anyone behind. The 
Goal of the Plan is to create a diversified and 
resilient economy for sustained growth and socio-
economic transformation. The transformation 
is to be driven by agriculture, tourism and 
mining, while also investing in areas of energy, 
infrastructure, information and communication 
technology, commerce and trade, water resources 
development, research and development and 
creating an enabling governance environment to 
support the economic diversification and national 
development efforts. These efforts are to be 
complemented by interventions that are expected 
to generate improved human capital, while 
addressing poverty, vulnerability and inequality 
which have the potential to undermine the 
transformation gains that the country envisions 
by 2030.
The aspiration to attain the developmental 
agenda articulated in the 7NDP necessitated 
the establishment of a framework that ensures 
effective oversight, coordination and execution 
of planned interventions. The Presidency, under 
the oversight of His Excellency, President Edgar 
Chagwa Lungu, has been providing policy oversight 
on 
7NDP 
implementation 
through 
periodic 
Cluster engagements. The National Development 
Coordinating Committee, in collaboration with the 
ministries responsible for National Development 
Planning and Finance oversees the technical 
aspects of planning, financing, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation. Further, in the spirit 
of promoting integrated development that leaves 
no one behind, the Cluster Advisory Groups, 
Provincial Development Coordinating Committees, 
District Development Coordinating Committees 
and Ward Development Committees have taken 
up the responsibility of ensuring the participation 
of all relevant stakeholders, including cooperating 
partners, civil society, the private sector, academia 
and community-based groups representing the 
wider Zambian society. This framework has been 
effective in ensuring integrated development 
coordination, 
supervision, 
implementation 
and monitoring and evaluation, among the 
various stakeholders in the country. The 7NDP 
Implementation Plan with its specific outcomes, 
associated outputs, programmes and resource 
outlays anchors the development trajectory to be 
followed by the country to attain the planned five 
Strategic Development Results. It also forms a 
basis for the assessment of progress being made 
during the process of plan implementation.
In November 2019, the Mid-Term Review of 
the 7NDP was commissioned for the purpose 
of assessing progress made mid-way through 
the implementation of the Plan. The results 
are expected to generate lessons to inform the 
remaining period of 7NDP implementation. The 
findings of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) reveal that 
an appreciable measure of progress was recorded 
across all the five Pillars of the 7NDP. A few targets 
of the Plan had already been attained and a number 
of outcomes were on track to be attained by 2021, 
some  were partially on track while others were off 
track. There are also a number of valuable lessons

learnt with regard to implementing agencies 
doing more with less resources and beneficiaries 
experiencing improvements in public service 
delivery. Multidimensional Poverty Analysis also 
revealed declining trends in levels of deprivation of 
households in basic services, such as education, 
water and sanitation, energy for lighting, health 
and access to finance. 
The challenge of attaining more robust socio-
economic transformation across the entire 
spectrum of society, however, still remains a 
challenge for the country to overcome in the 
medium term. This entails adopting new and 
responsive strategies to mitigate the impact of 
external factors, such as climate change, energy 
deficits, a slow-down in foreign direct investment 
inflows and livestock diseases that have negatively 
impacted some of the key development areas 
of the Plan. Agriculture, water resources and 
energy were among those negatively affected. The 
exchange rate fluctuations as a result of global 
developments have also negatively affected the 
country’s macroeconomic foundation. The MTR 
also reveals best practices in terms of 7NDP 
coordination and implementation mechanisms 
which are worth replicating to optimise the results 
of the Plan by 2021. The country remains committed 
to continue on the development trajectory set out 
by the 7NDP while adapting to global emergencies 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic. All stakeholders 
are, therefore, urged to scale-up efforts in support 
of attaining the transformative agenda outlined in 
the 7NDP by 2021.

The Government of the Republic of Zambia, in its 
development agenda, prides itself in promoting 
values that support consultative development 
approaches 
enabling 
citizen 
participation, 
transparent and independent evaluation practice, 
and 
continuous 
knowledge 
and 
evidence 
generation to support informed policy-making 
and development delivery. This is important for 
the country to learn lessons on what works, avoid 
adopting detrimental development approaches 
and apply continuous improvements in the 
implementation of development interventions.
The Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Seventh 
National Development Plan (7NDP) was a 
consultative process that involved the engagement 
of various stakeholders at ward, district, provincial 
and national levels. The MTR also captured the 
views of a wide spectrum of institutions and key 
informants from the Government, the private 
sector, cooperating partners, and civil society, 
including organisations representing special 
groups, such as children, the youth, women and 
persons with disabilities.  
Gratitude is extended to all the stakeholders who 
participated in the 7NDP mid-term evaluation 
process and those who provided technical and 
financial support without which the evaluation 
would not have been possible. The MTR process 
entailed setting aside time to discuss development 
outcomes and experiences and providing valuable 
information and data that formed the evaluation 
findings compiled in this report. 
Special appreciation goes to the Cluster Advisory 
Groups, Provincial Development Coordinating 
Committees, District Development Coordinating 
Committees and Ward Development Committees 
for effectively participating in the evaluation.
The various ministries, provinces and agencies 
are also commended for providing valuable 
information and sharing experiences with regard 
to implementation of national development 
interventions. The Reference Group that provided 
technical guidance and review of the report are 
commended as well as the two experts, Dr. Nedy 
Matshalaga and Mr. Chibamba Mwansakilwa, who 
facilitated the review process.
Special thanks are extended to the United 
Nations in Zambia and particularly, the United 
Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations 
Development Programme for providing financial 
and technical support to the review process.
