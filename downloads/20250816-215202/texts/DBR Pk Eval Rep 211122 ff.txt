GLOSSARY  

Term 
Definition 
Birth Registration 
Birth registration is the permanent and universal recording of a child’s birth by the government and serves as 
legal proof of his/her existence and identification. Not only is BR a fundamental human right, but it also provides 
the foundation for safeguarding civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights.1  
Certification 
The issuance by the civil registrar of a legal document certifying a birth or death.2 
Civil Registration 
and Vital Statistics 
(CRVS) 
Civil registration is defined as the continuous, permanent, compulsory, universal recording of the 
occurrence and characteristics of vital events pertaining to the population, as provided through decree or 
regulation in accordance with the legal requirements in each country, with full respect for the rules regulating 
the protection and privacy of individual information.3 
Coherence 
The compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a country, sector or institution.4 
Contribution 
Analysis 
Contribution Analysis is an approach for assessing causal questions and inferring causality in real-life 
programme evaluations. It offers a step-by-step approach designed to help managers, researchers and 
policymakers arrive at conclusions about the contribution their programme has made (or is currently making) 
to outcomes.5  
Date of Registration 
The day, month and year when an entry of registration of a vital event is made in civil register.6 
Delayed 
Registration 
The registration of a vital event after the prescribed period specified in existing laws, rules or regulations 
(including any specified grace period). Delayed registration is usually considered to be the registration of a vital 
event one year or more after the event has occurred. (Not to be confused with ‘late registration’).7 
Effectiveness 
The extent to which the intervention achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives and results, including 
any differential results across groups.8 
Efficiency  
The extent to which the intervention delivers, or is likely to deliver, results in an economic and timely way.9 
Impact  
The extent to which the intervention has generated or is expected to generate significant positive or negative, 
intended or unintended, higher-level effects.10 
Lady Health 
Workers (LHW) 
LHWs provide primary health care services to underserved populations in rural and urban areas. These workers 
are attached to a local health facility, but they are primarily community based, working from their homes.  
Late Registration 
Registration of a vital event after the prescribed time-period but within a specified grace period. Since the grace 
period is usually considered to be one year following the vital event, late registration means the registration of 
a vital event within one year of the event occurring (not to be confused with delayed registration).11 
Lot Quality 
Assurance 
Sampling (LQAS) 
Provides real-time planning and management information. It uses small sample sizes to classify administrative 
geographical areas, to inform if these areas have achieved or not a pre-determined target for a given indicator.12 
Mixed Methods 
A mixed-method evaluation systematically integrates two or more evaluation methods, potentially at every 
stage of the evaluation process, usually drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data.13 
Nikkah Registrars 
Marriage Registrars who have the legal authority to perform marriage ceremonies. 
Participatory 
Evaluation  
An approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This 
involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection 
and analysis and the reporting of the study.14 
Primary Caregivers 
Primary caregivers of children are those adults who, if the parents of the child are deceased or do not live in 
the same household with the child, take the primary responsibility of raising the child. A person can be identified 
as the primary caregiver of a child only if he/she lives in the same household with the child. They are not 
persons who take care of the child when the parents are away.  
Quasi Experimental  
Quasi-experimental research designs, like experimental designs, test causal hypotheses. These designs 
identify a comparison group that is as similar as possible to the treatment group in terms of baseline (pre-
intervention) characteristics. The comparison group captures what would have been the outcomes if the

programme had not been implemented (i.e., the counterfactual). Hence, the programme can be said to have 
caused any difference in outcomes between the treatment and comparison groups.15 
Relevance 
The extent to which the intervention objectives and design respond to beneficiaries, global, country and 
partner/institution needs, policies and priorities, and continue to do so if circumstances change.16 
Sustainability  
The extent to which the net benefits of the intervention continue or are likely to continue.17 
Theory Based 
Approaches 
Theory-based approaches to evaluation use an explicit theory of change to draw conclusions about whether 
and how an intervention contributed to observed results. Theory-based approaches are a “logic of enquiry,” 
which complement and can be used in combination with most of the evaluation designs and data collection 
techniques outlined in programme evaluation methods.18

SUMMATIVE EVALUATION OF DIGITAL BIRTH REGISTRATION PROGRAMME 2017-2021 
i 
Executive Summary 
This is the final report for the Summative Evaluation of the Digital Birth Registration Programme 
(henceforth referred to as DBR or the Programme), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) Pakistan Country Office (PCO) and Telenor Pakistan (a mobile service operator). DBR sought to 
expedite birth registration (BR) of children as a means of contributing to universal birth registration (UBR) for 
children under 17 years old (with a focus on children under five (U5)). AAN Associates was contracted to 
implement the evaluation, undertaken from December 2021 to September 2022.  
Chapter 1 - Intervention Context and Object of Evaluation: In Pakistan, BR was reportedly 42.2 per cent 
(2017-2018), implying that one in every two children was not registered and not counted in development 
planning and resource allocation decisions. Provincial BR rates varied – 58 per cent for Punjab and 28 per 
cent in Sindh.19 Contributory factors for low BR coverage include: limited government capacity; complex BR 
process; high direct and indirect costs for service users; and limited community awareness on the process 
and importance of BR.  
The intervention evaluated is the UNICEF PCO-supported DBR Programme which intended to reform the 
BR system to improve BR rates in selected districts of two provinces. The Programme was implemented in 
two phases. In Phase I (2017-2018) five districts (Bahawalpur, Pakpattan, Thatta, Badin and Naushahro 
Feroze) were selected. In Phase II (2019-2021), the intervention was expanded to four additional districts, 
including Lahore, Multan, Dera Ghazi (D.G.) Khan and Karachi. 
Chapter 2 - Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Summative Evaluation intended to 
demonstrate commitment to accountability. The evaluation scope included all DBR-funded activities 
implemented in nine districts from 2017 to 2021 (excluding the pilot phase). The evaluation followed the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee’s (OECD-
DAC) prescribed criteria (i.e., relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability). The 
evaluation also focused on UNICEF programming priorities including gender equality, equity, human rights-
based approach (HRBA) and disaster risk resilience (DRR). 
Chapter 3 - Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The evaluation is guided by two 
overarching designs: Theory-based and Participatory. The evaluation team conducted a Hybrid 
Evaluation, comprising two sub-designs (i.e., Contribution Analysis and Quasi Experimental). The 
contribution analysis sub-design was applied to measure DBR’s outcome achievements, and quasi-
experimental was used to establish if the demand-side interventions worked to increase uptake of BR 
services. The evaluation used a Mixed-Methods approach including: key informant interviews (KIIs), focus 
group discussions (FGDs) and household surveys (HHS). In total, 1189 people participated in and informed 
the evaluation including 864 HHS respondents (431 male and 433 female), 37 KII respondents (27 male and 
10 female) and 288 FGD participants (220 male and 68 female). The evaluation team conducted a desk 
review of 174 documents, used to complement primary data. Limitations include: unavailability of baseline 
data on BR awareness for possible before-after comparison (for which control-treatment comparison was 
made using single point data); inconsistency of results framework with result-based management principles 
for impact assessment; and limited information on budgeting for comprehensive efficiency assessment.  
Chapter 4 - Evaluation Findings and Conclusions: Key findings and conclusions are outlined below:  
Relevance: The evaluation findings indicate that DBR was relevant on multiple levels. These are evident in 
terms of alignment of DBR goals, objectives and strategies with those of national and provincial policies/plans 
(i.e., National Framework on Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Reforms (2020), Punjab Birth 
Registration Strategy 2016 and Birth Registration Strategy Sindh 2018-2022). DBR strategies/interventions 
seem appropriate for addressing both the demand and supply-side barriers to BR such as: i) capacity 
development of local government (LG) and facilitators on digital technology; ii) partnerships with health, 
education and social welfare to expand outreach of BR services; and iii) community awareness and education 
for uptake of BR services. There are noted design deficiencies: two-step process (separation of registration 
and certification), instead of a single step (registration and certification happening in the same visit); fee 
charge for certification (including penalties for delayed and late registration); and double-entry registration 
system (as the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and DBR systems are not synced).  
Coherence: Evaluation findings indicate that DBR is largely coherent in terms of assisting provinces to 
expedite UBR and develop digital BR models in line with priorities identified in provincial BR policy 
documents. DBR is found to be partly consistent with UNICEF Global Guidelines (2013). It is consistent in 
terms of: BR system being continuous, universal, timely and established under the civil registry/national ID 
administration and BR system being. There are inconsistencies such as: BR is not free (users are charged 
for late/delayed registration); certificate is not free; limited institutionalization or policy framework for 
interoperability; and system does not monitor the demand creation activities (such as lack of baseline on 
community awareness or practices).

SUMMATIVE EVALUATION OF DIGITAL BIRTH REGISTRATION PROGRAMME 2017-2021 
ii 
Efficiency: The Programme efficiency measurement was constrained for limited thematic disaggregation of 
the budget. From the data available, the Programme managed to achieve 137 per cent of intended BR targets 
by spending 98 per cent of funds. In relative terms, Phase I proved less efficient compared to Phase II, for 
achieving only 73 per cent of the planned registration target. Phase II exceeded the registration targets by 
achieving 174 per cent of registration numbers. The cost/beneficiary comes to USD20$0.53 per registration 
(minus certification) and USD$3.33 per certification. The certification cost falls in the middle when compared 
with other countries i.e., Nigeria (USD$0.27), Liberia (USD$1.38), Tanzania (USD$2.03), Ethiopia (USD$4) 
and South Sudan (USD$6). 
Effectiveness: Programme effectiveness is assessed at two levels (i.e., achievement of outcomes (output 
achievements are used, as outcomes did not have indicators) and relative effectiveness of programme 
strategies). DBR was mostly effective for achieving most of the outcomes (in Phase I two out of five 
outcomes21 were mostly achieved and in Phase 2, two out of three outcomes22 were fully achieved). As for 
the registration targets, the findings indicate that DBR registered 2.6 million children in nine districts against 
the target of 1.9 million (0.5 and 2.1 million in Phase I and Phase II respectively). Factors that contributed to 
the achievement of targets include: demonstrated leadership and ownership by relevant public entities (LG 
in both provinces); engagement of community-based facilitators expanded outreach of BR services; inclusion 
of community influencers helped in dissemination of awareness messages; partnership with Telenor enabled 
access to technical and financial resources; and adaptive programming whereby learnings contributed to 
improving design and delivery. Disabling factors that hindered achievements included: technological 
challenges (limited internet connectivity and digital infrastructure, power shortages); lack of interoperability 
between NADRA and the local government registration systems; use of two step approach (registration and 
certification); delayed payments to facilitators that demotivated them; and disruptions due to COVID-19. 
DBR strategies demonstrate varied levels of effectiveness (strategies are assessed by looking at their 
contributions to achievement of intended results and relevant stakeholders’ views on their efficacy). Effective 
strategies include: advocacy and technical support for policy reforms (enabled developing Birth and Death 
Registration Rules in Punjab and bye-laws in Sindh), technology integration in the BR process (DBR 
application was developed which reduced cost and time for the service users); community education and 
sensitization (helped to increase community awareness on process, documentation and importance of BR). 
Others that remained less effective include: capacity/staff development of stakeholders (a capacity 
assessment was not conducted with noted variations in capacities of different types of facilitators deployed 
and trained) and partnerships (engagement has not been institutionalized whereby BR would be included in 
duties of relevant staff in other departments). 
Impact: The impact measurement remains incomplete due to absence of an impact statement and indicators 
(in both the Results Framework and Theory of Change (ToC)). The evaluation team has used the long-term 
objective (as proxy) in terms of accelerated BR coverage in both provinces. While the latest secondary data 
is unavailable to determine the magnitude of change, primary data (HHS) indicates that the BR rate23 in 
treatment districts is higher (42 per cent) compared to control districts (7 per cent). Qualitative discussions 
with community members are indicative of perceived changes such as children’s improved access to social 
services (education, health, social protection) and reduced vulnerability to protection risks such as child 
marriage, child labour and trafficking (but could not be verified for absence of secondary data). DBR has 
resulted in unintended results such as focus on other vital events (such as marriage, divorce and death) and 
technology-trained facilitators that can contribute to other exercises (immunization, census, elections). 
Sustainability: DBR was implemented without a sustainability or exit strategy. The evaluation team has 
assessed the sustainability of programme strategies and results and rated them accordingly. The gains made 
to bring legal and administrative reforms are likely to be sustainable (amended bye-laws in Sindh and 
approved Birth and Death Registration Rules in Punjab). The digitization of the BR system is likely to be 
sustainable as provinces have either adopted or are keen to use the application for scale-up. Punjab has 
allocated PKR2440 million and plans to scale up to 36 districts using the DBR application (renamed Baldia 
Online). The Local Government Department (LGD) Sindh intends to scale up the digital service across 30 
districts with PKR21 million allocated. The capacity building component is rated partially sustainable for 
continuous need to retrain human resources on upgraded systems. On partnerships, DBR partnered with 
relevant government departments (health, education, social welfare) through notifications, however, this is 
less likely to be sustainable unless partnerships are institutionalized with changes in job descriptions of 
relevant staff. Community awareness has improved; however, it may fade with time. Hence, the departments 
need to plan and implement awareness on a recurring basis.

Gender Equality: DBR is assessed as partially compliant with gender equality principles. At the design 
stage, a gender assessment was not conducted nor any gender-disaggregated targets set. In terms of 
implementation, some interventions promoted gender equality such as: door-to-door registration for mothers; 
involvement of LHWs to gain trust and access to mothers; community education prioritised both mothers and 
fathers. In terms of results of registration numbers, there is slight gender disparity between boys (54 per cent) 
and girls (46 per cent).25 Although, the population sex ratio (male/female) is 103.41 for Punjab and 108.29 
for Sindh.26 However, BR was slightly lower in girls compared to boys (prior to the initiation of DBR)27 in both 
provinces and therefore should have been prioritised. Reporting on gender and age disaggregates for other 
results was weak/non-existent. 
Equity: DBR is assessed as partially compliant to equity principles. Design was not informed by an equity 
assessment and some of the most vulnerable districts (in terms of BR rates) were not prioritized in both 
provinces. In terms of implementation, some interventions were equity-centred including door-to-door service 
for hard-to-reach areas and communication outreach through various platforms to reach vulnerable 
communities Even though the Programme did not report on equity components, the HHS findings show that 
poor households and disabled children were registered through the Programme. 
HRBA and DRR: DBR is consistent with the HRBA principles of participation (in terms of developing relevant 
partnerships); non-discrimination and equality (for providing access to DBR services without discrimination); 
legality (for ensuring consistency with local laws and child rights provisions); and empowerment (2.6 million 
children were registered and now have a legal identity). It is partially consistent with the principle of 
accountability due to lack of a feedback/complaint system for recipients. There is no evidence of DRR 
integration in DBR strategy, execution or results. 
Chapter 5 - Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations 
Conclusions on the Way Forward: Future assistance must be guided by an expressed impact and 
sustainability plan, which was not the case for the period evaluated. The provinces need to be guided to think 
of a system for birth registration which is focused on newborns and for that the role of health departments is 
central. The provincial lead departments must evolve a system whereby healthcare infrastructure is engaged 
and provided the tools to do BR at birth and immediately afterwards. The same system could focus on 
children between 1-4 years, for the fact that these children are more likely to interface with the system. For 
age four and above, the focus must shift to periodic campaign work preferably through education sector (for 
both in-school and out-of-school children) to help address the service gap for unregistered children. Whatever 
solution is evolved, the system should require parents/caregivers to interface once (not more), and later the 
LG and NADRA systems should interface on their own without asking parents to pay repeated visits.  
Lessons Learnt: Key lessons and good practices are outlined below:  
1. The shift from centralised to decentralised services is central to uptake of public services such 
as birth registration. DBR has proven this as the process of BR was decentralised and the engagement 
of facilitators (both from the public sector and others) helped expand outreach and made services more 
accessible to users (in contrast to certification which was kept centralised). For instance, in the selected 
districts, the number of BR points increased from 800 to 11,000 (almost 14 times), which supported 
registration of over 2.6 million children in five years. Aided further by digital registration, this approach 
helped to take services closer to end users. It also saved time and cost (indirect) for parents and 
caregivers (at least for registration).  
2. Shift to innovative use of digital technology is both inevitable and revolutionary, as it can aid in 
taking services to the users and cutting time and costs. DBR has demonstrated this by use of digital 
tools which have facilitated taking services to end users (at least registration). The uptick in registration 
numbers has proven that if people are offered a viable option, they are willing to register children. This 
is equally useful for the service providers to enable real-time data tracking and validation.  
Recommendations: Find below evaluation recommendations drawn from findings and conclusions: 
Recommendation 1: BR system reforms must continue to enable provinces to make BR services 
simplified, accessible and affordable. The intervention has demonstrated that the solution lies in 
decentralisation, digitization and demand creation of services. The intervention has done the much-
needed foundational work and has generated visible appetite (amongst provinces) to continue. There 
are still design and operational aspects that merit improvements to help provinces continue and 
upscale. The recommended actions for continuity and upscaling include:  
• The BR Rules (in Punjab) and Bye-laws (in Sindh) may need to be reviewed and revised to include a one 
visit-one step approach (whereby both registration and certification are done simultaneously requiring 
one interaction with parents/caregivers); free of cost registration and certification (the first copy of the 
certificate may be issued free of cost in the allowed period with rationalised penalties for late/delayed

27 As per MICS Punjab 2017-2018, 75.8% boys are registered compared to 74.8% girls and as per MICS Sindh 2018-2019 34.4% boys are registered compared to 33.6% girls).

registration); and formalize interoperability by stating the support roles of different public entities for BR  
such as departments of health, education, social welfare and others.  
• System reforms must prioritise creating a system for registration at birth or immediately after birth. The 
role of health departments remains central to making such a system work. The Local Government and 
Community Development Department (LG&CDD) (in Punjab) and LGD (in Sindh) must formalize 
interoperability by introducing requisite changes in Rules of Business (or mandate of health and other 
relevant departments) and updating frontline staff to contribute as per the prescribed support role.  
• Future reforms must underline the issue of non-registered children as a priority by evolving campaign-
based approaches or modalities. This may be done better if the unregistered children are disaggregated 
into two groups (i.e., ages 1-5 and ages 5-17), and then interventions can be undertaken with the health 
system to register children ages 1-5 (as this group is more likely to interface with health system for 
immunization and healthcare) and schools for tapping onto the unregistered children in schools including 
out-of-school children (by launching campaigns during summer and session breaks).  
• The BR system should issue a LG&CDD and LGD-based unique ID to every child (and this may not 
necessarily be same as the ID given by NADRA) and together with parents’ details (including 
Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC)) feed into the LG&CDD and LGD databases. LG and NADRA 
databases should interface using the parents’ IDs to update Form B and other data, without parents 
needing to interface with the system again. The current system does not allow simultaneous registration 
and certification as there needs to be verification from the NADRA system and issuance of a NADRA-
given Civil Registration Management System (CRMS) ID.  
• The BR database should be functionally linked to other vital events (marriage, divorce, death) and the 
database should be accessible to other public sector planners (with restricted access to 
private/confidential information) for planning and resource allocation decisions.  
• Explore partnerships with the private sector and other mobile network companies for technical and 
financial support and to address issues around internet connectivity and data backlog, especially in hard-
to-reach areas. Seek help from development partners to document (in the form of visibility materials) the 
Telenor Case Study and organize events to seek support from the private sector.  
• Seek technical assistance and plan capacity assessment of facilitators and Union Council (UC) staff in 
target districts. With varied capacities of registration staff, this may require updating the training materials 
along with the length of training/refresher events. While LG&CDD have embedded BR as part of routine 
training exercises for LG staff, this initiative should be replicated in Sindh as well.  
• Plan and implement periodic communication campaigns and integrate it with other campaigns (such as 
school enrolment campaigns, breastfeeding weeks, mother and child health weeks) to enable continuous 
messaging around the importance and processes of birth registration.  
• Seek technical assistance and commission gender equality and equity assessments (at provincial levels) 
and use findings to inform the design, implementation and reporting of gender equality and equity 
parameters such as updating monitoring tools to collect gender and equity-specific data and updating 
communication messages as per the needs of vulnerable groups and gender. The services at present 
are not informed by the needs and preferences of these groups.  
• Disseminate information on established complaint mechanisms (e.g., toll-free number) so communities 
can file their concerns and provide feedback on BR services.  
Recommendation 2: UNICEF PCO’s technical 
assistance has demonstrated successful 
implementation of BR reforms. There is an underlined need for continued engagement of 
development partners (including UNICEF) to scale up at the provincial level. The future assistance of 
UNICEF should focus on:  
• Continuing support to provinces with the above-listed actions (where provincial authorities are advised to 
seek technical assistance from development partners) to enable further reforms to the BR system in order 
for provinces to have a functional CRVS.  
• Future assistance must include province-specific targets and assistance plans (enabling addressing local 
challenges). The results framework and ToC should be consistent with Result Based Management 
principles including intended impact and associated indicators. Moreover, future assistance should be 
guided by a documented Exit Plan   
• Continued advocacy with provincial and national authorities to prioritise functioning CRVS and wider 
access to CRVS data for possible use of data for development planning and resource allocations. 
Moreover, advocate with Planning and Development (P&D) and Finance Departments for additional 
financial allocations for LGDs to upscale DBR. 
• Budgeting which should follow activity-based costing (ABC) principles and must be linked to programme 
results/outcomes. The expenditures statements should be linked to outcomes/results to enable usable 
computation and analysis (for internal and external review).
