ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
This report provides an independent formative and evidence-based evaluation of the Nepal’s Education 
Equity Strategy. The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Nepal Country Office. The evaluation was 
designed in consultation with the Government of Nepal and relies on consultations and inputs from a wide 
range of stakeholders. The evaluation team wishes to thank every contributor for their valued input and 
support.  
 
Appreciation goes first to the Government of Nepal and more particularly to the various institutions and staff 
working at Federal, provincial, municipality and school level, with particular thanks to the MoEST staff and 
the CEHRD for their time and commitment.  
 
All over the assignment, CAYAMBE team benefitted from the continuous support and guidance from 
UNICEF and its implementation partners under the equity strategy. Their inputs were instrumental for the 
organization of the Interviews and access to information. 
 
We would like to give a special thanks to the following individuals who allocated an important amount of 
time and support to the organization and follow up of this evaluation: Mr Shankar Thapa, Deputy Director 
and Head of EMIS Section, CEHRD, Mr Jimmy Oostrum, Education specialist, UNICEF Nepal; Ms. Sevara 
Hamzaeva, Evaluation Specialist, UNICEF ROSA; Mrs James Alexander Russell, Education Sector 
Planning Liaison Officer, MoEST and UNICEF; Mr Sambedan Koirala from World Education. 
 
Our special gratitude also goes to all focal persons from the UNICEF field offices and Government 
Education officers of the surveyed municipalities for having largely facilitated the organization of Key 
Informants interviews at Sub National level in the difficult context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Finally, our recognition goes to all other developments Organizations who also committed part of their busy 
schedule for this evaluation and more particularly the members of the Equity and Inclusion Technical 
Working Group for their valuable inputs in the discussion around Equity in Education. 
 
The CAYAMBE Education team as a whole, also including the experts, give their most sincere thanks to all 
those who contributed, to varying degrees, to the present evaluation. We hope that this report can offer an 
objective picture of the huge work carried out to allow every Nepalese child to fully achieve their right to 
quality education and open new perspectives for future improvements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
The consolidated equity strategy for the School Education Sector in Nepal, titled as “Equity Strategy” (ES), 
was launched in December 2014. The main objectives of this strategy are to reduce the current disparities 
in access, participation and learning outcomes for children in basic and secondary public education in 
Nepal. The strategy envisions to achieve this by (i) developing an Equity in Education Index (Equity Index), 
at national and sub-national level, and (ii), supporting the development of Equity Strategy Implementation 
Plans (ESIPs) to allow for a systematic use of the equity index to inform need-based planning at local 
government level thus reducing identified disparities. 
 
With the current School Sector Development Plan (SSDP) coming to an end in July 2021, the government 
initiated the development of a new long term-education sector plan. The present evaluation of the Equity 
Strategy is expected to inform the implementation of the strategy during, and as part of the new education 
sector plan in the new federal context and guide the application of the equity index and equity strategy 
implementation plans. 
 
The evaluation aims at illustrating the direct and indirect effects that the introduction of the Strategy has 
had on applying an equity-based approach within the previous two education sector plans through a 
comprehensive analysis. 
 
The audience of this evaluation are the Government of Nepal, education sector development partners, 
UNICEF, UN Agencies, implementing partners and other stakeholders who will make use of the 
evaluation results. 
 
The Thematic evaluation scope will focus on equity dimensions (gender, geographical location, wealth 
quintile, disability, ethnicity and caste) based on available data provided by UNICEF and the two main pillars 
of the ES: Equity Index and equity-based interventions. The geographical scope of the evaluation is national 
with specific focus on the 15 districts which were prioritized for interventions under the Equity Strategy. The 
chronological scope included all documented activities under the Equity Strategy implemented since 2014. 
 
A set of Evaluative Questions was defined and agreed during the inception phase and 5 OECD1/DAC2 
criteria have been used for this evaluation: Relevance, Coherence, Effectiveness, Efficiency and 
Sustainability. 
 
The evaluation is formative and process-based with a strong focus on learning lessons. It adopted a mix 
method approach (qualitative and quantitative) and the following steps: Reconstruction of the Theory of 
Change of the ES, secondary quantitative3 and qualitative data review and analysis, primary qualitative 
data collection through Key Informants Interviews at National and Sub National level with a range of 
stakeholders (i.e Government education staff, UNICEF staff, Non-State Actors, donors agencies...) being 
also the anticipated users of the outcomes of the evaluation. 
 
The evaluation took place between mid-January 2021 to end of April 2021 and was organized under three 
main phases: inception, data collection/analysis and reporting. 
 
The main findings and conclusions of the evaluation are described for each evaluation criterion.

RELEVANCE 
 
The 2014 equity strategy responded to an identified need to test an innovative approach of using education 
data for equitable resource allocation and targeted programming. It was pioneer in addressing equity issues 
in accordance with an analysis of equity dimensions and explaining factors. Moreover, it succeeded in 
moving equity consideration fairly high on the Nepalese education policy agenda. However, the definition 
of equity underpinning the Strategy and calculated by the index has 3 major interrelated weaknesses: 
 
• 
The strategy addressed equity issues adopting a cross-cutting definition where individual 
characteristics and social barriers prevail (poverty, caste, gender, disability). It is not focused on 
educational needs. Data for SLC exam was not available for all Local Governments – hence not 
used initially for analysis.4 Once the data will be available for all LGs for grade 8, the learning 
dimension will be added in the index. Moreover, only few local equity plan analyzed by the 
evaluation team addressed learning needs or promoted equalization of learning opportunities within 
the school environment. 
 
• 
The design of the index and proposed measurement of deprivation across districts underlies a 
linear complementarity (and equal weight) between access-participation-learning outcomes. At 
international level, the analysis of schooling trends usually considers learning perspectives above 
participation (and sometimes even above access), bearing in mind that weak learning outcomes 
are a major cause of dropout. The index therefore failed to capture the learning explanations to 
drop-out. The evaluation team also questions the idea that there would be a “main driver” of inequity 
because of their cumulative and hierarchical nature, where poverty always ranks first. 
 
• 
The strategy focusses on education demand, understood mainly under the access and participation 
dimensions. ESIPs activities mainly focussed on enrolment campaigns (access) and participation 
measures (meals, hygiene products for girls), but not enough on learning. The quality of education 
supply in the most vulnerable areas was not addressed nor analysed. This is an important 
shortcoming as school provision is generally differentiated in terms of quality (community versus 
institutional schools, concentration of "good" teachers in several privileged localities, existence of 
huge differences in learning environments, etc.). Thus, access to differentiated education service 
provision can lead to different participation and learning. 
 
 
COHERENCE 
 
The Equity strategy was coherent with Nepalese international commitments and paved the way to further 
effort implied by the 2030 Agenda in terms of nationwide quality and equitable educational provision. It was 
adopted within a context of major governance change (shift to federalism) and progressive ownership of 
the new governance mechanisms by national and local decision makers. As such, the Equity strategy 
proved coherent with the evolving context and fully adaptive. With the transition to federalism and new 
division of competences, the ES targets additional financing to local government levels / municipalities, thus 
making pillar 2 of the ES (the ESIPs) dependent upon local planning capacity and prerogatives.  
 
This focus reduces the scope of possible measures when they do not depend upon local governments, in 
particular major policy levers revolving around human resource (among them teacher affectation and 
capacity development, for instance to identify student’s needs, management of the diversity in classrooms 
and building trust with parents). As teacher-related measures still refer to national competence, more 
coherence could have been expected at local level to align local efforts with education policy decisions 
taken at national level. In this context, the evaluation team noted a limited internal coherence of the Equity 
strategy and inconsistency between the highly comprehensive dimension of the index and the limited scope 
of implemented measures in the field. 
 
 
4 SLC examination is a public examination for the purpose of certification at the central level, not similar to grade 8 and grade 5 
examination and not developed as the as the NASA test.

EFFECTIVENESS 
 
Our analysis of effectiveness is partly nurtured by Nepalese school enrolment performance. Undoubtably, 
the implementation period of the equity strategy was a strong momentum for effective reduction in the 
aggregate number of OoSC at national level. A good performance of most of the 15 targeted districts is 
confirmed in terms of access, and the gender gap was effectively addressed. Parity in basic education, 
already acquired nationwide at Lower basic level, is now achieved at Upper basic level, with girls even 
over-represented in lower basic both at national level and in the targeted districts.  
The evaluation team confirms the number of 256 000 OoSC reintegrated into schools with little grade-
related variation, suggesting that the campaigns were effective for all age groups. However, caste and 
ethnicity-related barriers still remain poorly addressed, with some trends to be confirmed by further 
demographic data, for instance the decrease in Janajatis enrolments over the past 10 years.  
Our analysis also shows a decrease in survival rates in districts that have experienced recent rapid 
increases in enrolment, more visible at Lower basic level than at upper basic level. These results confirm 
the demand-orientation of the ES that succeeded in bringing many children back to schools but did not 
foster increased school capacity to help them remain in schools and learn. To summarize, the index proved 
effective for ranking purposes, and succeeded in triggering new and effective measures targeting mostly 
school enrolment and participation. It was rather misused or poorly understood by education planers and 
policy makers to inform needs-based programming and equity-focused measures.  
 
In quantitative terms, only 13% of LGs have endorsed their ESIP plan by January 2021, although in many 
cases, ESIP development successfully triggered the development of a general LG education plan where 
they were still missing. Broadly, the initial rationale according to which understanding equity dimensions 
would lead to more tailored and diversified actions did not really materialize in the field. Interventions 
analyzed by the evaluation team were quite similar from one ESIP to another and focused mainly on 
“mainstream” OoSC (back to school campaigns representing the bulk of funding) and general participation 
measures (meals and girls hygiene products). In other words, and despite the strong increase in analytical 
data available, equity interventions designed and implemented failed to address the needs of the highest 
number of excluded children, namely those in school but not learning (disability, poverty, language…).  
 
The evaluation also underlines the role played by the members of the Equity and inclusion Technical 
Working, as well as UNICEF, CERHD and World Education who have been instrumental in supporting the 
dissemination and support for the implementation of the Strategy. 
 
 
EFFICIENCY 
 
Considering the limited scope of the index and effects of ESIP development support, its current use and its 
reduction in scope compared to what was initially planned, one can ask if the development of the index was 
a cost-effective targeting system compared to other (potentially less sophisticated) strategies.  
 
Efficiency consideration refers here to the capacity of local planners to use the ES effectively (or even use 
possible alternative in terms of equity analysis through the use of the schooling profiles) 
 
Important effort was made to train LG education staff to prepare the plans in regional workshops. These 
workshops were valuable for building large commitment from Central, Provincial and Local Governments 
but were made less effective because of strong staff turnover following the workshops. Alternative solutions 
were identified, among them the WE-sponsored blended training strategy, proving relevant and more 
efficient solutions in the COVID-19 context.  
 
However, ESIP did not always address the root causes of inequity. The funding allocated for each 
municipality was quite limited and it was not clear how and to what extent the budget was used for the

of funds and lack of M&E mechanisms at LG level.
