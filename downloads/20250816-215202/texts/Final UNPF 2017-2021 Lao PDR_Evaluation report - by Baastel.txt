Executive Summary 
1. 
Purpose 
As described in the Terms of Reference (TOR), the overall purpose of the UNPF evaluation in 
Lao PDR was to assess the extent to which the UNPF outcomes (2017-2021) are aligned and 
contributed to the national development priorities set forth in the 8th NSEDP and to determine the 
extent to which UNPF outcomes have been achieved. In addition, the evaluation examined the 
relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of UNPF results as well as the sustainability of the 
UNCT’s support to national development priorities. The evaluation is intended to feed into design 
of the forthcoming Lao PDR - UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 
2022-2026. 
2. 
Objectives  
As per the TOR, the overall objectives of the UNPF evaluation were to:  
• 
Assess UNPF’s overall effectiveness in advancing Lao PDR’s national development 
agenda (8th NSEDP); 
• 
Review results achieved during the UNPF 2017-2021 cycle;  
• 
Review UNPF’s relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability against Lao PDR’s 
national development agenda (8th NSEDP);  
• 
Examine how the five UN programming principles have been mainstreamed in the results-
based management cycle (design, implementation, and M&E) of the UNPF; and 
• 
Provide clear, actionable strategic and programmatic recommendations for improving the 
UNCT’s contribution to Lao PDR’s development priorities, taking into consideration the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
3. 
Principles and Pillars  
The UNPF is underpinned by the five programming principles of: gender equality, human rights-
based approach, environmental sustainability, results-based management and capacity 
development. It also considered the specific context of Lao PDR focusing on its cultural and 
national heritage, its very diverse number and variety of ethnic groups, its phased reform process 
and agricultural economy with a pronounced rural-urban divide. The UNPF is supported by three 
key pillars: 1. Inclusive Growth, Livelihoods and Resilience; 2. Human Development; and 3. 
Governance, Rule of Law and Participation in National Decision making under which the key 
outcomes are framed.
