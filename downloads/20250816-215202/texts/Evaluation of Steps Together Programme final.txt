EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
UNICEF’s Programme on Prevention of Violence 
and Bullying in School – Steps Together 
 
In 2019, an Expert Group was established in MES to 
develop a whole school programme1  for a safe 
environment2 to prevent violence in schools. A whole 
school approach as one where, “well-being and 
mental health are everyone’s business, with genuine 
engagement across the enter community, including 
school staff, students,  parents, local authorities and 
external services. The approach involves multiple 
components, including early identification and 
intervention, staff well-being and development, and 
skills-based work for students, but above all it adopts 
a positive and universal focus on well-being.”3  
 
The Programme on Prevention of Violence and 
Bullying in Schools – Steps Together Programme 
(hereinafter referred to as the Proramme) was 
implemented in cooperation with MES in five pilot 
schools – Sofia, Tetevan, Iskar, Kustendil and Zavet - 
for three school years, 2019-2022. The first school 
year, 2019-2020, was a preparatory year, and the 
second and third school years, 2020-2022, were for 
Programme implementation. School selection was 
completed in two phases. First, 13 schools were pre-
selected using a questionnaire. Second, discussions 
were held with school staff, students and parents to 
explore their willingness, readiness and motivation to 
join the Steps Together Programme. The five pilot 
schools selected were very different in terms of 
geographic location, size, resources and capacities. 
 
Evaluation Rationale and Purpose 
 
The purpose of this evaluation of the Programme was 
forward-looking to lead to improvements of the 
structure, implementation and quality of the Steps 
Together Programme, and eventually to ensure its 
national scale-up and sustainability through its legal 
and administrative institutionalization and status 
budgeting.  
 
The Programme was established with UNICEF 
support in five schools in five different regions – Iskar, 
Kustendil, Sofia, Teteven and Zavet.  The aim was to 
 
1 A whole school approach is based upon a social-ecological 
model to address school violence and bullying. 
2 A safe environment is characterized by a positive social 
and psychological climate at school and requires fostering 
a caring, respectful, inclusive and supportive culture at 
school. A school having a positive climate is hospitable and 
its students and teachers try their best to behave in the 
best possible way. Being part of such a setting positively 
understand why and to what extent intended and 
unintended results were achieved and to analyse 
implications of the results.4  
 
The primary expected users of this evaluation will be 
UNICEF CO and the MES, along with the pilot schools 
and schools who are interested in implementing the 
Programme in the future. Other users of this 
evaluation may include the ASA, MLSP and SACP.  This 
evaluation will also be of interest to partner UN 
agencies and international financial institutions and 
donors that contribute to UNICEF results and wider 
UN system commitments, intended outcomes and 
efforts on the realization of children’s rights and 
wider 
human 
rights 
commitments, 
including 
promoting gender equality and ending violence 
against women and girls.  
 
Evaluation Scope  
 
The evaluation focused on five pilot schools – Sofia, 
Teteven, Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet – and covered the 
period of September 2019 to June 2022. The 
evaluation included perspectives and views of all 
relevant partners and stakeholders, including UNICEF 
CO personnel and school mentors, MES staff, 
members of the Roditeli (Parents) Association, and 
pilot school staff (i.e., school principals, school 
psychologists, pedagogical counsellors, teachers), 
students and parents who participated in and 
benefited from the Programme.  
 
Evaluation Objectives 
 
In keeping with the TOR, the main objectives of this 
evaluation were to:  
• 
Assess and evaluate the Programme and its 
implementation, along with its relevance, 
efficiency, 
effectiveness, 
coherence 
and 
sustainability, and, to the extent possible, its 
impact on teachers, students and parents. 
• 
Assess the Programme’s equity and child rights 
perspective, both in terms of the capacities to 
reach out to and deliver support for prevention 
of violence and bullying in schools and ensure an 
environment of safe schools.

Evaluation Sites and Samples 
 
The evaluation was conducted in each of the five 
pilots schools – Sofia, Tetevan, Iskar, Kustendil and 
Zavet – and with the Parents Association and UNICEF 
and MES staff in Sofia.  
 
The sample included an estimated 126 respondents, 
of which 29.4 percent were high school teachers, 23.8 
percent were middle school teachers and 12.7 
percent were primary school teachers. In addition, 
19.8 percent were members of the coordination 
councils and 5.6 percent were principals and/or 
deputy principals. Only 4.8 percent of respondent 
were UNICEF mentors, 2.4 percent were UNICEF CO 
staff and  1.6 percent were members of the MES.  
 
A total of 143 students participated in 17 FGDs. The 
majority of students were middle school (35.7 
percent) and high school students (44.0 percent), 
whereas fewer were primary school students (20.3 
percent). Among the 143 students who participated 
in FGDs, 43 were male (30.1 percent) and 100 were 
female (69.9 percent).  
 
In addition, a total of 61 parents participated in 9 
FGDs. The majority of parents who participate in 
FGDs were female (93 percent); only four parents 
were fathers.  
 
KEY FINDINGS 
 
Coherence  
 
The Programme was designed and implemented to 
support schools in their efforts to implement the 
Mechanism of Counteracting Bullying and Violence in 
the Institutions of the Preschool and School Education 
System, which offers a policy framework for 
prevention and intervention against school violence 
and bullying, and which aims to assist educational 
institutions in their efforts to create a safe education 
environment. The Programme focused on providing 
each of the five pilot schools and their staff with 
capacity building, technical assistance and tools to 
implement the Mechanism.  
 
Relevance  
 
The Programme is also squarely aligned with 
UNCIEF’s Country Programme 2018-2022, which 
focuses on supporting Bulgaria in its efforts to enable 
all children and adolescents in the country, including 
the most disadvantaged, to enjoy their rights and to 

 
v 
 
develop to their full potential in an inclusive and 
protective society. The realization of the right of 
every child to live free from violence, abuse, 
exploitation and harmful practices is a cross-cutting 
element throughout the Country Programme, which 
is in line with Bulgaria’s national priorities (i.e., 
National Development Programme Bulgaria 2030) 
and regional priorities identified in the Europe 2030 
Strategy6, European Commission Recommendation 
"Investing in Children: Breaking the Cycle of 
Disadvantage”7, and the Council of Europe Strategy 
for the Rights of the Child (2016-2021 and 2022-
2027)8, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development9 
and 
UNICEF’s 
Global 
Strategic 
Framework 2018-2021 and 2022-2025.10 
 
UNICEF’s support to develop the Programme has 
been in line with the needs of schools, as evidenced 
by school staff’s recognition that the Programme is 
relevant. In general, school staff appreciated the 
support provided by mentors to build their capacities 
to understand school violence and bullying, and to 
implement good practices for developing a whole 
school approach that will help to prevent and 
respond to school violence and bullying, and to 
create a safe school environment. This is despite the 
fact that pilot schools were unable to fully implement 
the Programme in its entirety in the two-year period. 
 
Moreover, the Programme was evidence-based, 
modeled after a similar programme, entitled ‘For a 
Safe and Enabling Environment in Schools’ (SEES), 
which was designed and implemented in Croatia with 
full support from UNICEF Croatia from 2003-2011.11  
The SEES Programme focused on prevention of peer 
violence and bullying for a safe and enabling 
environment in schools. To support the SEES 
Programme, UNICEF Croatia developed a handbook 
for teachers, school associates and principals 
involved in the development of the SEES Programme 
that was published in 2015 by UNICEF Regional Office 
for Europe and Central Asia. UNICEF maintained that 
the Steps Together Programme Handbook was

schools, such as including a component on engaging

UNICEF and MES would benefit from reviewing and 
revising the Programme’s programme document to 
include a proper ToC and to strengthen the RMF, and 
to align the ToC and RMF with a clearly developed 
programme goal and related outcomes, outputs and 
activities.12 The lack of a proper ToC may have 
hindered the Programme; thus, any desire to scale-
up the Programme should occur with a review and 
revision of the ToC and RMF.  
 
On average, respondents ranked the Programme as 
an 8.4 on a 10-point scale (1=not important to 
10=very 
important).

preventing school violence and bullying.  This was 
followed by UNICEF staff (mean=8.7), coordination 
council members (mean=8.6) and UNICEF mentors 
(mean=8.4).  In comparison, middle school teachers 
(mean=7.8), high school teachers (mean=7.7) and 
primary school teachers (mean=7.6) were less likely 
to rank the Programme as very important to 
preventing school violence and bullying. In terms of 
region, school staff from Iskar (mean=9.6) were most 
likely to report the Programme was very important to 
preventing school violence and bullying, followed by 
school staff from Kustendil (mean=8.9) and Teteven 
(mean=8.6), whereas school staff from Sofia 
(mean=7.9) and Zavet (mean=7.7) were less likely to 
rank the Programme as very important to preventing 
school violence and bullying. 
 
Effectiveness  
 
Most pilot schools described their school as having a 
safe environment, yet recognized they have 
occasional problems with aggression and bullying. 
Some school staff tried to be more proactive and use

prevention-related activities from the Programme 
Handbook as a means to prevent school violence and 
bullying, and they felt their efforts were paying off 
because they started to receive fewer alerts or tip-
offs from parents and colleagues. 
 
The Programme included a number of practices to 
prevent school violence and bullying.  Some of these 
practices were more successful and readily accepted 
by school staff. For instance, peer-to-peer initiatives, 
such as the peace makers, was well received by  pilot 
schools. Coordination councils saw the peace makers 
initiative as innovative and fairly easy to implement.  
The restorative justice approach, however, which 
was meant to be a cornerstone of the Programme, 
was more difficult for school staff to understand and 
implement.    This, in part, is because the educational 
system has a long-held tradition of imposing punitive 
sanctions on students who violate school’s rules, 
which is in contrast to the concept of restorative 
justice. 
 
On average, respondents ranked the Programme’s 
capacity building activities as a 7.6 on a 10-point 
scale.  (1=not effective to 10=very effective). More 
specifically, school principals and coordination 
council members  from Iskar (mean=9.8), Teteven 
(mean=9.3) and Kustendil (mean=9.2) ranked the 
capacity building trainings as very effective, whereas 
those from Sofia (mean=6.3) were less likely to rank 
the capacity building trainings as very effective.  
  
Mentors and school staff felt that teachers, students 
and parents benefited, to varying degrees, from the 
Programme. At the time that the evaluation was 
conducted, most pilot schools were in the early 
stages of introducing students to the Programme 
because implementation was delayed due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers were still learning 
how to teach the Programme’s curriculum to 
students. In addition, teachers faced difficulties when 
it came to finding time to integrate the Programme’s 
curriculum into their teaching. The number of 
courses that form teachers could use to teach the 
Programme’s curriculum was limited each semester 
 
Many students, particularly at the middle and high 
school levels, thought the Programme had no impact 
on changing students behaviours, particularly the 
behaviours of students who are aggressive and 
bullying. There were, however, some students who 
thought that the Programme helped to reduce some 
conflicts among students, but more so among 
students who were not known troublemakers and do 
not have a reputation of being aggressive or bullying. 
High school students seemed to be less interested in 
the Programme because they perceived the content 
and materials to be more appropriate for younger 
students, except for students who were involved in 
the peace makers initiative.  
 
School staff had a difficult time in seeing  the benefits 
of the Programme for parents because it was difficult 
for them to engage parents in the Programme, 
including to identify one or two parents who were 
willing to serve on the coordination council.  FGDs 
with parents with children in primary, middle and 
high school grades revealed that most parents were 
not fully aware of the Programme, nor did they 
understand the Programme and its content.   
Nevertheless, many parents believed that a 
Programme focused on creating a safe school 
environment and preventing school violence and 
bullying is very important, but they want it to be 
substantive and to have a real impact. 
 
Impact  
 
As part of the Programme, UNICEF mentors received 
capacity building from UNICEF; after which, mentors 
delivered capacity building trainings and provided 
technical assistance to school staff in the pilot schools 
to implement the Programme.  Due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, most of these trainings were delivered 
online in two- to three-hour training sessions; which 
was different from what was originally planned (i.e., 
face-to-face trainings). This was a challenge for 
everyone involved in the Programme, as they were 
not accustomed to delivering or receiving capacity 
building training online, and school staff were 
overwhelmed by online teaching and distance 
learning, which was leading to burnout. 
 
The majority of respondents were satisfied, at least 
to some degree, with the Programme.  On average, 
respondents ranked their level of satisfaction with 
the Programme as an 8.7 on a 10-point scale (1=not 
satisfied to 10=very satisfied).  More specifically, 
school staff from Iskar (mean=10.0) and Kustendil 
(mean=9.3) were most likely to report being very 
satisfied with the Programme, followed by school 
staff from Sofia (mean=8.1) and Teteven (mean=8.0), 
whereas school staff from Zavet (mean=7.3) were 
least likely to be very satisfied with the Programme. 
 
Programme 
implementation 
was 
negatively 
impacted by challenges and barriers, including: 
difficulties findings time and space to teach the 
Programme’s curriculum; teacher did not feel 
comfortable 
and/or 
confident 
teaching 
the 
Programme’s curriculum; not all teachers were 
motivated to implement the Programme; school staff 
faced challenges engaging and communicating with 
parents; and many teachers held negative attitudes 
toward parents and expressed an ‘us against them’ 
mentality.

Efficiency  
 
This evaluation was unable to evaluate the 
Programme’s efficiency in terms of measuring how 
economically resources and inputs (i.e., funds, 
expertise, time) were converted into results, nor 
could it determine if there would have been a more 
cost-effective way to achieve results. UNIEF put a 
notable amount of time and resources into planning, 
implementation and coordination of the Programme.  
From start to finish, with the support of mentors, 
UNICEF tried to tailor implementation strategies to 
each of the five pilot schools - Sofia, Teteven, 
Kustendil, Iskar and Zavet. Despite all of these efforts, 
there was still room for improvement. 
 
UNICEF was able to adapt and change to meet the 
needs of each of the pilot schools, particularly during 
the COVID-19 pandemic.  The pandemic significantly 
influenced the Programme’s implementation and 
made engaging school staff and students much more 
difficult as teachers were struggling to teach online 
and students’ were having a difficult time with 
distance learning. 
 
UNICEF had a monitoring and reporting approach to 
support Programme  management.  UNICEF had a 
monitoring and reporting approach for Programme 
management, that was aligned with the RMF.  In 
general, the focus was on documenting progress 
made toward implementing activities, and pre-
defined 
indicators. 
Monitoring 
reports 
and 
documents were predominately in Bulgarian, 
however, the mid-terms assessment that covered the 
period of September 2019-2021 was shared with the 
lead evaluator. UNICEF also invested in Programme 
oversight, including baseline and endline studies, but 
these were qualitative in nature and scope. Although 
there is room for improvement, however, when it 
comes to the monitoring and reporting framework 
for this Programme,  
 
This evaluation found that there has been significant 
progress made in some of the pilot schools and their 
staff recognize the importance of the Programme 
 
Sustainability  
 
There is limited evidence that the Programme will be 
sustainable after only two-years of implementation. 
Moreover, there are challenges and barriers to 
Programme implementation that need to be address 
 
13 During the finalization of this evaluation report, the 
UNICEF Programme Coordinator stressed that it depends 
on the leadership style of the school principal. In the 
Programme, mentors observed in some pilot schools school 
principals over delegated Programme responsibilities of 
for the Programme to be sustainable. This includes 
revisions and enhancement to Programme-related 
materials and strengthening of the capacities of 
school personnel to implement the Programme and a 
whole of school approach, in cooperation with 
students and parents, and ongoing support of the 
mentors. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED 
 
There were several lessons learned to consider if 
there are plans going forward to scale-up the 
Programme, and could be relevant in other countries 
where there are plans to implement school-based 
programmes focused on preventing school violence 
and bullying.  Lessons learned include: 
 
• 
For the Programme to be properly and 
effectively implemented, school principals need 
to be committed to the Programme and the 
whole 
school 
approach 
to 
Programme 
implementation.  In keeping, school principals 
need to serve as role models to school staff and 
communicate 
and 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment to the Programme, and ensure that 
all school staff are capacitated to implement the 
Programme.  
• 
School principals need to delegate some 
responsibilities 
for 
coordination 
and 
implementation of the Programme to school 
staff, particularly coordination councils and 
teachers 
who 
are 
committed 
to 
the 
Programme.13 
The 
Programme’s 
success 
depends, in part, on coordination councils 
willingness to implement the Programme and 
apply the Mechanism.  
• 
In Bulgaria, educational institutions and school 
staff are slow to change their approaches to 
engaging with and teaching students, and 
addressing anti-social and behavioural problems 
of students; thus, efforts to ‘win the hearts and 
minds’ of school staff to implement the 
Programme requires significant capacity building 
and technical assistance, a demonstration of 
results, and proper allocations of time in weekly 
teaching schedules.   
• 
The majority of school staff need to be properly 
capacitated and mentored to implement the 
Programme and to work together as a team to 
implement the Programme as a whole school 
approach. A whole school approach will increase 
the responsibility and engagement of all school 
the school principal to a few active and experienced 
teachers who were also engaged in other school 
programmes; as a result, these teachers soon  burnt out or 
shifted their focus away from the Programme and only to 
implementing their formal duties.
