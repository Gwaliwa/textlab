Executive summary 
This report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations of the evaluation 
of the UNICEF Bulgaria Country Programme (CP) 2018-2022. The evaluation is part of the Multi-country 
Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, covering 
UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine, with a focus on relevance, 
coherence, and impact.    
Overview of the Country Programme 2018 – 2022 
The overall goal of the UNICEF CP 2018-2022 is to assist Bulgaria to “ensure that all of its children and 
adolescents, particularly the most disadvantaged, enjoy their rights and develop to their full potential 
in an inclusive and protective society that respects their voice”.1  
The CP has four mutually reinforcing core Outcomes: 1) Early Childhood Development (ECD) and child 
care, 2) Inclusive education and early learning, 3) Prevention of violence, protection of victims and the 
promotion of access to justice for all children and 4) Partnerships for child rights.  
Outcome 1 focuses on: the development of child-focused policies and programmes for family support 
and social inclusion; the improvement of national policies for ECD; the improvement of coordination 
between the health, social and child protection sectors on ECD; and increased access to quality and 
holistic services. Outcome 2 aims to increase access to better quality and inclusive education services.  
Outcome 3 aims to decrease social tolerance for violence against children; strengthen the commitment 
of Bulgaria’s Government and Parliament to legislative reform on children in conflict with the law, child 
victims and witnesses of violence and crime; and strengthen the prevention systems for violence against 
children. Outcome 4 supports the generation and use of evidence to promote child rights; the 
strengthening of partnerships among key stakeholders; and raising awareness about the situation of 
children in Bulgaria, with a firm focus on reaching the most vulnerable groups and reducing the 
discrimination, stigmatization and negative social norms that often shape their lives. 
The CP Updated Strategy Note 2020 places more emphasis on emphasizes the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized children and on closing existing gaps in child rights realization. The document emphasizes 
the importance of Communication for Behavioural and Social Change (C4BSC) to promote solidarity and 
to counter the impact of discriminatory public attitudes, public hate speech and anti-human rights 
movements, and mobilize public and private support.  
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UNICEF Bulgaria Country Office (CO) has added five new 
COVID-19-related indicators to outputs in three areas: support for ECD; support to reduce school 
dropout; and support for the prevention of (and response to) violence against children and gender-
based violence.2 
Purpose of the evaluation and its audience 
This strategic evaluation aims to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme 
Document (CPD) by understanding the strategies used by the CO to drive changes for children, 
particularly those who are the most vulnerable. It draws lessons from the activities undertaken in order 
to enhance results in the future. At the same time, the evaluation aims to strengthen UNICEF’s 
accountability to its national stakeholders.  
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. 
Secondary users are the Government of Bulgaria, UN agencies and development partners with a 
presence in Bulgaria. The evaluation builds on the agreements made among these partners and aims to 
assist the establishment of strategies for their future collaboration, as the parties move together into the 
next planning and programme cycle. 
Evaluation context 
The evaluation was conducted in a context marked by a complex political context, as a result of political 
instability (with three parliamentary  and one presidential elections held in 2021), and also movements

opposing to human rights. In addition, the country had to contend with the impact of the global COVID-
19 pandemic, which reduced access to education for many children, including the most marginalized, 
increased domestic violence and triggered an economic crisis.  
This challenging context added to an already difficult situation for many children in Bulgaria. In 2019, 
38.6 per cent of Bulgarian children were at risk of poverty before social transfers, and 27.5 per cent after 
transfers3 (close to half a million children). Every fifth Bulgarian child lives in severe material 
deprivation (close to 250,000 children).4 
In the recent years, the anti-human and anti-child rights narrative of some political parties and extremist 
groups, gained strong momentum in Bulgaria, impeding key children-related strategic and legislative 
changes, including adoption of the UNICEF-supported National Strategy for the Child 2019-2030. 
Moreover, in the context of Covid19 crises, anti-Roma public and politic rhetoric increased, in some 
cases even officials being engaged in this kind of discriminatory acts.  
While the regulatory framework for children has been through significant reforms in recent years, the 
necessary enforcement is lacking. In line with this, the low enforcement of children rights has been 
recognized by some stakeholders as a serious challenge to Bulgaria’s overall regulatory stability. As 
confirmed by the Situation Analysis of Children’s Rights in Bulgaria conducted in 2020, in the area of 
Justice for Children, the low level of enforcement is inconsistent, because the authorities adopt a 
discriminatory approach towards crimes with a gender element, including domestic violence or rape, 
leading to biased prosecutions. Moreover, in the case of the Social Services Act adoption many 
interviewed stakeholders expressed their concern regarding the extent to which its implementation will 
be effective (taking into consideration the political will, the administrative capacity of responsible 
bodies and the available specialized human resources). 
There are also regional disparities – and particularly at municipal level – in the provision of services to 
address vulnerability, minimize dependency, and prevent the intergenerational cycle of poverty and 
social exclusion, both in terms of the types of services available and capacity for service provision 
Bulgaria’s social protection system in the country remains fragmented with considerable gaps in 
coverage, especially for people in the bottom 20 per cent in terms of their income. Many families are not 
accessing the services and benefits that are available or the support they are offered may not meet their 
needs. 5  
Evaluation methodology 
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC) 
developed by the UNICEF Bulgaria CO. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD DAC6 
criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. The evaluation criterion of sustainability is also covered to 
a certain extent by the evaluation, under the wider impact criterion. An Evaluation Matrix was 
developed during the inception phase to map out evaluation questions and sub-questions, judgement 
criteria, data collection methods and data sources.  
An in-depth impact assessment was undertaken for three selected areas: early childhood development, 
inclusive education for children with disabilities, and violence against children, to provide lessons on 
UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. Other important evaluation 
methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder analysis and a social network analysis. The 
evaluation also uses systems-based evaluation principles. 
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, requiring a wide-ranging document review and 
consultations with 24 key informant interviewees at national, regional and local level. The CO supported 
the identification of respondents who were consulted using semi-structured interviews. They included 
interviewees from UNICEF, government entities, UN agencies and other development agencies, and civil

society organizations (CSOs). In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social 
network analysis.  
The evaluation methodology fully considered the ethical obligations of evaluators. Child rights, equity 
and gender were key issues throughout the evaluation process. 
Key findings 
Relevance 
The analysis shows that UNICEF has been relevant in addressing the changing needs of the most 
vulnerable children in Bulgaria throughout the implementation of its CP, and that the equity focus of the 
programme is being well defined and applied. The evaluation finds that the Country Programme 
Document (CPD) is fully aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the observations of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018–2021) and the Council of 
Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2016–2021).  
First, the CP targets vulnerable groups through the models or pilots envisaged, and their 
implementation has generated observable results for the most marginalized, hard-to-reach families and 
children. Second, the CO has prioritized the generation of evidence on child rights realization in Bulgaria, 
with technical support to ministries and advocacy activities based on the studies that have been 
developed.  
Third, UNICEF adjusted its activities to ensure a timely respond to the challenges caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic. The CO has conducted studies and analyses on the impact of the pandemic on children’s 
lives and has supported the government, local public actors and other stakeholders in providing access 
for children and their families to relevant information and vital services, including health and education. 
UNICEF also adjusted its strategies to respond to the growth in anti-human rights movement and 
discriminatory public narratives. The aim has been to achieve further results for the most marginalized 
children, but the response has been cautious rather than proactive, in the sense that the CO used several 
entry-points (such as domestic violence policy and practice opportunities) as to be able to promote child 
rights realization, being careful regarding the generalized negative perspective) on social protection 
services, promoting rights of children from Roma communities or on early childhood development legal 
framework. The evaluation found that this approach provided UNICEF Bulgaria CO the opportunity to 
maintain and strengthen their partnership with the government and also, maintain its status at national 
level as a key actor promoting child-rights realization.  
UNICEF addresses gender equality to some extent in all aspects of its programming and implementation. 
While some planned actions address specific gender-related needs (such as the prevention of child 
marriages in Roma communities, and gender-sensitive statistics on violence against children), there are 
CP areas where the gender equality principle is not explicit in the programming or design phases (such 
as ECD). 
Coherence 
The UNICEF Bulgaria CPD remains true to its mandate to ensure the rights of all children to survival, 
development, protection and participation and has been prepared and implemented in line with 
UNICEF’s global and regional strategies.  
The evaluation finds that UNICEF has strong credibility among all CP stakeholders and is well-
acknowledged as the primary defender of child rights in Bulgaria. UNICEF – with its accumulated 
knowledge, experience and expertise at the global, regional and national level – has gained the trust of 
all social and economic actors as a facilitator for policy dialogue across the public, private and civil 
sectors. UNICEF is perceived as a reliable partner that supports the government and strengthens its role 
in the fields of health, education and protection.  
The overall partnership network developed by UNICEF Bulgaria CO can be defined as a relatively strong 
community, with various connections with actors from different sectors, such us governmental bodies, 
public agencies and institutes, CSOs, local authorities, and UN agencies and other international 
organizations. According to the data collected through interviews and the findings of the social network

analysis, the most stable and strong type of partnership is the one established with governmental 
bodies, followed by the partnerships with CSOs.  Building strong partnerships, it has translated into 
programmatic work that allow the CO to provide technical support to governmental bodies and other 
implementing partners, conduct evidence-based advocacy, and develop and demonstrative models to 
be brought to scale.  
UNICEF has commissioned or supported the collection of evidence through numerous research and 
studies, including research to inform the design of activities under outcome areas and generate valuable 
data on vulnerable and marginalized children. The UNICEF CO has used the evidence gathered to review 
and revise its strategic partnerships with a view to: 1) engage more academia in partnerships; 2) 
enhance collaboration with the regional or local service units that are gaining importance and focus on 
special groups (such as children from Roma community); 3) strengthen partnerships with the media for 
fundraising campaigns and to advance the application of the C4BSC approach; and 4) develop strategic 
partnerships to engage the private sector in common projects and leverage resources for children. 
Impact 
UNICEF actions have generated changes in the legislative framework for ECD, child protection and 
justice for children. The adoption of the New Social Act, for example, represents significant progress at 
the national level on the promotion and realization of child rights in social protection and justice for 
children.  
Other legislative improvements that have been achieved with UNICEF’s contribution include: the 
development of the National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020; 
the adoption of the National Strategy for Promoting Equality between Women and Men for the period 
2021-2030; the adoption of the amendments of the Law on Asylum and Refugees and the amendments 
of the Regulations and the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria.  
While UNICEF has also helped to enhance cross-sectoral cooperation, the impact remains limited to the 
tested models, such as the Home-Visiting Service (HVS) or Child Advocacy Centers models. There are 
also concerns about the continuation of such cooperation after the end of the projects. However, the 
models developed and implemented by UNICEF have proven to be very effective in improving the 
quality of integrated support services provided for children and their families in all CP areas. They have 
also helped to change the attitudes and behaviors of parents (in terms of the child care provided) and 
teachers (contributing to a more inclusive school environment). Through the Family Consultative 
Centers and HVS models, UNICEF has provided effective alternative care and support solutions to 
support the deinstitutionalization process in Bulgaria. But, without the national expansion of such pilots, 
their limited impact in terms of the numbers of people who benefit cannot generate a significant at-scale 
change in the lives of children in Bulgaria. 
Data and other information collected by the evaluation team demonstrate that the CP and its 
implementation took into account the specific needs of different groups of children. Although most of 
the interventions are designed to provide universal impact for all children, in practice they tend to target 
and offer support for the most marginalized children. They achieve results, mainly, for these groups.  
The CP documents include strategies to address the most critical bottlenecks. Comprehensive situation 
and needs assessments, surveys and evaluation studies suggest that UNICEF Bulgaria take a proactive 
approach to the identification of risks at different stages of the interventions, and uses different 
monitoring mechanisms to revisit these risks and identify mitigation measures.   
Nevertheless, the bottlenecks that were initially identified have persisted over time and some have 
become serious threats to the efforts of the CO to achieve results at scale. Therefore, the sustainability 
of many CP outcomes is highly dependent on political will, existing institutional arrangements, and 
capacities at national and local level. As noted, UNICEF Bulgaria collaborates successfully with different 
government bodies. However, the prospects for the sustainability of the results achieved to date are 
uncertain. given the current political instability, strong opposition to human rights, constant changes in 
the policy agenda on children rights, weak cross-sectoral cooperation, fragmented institutional 
practices and limited capacities (especially at local level).

The evaluation found that CPD logic of the intervention lacks in coherence. While, many outcomes and 
outputs indicators define impacts rather than results, the causal links between outcome level and output 
level is week. Thus, in some cases, the expected outputs could not significantly contribute to the related 
outcome.  
Conclusions 
The evaluation finds that UNICEF is well-positioned to assume a pivotal role in persuading actors from 
different sectors to engage in concerted efforts to produce results for children. Building on this strength, 
the CO has widened the scope and content of its partnerships when faced with political resistance to 
child rights, to ensure the continued promotion of these rights without compromising its strategic 
partnerships with the Government of Bulgaria and line ministries at the central and local level.  
In this context, the evaluation shows that the CO has successfully addressed important and pressing 
needs of children in the country, especially for groups of vulnerable children, and has supported policy 
and institutional development for their benefit. UNICEF’s efforts to improve the situation for the most 
marginalized children is well documented, with most CPD outputs focusing on specific groups of 
disadvantaged children, such us children in residential care; children living in poverty; Roma children; 
children with disabilities and/or at risk of developmental difficulties; child victims of violence; children 
in conflict with the law; and refugee and migrant children.  
An important contribution identified by the evaluation has been the CO’s provision of effective technical 
support for the development of the legislative framework in all areas of the CP. The available evidence 
shows important progress in the realization of child rights in most areas where the CO works.  
UNICEF has, for example, made significant contributions to the process of deinstitutionalization and 
solutions for alternative care, as well as support and counselling for parents from disadvantaged and 
vulnerable groups. Its contribution to improving the legislative framework for child rights realization in 
Bulgaria is well documented. Nevertheless, UNICEF should pursue its work in this area and provide 
direct support for implementation through its available means. The process is long-term and the 
changes that should be generated at-scale at the level of children’s lives will only be observable in time 
(see Recommendation 1). 
The evidence collected for the evaluation shows that the modeling components of the CP have been very 
effective. The projects implemented have strengthened cooperation between duty bearers, and have 
improved the quality of services for children in marginalized areas or children in precarious living 
situations, in the areas of social protection, health and education. They have also increased access to 
proper educational services for children with special educational needs and have improved the 
knowledge, attitudes and practices of parents, especially those from the most remote and marginalized 
settings. Additionally, these models have improved access to justice for children in contact with the law, 
as well as access to specialized case-tailored services for child victims of neglect, abuse and violence or 
for children at risk.  
UNICEF has also contributed to the development of human resource capacity (such as social workers, 
teachers and prosecutors) at the level of local public authorities and other public bodies involved in pilot 
initiatives. As noted, the impact of UNICEF’s work can be observed mainly among disadvantaged 
children, and analysis of the results at-scale of UNICEF CO Bulgaria in the period of 2018 – 2020/2021 
indicates that the effects do go (to a limited extent) beyond the geographic areas where the pilot 
programmes are implemented.  
Nevertheless, there has been less progress on the objective of scaling up these pilots, and their impact 
remains limited to the geographic areas where they are implemented.  Most of these interventions 
remain rather small in scale and local in scope.   The data collected indicate that the provision of 
integration could not be delivered to the same level of quality or intensity without the support of UNICEF 
because of an ongoing lack of institutional capacity, and long-term impact is limited by the unclear 
strategy to engage the government in the scaling-up of pilot projects (see Recommendations 3, 5 and 
7).

A shift towards a more preventive approach and “positive messaging on child well-being and good 
practice of the realization of children’s rights” was taken. However, there is room of improvement as 
regards CO involvement in better addressing public prejudices and to tackle both the strong anti-child 
propaganda and violation of child-rights. While UNICEF Bulgaria CO managed to generate results for 
children’s lives (through the demonstrative models developed and regulatory and legislative changes 
supported), the extent to which the new adopted legislation will be enforced or the current legislative 
framework will be further improved depends also on the evolution of this movement.  (see 
Recommendations 2 and 3). 
The evaluation found that the overall programming approach demonstrates gender sensitivity, with two 
gender-related interventions: (1) prevention of child marriages in some of the most vulnerable Roma 
communities and activities to empower the girls at risk; (2) interventions on violence against children. 
In addition, gender responsiveness and gender mainstreaming are incorporated into the 
implementation of other CP components (such as the HVS, parenting support programmes and the 
capacity building of frontline workers on ECD). However, UNICEF’s gender priorities are insufficiently 
clear and most stakeholders do not distinguish the gender equality aspect of its work. One serious 
limitation is the lack of disaggregated data by gender in all cases; there are few gender-sensitive 
indicators within UNICEF’s monitoring system (see Recommendation 6).  
In addition to the gaps identified in the evidence to support UNICEF’s contributions to changes at 
national level, the evaluation identified a series of inconsistencies in the CP logic of intervention, as well 
as gaps in the CP performance framework (see Recommendations 8). 
Lessons learned 
UNICEF has adjusted its strategies to continue its work, despite the negative public discourse and 
movements that affect the realization of human and child rights in Bulgaria. As a result, the CO learned 
that there should be a balance between the extent to which its shifts its strategy to address the needs of 
most vulnerable children and the expected results. UNICEF have used several entry-points to promote 
the realization of child rights, being cautious in the face of negative perspectives, disseminated by 
Bulgaria’s media, on social protection, on the rights of children from Roma communities, and the legal 
framework for ECD. As a lesson learned, UNICEF has understood that a more proactive approach is 
needed to advance its work. It has, for example, tried to find sources of funding through which to target 
the Roma population directly and has, therefore, managed to advance its work through the European 
Union Child Guarantee programme. 
Perhaps the most important lesson learned by the CO is the need for more efforts on in the scale-up of 
models. Without the development of a scaling-up strategy, agreed with all duty bearers in the early 
stages of the project, the prospects of public institutions taking up the intervention remain unclear, 
mainly due to a lack of public financial resources. Experience has revealed the challenges to the pilot 
model used by UNICEF, and the CO needs to address sustainability from the outset.  
As a result of the first three years of the CP implementation, the CO has realized that it should do more 
to build upon the status of Bulgaria as a EU Member State and align more closely with EU priorities, to 
position itself as a strategic partner for the government in using EU funds to improve the situation of 
children in Bulgaria. UNICEF has worked to support the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee in 
Bulgaria, and to leverage the available funds to improve access for the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized children to quality, integrated services.  
Another lesson learned relates to the strategy adopted by the CO when developing partnership with the 
business sector. Experience has shown that UNICEF’s usual approach to the fundraising component of 
the CP does not achieve the same impact when engaging with the private sector. In addition, the CO aims 
to create partnerships beyond fundraising and to engage the business community in a more strategic 
way, with interventions developed together and resources leverages on a more sustainable basis. There 
is, therefore, a need for a more structured and focused strategy on the development of partnerships with 
the business sector.  
UNICEF has reacted in a timely and effective way to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, with support 
to the government to contain the impact on children’s lives. UNICEF provided support that 
complemented the work of the government, as seen in pre-school education, where UNICEF has 

 
 
9
provided technical and IT support for children and teachers to help them continue the educational 
process. Nevertheless, as the CO observed, there is still a pressing need to improve the quality and 
coverage of data on the effects of the crisis on the most disadvantaged children. The inconsistency of the 
national monitoring system on child rights has influenced the capacity of public institutions and UNICEF 
to addresses the specific needs of the most marginalized children in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic.  Therefore, the improvement of the monitoring system remains a priority for the 
development of well-grounded and effective policies. 
Recommendations 
The evaluation team formulated eight recommendations based on the findings and conclusions of the 
evaluation report. These cover four main areas of action:  policy advocacy (from a sustainability 
perspective); partnership building and cross-sectoral cooperation; programming; and monitoring.  
The team has developed a set of indicative measures (institutional, programmatic and operational), that 
can be used by the CO to guide the effective implementation of these recommendations, which are 
presented in the main report. 
Policy advocacy  
Recommendation 1. Continue to conduct advocacy activities and provide technical assistance to 
improve the legal framework, support the development of law enforcement documents and continue to 
follow-up on their implementation. 
Partnership building and inter-sectoral cooperation 
Recommendation 2. Continue to strengthen partnerships with both the government and key 
stakeholders in the country and develop partnerships with other international organizations and other 
UN agencies in a more strategic way. 
Recommendation 3. Continue to support and facilitate the development of cross-sectoral cooperation at 
all levels and all areas addressed by the CPD.  
Programming  
Recommendation 4. Prioritize specific objectives under each area of the CPD to focus more resources on 
one single aim and to develop more coherent strategies for actions (this recommendation should be 
considered together with recommendation 5). 
Recommendation 5. For results-at-scale, plan comprehensive activities that combine advocacy 
activities, technical assistance for improved financing/budgeting and support for capacity building 
(training, leadership development, procedures, and development of IT capacity) 
Recommendation 6. Integrate equity and gender equality into all CP outcomes (where relevant). 
Recommendation 7. Embed sustainability into the design of pilot interventions, including follow-up 
plans, handover and exit strategies, and arrangements for scaling-up. 
Monitoring 
Recommendation 8. Define the indicator framework of the CPD and the monitoring process to better 
record the actions and the results of the UNICEF CO.
