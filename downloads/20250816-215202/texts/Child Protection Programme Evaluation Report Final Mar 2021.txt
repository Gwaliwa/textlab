 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
1.1. 
Evaluation purpose and scope 
In January 2020 UNICEF Ghana engaged Coram International to conduct a Formative and Summative Evaluation of 
its Child Protection Programme, covering programming from January 2012 to December 2019, across two 
programme cycles (2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022). The purpose of the evaluation is to support learning and decision-
making to improve child protection outcomes for girls and boys in Ghana: to hold UNICEF accountable for its 
contributions to child protection outcomes; to clarify the changes in child protection in Ghana that have been 
brought about by UNICEF’s programme; and to determine whether the current programme has the right strategic 
focus to contribute to strengthening the child protection system moving forward. The UNICEF Ghana Country Office 
is the primary intended user of the evaluation. Other users include the UNICEF Regional Office for West and Central 
Africa, the Government of Ghana, other UN agencies and NGOs, and development partners. 
The evaluation's geographical scope is expansive, covering programming across Ghana at both national and sub-
national (regional, metropolitan and district) levels. It generates evidence in relation to 4 of the 6 evaluation criteria 
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Development Assistance Committee 
(OECD/DAC), namely: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability.1 In addition to these criteria, the 
evaluation methodology incorporates UNICEF’s guiding principles of gender, human rights and equity.  
1.2. 
Methodology 
The evaluation employed a mixed methodology, drawing on the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative data, 
whilst increasing opportunities for triangulation. In addition to drawing on existing evidence, the evaluation 
involved the collection of a significant body of primary data. Data collection methods included: 
- 
A standardised survey with social welfare officers and community development officers at district level 
(n=120) to gather evidence on their child protection response work. Professionals were surveyed across 30 
districts that received interventions from UNICEF and 30 ‘comparison’ districts; 
- 
A KAP survey of both children and adults (n=1022), designed to investigate changes in the knowledge, 
attitudes and practices (KAP) of communities targeted by UNICEF’s social and behaviour change 
interventions. The survey was designed to identify changes in KAP which had occurred since a 2013 
baseline. It was administered in areas where UNICEF has conducted community engagement work, as well 
as in selected ‘comparison’ districts which had not received interventions; 
- 
Key informant interviews (n= 159) with stakeholders at national, regional and district level; 
- 
In-depth life history interviews (n = 87) with children and their caregivers whose cases had been subject 
to a child protection intervention; 
- 
Reviews of case files (n=80) maintained by district social welfare officers; 
- 
Focus group discussions (n=242) with community members to gather qualitative evidence on attitudes 
and norms around child protection issues. 
Strict ethical guidelines were followed at all stages of the data collection and analysis. 
1.3. 
Findings and Preliminary Conclusions 
Relevance of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme 
Evaluation findings demonstrate a strong alignment between UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme’s design and 
approaches and the Government of Ghana’s priorities in relation to violence against children, evidenced by an 
analysis of GoG policies and plans, as well as interviews with Government representatives. UNICEF’s contributions 
to strengthening the legal and policy framework for child protection and building the capacity of service providers 
to implement that framework were found to be particularly relevant to national priorities. UNICEF’s commitment 
was demonstrated by its willingness to divert from past approaches where these were not well aligned with needs 
in Ghana.

The Child Protection Programme was also found to be relevant and responsive to the needs of children in Ghana. 
Across research sites, respondents consistently described that UNICEF has taken a consultative approach to 
programming; seeking out beneficiaries’ views and making relevant adjustments to meet their needs better. 
However, evaluation findings suggest that in practice certain groups of children have been more difficult to reach 
than others. In particular, findings suggest that street children require additional support and may have been 
neglected by services delivered through the national child protection system. 
Outcomes and Effectiveness of the Child Protection Programme2 
Effectiveness of National Child Protection System Strengthening 
UNICEF’s child protection programming was found to have made significant contributions to strengthening the 
national child protection system in Ghana. When UNICEF’s 2012 programme cycle began, Ghana lacked an 
institutional framework for the delivery of child protection response services. Recognising this gap, UNICEF worked 
effectively with the Government of Ghana to develop a more strategic vision for child protection work. Significant 
achievements include improvements to the legal and policy framework for children protection, particularly the 
development of the Child and Family Welfare Policy and the Justice for Children Policy, as well as the establishment 
of a comprehensive child protection response service delivered through district administrations as part of a broader 
child protection system. These changes were recognised and valued by respondents, who emphasised the 
importance of building an institutional framework for child protection work.  
Evaluation findings also demonstrate that UNICEF made important contributions to strengthening the capacity of 
social welfare authorities to deliver child protection services. In particular, UNICEF has succeeded in building the 
capacity of district level social welfare staff to deliver child protection response services in line with the 
Government’s case management SOPs. Whilst findings indicate that the application of case management 
procedures is imperfect, a considerable proportion of service providers do report to be following the SOPs when 
responding to CP cases, a significant change from past practice. Furthermore, findings demonstrate the 
effectiveness of UNICEF’s interventions: the implementation of case management procedures was found to be 
consistently stronger in districts that received UNICEF support compared to those that did not.  
The degree to which this improved capacity has translated into outcomes for children exposed to violence or other 
forms of child protection risk is less clear, particularly given that these cases were rarely found to be reaching the 
child protection system. Findings revealed that the vast majority of child protection cases to which district level 
social welfare authorities respond are child maintenance cases, followed by custody cases, and, to a less extent, 
cases of parental neglect and abandonment. These findings are problematic, suggesting that the child protection 
system is not yet fulfilling its core function of identifying and responding to cases where children are exposed to 
violence or at risk of harm.  
The evaluation identified a number of explanations for this trend. VAC cases continue to be handled by the Police 
Service’s Domestic Violence Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU), and in some localities coordination between DOVVSU 
and district social welfare authorities was found to be weak. Meanwhile, effective and reliable referral channels 
between frontline professionals and district level social welfare authorities are lacking in many districts, 
undermining identification of cases where children are at-risk3. Finally, findings point to a number of reporting 
barriers, including stigma around child abuse and attitudes which are accepting of domestic violence, lack of 
awareness of reporting channels and practical barriers, which make accessing services challenging or costly. 
Effectiveness of community mobilisation and behaviour change 
UNICEF’s child protection programme has included a number of behaviour change campaigns and community 
mobilisation efforts, designed to transform attitudes and practices in relation to child protection. At the national 
level this has involved the use of mass and social media to raise awareness, whilst at the local level, interventions 
involved collaboration with local government to deliver a Social and Behaviour Change Communication toolkit. 
UNICEF supported campaigns were found to have achieved an impressive reach: findings from the KAP survey 
indicate that the national ‘Ghanaians Against Child Abuse’ campaign has had widespread coverage in communities 
across Ghana, and 70 per cent of respondents in intervention communities said that they had participated in 
awareness-raising activities. The participatory methodology applied in the application of the toolkit was found to 
 
2 This evaluation covers UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme across all of its many components, however  the executive summary presents 
findings on the effectiveness of two main areas of programming: strengthening the national child protection system and community mobilisation 
and behaviour change.  
3 There is some evidence that districts that have received UNICEF interventions, particularly those that were part of the ‘policy to practice 
initiative’, are more likely to receive referrals from the police, community members and DOVVSU. 

 
 
10
be particularly effective in promoting community engagement, and 99.2 per cent of participants said that they 
would recommend activities to a friend. 
As well as achieving widespread reach and endorsement, analysis of the data from the KAP surveys provides 
evidence that UNICEF’s campaign and mobilisation efforts may be having a significant impact in contributing to 
transforming community norms and behaviours related to child protection. Respondents in the KAP surveys were 
asked a range of questions about their attitudes and practices in relation to a variety of relevant topics, and changes 
in results from baseline (2013) to endline (2020) were compared in both UNICEF intervention4 and non-intervention 
communities. Overall, the findings indicate a significant improvement over time in attitudes and practices across a 
range of issues, including: family separation, violence against children, child marriage, child justice and help seeking 
behaviour. Yet despite the changes which occurred, there were no significant differences in rates of change in 
UNICEF intervention sites compared to comparison sites, making it hard to determine whether changes can be 
directly attributed to UNICEF’s campaign and mobilisation efforts.  
Evidence from the KAP survey suggests that behaviours related to violence against children may be particularly 
‘sticky’, or difficult to shift. Analysis of the data demonstrates a small but significant reduction in rates of violence 
against children from baseline to endline.5  However, there were no significant improvements in rates of violence 
in UNICEF intervention compared to control sites, and rates of change in intervention sites concerning attitudes 
towards corporal punishment and children’s experiences of domestic and emotional violence were found to be 
particularly slow. Whilst social norms endorsing violence against children are widespread and entrenched, drivers 
of violence against children include structural factors such as poverty, low levels of education, lack of opportunity, 
gender inequalities and children’s position of dependency in families and communities. These are complex factors 
that may not be effectively addressed by sensitisation messaging alone. 
Efficiency of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme 
UNICEF’s Child Protection programme was successful in mobilising significant financial resources to support its 
system strengthening approach over both the 2012 – 2017 and 2018 – 2022 programme cycles. This is a notable 
achievement given that UNICEF Country Offices have often struggled to obtain funding for CPSS work, as ‘issue 
based’ programming tends to be more popular amongst donors6. The Child Protection Section was innovative in 
recognising that funding for an ‘issue’ can be incorporated into a system strengthening approach and utilising issue-
based funding to promote their broader systems strengthening objectives.  
A lack of sufficient resources continues to hinder child protection outcomes in Ghana, however. Evaluation findings 
demonstrate that district-level child protection services remain underfunded, resulting in significant disruptions to 
their effective delivery. Adequate funding for local child protection response services is critical to ensuring that 
resources are used efficiently within the child protection system. Without this component of the child protection 
system in place, the efficiency of other investments made by UNICEF, the GoG and other partners, are likely to be 
undermined, as cases are missed and duplication and fragmentation are more likely to occur. UNICEF has 
acknowledged the lack of sufficient resources for frontline social workers, and the Child Protection Programme has 
undertaken initiatives aimed at advocating for budget commitments from Government at central, regional and 
MMDA levels, but significant work remains to be done.  
Sustainability of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme 
Evaluation findings suggest that many programme outcomes have been institutionalised, enshrined in law, policy 
or practice, and are therefore likely to continue even after programming ends or changes its focus. Evidence also 
demonstrates that the GoG is increasingly taking ownership of programme activities. The next step in promoting 
sustainable child protection outcomes is to ensure that policy level achievements translate into effective child 
protection prevention and response services on the ground. This will require the GoG to commit sufficient funds to 
service delivery and highlights the need for UNICEF to continue to prioritise achieving budget commitments from 
the government. 
UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made considerable contributions to building the capacity of  Ghanaian 
government counterparts at national and sub-national levels, and this support was found to have resulted in 
genuine improvements in the abilities and practices of beneficiaries. UNICEF’s programme design has been

conducive to sustaining capacities in the longer term. UNICEF developed materials, manuals and tools, which can 
continue to be used by relevant agencies going forward, and, wherever possible, supported the integration of 
training materials into national curricula to ensure their continued use. Whilst is too early to comment definitively 
on the sustainability of capacities generated through the Programme, findings clearly indicate that they have the 
potential to continue after the Programme’s conclusion.  
Gender equality7 
Efforts have been made to mainstream gender in the child protection programme by recruiting a dedicated gender 
specialist and developing a Child Protection Programme Gender Strategy for the 2018-22 programme.8 While child 
protection responses are evenly split by gender, the low number of child abuse cases overall suggests that a 
significant proportion of cases involving violence, neglect and abuse are not receiving an appropriate response, a 
phenomenon likely to affect girls more seriously than boys given their higher vulnerability. Whilst social and 
behaviour change programming has raised awareness of gender equality and shifted some norms, particularly those 
related to women’s economic empowerment and child marriage, much work remains to be done to address 
entrenched norms and to reduce the high levels of violence reported by girls in Ghana.  
1.4. 
Lessons learned 
A number of ‘lessons learned’ emerged from the evaluation, which can be used to inform future programming: 
1. Legal reform is more likely to be successful when it is evidence based, drawing on analysis of existing laws, solid 
empirical evidence on the issues at stake and consultation and engagement with stakeholders. 
2. Building a fully functioning child protection system requires sufficient resourcing, a continuum of services, 
monitoring and oversight and community engagement in addition to a legislative and institutional framework; it 
requires a long-term commitment to realise.  
3. The identification and referral of suspected child abuse cases is an essential step in child protection system 
building and requires both effective referral processes and widespread training and awareness-raising. 
4. Strengthening prevention and early intervention can promote an effective, efficient and sustainable child 
protection system. Acting early when risk is first identified can prevent cases from reaching crisis point. 
5. Coordination amongst different bodies with child protection duties and roles is key to ensuring effective 
implementation of the child protection system and delivering outcomes for children. 
6. In contexts where particular forms of violence are normalised, shifting attitudes and practices requires that 
sensitisation messaging be integrated with other programming approaches (social welfare, livelihoods, etc). 
7. Building an effective foster care service requires appropriate funding for foster families and sufficient support 
from a social service workforce. 
8. Gender empowerment programming may produce unintended consequences and must be done sensitively in 
order to avoid reinforcing stigma or discrimination. 
1.5. 
Final Conclusions 
The findings of this evaluation demonstrate that UNICEF Ghana’s Child Protection Programme has made significant 
contributions to strengthening the national child protection system in Ghana. In addition to being well aligned with 
UNICEF’s global strategies, the programme’s system strengthening approach was found to be highly relevant in the 
Ghanaian context. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme has made significant contributions to addressing gaps in 
Ghana’s child protection system. A number of important outcomes of this work include: institutionalising a social 
welfare workforce at the district level and building the capacity of that workforce to deliver child protection 
response services; establishing frameworks for alternative care and justice reform and models for service delivery, 
and building duty bearer’s capacity to implement those frameworks and models, and supporting the delivery of 
community mobilisation and awareness campaigns which achieved remarkable coverage and high levels of public 
approval; amongst many others. The Child Protection Programme employed an efficient design and was effective 
in mobilising resources across diverse partners and stakeholders. Many of its achievements are likely to remain after 
programming has ended or changed focus, and the programme’s capacity building work has generated capacities
