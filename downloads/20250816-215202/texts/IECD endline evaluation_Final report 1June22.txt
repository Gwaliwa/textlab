ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  
 
The Mekong Development Research Institute has been commissioned by UNICEF Viet Nam 
to conduct this endline survey and final programme evaluation during April – December 2021, 
with the great support and insightful inputs from UNICEF Viet Nam.  
We are thankful to the representatives from MOLISA, MOH, MOET, World Vision, Child Fund, 
Save the Children, and other relevant stakeholders in project provinces, districts, and 
communes for finding time to meet with the evaluators and sharing your reflections on the 
programme.  
The research team is grateful to the Project Management Units of the Integrated Early 
Childhood Development in 3 project provinces and 27 communes for their strong support 
during the field work. In particular, thanks are due to Mr. Luong Van Kien (PMU Dien Bien), 
Mr. Nguyen Dinh Bac (PMU Kon Tum), and Ms. Nguyen Thi Tuyet Nga (PMU Gia Lai), for their 
active collaboration. We would also like to extend our gratitude to the IECD program focal 
points whose coordination and facilitation really smooth the process of data collection – Ms. 
Tran Thi Hoa, Mr. Chu Quyet Tien, Mr. Van Tien Thu, and Mr Phan Van Hoi. 
We appreciate the participation of every beneficiary household and service provider in our 
endline survey. 
Last but not least, the creation of this report would not have been made possible without the 
contribution of 16 enthusiastic enumerators whose professional experience has helped to 
ensure that our collected data is truthful and always of the highest quality. 
The research team specially thank UNICEF members including the key focal points (Mr. 
Nguyen Dinh Quang, Mr. Nguyen Minh Nhat, Ms. Nguyen Thi Y Duyen) for connecting us with 
the provincial partners, and UNICEF Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Chief – Ms. Ngo Thi 
Quynh Hoa as well as other experts at the technical team for providing important guidance and 
comments on the draft report. We also thank Mr. Oscar Huertas – UNICEF evaluation 
specialist for his constructive feedback and editing.
