EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Background 
Violence against children (VAC) has taken on a new dimension through the various types of online abuse. 
Covid-19 restrictions and developments such as online teaching highlighted the balance between internet 
access and protection of children. The Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children was launched 
by the UN Secretary-General in 2016 with the purpose of accelerating the end to violence against children. 
There are over 360 partners globally, including civil society organizations, governments, foundations, 
corporations, academic institutions, faith communities, and UN agencies. The End Violence Fund has 
invested $32 million in 37 projects for preventing and eliminating online child sexual exploitation and abuse. 
African country partners include South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar, 
and Ghana. 
The UNICEF Global Partnership programme in South Africa aims to reduce high levels of VAC in the 
country and strengthen child protection from online violence through the safe use of the internet. The 
initiative began in May 2018 when UNICEF implemented the programme in partnership with key 
government departments including the Department of Social Development (DSD) and Department of Basic 
Education (DBE). The programme sought to: 
• 
understand the extent of the problem and the gaps in policy and implementation; 
• 
undertake a consultative, participatory and cross-sectoral process to build commitment and ownership 
in addressing the issue; 
• 
identify appropriate prevention and response actions that could be integrated into relevant legislation, 
policy, and capacity-building efforts for service providers; and, 
• 
engage with industry to implement online safety standards and complement this with practical, tested 
interventions to build knowledge and skills of children, caregivers, teachers and communities on online 
safety. 
As this programme was essentially a system programme it did not exclusively work with children (rights-
holders) as the ultimate beneficiaries but focused on capacitating the duty-bearers (those who interact with 
children, provide services to them, develop legislation, and enforce the law). The four main pillars or 
subsystems of the programme included: 
1) Children, families, and communities protect children from online violence and help access services 
when needed 
2) Children benefit from key services that help children stay safe online and respond to the needs of 
child survivors 
3) Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry implements standards and measures 
to prevent and address online violence 
4) National authorities and civil society have increased their knowledge of online safety and their 
commitment to addressing it 
EVALUATION OBJECTIVES  
This is a summative evaluation of the Global End Violence Fund Programme of the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in South Africa. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the aspects of 
relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability and understand progress toward outputs 
and outcomes (see Annex I). Considering these criteria, and describing progress towards output and 
outcome results, only provides a limited picture of the true value of the programme in system transformation. 
Therefore, the evaluation also focused on providing a description and assessment of the system structure 

 
 
 
10 
and dynamics and guides on how to leverage points and processes in the system where children can be 
engaged more effectively. The impact on the ultimate target beneficiaries (children) was not expected at 
this time and so the programme focused on system transformation and programme structure rather than 
longer-term results. As a result, children were not included as respondents. The South African and global 
UNICEF Child Protection units, the Evaluation Reference Group (see Annex II), and the Global Partnership 
to End Violence will use the findings primarily for reflective purposes (see Annex III).  
Evaluation methodology  
A conceptual model of the system structure and programme interventions using a theory of change was 
constructed and used to guide the tracking of results. Integrating traditional evaluation standards 
(relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and reporting on progress) with system 
evaluation criteria (including system structure, boundaries, dynamic, interrelatedness, and leverage points) 
ensured that the evaluation could capture and report on both dimensions.   
The study is a summative, external evaluation. It is descriptive and based on mostly qualitative data. The 
evaluation methods included desk reviews (of programme documents and wider literature), KII, online 
surveys, and secondary data. All ethical principles were applied both during engagements with respondents 
(held remotely due to Covid-19 precautions) and the data management.  
The biggest challenge was the gap in programme monitoring data and recommendations regarding the 
development and implementation of a formal monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system are made. An 
additional challenge included the need for repeat invitations for some parties. Although it was not necessary 
or feasible to include children as participants in this evaluation, this will be critical in the future to ensure 
their engagement when the system is functional and reaching children. 
Key conclusions on findings 
The main systemic conclusion of the evaluation is that the foundation for the system to function was 
established, including system-wide awareness of COS and the generation of essential knowledge and 
training materials. The overall commitment of the stakeholders was raised (except for SAPS, justice, and 
the ICT industry) and the shift from awareness to practical skills and behaviour change is not yet evident.  
Progress towards output and outcome results 
The output results generally exceeded the targets for the programme, although the reported reach of more 
than 1.2 million children needs clarification and disaggregation to reflect on the groups reached and the 
most effective methods used. Peer-to-peer dialogue, the most effective strategy, needs more definition and 
rollout. Training of Trainers for interventions with parents and caregivers, as well as the incorporation of 
modules in existing parenting programmes, all took place. Training of religious leaders raised awareness 
but the influence on the broader communities requires the inclusion of other community groups. 
The most significant contribution was the generation of knowledge for the system through the Disruptive 
Harm research study. The training materials developed (social service workers, educators, SAPS) were of 
high quality, though the training of educators was limited to two districts in the Eastern Cape. The method 
to reach social service workers through accredited online modules for CPD was effective. SAPS and justice 
officials still need to be trained and the guidance of other service providers, such as community-based 
workers, mental and health care workers, and NPA, among others, to children is recommended. 
Commitment on a national level was high for some government departments (including DSD, DBE, and 
FPB) while others would need stronger relationship-building activities and awareness of the implications of 
thinking and working systemically. Civil society, a stakeholder group with a huge potential contribution, was 
not optimally included. Some national child rights NGOs participated in training events but their 
contributions in advocacy, service provision and implementation of programme activities were not evident.  

 
 
 
11 
The outcomes have not been realised at this stage of the programme as the intended results hinge on 
further strengthening of the system. Repeat measures, such as a follow-up Disrupting Harm study and the 
evaluation of the next phase, will provide information on targets reached for outcomes in the future.  
DAC criteria and equity  
The results of the DAC criteria varied between programme components and within the different pillars of 
the programme. Relevance and effectiveness were generally rated high and coherence and sustainability 
low.  
Relevance 
The UNICEF programme was relevant to the time, needs, and situation in South Africa and contributed to 
global efforts. Some components need more directed effort (ICT and service provision) while additional 
government departments and civil society need to be included. The programme was relevant to the reform 
needed in legislation and will expand once the knowledge it generates is disseminated more widely. The 
Disrupting Harm study made a significant contribution locally and internationally. 
Coherence 
The programme’s knowledge generation contributed significantly to global efforts, such as the Global 
Partnership to End Violence alliance’s We Protect programme and the SDG targets 5.2, 8.7, and 16.2. 
However, coherence within the system was low and there was limited collaboration between 
subcomponents and within the components of the programme.  
Effectiveness 
The effectiveness of the programme was linked to knowledge generation. System-wide awareness of COS 
was achieved and although more effort will be needed to roll out the training to other stakeholders not yet 
included in the programme activities, the high-quality materials developed thus far will enable this. Children 
need to be engaged in innovative methods other than the wider media advocacy used so far, including 
peer-to-peer dialogue using existing leverage points such as the learners’ representative council structures 
at schools. The effectiveness of the system will be improved through a dedicated and inclusive steering 
mechanism with representation from all stakeholder groups. Including children will highlight the uniqueness 
of the COS system and its challenges and reveal innovative and relevant solutions. 
Efficiency 
The programme had two no-cost extensions to complete some activities affected by the Covid-19 
pandemic. The extensions did not influence the quality of programme delivery or the allocation of budget 
items. The optimal use of partner and consultant skills and structures (including existing processes) enabled 
a cost-effective programme.  
Sustainability 
The sustainability of the programme results was generally low. Some activities did not take place and the 
replacement interventions did not achieve the desired effect. In this regard, the ICT industry’s commitment 
is critically needed. The practicability of the knowledge generated is high, but without dissemination of the 
information to all stakeholder groups, it will lose its effect. Despite this, the sustainability of the system itself 
was high. This was mostly due to the structural integrity of the system as it was based on existing networks 
and procedures (mainly based on government structures).  
Equity and gender responsiveness 
The programme did not address gender or equity directly. Strengthening the system focused on the 
assumption that all children with access to the internet were equally at risk and that structures should be in 
place to provide blanket protection. Targeted interventions for groups identified as more vulnerable need 
to be included in the next phase of the programme. Children’s voices must be included on a continuous 
basis. Power discrepancies between stakeholder groups were evident with larger government departments 
being more likely to drive the process. UNICEF was able to harness these strengths but, going forward, an 

 
 
 
12 
approach of inclusiveness and participation of all stakeholder groups (including a wider range of 
government departments) will be needed.  
System changes 
The essential knowledge generated ensured a solid system foundation. The unique character of the COS 
system, including the range of victims involved, perpetrators who are children, the technical skills of children 
that frequently surpass those of adult caregivers, and the mixture of physical and online violence, makes 
treatment and prevention distinct from general CP issues. Furthermore, solutions such as simply avoiding 
the threat are not applicable. This was highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic’s implications on education 
and learning. The COS system needs to be recognized as unique. 
There was limited interaction between stakeholders and even within sub-systems. It is important to consider 
the dynamic nature of the system where a balance needs to be maintained in controlling and regulating the 
access of predators whilst ensuring internet access to all children and providing protection and treatment 
to those affected by online vulnerability and violations. There is a need for the inclusion of other components 
as well as stakeholder groups within a component (for example, diversification of training to community 
members). Understanding the dynamic nature of the interaction between the system's components and the 
system-wide implications of change within subsystems is critical to its strength.  
The most important consideration is the use of touchpoints in the system where stakeholder groups can be 
engaged. Leverage points in the system where the interventions can be more effective need to be identified 
and used. These include RCL systems in schools, the involvement of CBOs that work with children, and 
online games and applications. 
 
Good practices and lessons learned 
There were four good practices in the system that should be highlighted: 
1) The recognition that system transformation is needed and that this should be addressed 
systemically 
2) Building a solid foundation of knowledge about the system on which to base interventions 
3) Incorporating the key subsystems 
4) Identifying peer-to-peer dialogue as an effective method to engage children 
The lessons learned include programme implementation using a system approach and delineating the 
boundaries of the Child Online Safety system within the Child Rights strategy. There are elements not 
included in the Child Protection system and a solution should be sought outside those traditionally used for 
violence against children. 
Recommendations   
Recommendation 1:  
UNICEF South Africa COS programme staff should strategically reflect on the systemic nature and 
boundaries of the COS system, how it influences the second phase of the programme, and how the various 
programme interventions and stakeholders fit into the broader COS system. UNICEF CP staff can then 
influence the higher-level understanding and implementation of systems-thinking in key government 
departments such as DSD and DBE.
