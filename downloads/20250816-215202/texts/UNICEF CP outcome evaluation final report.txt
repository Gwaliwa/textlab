EXECUTIVE  
SUMMARY
Cambodia has made notable progress in establishing a child protection system, and the key elements of 
a system are in place, yet despite this progress, Cambodia’s child protection system is still underfunded 
and understaffed. While there have been significant improvements in establishing systematic coordination 
mechanisms in preventing and responding to the need of the vulnerable children who are at risk, these 
systems are still at basic and initial level. UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme aims to address key gaps in 
the child protection system according to three output areas:
These three outputs are situated within a system building framework: all are key components or elements that 
need to be in place to ensure that children are increasingly free from violence and exploitation in all contexts, 
through a comprehensive child protection system. The overall goal of the Child Protection Programme is that 
girls and boys, including adolescents, living with family and outside of family care are increasing free from 
violence and the threat of violence in their homes, schools, communities, and institutions. 
UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme 
2019 – 2023 
By 2023, national and subnational authorities have the knowledge, tools, resources and 
authority they need to formulate and implement the institutional and legal frameworks 
to strengthen child protection prevention and response interventions in a more enabling 
legislative, policy and financing environment.
1
By 2023, parents, teachers, religious leaders, communities and adolescents have enhanced 
knowledge, skills and attitudes to protect girls and boys from violence and exploitation 
through the scaling up of positive discipline, positive parenting and Cambodia PROTECT 
child protection programmes.
3
By 2023, the broader child protection workforce in the spheres of social work, welfare, 
justice, health and social protection, has the knowledge, tools, resources and authority it 
needs to identify vulnerable children and provide child prevention and protection services 
to reduce violence and exploitation and enhance children’s access to justice with priority 
accorded to urban poor communities and rural poor centres.

The logic underpinning the Programme is that interventions aimed at strengthening the functioning of the 
child protection system will result in reduced levels of violence, abuse and exploitation of children. This logic 
is embedded within UNICEF’s global approach to child protection programming, which shifted towards a 
systems strengthening approach in 2008, in recognition that this approach avoids the fragmentation and 
inefficiency of an ‘issue-based’ approach and instead aims at achieving sustainable coverage of child protection 
at scale, leading to a more effective and comprehensive approach for children exposed to violence, abuse, 
neglect and exploitation.1  
In June 2022, UNICEF Cambodia engaged Coram International to conduct an Outcome Evaluation of the Child 
Protection Programme, covering the period 2019 to mid-2022, while taking into consideration the evolution 
of the Programme since the previous country programmes as well as the formative evaluation conducted in 
2018. The Programme is jointly implemented with the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) and a diverse 
range of partners at the national and sub-national levels.
The RGC and UNICEF will use the findings and recommendations of the evaluation, including lessons learned, 
to inform decision-making processes, including informing the planning processes for the development of the 
next Country Programme Document (CPD), 2024-2028. In particular, and as stated in the Terms of Reference, 
the five objectives of the evaluation are to: 
Evaluation purpose and intended use
1 	Wulczyn, et. al., ‘Adapting a systems approach to child protection: Key concepts and considerations, 2010, UNICEF New York. 
Review the theory of change of UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme including the 
interlinkages among the Programme outputs and provide an assessment of how far they 
are based on evidence from programme experiences and approaches that have proven 
effective in protecting girls and boys in the current country context.
1
Assess UNICEF’s leadership, comparative advantage, ability to leverage resources and 
partnerships for strengthening the RGC child protection system at national and sub- national 
levels through advocacy and policy influencing, including utilising knowledge management 
and evidence-generation to inform policy decisions;
3
Examine the results achieved by UNICEF’s Child Protection Programme, enabling and 
disabling factors, considering aspects of both prevention and response, including capacity 
development of government institutions at national and sub-national levels, international 
and national NGOs, development partners as well as the voices of children, adolescents, 
families and communities.

The evaluation, which used a theory-based approach, drew on a variety of evidence sources to answer 
evaluation questions pertaining to the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of UNICEF’s 
child protection work, as well as to cross-cutting questions of gender, equity and human rights. Evidence 
gathered includes extensive qualitative data collection in key UNICEF programming provinces (Phnom Penh, 
Battambang, Kandal, Ratanakiri and Siem Reap), along with two ‘comparator’ locations, in which UNICEF 
has not been engaged intensively (Oddar Meancheay, Pursat). Data collection included an extensive desk 
review of programming documents, data and research; key informant interviews with 111 key stakeholders 
and programme implementers (national and sub-national Government, NGO, UN and donor), 12 in-depth 
interviews relating to individual cases (eight rights holders / beneficiaries and four service providers) and 
focus group discussions with 81 rights-holders (70 women and 12 men), along with a quantitative stakeholder 
survey, which received 33 responses (20 from within UNICEF and 13 from NGO and Government partners).
•	
The Child Protection Programme (CP Programme) was found to be highly relevant to Cambodia’s 
global development commitments and, in utilising a strong systems building framework, was also 
found to be relevant to UNICEF’s global frameworks and priorities. The three output areas of the 
Programme were found to respond well to existing gaps and needs within the child protection 
system.
•	
The CP Programme’s multi-tiered approach, involving interventions aimed at strengthening the 
system at both the national and sub-national levels, responds well to the programming context 
and the engagement with new stakeholders, in particular, the Ministry of Interior (MOI), was 
found to be highly relevant to the new decentralised system for social welfare / child protection 
service delivery.
On relevance
Methodology
Findings
Examine the existing linkages between the outputs of the Child Protection Programme, 
as well as inter-linkages with Policy and Public Finance for Children, Education, Health and 
Nutrition, and WASH through the joint work such as positive discipline in schools, child 
protection service delivery in the health system and communication for development.
5
Assess the opportunities for further accelerating action on child protection in Cambodia 
with the RGC and partners; and

On coherence / connectedness
•	
While the Programme was found to be highly relevant to Government policies, plans and 
commitments, some interventions were not fully operationalised, owing to existing capacity gaps 
at the sub-national level, indicating that more attention should have been given to the phasing 
and complementarity of the Programme’s interventions at the sub-national level.
•	
While some measures were taken to integrate gender and equity into the Programme 
design, these measures were found to be insufficient, and there is a need to engage more 
comprehensively with the gender dimensions of child protection issues and more effectively 
address the protection needs of children with disabilities, in particular.
•	
With its focus on addressing violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of children, the Programme 
was found to be highly relevant to the evidence base on the protection risks and needs of children 
in Cambodia. However, there was limited systematic engagement of children and adolescents in 
the programme design and review.
•	
The CP Programme was found to have retained its relevance in the changed context brought 
about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
•	
The CP Programme worked effectively in coordinating the different interventions of development 
partners, including government and NGO partners through supporting the Child Protection Forum 
at the national level. The Child Protection Forum brings together UN agencies, Government 
stakeholders and NGOs to coordinate their work in child protection systems strengthening.
•	
The development and maintenance of respectful, open and enduring strategic partnerships were 
key factors in UNICEF’s ability to achieve coherence between the Programme goals and outputs 
and the work of other agencies. 
•	
At the sub-national level, UNICEF ensured the effective coordination of child protection service 
delivery primarily through the Partnership Programme for the Protection of Children (3PC), which 
is a collaboration between the government UNICEF and NGOs for the provision of prevention and 
response child protection services, coordinated by Friends-International.
