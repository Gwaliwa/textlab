EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
In order to make some meaningful contribution in addressing the challenges related to girls’ education, 
their school completion, early marriage and effective contribution to Zambia’s economy, UNICEF in 
partnership with the Ministry of General Education has provided financial support to implement the 
Zambian Girls 2030: Realising My Potential Programme (2016–2018). The programme has been 
implemented in Northern and Southern Provinces targeting four districts in each province: Mungwi, 
Luwingu, Mbala and Mpulungu in the Northern Province and Pemba, Sinazongwe, Namwala and 
Monze in the Southern province. The programme aims to support the Government of Zambia to 
achieve its Vision 2030, which is to be “A prosperous Middle-income Nation by 2030”. The focus of 
the programme is to empower girls through career and skills mentoring, guidance, entrepreneurship 
skills development, financial literacy education and an internship opportunity, and to provide girls with 
the professional training and networks to succeed. Restless Development was the implementing 
partner, and financial and technical assistance and guidance were provided by Ministry of General 
Education and UNICEF.  
The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) was contracted by UNICEF to conduct an 
end line evaluation of the Zambian Girls 2030 Programme. The specific objectives of the evaluation, 
as specified in the ToR (See Annex 8.1) were to: 
1. assess the programme’s effectiveness and evaluate the extent to which the programme achieved 
its intended results at output and outcome level; 
2. assess the programme’s efficiency, and evaluate how well have programme resources (financial, 
human and technical) been used to achieve the results; 
3. assess the programme’s relevance and evaluate to what extent the programme design and 
intervention responded to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries as well as the strategic 
priorities of the Ministry of General Education; 
4. assess the programme’s sustainability, and evaluate whether, without external support, key 
conditions and factors are in place for the programme to continue to exist and be effective/efficient; 
and 
5. finally, assess the programme’s equity focus, and evaluate the extent to which the programme 
addressed inequalities in gender barriers to stay in school, gain interest in Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects, and successfully integrate into the labour market. 
The evaluation relied on secondary literature review and qualitative data collection from 30 schools 
across 4 districts. This included 1,368 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) at the school, district and 
provincial level with pupils, school leaders, Guidance and Counselling Teachers, Provincial Education 
Officers (PEOs), District Education Officers (DEOs), and other stakeholders. In addition, the 
evaluation team conducted 30 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with parents and caregivers at the 
school level. In total around 300 parents and caregivers were included in the discussions. 
The findings under each objective are as follows: 
Effectiveness 
The project has made significant strides in improving girl’s transition rates, in reducing pregnancy 
rates and in increasing re-admissions in both Northern and Southern provinces.  
Among the three components of the programme, career and skills clubs were reported to be the most 
effective. The clubs were effective because majority of the girls had access to clubs, which were a 
regular affair at the school level. The project established a shift in the pupils thought process regarding

ACER © 2021 Commercial in Confidence 
the choice of careers and higher education after the children attended the career clubs and after 
hearing about the career camps and internships from fellow pupils who had attended them.  
The project targeted three outputs, which were covered under the programme components:  
1. by 2018, 11,200 girls between Grades 5 to 12 are to be trained or sensitised on: career 
guidance, reproductive health and re-entry policy through participation in school clubs to 
facilitate girls being retained in school or to transition girls to tertiary education; 
2. by 2018, 1,200 adolescent girls are to acquire knowledge and skills on leadership, 
employability and career options, entrepreneurship (to make informed decisions about staying 
in school), transitioning to higher education and future career paths; and 
3. the Ministry of General Education is to increase capacity to implement and monitor the national 
Career Guidance standards at School level. 
While the project met 10 out of the 11 indicators at the output level, the performance against the 
following indicator fell short of the target:   
• 
girls receiving the integrated package on Career Guidance and Sexual Reproductive Health, 
life skills (financial literacy and entrepreneurship skills through clubs) [Target: 11,200; 
Achievement: 9,811] 
The project has seen significant improvements from baseline to end line in the number of pupils 
actively participating in clubs (2,489 to 14,846), establishing personal savings plans (11 per cent to 
54 per cent), transitioning from Grade 9 to 10 (47.2 per cent to 57.1 per cent), re-admissions after 
delivery (9 per cent to 82.1 per cent), enrolment in the internship programme (from 0 girls to 423).  
Efficiency  
Managerial and coordination efficiency was observed at the school level. The evaluation findings 
showed the project sufficiently financed its school activities, such as career clubs and training of 
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, and the schools are using the resources efficiently to the best 
of their capability. According to some stakeholders there is a need for strengthening the training of 
teachers on reporting and on exploring the option of digital reporting to minimise travel of teachers for 
reporting purposes. Integrating the reporting on programme components within the routine school 
reports may also help in sustaining the reporting, without burdening the school system. Also, the 
stakeholders suggested decentralising career camps and internships to bring cost efficiencies in the 
programme. 
Relevance 
The end line evaluation found that the objectives of the programme were consistent with its goals and 
the implementation strategy was relevant to the programme targets. The project was initiated in 
August 2016 when several indicators at school level in Zambia related to dropouts, retention of girls 
and early pregnancies, in Northern and Southern provinces in particular, were unsatisfactory. The 
project objectives planned outputs and outcomes were all aligned within the priorities of the Ministry 
of General Education in relation to improving transition rates and to overall improve gender parity. 
The project was in line with the Seventh National Development and Zambia 2030 goals of becoming 
middle-income economy.   
The relevance of the project was also seen from the implementation aspect. The project 
implementation was widely accepted and praised by the stakeholders at the provincial and district 
level, as well as by the targeted beneficiaries. The stakeholders reported decline in the rate of girls’ 
absenteeism, reduction in the dropout rates, improvement in the transition rates across grades,

decline in the incidence of teenage pregnancies and increase in the numbers for re-admissions after 
pregnancy. 
Sustainability 
The project model was sustainable and scalable across all three components, although in varying 
degrees. The career clubs were successful in establishing processes as they were being run by the 
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, who were a part of the education system. One key constraining 
factor for sustainability of the career camps and internships was their resource intensive nature and 
the level of coordination and communication that was needed to be maintained with all the 
stakeholders. Therefore, these two components needed to be more decentralised. 
Equity 
The programme approach included equity as one of its defining criteria. Poverty, accessibility of 
school, gender, and children with special education needs and disabilities were some of the key 
aspects of vulnerability that the programme design targeted to address under its equitable approach.  
In the absence of credible data on children with special education needs, a focused approach for such 
children within the project was not possible. However, the default position at the school level career 
and skills clubs as well as at career camps and internships was to include vulnerable children and 
those with special education needs. Gender equality and equity was practiced in the programme 
activities as reported by an overwhelming majority of pupils. 
Conclusion 
The Zambian Girls 2030 programme has been found to be relevant, efficient, effective and equitable 
in its approach. The school level career clubs are sustainable, although it cannot be said with the 
same level of authority about the career camps and internships which require sustained coordination 
and investments. The programme has made successful inroads into the community, which has played 
an important role in the success of the programme, particularly around the issue of dropouts, 
progression from Grade 7 to higher grades, absenteeism, early marriage, teenage pregnancies and 
re-entry into school. The Ministry of General Education along with the provincial and district level staff 
and school leaders and Guidance and Counselling Teachers have been fully involved in the 
programme. The boys have been active participants of the school level career clubs, but reportedly 
felt left out when it came to career camps and internships. The Ministry of General Education may 
therefore like to consider boys’ demand for the next phases keeping in mind that it may lead to the 
requirement of additional funds. The schools need to manage the records of children who have 
graduated, and of those with special education needs in the community. The end line evaluation 
yielded four lessons: (1) Periodic monitoring is critical, (2) funds are required, (3) reporting by teachers 
is tedious, and (4) internships are to be held within the province. Overall, the programme has 
performed well and by addressing some of the issues outlined in the recommendations and lessons 
learned, it is expected to achieve its goals in the future phases as well. 
Recommendations 
Key recommendations emerged from discussions with various stakeholders involved in the designing 
and implementation of the Zambian Girls 2030 programme. The stakeholders were school leaders, 
Guidance and Counselling Teachers, Directorate of Teacher Education and Specialized Services 
(TESS), District and Provincial Education Officials, Restless Development and UNICEF. 
Recommendations are also drawn from analysing parents and caregivers’ perceptions and by 
reviewing relevant programme documents. Detailed recommendations are provided in Chapter 6:

• 
Landscape analysis and decentralised programme activities—The project would be easier to 
implement and would be more cost effective if career camps and internships were decentralised 
at district level. However, prior to the decentralisation, a thorough landscape analysis, in line with 
international best practices, is important to accurately assess the capacity and appetite of 
corporates and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to participate in the programme.   
• 
Written communication plan and record keeping—The communication across UNICEF, 
Restless Development and Ministry of General Education was cited as satisfactory by all three 
groups, as the progress meetings happened quarterly. It can be further streamlined by having a 
clear written system and protocol of communication, which is established at the very beginning of 
the programme. Records of meeting and discussions across all levels, right up to the schools, 
should be maintained to serve the twin purpose of accountability and reference for action. 
• 
Costing exercise for a sustainable scale up plan—Prior to the scale up of the programme, it 
would be useful to conduct a review of the budget allocation to aid the programme planners in 
rationalising the costs against each component. 
• 
National framework for engagement with corporates—Programmes of greater public good like 
the Zambian Girls 2030 could benefit immensely from a continued engagement with corporates 
and PSEs. To sustain the initiative, a national framework for engaging with corporates should be 
developed to institutionalise the process and provide guidance to the corporates for continued 
support to such programmes. 
• 
Rationalise the timeframe of internships—The corporate respondents who hosted the 
internships reported the period of internship to be short and suggested increasing it to a minimum 
of one month.  
• 
Age-appropriate curriculum for financial literacy and entrepreneurship training—Simplified 
age and education level appropriate curriculum content for financial literacy and entrepreneurship 
trainings for the upper primary grades (Grade 5–7) should be developed to ensure that these 
concepts are appropriately understood by the pupils. 
• 
Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of programmes—The programme has 
been successful in maintaining the gender equity focus. The efforts at the school level career 
clubs have been useful in breaking gender stereotypes, both among boys and girls. There is 
greater acceptance of girls in leadership roles at the clubs, their financial independence, career 
choices, etc. Gender equity needs to continue as the central focus of all future programmes in the 
education sector.
