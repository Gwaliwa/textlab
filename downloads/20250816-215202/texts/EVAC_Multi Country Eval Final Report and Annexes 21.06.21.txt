Executive Summary 
Objective, intended users, and scope 
Multi Country Formative and Summative Evaluation of Elimination of Violence Against 
Children (EVAC) 
 
Regional Office (RO) and has the dual objectives of accountability and learning. 
The main audience of this report are UNICEF staff in the Middle East and North Africa 
Regional Office (MENARO) and the three Country Offices (CO) covered by this evaluation. A 
secondary audience will be UNICEF staff in other COs, ROs or in HQ that may have an interest 
in the findings of the evaluation to feed into their programming; learn from MENA experiences; 
and/or eventually replicate or adapt to their own contexts.  
The evaluation covers three countries of the region - Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. These three 
countries were selected because it is where UNICEF has partnered most closely with national 
governments in the MENA region to deliver a wide variety of EVAC programmes. It covers all 
activities planned and/or implemented during the period between July 2019 and December 
2020 that either protect children from violence directly or develop improved responses for 
when violence against children occurs. 
Context 
The MENA region is affected by political instability, economic stresses and demographic 
challenges. It is also home to the largest refugee and displacement crisis of modern times; 
with a total of 10.5 million Syrian refugees and with the Syrian crisis impacting each one of 
the three countries under study differently. The reg
constituting 36 percent of its population according to UNICEF (2017), with more than one 
  It is home to some of the highest rates of 
violent disciplinary methods, with 106 million children (aged 2-14) regularly subjected to 
violent discipline in the home and 27 million children having experienced severe physical 
punishment; with the odds of boys being subjected to severe punishment being 1.3 times 
more likely than girls. Furthermore, the same study found that 80 per cent in the MENA region 
had experienced psychological aggression. While the three countries under study have 
ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) as well as the Convention on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), significant concerns 
regarding the protection of children from violence within Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon very 
much exist.  
Methodology 
The evaluation s analytical framework was based on 
Global Theory of Change for 
Programme Guidance (2018). The evaluation was conducted remotely and was based on in-
depth document review and key informant interview with 100 stakeholders. Debriefings were 
held with key stakeholders in the three countries to validate the key findings. 
Furthermore, the evaluation followed a gender-sensitive and human rights based approach. 
It also adhered to the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical standards and norms.

The evaluation faced severe limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the team was 
was unable to meet with key stakeholders (e.g., government and donor staff) which limited in 
some cases the triangulation of information. 
Key Findings 
Relevance 
At the country level, 
level of violence against children in the three countries. Its activities are also aligned with 
national priorities, strategies and frameworks. At the global level, 
are 
aligned with SDGs 5 (gender equality) and 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) as well 
as 
Global EVAC Framework. Furthermore, 
with six out of the seven

Similarly, in the three countries, EVAC initiatives are 
generally in line with six out of seven of INSPIRE strategies. However, the evaluation did not 
come and economic 
 Notwithstanding the overall relevance of U
 in the 
three countries, UNICEF did not fully consider the gender dimensions and the specifics for 
of violence along the life cycle.  Furthermore, EVAC programmes in the three countries were 
not fully framed to address violence occurring across all social classes and environments. 
Finally, UNICEF displayed its adaptive capacity by quickly responding to the changing 
context due to the COVID-19 pandemic in three countries as well as to the Beirut port 
explosion in Lebanon. 
Efficiency 
The evaluation found little evidence that EVAC initiatives use resources in a way that allows 
for cost monitoring. Based on an analysis of the funding gaps reported in the SitReps, 
financial resources available for Child Protection (CP)1 activities are adequate in Jordan and 
Lebanon but insufficient in Egypt. Though EVAC has been identified as one of the 
humanitarian financing as a result of the Syria crisis. The evaluation identified several steps 
that UNICEF in the three countries implemented to improve the efficiency of programme 
delivery, including partnering with national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), reducing 
operating costs and sharing information and tools across the three countries. 
Notwithstanding these cost-efficient measures, the evaluation noted several issues  both 
internal and external - that limit the efficiency of EVAC interventions by either increasing the 
cost and/or decreasing the number of people reached. These inefficiencies were caused 
mostly by COVID-19 related delays, internal UNICEF processes, limited leveraging of 
public/private funding, insufficient local capacities and lack of trust among different 
stakeholders. 
Effectiveness 
Overall, the three countries were able to achieve the expected results in 2019. In 2020, and 
partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic (and in Lebanon also because of the multiple crises 
the country faced in 2019-2020), not all the planned results were met. There is some evidence 
outlined in the Global EVAC Theory of Change (ToC). Children/adolescents and caregivers

have gained greater 
behaviours have changed. At the institutional level, UNICEF supported the development of 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), the rolling out 
of the CPIMS/FVTS and capacity building of government staff. At the level of legal and 
political frameworks, the changes included the development of an EVAC strategy in Egypt, a 
Child Protection, Social and Behavioural Change Communications (SBCC), and sectoral 
strategies in Lebanon, and amendments to laws in Jordan. Limited evidence exists that 
changes occurred at the society/community and social norms levels. Several factors 
contributed or hindered progress towards achieving the expected results. These include (i) 
the existence of processes that increase commitment, ownership and buy-in, integration of 
EVAC into other sectors, and mechanisms that provide incentives and ensure accountability; 
(ii) the capacity levels of all stakeholders, including staff of UNICEF, Implementing Partners 
(IPs) and government; and (iii) external factors, including the crises, funding and existence of 
multiple Helplines which render coordination and collaboration more difficult. 
 
From the information made available, the evaluation concluded that UNICEF COs would be 
able to monitor results disaggregated by gender, nationality, age, disability, geographic area, 
but it is not clear (i) to what extent this is being done, and (ii) to what extent this can be done 
across all interventions, i.e., some intervention results may be disaggregated by gender but 
not by nationality, some may be disaggregated by age, and others by disability or geographic 
location. Furthermore, though there are several M&E reports that provide information 
regarding EVAC interventions, not all were made available to the Evaluation Team (e.g., 
CPMIS and GBVIMS). As a result, the evaluation was unable to determine the extent to which 
they are being used to effectively measure progress in achieving planned results and to guide 
programme implementation. 
 
The evaluation identified five unplanned effects of the EVAC interventions in the countries 
under study. Two had unintended positive consequences: (i) wide acceptance by caretakers 
of receiving psychosocial support remotely during COVID-19 and (ii) greater ease in involving 
men through online means. Three had unintended negative impacts and they include (i) 
overwhelming the Child Helpline as a result of a successful social media campaign in Egypt; 
(ii) several repercussions due to target setting by nationality in Lebanon; and (iii) resentment 
due to targeting only teachers in the 
 programme in Jordan. In addition, the evaluation 
identified two initiatives that would merit deeper analysis and an assessment how they could 
develop impact at the national, regional and possibly global level. They are: (i) delivering 
prevention and response services remotely; and (ii) addressing EVAC through leveraging the 
power and influence of religious leaders, which is a necessary approach to achieve change 
in societal norms in the region. In addition, case management would merit an in-depth 
assessment which would analyse in-take, referral, case resolution, coordination and the roll 
out of the CPIMS. 
 
UNICEF in the three countries has coordinated with different government institutions, UN 
agencies, NGOs and the private sector which has contributed to achieving the expected 
results. However, there is a missed opportunity for greater coordination and collaboration 
with UN Women, especially to carry out high-level advocacy as well as to better integrate 
VAC and Violence Against Women (VAW) interventions. The extent of internal coordination 
and complementarity varies between one sector and another, with the greatest integration 
taking place between the Child Protection and Education sectors within UNICEF. 
Sustainability 
Existence of national legal frameworks in Egypt, which has a National Child Law, and, in 
Jordan, which 
 Juvenile Laws, contributes to long-
term sustainability. However, Lebanon still does not have a unified national framework to 

 
iv 
 
address EVAC since family and personal status laws are regulated by religious courts. Due 
to their institutional setup which limits their leverage, the National Council for Childhood and 
Motherhood (NCCM-Egypt), the National Council for Family Affairs (NCFA-Jordan) and the 
High Council of Childhood (HCC-Lebanon) are limited in their abilities to ensure multisectoral 
coordination. In terms of financial sustainability, the evaluation identified two national 
strategies (Egypt and Jordan) that were costed and none which has been included in the 
national budget. The lack of outcome level data did not allow the evaluation to assess the 
extent of changes in attitudes and behaviour and even less their sustainability. Sustainability 
of direct interventions varies among the three countries and is a function of several factors, 
including institutional arrangements, continuity of funding, and sufficient human and technical 
capacities. Finally, the evaluation identified four initiatives that could be replicable and/or 
scalable: (i) partnering with the private sector in Egypt which can be leveraged in other 
countries in the region; (ii) conducting monthly online surveys in Jordan; (iii) provision of 
integrated services at the community level in Jordan; and, potentially, (iv) mainstreaming 
EVAC within municipalities in Lebanon. 
Gender 
There is inconclusive evidence on the extent to which UNICEF COs are using gender 
considerations in the design of EVAC response and prevention activities. At the 
implementation level, the three COs are supporting several initiatives which have a strong 
gender dimension at different levels, however there is room for enhanced gender 
mainstreaming by (i) targeting male caregivers, (ii) supporting boy victims of violence; (iii) 
enha
; (iv) partnering with UN Women; (v) linking gender-
related EVAC interventions with other sectors; and (vi) strengthening collaboration between 
the response (case management) and prevention (psychosocial support, parenting 
programmes,  social and behavioural change communication) at the community level. In terms 
of monitoring, sex-disaggregated data is being collected through the different case 
management information systems as well as through the Helplines though this is not captured 
in the formal reports in a systematic manner. 
Conclusions 
Conclusion 1 
with national child protection and EVAC strategies and are relevant to the context in the three 
countries, given the high level of VAC. 
Conclusion 2 (based on Finding 4). 
allows its partners in each country to 
with all stakeholders. While UNICEF COs have responded to the multiple crises in the last 
emergency situations. UNICEF in Egypt has developed an EVAC ToC; however, Jordan does 
not have an EVAC-specific ToC and Lebanon has an outdated one.  
Conclusion 3 (based on Findings 9 and 10). UNICEF has successfully adapted its 
interventions to the changing context and needs due to multiple crises in the three countries. 
However, there is room for increasing the relevance of activities for specific target groups 
(e.g., adolescents, children who attend private schools, male caretakers, etc.). 
Conclusion 4 (based on Findings 11, 12 and 13). UNCEF has received substantial resources 
to respond to the Syria crisis in the three countries which has provided an opportunity to 
strengthen EVAC national systems. However, insufficient information was available to assess 

 
v 
 
the ability of UNICEF to carry out cost-monitoring of its activities or to analyze the efficiency 
of UNICEF funding, particularly regarding awareness raising and prevention efforts. 
Conclusion 5 (based on Findings 14 and 15). Although UNICEF is taking concrete steps to 
improve efficiency across programme delivery, particularly in areas related to reducing 
operational costs, enhancing cross sectoral collaboration and strengthening service delivery 
of national NGOs, duplication of services/programming, use of multiple data tracking 
systems decrease the efficiency of the systems. A significant opportunity exists which is not 
being utilized fully for sharing experiences and resources among the three countries. 
Conclusion 6 (based Findings 16 and 17). Overall, the three countries were able to achieve 
their planned results in 2019 and were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 which 
slowed down implementation. UNICEF-Lebanon experienced additional crises that had an 
impact on its results. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that UNICEF in the three countries 
has contributed to changes at the different levels of society, most significantly at the level of 
children and their caregivers.  
Conclusion 7 (based on Findings 19, 20, 21 and 22). While several prevention activities are 
designed using evidence-based approaches, response interventions are less grounded on 
evidence-based methods.  There are multiple reports and approaches that could be used to 
assess progress. However, there was little evidence that UNICEF COs have capitalized on 
these reports to inform programme implementation and monitor their effectiveness in 
reducing violence (or the risk factors associated with violence). 
Conclusion 8 (based on Findings 25 and 26). UNICEF is coordinating with several external 
stakeholders through the CP Sub-Working Group coordination meetings and/or through 
technical task forces. In addition, the COs have a strong collaboration with several NGOs 
(especially, Lebanon) and the private sector (in particular, Egypt). Nevertheless, there are 
unexplored opportunities to strengthen external collaboration with UN Women, WHO and the 
private sector. Internally, UNICEF CP Sector coordinates mostly with the Education and 
Communications for Development (C4D) Sectors and there is unused potential to do joint 
programming with the Youth, Health and Social Protection Sectors. 
Conclusion 9 (based on Findings 27 and 28). There are elements of sustainability in place 
(e.g., legal frameworks, varying degrees of multi-sectoral coordination and political 
commitment), however there are still several issues that need to be addressed in order to 
ensure long-term sustainability (e.g., inclusion of EVAC costs in national budgets and 
strengthening multi-sectoral coordination). Furthermore, and more importantly than a costing 
exercise, there is a need to develop a detailed financing strategy which would present the 
business case for EVAC and would include an assessment of the cost of inaction. None of 
the EVAC programmes, with the exception of the 
 Programme in Jordan, have 
developed an articulated exit or sustainability strategy. 
Conclusion 10 (based on Findings 30 and 31). Insufficient information is available to assess 
the sustainability of changes in attitudes and behaviours. Without creating such deep-seated 
changes in society as a whole and shifting social norms, the long-term sustainability of EVAC 
intervention will not be assured. Sustainability of direct interventions varies among the three 
countries and depends on several factors, including institutional, financial, technical and 
human capacities, and effective case management systems. 
Conclusion 11 (based on Findings UNICEF Jordan and Lebanon have endeavored to link 
emergency response with a longer-term development approach, by implementing both 
response and prevention activities and supporting systems strengthening. However, heavy 
reliance on humanitarian funding jeopardises the sustainability, scalability and replicability of 
interventions. 
Conclusion 12 (based on Findings 33, 34, 35 and 36). Several UNICEF EVAC interventions 
have integrated gender considerations in their design and implementation. However, gender
