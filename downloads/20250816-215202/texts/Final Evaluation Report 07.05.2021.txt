Executive Summary 
The Project, Promoting Reconciliation in Sri Lanka with USD 1.6 million was funded by the Peacebuilding Fund 
of the UN and implemented from April, 2017 to August 2019. The Project was extended up to 31 December 
2020 with financial closure on 30 September 2020. The Project's peacebuilding efforts are implemented by 
UNDP, UNICEF and WHO through three Outcomes, viz., (a) Promoting processes for social cohesion and 
conflict prevention (UNDP), (b) improving education system to support inter-personal and inter-group 
understanding and interaction (UNICEF), and (c) addressing conflict-related mental health and psychosocial 
issues (WHO). The Project was implemented at the National level as well as in the Northern, Eastern, Uva, and 
Central provinces. 
The Evaluation: The purpose of the evaluation is to provide lessons for future peacebuilding initiatives to the 
Government counterparts, UN agencies and implementing partners, and the Peacebuilding Fund. The objective 
of this summative evaluation, carried out between November 2020 to March 2021, is to assess relevance, 
efficiency, effectiveness, progress towards outcomes, sustainability, gender and conflict sensitivity of the 
Project as well as the effectiveness of monitoring and evaluation. The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF. 
The evaluation methodology consisted of desk review of documents, 90 key informant interviews, 33 Focus 
Groups Discussions, and a physical assessment of 11 schools for civic education and positive discipline. A 
questionnaire was administered to 33 beneficiaries to assess the performance of livelihood assistance initiative. 
Because of COVID-19 pandemic, virtual data collection methods were used in Key Informant Interviews. The 
evaluation faced several limitations, viz., difficulties with identifying key informants and arranging interviews 
(Component # 1); delays in obtaining key documents from RUNOs; absence of critical information on project 
implementation; and extended closure of schools due to COVID-19. 
Relevance: 
The Project is well aligned with Government's policies and strategies especially supporting 
UNHCR Resolution 30/1, and the National Policy on Education for Social Cohesion and Conflict Resolution and 
Reconciliation. It builds on Articles 28/29 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child of UNESCO framework 
of Global Citizenship. The psychosocial component addresses the mental health and psychosocial issues in the 
reconciliation process and in a conflict-related milieu in the overall peace building efforts. The Project is also 
aligned with the Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) for Sri Lanka. 
Effectiveness: Overall progress is weak, and targets have not been achieved. Project delivery has suffered 
from inadequate coordination amongst UN Agencies and connectivity amongst the implementing partners. A 
common understanding of the 'Project' amongst implementers was not evident at different levels. Absence of 
a designated ‘Project Manager’ for overall coordination and timely implementation has affected effectiveness.  
These delays have been exacerbated by the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic. 
Additionally, the dissolution/disengagement of the relevant Government agencies in  2019/2020 has 
significantly affected effectiveness. 
The Project, however, made adjustments to address critical gaps in government funding for emergency work 
after the Easter Sunday attack of 2019 and COVID-19 pandemic. With the disengagement of ONUR, funds 
were utilized for a research study on violence and to provide livelihood support to ex-combatants. The modus 
operandi of implementing this initiative via Government agencies was apt albeit it did not provide the desired 
outcomes. The Project's approach of implementation through CSOs could have been more effective if the 
connectivity amongst CSOs was better. 
Whilst the Project's design has considered the pathways for peacebuilding, its Theory of Change does not 
capture the philosophy of UN Joint Programming reflecting the need for integrated responses to the issues. 
In Project management, programmatic coordination has not been effective. The Project neither prepared 
annual workplans nor a monitoring and evaluation plan. As a result of weak monitoring, major delays in 
delivery of outputs do not appear to have drawn the attention of UN agencies.  
Efficiency: 
The evaluation did not analyse financial information as output-based expenditures were not 
available. Yet, there was general indication that the allocations made to work packages were more than 
adequate; the Project did not assess some deliverables for value-for-money. 

v 
 
Progress towards Outcomes: Limited project progress at the output level has hindered the Project’s ability 
to contribute to outcomes. In Component # 1, Project's initiatives at policy level have not proceeded to the 
level expected with delayed delivery or abandoning outputs due to the closure of the Secretariat for 
Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms and disengagement of Office for National Unity and Reconciliation 
in 2019/2020. The social cohesion module introduced to Sri Lanka Institute for Development Administration is 
noteworthy, but its continuation could not be ascertained. 
In the education component (# 2), delivery has been affected by the limited level of understanding of the 
innovative concepts of civic education and positive disciplining amongst CSO partners, and delays and the 
inability to complete work. The social cohesion work has not been taken up evenly across the schools. The 
School Development Plans have not factored in the activities promoted by the Project into their planning 
processes. Monitoring of project work in schools was weak. The E-platform is fully implemented only at one 
school, because the school has trained staff and enthusiastic parents and students. 
In regard to positive discipline, schools lack facilities that are conducive for learning and social and emotional 
growth. Of the children, 3.2% did not feel safe and protected at school; 4% did not feel protected and safe at 
home; 10% did not feel that teachers engaged them interactively; 9% did not like to work in groups and in 
supporting peers; and 21% did not feel they had the ability for tolerance and anger management. The 
evaluation found that 89% of the parents continue to beat children as the most effective form of discipline; 
42% use harsh language; 33% do not establish rules of behaviour and encourage good behaviour; 29% do not 
have a daily routine or structure at home; and 24% do not demonstrate anger management and self-restraint. 
The progress could have ben better demonstrated if there was a baseline, technically sound common modules 
with provision for adaptation across the Provinces and sectors of living, and regular review. Work with the 
University Grants Commission and the National Institute of Education has not been completed. 
In Component # 3, the Project supported the preparation of the National Mental Health Policy (2019-2030) 
and the Action Plans have been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in December, 2020. The Project's work 
on mapping mental health and psychosocial services using the IASC 4Ws tool has not been taken to a 
completion due to lack of access to data. The National Suicide Prevention Strategy, developed with Project's 
support is yet to be approved. The Project developed a suicide registry and a hospital-based suicide attempt 
surveillance system for the Ministry of Health, and trained its staff. This is yet to be operationalised. The Project 
trained 60 volunteers from 11 districts to recognize and support suicide prevention. The Project is continuing 
its dialogue with the Ministry of Health to complete the tasks initiated under the Project. 
The Project supported the Mental Health GIS-based access points and piloted it in Nuwara Eliya and Mannar 
districts. The Global tool, MH Atlas was introduced to collect data on mental health. The Project trained 250 
mental health professionals in early identification and treatment of substance abuse. The Manohari 
Programme, introduced to strengthen psychosocial well-being and improve mental health services through 
community-based interventions, has been piloted in 12 districts for frontline mental health staff and 
community leaders. The staff showed positive behavioural changes. The multi-stakeholder alcohol abuse 
prevention programme also supported communities to acquire coping skills. Following the Easter Sunday 
attack (2019), the Project trained about 1,500 teachers in the affected areas on Psychosocial First Aid and 
provided a purpose-built self-help manual in Sinhalese and Tamil. The IASC-MHPSS Reference guide on Basic 
Psychosocial Skills for COVID-19 Responders was translated into local languages.  
Sustainability: The evidence for sustainability of project initiatives is limited, as several work packages are yet 
to be completed. The closure of Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms and the 
disengagement of the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation from the Project have significantly affected 
sustainability of the peacebuilding component. The sustainability of modules for introducing reconciliation 
and peacebuilding to new entrants of the Government Administrative Service could not be assessed due to 
non-availability of information. Sustainability of the work with the University Grants Commission on ragging is 
uncertain, and UNICEF will continue to support the National Institute of Education on curriculum revisions, 
expected to come into force in 2023. In the psychosocial component, sustainability of some initiatives cannot 
be assessed as work has not been taken to a completion. The Manohari programme has transcended beyond 
the trained frontline health staff in some locations but it has not been institutionalised in the Ministry of Health. 

vi 
 
Alcohol abuse prevention work is institutionalised in the relevant agencies. The developments in reconciliation 
in Sri Lanka have somewhat reversed largely due to very divisive election of 2019, Easter Sunday attack of 2019 
and the COVID-19 burial issues. 
Cross-cutting considerations on gender and conflict-sensitivity: In Gender, there are no specific 
interventions towards achieving Gender indicators except in Component 2. The Project has not maintained 
gender disaggregated data in Components 1 and 3. The understanding of gender equality programming and 
monitoring amongst Partners is not to the desired level. There are no documented insights of Project's 
technical inputs on gender equality and its inclusion in the curricula and modules developed. In Conflict 
Sensitivity the Project approach included conflict sensitivity analysis and vulnerability assessments. The Project 
followed conflict analysis as a central and cross-cutting component to promote conflict sensitive practices of 
the project. There is evidence to ensure that conflict sensitivity is integrated in Project actions.

Lessons Learnt: There are five programming lessons, viz., (1) Using a bottoms-up approach and capturing the 
nuances of joint programming in designing projects of this nature, (2) implementation modality of using 
Government partners and CSOs with better oversight, (3) the success of delivery of civic education and positive 
discipling is due to the readiness of schools to embrace new methods, (4) need for regular dialogue with 
Government agencies to ensure proper management of work packages, and (5) success of interlinkages 
between psychosocial support and peacebuilding was dependent on the commitment of the community 
health professionals.

1. Introduction 
Sri Lanka has experienced insurrectionary violence and protracted ethno-political conflict from 
about 1983 to 2009. The youth led insurrectionary violence in the South of the county from 
1987-89 and the separatist violence between Tamil youth led rebel groups and government 
forces in the North and East of the country killed thousands and inflicted devastating and 
deeply felt consequences at the human, social, physical, and institutional level. The conflict has 
created made people less secure. Repeated displacement from the homes, inability to access 
their own lands for livelihoods, food insecurity, and destruction of infrastructure were evident 
in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, resulting in vulnerable groups such as women-headed 
households, families of the disappeared, or former child combatants. The process of reparation 
and reconciliation has lingering issues with post-traumatic stress disorders within the affected 
communities and social and political divisions between ethnicities and social groups. 
With the end of the conflict in the North and the East in 2009, the Government made significant 
investments in infrastructure development thus vastly improving the roads, hospitals, 
administrative buildings, schools, electricity, telecommunication and water supply. Processes 
of conflict resolution and reconciliation were parallel initiatives to establish a socially cohesive 
society. The Government established a ministry for rehabilitation and reconciliation in 2015, 
which provided the institutional framework to work on policies focused on issues of 
peacebuilding, reconciliation and transitional justice. Concomitantly, two agencies, viz., 
Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) and the Office of National 
Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) were established to promote and coordinate transitional 
justice and reconciliation initiatives. The constitutional crisis of October 2018 which removed 
the then Prime Minister, temporarily deactivated SCRM; although it was restored with the 
reappointment of the Prime Minister in early 2019. The change of Government in November 
2019, SCRM was again deactivated and finally dissolved in early 2020 as it had not been 
established under a statute; ONUR became completely dormant and staff moved elsewhere. 
In October 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution titled ‘Promoting 
reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’. The resolution supported the 
commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to undertake a comprehensive approach for 
reparation and reconciliation with a nationally owned and victim-centric transitional justice 
process that addressed the social and political divisions in Sri Lanka.  and advanced 
accountability and reconciliation for all.  SCRM was specifically entrusted with the way forward 
on the Human Rights Council's Resolution. 
Consequently, the Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP)1 was prepared by the Government of Sri 
Lanka and the Peacebuilding Support Office to implement the reconciliation and transitional 
justice commitments to the people as part of Government's peacebuilding agenda. This Plan 
was expected to serve as the framework for development partners' support towards 
peacebuilding. 
The Government, in 2017, identified the need for reforms to educational curricula to address 
issues surrounding peacebuilding and encouraging a more inclusive and pluralist society’2. The 
revisions to the curricula were expected to address the need for inclusive policy and practice 
with equitable representation in decision-making around policy reforms, education

administration and school governance; all groups should benefit from an equitable allocation 
of education inputs; all groups must feel that their cultures, gender identities, religions and 
languages are recognized and respected within the education system. Revisions to the civic 
education curricula and supplementary modules for language was perceived as a means of 
improving trust and social cohesion between people and groups by strengthening 
competencies in analyzing the legacies of conflict; resolving conflict and promoting peace and 
social cohesion. 
Additionally, the Government also highlighted two pre-conditions that will contribute towards 
the educational reforms, namely, curriculum revisions and school to university level models 
aimed at strengthening competencies among young Sri Lankans for analyzing, resolving, and 
preventing conflict as well as promoting peace within their communities. 
Analysis of the situation on the ground in the conflict-affected areas also highlighted the need 
for psychosocial support for affected communities. It noted that psychosocial services are of 
ad hoc nature without proper support programmes for follow-up work and feed-back 
mechanisms. The National Mental Health Policy expired in 2015, and an updated Policy was 
needed. 
Many donor-funded projects have examined some of the issues highlighted in the previous 
sections. At the time of the design of this Project, there have been four projects implemented 
in Sri Lanka supported by the UN Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund (PBF)3 at a total value 
of USD 655,000.

2. Background 
The Peacebuilding Priority Plan (PPP) supports the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the 
Government's reconciliation and accountability commitments in keeping with the Human 
Rights principles and standards as part of its peacebuilding agenda. In terms of the agreement 
signed by the Co-Chairs of the Peacebuilding Board, the UN Resident Representative and the 
Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka are eligible to source funds from the UN 
Peacebuilding Fund to implement the peacebuilding agenda in Sri Lanka 
2.1. 
The Project 
The Project, Promoting Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka, has identified the following three 
intervention areas based on the development of PPP and its implementation. Firstly, the 
Government set in place two Ministries with mandates to promote national integration and 
reconciliation, and national dialogue across the country. Given the number of stakeholders, it 
was important to set in place a coherent national architecture for the institutions mandated 
with peacebuilding, including a regularised platform for dialogue at all levels (Outcome # 1). 
Secondly, the Report of the Taskforce on Reconciliation Mechanisms recommended changes 
to educational curricula4 supporting social cohesion, thus providing the rationale for Outcome 
# 2. Thirdly, the same Task Force recommended providing psychosocial support5, in particular 
addressing affected youth and young refugees, IDPs and former child soldiers providing the 
background for Outcome 3. 
The Project budget is USD 1.6 million (see Annex 2.1 for details). 
The Project contributes to PPP outcome 'Reconciliation' (Sri Lankan society with peaceful co-
existence and a sense of belonging6). The focus of the Project is in line with 2.1 (National 
Reconciliation), 2.3 (Conflict prevention) and 4.1(Strengthening essential national state 
capacity) of PBF Focus areas. 
The Project commenced in April 2017 with a duration of 29 months but has been extended up 
to 31 December 2020 with financial closure on 30 September 2020. 
Project Objective and Outcomes 
The Project's Theory of Change (ToC) is reproduced below7: 
IF authorities committed to peacebuilding and healing develop, through inclusive 
consultative processes, policies and strategies that provide opportunities and mechanisms 
for groups involved in and affected by the conflict to interact and share lessons and 
experiences, AND to jointly participate in rebuilding, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts 
between and amongst communities, THEN prospects for creating a society that is tolerant 
and lives in harmony are greatly enhanced. 
The key assumptions of the ToC are the availability of effective consultation processes and 
opportunities for sharing lessons and experiences together with joint community interaction

to necessary platforms for peace and harmony in the affected communities. The evaluation 
focussed on these elements to assess the performance of the Project. 
The key objective set out in the ToC aligns well with the PPP Outcome on Reconciliation, which 
relates to the establishment of positive relationships and mutual understanding between and 
among different groups contributing to peaceful co-existence. 
The project aimed to implement this theory of change through the following three outcome 
areas:  
Outcome 1 
Processes and mechanisms promoting social cohesion and conflict 
prevention, including through dialogue and early warning, institutionalized 
at national and sub-national levels 
Outcome 2 
Education system supports inter-personal and inter-group understanding 
and interaction among teachers, students, parents, and communities 
Outcome 3 
Conflict-related mental health issues are addressed to reduce inequalities and 
promote greater state and civic engagement in reconciliation processes 
The key outputs and performance indicators are given in Table 2.1. Annex 2.2 gives Outcomes,
