EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Background and context  
The 12 countries and territories1 covered by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Eastern 
Caribbean Area (ECA) Office are Small Island Developing States (SIDS) comprising about 2.3 million 
people, of which 27 per cent are children. All 12 of these countries and territories are classified as high 
or upper-middle-income and as ‘very high’ and ‘high’ on the Human Development Index (HDI). Most 
countries in the sub-region carry a high debt burden. Public debt reduces state spending on essential 
public services, which is further exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19) pandemic.  
 
Evaluation Object  
The object of the evaluation was the 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean Multi-Country Programme 
(MCP). It covered 12 countries and territories in the sub-region, with an overall budget of about USD 40 
million.  
 
The 2017-2021 UNICEF Eastern Caribbean MCP has been developed in alignment with the UN 
Caribbean Multi-country Strategic Development Framework (UN-MSDF) 2017-2021 priorities: (a) an 
inclusive, equitable and prosperous Caribbean; (b) a safe, cohesive and just Caribbean; and (c) a 
sustainable and resilient Caribbean. The programme is defined in the context of the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development, the Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action 
(SAMOA) Pathway and national and regional frameworks. 
 
The overall goal of the 2017-2021 MCP was “an Eastern Caribbean where no child lives in poverty, all 
children achieve minimum academic qualifications in a quality, protective and resilient learning 
environment and free from violence, neglect, exploitation and abuse.” Three outcomes were designed 
to contribute to this goal:  
• 
By 2021, 10% more children and adolescents, particularly boys, access equitable, healthy, safe 
and protective learning environments in development and humanitarian contexts  
• 
30% more vulnerable and poor households – particularly female-headed and large 
households - have access to quality social services 
• 
All girls and boys (in and outside humanitarian situations) grow up healthy, resilient and 
benefit from improved parenting practices and strengthened child protection systems 
 
There was an unequivocal UNICEF ECA demand to revisit the UNICEF M-CPD, including its 
achievements, but also its ability to adapt and flex to unexpected contextual changes, whether climate 
change, migration or the COVID-19 pandemic, among other, inevitable crises, including health crises. 
The recent eruption of the Soufriere volcano in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is only one example 
of these challenges. There is great emphasis now also on “building back better,” increasing the resilience 
of the SIDS to inevitable future challenges.   
  
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Intended Audiences  
The purpose of this M-CPE was to supports UNICEF learning efforts in enhancing the relevance and 
effectiveness of UNICEF programmes in the Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA), particularly by informing the 
development of the next Multi-Country Programme 2022-2026. 
 
The objectives of the evaluation were as follows:  

FINAL REPORT  
EVALUATION 
 
10 
 
• 
To assess the relevance, effectiveness, coherence and sustainability of the 2017-2021 
UNICEF, MCPD and implementation with a particular focus on relevance and connectedness 
and a formative and forward-looking focus on the current and evolving ECA context.  
• 
To take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the development and 
humanitarian results, including effects in addressing disparities and inequities; and identify 
the most effective implementation strategies and partnerships for UNICEF ECA to adopt for 
the next phase of programme development.  
• 
To determine how UNICEF can most effectively position itself, build on its comparative 
advantage, and provide specific recommendations to improve the design and relevance of 
the 2022-2026 MCP in the ECA and UN-MSDCF.  
  
The evaluation Terms of Reference served as the basis for the thematic, geographic and chronological 
aspects of the scope of work. This included its three main components, with a deeper dive into the 
issues of child protection, violence and resilience, as well as the UNICEF hurricane and migration 
response, also in relation to the COVID-19 crisis. While the MCP generally aimed to implement the 
identified priorities and components across the 12 countries and territories, the evaluation also 
identified specific case studies on the selected themes described above, in three chosen countries, the 
British Virgin Islands, Dominica, as well as Trinidad and Tobago. It covered three and a half years of the 
MCP, from the beginning of the current MCP and UN-MSDF to April 2021.   
  
The primary audience of the evaluation was UNICEF ECA Multi-Country Office (MCO) and UNICEF Latin 
America and the Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO), with interest also from UNICEF HQ, UNICEF donors, 
and other UN agencies, as well as the sub-regional organizations, governments and civil society 
organizations implementing related interventions in the 12 countries and territories.  
   
Methodology    
The design of the evaluation was non-experimental and theory based, applying contribution analysis 
and utilization focused, participatory mixed-methods that included both quantitative and qualitative 
data in 
assessing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
UNICEF 
MCP 
approaches 
adopted 
in 
the 
current programme cycle against their intended aims. The formative aspect of the evaluation allowed 
for conclusions to be drawn on the MCP conceptual framework and UNICEF’s Theory of Change (ToC) 
related to how MCP would achieve the goals they were intended for. The theory-based approach was 
further strengthened by describing similar interventions, notably child protection and disaster risk 
reduction (DRR) in the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, and Trinidad and Tobago. The selected case 
study themes particularly explored the adaptation and flexibility of the MCP to intransigent problems 
such as violence and the increasingly frequent crises facing the region.  
 
The evaluation relied substantially on secondary data sources, where these were made available to the 
evaluation team. Primary data collection methods enhanced existing data or covered identified gaps 
and priorities and included the following:   
 
• 
Perception survey (e-survey)   
• 
Key informant interviews (KIIs) 
• 
Group interviews  
 
Overall, the evaluation sought to improve data quality through the triangulation of findings. This 
evaluation was conducted remotely in a context of restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key Findings 
Evaluation question 1:  To what extent did the MCP objectives (including any adjustment of objectives) 
and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the changing circumstances 
in the 12 Eastern Caribbean countries and territories? 
Main findings: While the original MCP objectives and outcomes were well aligned with both sub-
regional and the priorities of the supported countries and territories, based on document review, e-
survey and interview data, to a degree, they had to be set-aside to due to the need to react to the 
sudden-onset disasters, whether hurricanes, COVID-19 or most recently, the volcanic eruption in Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines. The MCP was able to adapt and flex to both the specific national priorities 
of supported countries and territories, as well as to the more immediate needs imposed by these 
disasters, but the nexus between developmental and humanitarian work is not yet fully integrated, 
based on a review of the MCP TOC and interviews.  
 
Evaluation question 2: To what extent did the MCP objectives (including any adjustment of objectives) 
and UNICEF-supported interventions remain appropriate and relevant to the needs of children and 
young people, especially the most marginalized? 
Main findings: While the MCP prioritized addressing the needs of the most marginalized and 
vulnerable children, UNICEF relied primarily on governments to identify these populations (with the 
exception of Trinidad and Tobago) and major data gaps existed on identifying the poorest and 
especially ‘invisible’ or ‘unaccounted’ children, based on a review of poverty data, as well as interviews. 
The COVID-19 crisis has generated a new group of marginalized children, but again with limited data.  
Strength of evidence: Medium (Low on disability) 
 
Evaluation question 3: What are the major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of the MCP 
outputs? (e.g. (a) external factors - political, social, economic; (b) internal factors – implementation 
model/structure, quantity, quality, timeliness of delivery). What influence did these factors have on 
achievement (or not) of MCP outcomes? 
Main findings:  
Progress on original MCP outcomes is mixed, based particularly on UNICEF ECA project monitoring 
and reporting data. Primarily this was due to the need to recurrently redirect resources to crisis 
management, but also due to the highly ambitious and comprehensive MCP, which was not fully 
aligned with the means of UNICEF ECA, as indicated through consultations with UNICEF ECA staff in 
particular. More progress was made in outcome areas, namely in life-long learning that utilized the full 
suite of UNICEF strategies, including evidence-based advocacy for policy change, communication 
strategies to influence behavior change and actual service provision, over a long time period. While 
some progress was made in the promotion of child protection legislation, actual implementation was 
constrained by institutional capacity, as well as deeply entrenched norms that held-back the behavior 
change required. The Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) demonstrated that the influence of 
evidence alone on government strategies and policies was more mixed, with a particular weakness 
identified in influencing public expenditure for children. While tracking public expenditure for children 
was a key indicator in the MCP results framework, related data was not systematically collected and 
analyzed. Generally, monitoring and evaluation, especially data quality remained a concern across the 
main outcome areas, with limited adaptation made to these efforts despite the major challenges 
posed by the recurrent crises in the region. 
(See below for main findings in the three MCP components)  
 
Strength of Evidence: Medium 
 
 
 

FINAL REPORT  
EVALUATION

Main findings:  
Education 
Progress on original MCP learning outcomes was mixed, based namely on OECS education statistics 
from the sub-region, due to the need to shift attention and human resources to disaster response, 
according to interviews. 
  
Further progress was made on the availability and quality of early childhood development and positive 
behavioral management, the former employing the full suite of UNICEF strategies, from policy advocacy 
to the actual provision of related services, but no effect has yet been felt on school retention rates, 
especially of more marginalized boys, based on a review of OECS data, the e-survey and interviews. 
While initiatives beyond ECD and positive behavioral management may have responded to real 
government needs, they were more piece-meal, based on a review of UNICEF ECA reporting.  
Strength of Evidence: High 
 
Main findings:  
Child protection 
While UNICEF has a unique mandate and clear value proposition on the promotion of child protection, 
there has been limited progress in reducing child abuse and violence against children, based on 
available data on related cases. While some progress has been made on legislation (e.g. in Saint Lucia 
and Trinidad and Tobago), actual implementation is constrained by institutional capacity, as well as 
deeply entrenched norms in the small communities, based on interviews.  
In addition to promoting related policy change, UNICEF ECA has particularly utilized communications 
for development to promote related awareness among children, youth, caregivers and the broader 
population, based on UNICEF ECA reporting and interviews. There are particular challenges related to 
the time required for awareness raising to influence behavior and underlying norms, as well as 
measurement issues with assessing related behavior change.  
Strength of Evidence: Medium 
 
Main findings:  
Social inclusion and child rights monitoring 
The flagship data UNICEF data product has been the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), though 
its influence, along with other produced data and evidence on government strategies and policies is 
more mixed, based on interview data. UNICEF advocacy for the increase of public expenditure for 
children is a particular weakness, with also no data regularly gathered on related government 
commitments by UNICEF ECA. UNICEF has been extending its mandate into social protection, especially 
through the use of its DRR support as a catalyst for broader policy reform (e.g. British Virgin Islands, 
Dominica) but its mandate and added-value, also in relation to that of other UN agencies remains less 
clear, based on other evaluations and interview data. 
Strength of Evidence: Medium 
 
Evaluation question 4: What is UNICEF’s added value in the 12 Eastern Caribbean countries/territories 
– particularly in comparison to other UN agencies? Are these strengths a result of UNICEF corporate 
features or are they specific to the multi-country Office? 
Main findings: 
The M-CPD and ToC did not sufficiently capture UNICEF added-value, especially the interlinkages and 
synergies between upstream and downstream approaches and between inside-track and outside track 
advocacy; the latter being closely linked to the UNICEF established “brand” and excellent 
communications, which are among its global assets, based on the e-survey and interview data. 
Strength of Evidence: Medium
