PREFACE 
UNICEF has, over the years, played a key role in setting the global agenda on Early Childhood 
Development and advancing the realization of the rights of all children, especially the most disadvantaged, 
as affirmed in the 2014 – 2017 Strategic Plan. During this period, UNICEF efforts contributed to the adoption 
of Target 2 under SDG 4 on the importance of early childhood development that when the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015. Nonetheless, UNICEF global leadership and impact on 
young children and their families have not been assessed; hence we launched this evaluation to ascertain 
the conceptual underpinning of ECD work in UNICEF and to draw, from the past few years of 
implementation lessons that can be applied for course correction alongside other the mid-term 
assessments. The evaluation was structured around three themes that were arrived at after an extensive 
scoping exercise: (1) UNICEF’s Global Leadership  (2) System Strengthening  (3) Program Quality and 
Impact  
 
UNICEF has positioned itself as an ECD leader and expert, policy influencer, capacity developer, and 
service provider. In some countries where  UNICEF generated evidence on children’s developmental status 
or on public financing for ECD and combined this with advocacy and communications, there were notable 
increases public investment in ECD in some countries. The Major challenges in implementing UNICEF 
global change strategies were associated with (1) financial resources, (2) government allocation of 
resources to implement the strategies, (3) political buy-in, and (4) adaptation to the country context. The 
impact of COVID-19 on UNICEF’s strategies poses new challenges for the organization and has elevated 
the importance of certain strategies. 
 
The global evaluation team consisted of five international experts, with management provided by UNICEF’s 
Evaluation Office and with support from UNICEF’s ECD Section within the Programme Division at 
UNICEF’s International Headquarters in New York. Dr Pamela Wridt (Senior Monitoring and Evaluation 
Expert and ECD Researcher) and Dr Philip David Zelazo (Senior ECD Researcher and Developmental 
Neuroscience Expert) served as co-team leaders for this evaluation and were jointly responsible for the 
overall conceptualization and quality of the evaluation. Dr Caroline Frobel (ECD Neuroscience Researcher 
and Data Scientist) was primarily responsible for data collection, extraction and analysis procedures 
associated with UNICEF’s corporate monitoring system. Mr. Jonathan Carter and Mr. Conrad Barberton 
(ECD Scaling Experts) from Cornerstone Economic Research in South Africa were primarily responsible 
for undertaking the scalability and systems strengthening component of the evaluation. 
 
I would also like to express my gratitude to UNICEF colleagues to the PD ECD Section colleagues; 
particularly Nada Elattar, the ECD Section focal person for this evaluation for coordinating technical inputs 
in the ECD Section and ably facilitating data collection from regional and country offices. Other ECD Section 
team members also provided valuable support and inputs: Pia Britto, Chemba Raghavan,  Ana Nieto and 
Aditi Shrikhande, the Regional and Country Office ECD Advisor, Specialists and focal persons for their 
advice and support, and thought-provoking contributions.  
Lastly, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Evaluation Office to see the evaluation through. Kathleen 
Letshabo developed the evaluation approach, and Adrian Shikwe who managed the evaluation. As always, 
Geeta Dey and Celeste Lebowitz provided strong administrative support throughout the evaluation. I 
commend the efforts of all colleagues and believe that our colleagues in the ECD team will find the findings, 
insights and recommendations herein useful and timely.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Evaluation Context and Purpose 
 
Evaluation Background. During the period covered by this evaluation, UNICEF’s approach to early 
childhood development (ECD) became more grounded in the neuroscience research, as summarised in 
The Lancet series on Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale (2017). This 
publication was co-authored by UNICEF and was a pivotal publication that reflected a paradigm shift in how 
ECD is defined, valued, and implemented by policy makers and practitioners on a global and local level. In 
particular, the Nurturing Care Framework introduced in this series postulated that ECD is a synergistic 
outcome of five interrelated components: 1) good health; 2) adequate nutrition; 3) opportunities for early 
learning; 4) security and safety; and 5) responsive caregiving. 
 
Evaluation Rationale. UNICEF programming strategies are in the process of shifting from siloed 
approaches to multisectoral ECD packages, encompassing health, nutrition, HIV, WASH, education, child 
protection, and social policy. This evaluation provides the first comprehensive assessment of UNICEF work 
in Early Childhood Development (ECD), and early stimulation and responsive care, in particular, after 
advances in neuroscience research underscored the importance of this period of childhood development 
and placed it on the global development agenda. Thus, an evaluation of UNICEF’s leadership in early 
childhood development is timely and warranted to assess the organization’s progress in advancing the 
holistic ECD agenda through a multisectoral programming approach. 
Evaluation Purpose: This is a formative evaluation in which the main purpose was to draw lessons from 
policy, advocacy, and programming strategies and interventions to inform good practices and appropriate 
course corrections in UNICEF work in ECD. The secondary purpose of the evaluation was to provide 
evidence for accountability and oversight within UNICEF and relevant cooperating partners, and to provide 
concrete recommendations for strengthening UNICEF’s impact on the lives of young children and their 
families in the new strategic planning period. 
 
Object of the Evaluation. This evaluation examines UNICEF’s global leadership in the broader field of 
practice to promote ECD, as well as the organization’s support to national governments in ensuring parents 
and adult caregivers provide appropriate early stimulation and responsive care to young children as a basis 
for their healthy development, school readiness and on-time enrolment into pre-primary and primary school.  
This includes a detailed examination of two components of the Nurturing Care Framework: (1) responsive 
caregiving; and (2) opportunities for early learning.  
 
Scope of the Evaluation. The evaluation focused on the early years of life - from birth to age of entry into 
primary school (usually 0-5, noting that the age of school entry varies by country context). The evaluation 
assessed all UNICEF goal areas for early stimulation and responsive care programmes and services on a 
global, regional, and country level. The evaluation was both retrospective and prospective (forward looking), 
examining the period from 2014 through 2021 (encompassing two Strategic Planning periods). It included 
countries in all contexts and situations where UNICEF was or is implementing strategies to strengthen ECD 
systems and services, including development, humanitarian, and peacebuilding contexts. 
Evaluation Approach and Methods. The evaluation adopted an inductive and retroactive theory-based 
approach primarily because the object of the evaluation (early stimulation and responsive care) was not 
well defined or codified in the organization’s theory of change and results matrices. The evaluation methods 
included a mix of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques on global, regional, 

 
11 
country, and programme levels. Data were collected in five phases using the following methods: (1) 
secondary data from 157 countries; (2) document review of more than 400 reports, plans, studies, and 
evaluations from 28 UNICEF Country Offices (COs), 7 Regional Offices (ROs), and 5 Headquarter (HQ) 
Divisions; (3) institutional survey with 54 UNICEF COs; (4) remote key informant interviews/focus 
groups with 21 UNICEF staff members and external experts; and (6) six case studies of UNICEF-
supported parenting programmes or initiatives (Jordan, Mali, Paraguay, Rwanda, Serbia, and Thailand).  
Evaluation Criteria and Limitations. Evaluation criteria assessed the internal and external coherence of 
UNICEF’s work in early stimulation and responsive care, the effectiveness of UNICEF’s efforts to 
strengthen national systems for ECD, and the relevance and outcomes of UNICEF’s leadership and direct 
support for parents and young children. Summative evaluation criteria were also identified to provide 
qualitative ratings on the scope and strength of the evidence from nascent to advanced. In light of the global 
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation team could not undertake primary data collection 
activities through direct contact with stakeholders and beneficiaries, and observations of the implementation 
of interventions; hence we modified the original evaluation design and methods accordingly. However, 
additional questions about the impact of COVID-19 on UNICEF’s work in ECD and early stimulation and 
responsive care programming were integrated into the methods to capture this information. 
Key Evaluation Findings 
 
The evaluation objectives and questions addressed three themes that were identified during the scoping of 
the evaluation. The key findings for each theme indicate both positive advancements as well as structural 
challenges in implementing a multisectoral approach to early childhood development programming. 
 
● Theme 1: UNICEF’s Global Leadership ……………………………………………………………….. 
 
Objective: To assess the internal coherence and effect of UNICEF’s global leadership in early 
childhood development. 
 
Evaluation Questions: To what extent is UNICEF positioned and prepared to lead and support 
governments in scaling early stimulation and care systems? What impact has UNICEF’s leadership 
had on the field of early childhood development, international development agencies, evidence in 
early childhood development, and in communicating the importance of early stimulation and care 
to governments and development agencies?  
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
 
Institutional Readiness. UNICEF was successful in discharging its role as global leader in ECD when 
ROs and COs had sufficient human and financial resources to make it an explicit development priority that 
was integrated into its results frameworks.  
Internal Coherence. While ECD is prioritised in UNICEF’s current Strategic Plan, there is a lack of internal 
coherence on ECD as it relates to multisectoral programming and the engagement of parents. 
Effectiveness of UNICEF Leadership. UNICEF’s leadership on ECD was transformative for the 
international development community over the evaluation period in raising awareness about and gaining 
buy-in for an integrated ECD agenda, especially given the lack of investment by the organization in sufficient 
human and financial resources for effective multisectoral programming.  
Global Positioning. A lack of evidence on the situation of young children and on the efficacy of UNICEF-
supported programmes places the organization at a disadvantage in maintaining its global leadership and 
positioning for ECD.

● Theme 2: System Strengthening ……………………………………………………………………… 
 
Objective: To analyse UNICEF’s contributions and effectiveness in strengthening national capacity 
and systems to implement and scale early stimulation and responsive care programs and services. 
 
Evaluation Question: To what extent has UNICEF supported governments to strengthen 
multisectoral policies and systems for ECD, including national capacity to scale the delivery of early 
stimulation and care programs and services? 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
 
Enabling Environment for ECD. UNICEF makes significant contributions to the development of policies 
and national ECD plans, but few country offices focus their support on strengthening systems to scale up 
early stimulation and responsive care programmes. 
 
Coordination Mechanisms. Many UNICEF COs make valuable contributions to multisectoral coordination 
through their participation and, in some countries, joint leadership of ECD coordination committees. 
 
Public Financing. UNICEF COs lack the capacity and technical knowledge needed to support line 
Ministries to mobilise and ensure the equitable allocation of public funds to ECD programmes, and to 
evaluate the efficient and effective use of such funds.  
 
National Training Systems. UNICEF COs’ monitoring and evaluation activities mostly focus on measuring 
the reach of programmes (e.g., the numbers of children reached), rather than contributing to the 
development of systems that can be used to monitor and manage the activities of frontline workers to 
ensure programmes are implemented with fidelity. 
 
● Theme 3: Programme Quality and Impact ….………………………………………………………… 
 
Objective: To assess the relevance and impact of UNICEF’s direct support for vulnerable children, 
parents, and frontline workers participating in early stimulation and responsive care programs in 
low-resource and emergency settings. 
 
Evaluation Question: What evidence is there that UNICEF direct support for early stimulation 
and care programs is making a difference on a significant scale for vulnerable children, parents 
and caregivers? 
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… 
 
Programme Delivery. UNICEF has focused its efforts primarily on public ECD programmes, working with 
governments to deliver parenting and early learning programmes. UNICEF is reaching some of the most 
marginalized child populations, but it is difficult to assess the adequacy of programme coverage. 
Programme Design. UNICEF supported early stimulation and care programmes have adopted evidence-
based practices, with the exception of encouraging children’s agency and promoting autonomy-supportive 
parenting and teaching. 
Programme Scaling. Very few of the programmes that UNICEF pilots are designed to be taken to scale 
because the focus is on proving effectiveness rather than on developing an understanding of what it takes 
to institutionalise the programme in government systems. 
Programme Quality of Implementation. There was almost no evidence of efforts to ensure programme 
fidelity.  Fidelity is the extent to which frontline workers adhere to the protocol for programme delivery.
