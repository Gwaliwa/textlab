GLOSSARY  
Term 
Description 
Accountability 
Principles 
The UN defines accountability principles as the responsibility of individuals, organisations, 
and institutions to be answerable for their decisions and actions, ensuring transparency in 
decision-making, following established rules and procedures, being accountable to 
stakeholders, monitoring and reporting performance, and taking corrective action when 
necessary. Accountability is a vital component of good governance and promotes trust and 
sustainable development.1 
Adolescents 
Adolescents with disabilities, special needs, and those who have dropped out of school for 
various reasons. 
Child Protection 
UNICEF uses the term ‘child protection’ to refer to prevention and response to violence, 
exploitation, and abuse of children in all contexts. This includes reaching children who are 
especially vulnerable to these threats, such as those living without family care, on the 
streets or in situations of conflict or natural disasters.2 
Civil Society 
Organisation 
(CSO) 
A CSO is any non-profit, voluntary citizens’ group which is organized on a local, national, 
or international level.3 
Contribution 
Analysis 
Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme 
is making to observed results.4 
Global Evaluation 
Reports Oversight 
System (GEROS) 
The GEROS system consists of systematic and independent quality assessment of 
evaluation reports that have been uploaded to the corporate Evaluation and Research 
Database (ERDB) by UNICEF Country Offices, Regional Offices, HQ divisions and 
Evaluation Office. The purpose of the Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System 
(GEROS) is to support and strengthen the evaluation function to meet and exceed United 
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards, UN System Wide Action Plan (UN-SWAP) 
on gender equality and other UNICEF commitments (including equity and human-rights 
based approaches).5 
Hackathons 
A hackathon is an event that brings together experts and creates a collaborative 
environment for solving a certain problem. While the majority of hackathons revolve around 
computer programming and IT, many other industries follow suit.6  
Humanitarian 
Action 
Humanitarian action saves lives, alleviates suffering, and maintains human dignity 
following conflict, shocks, and natural disasters.7 
Humanitarian 
Principles 
Humanitarian principles are a set of values and ethical standards that guide humanitarian 
action to ensure assistance and protection to people affected by crises in a neutral, 
impartial, independent, and humane way. The four main principles are humanity, neutrality, 
impartiality, and independence. Upholding these principles ensures aid is provided based 
on need, without discrimination, and with respect for the dignity, safety, and rights of those 
affected by crisis.8 
Human Rights 
Based Approach 
(HRBA) 
The human rights-based approach (HRBA) is a conceptual framework for the process of 
human development that is normatively based on international human rights standards 
and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. It seeks to analyse 
inequalities which lie at the heart of development problems and redress discriminatory 
practices and unjust distributions of power that impede development progress.9 
Life Skills  
Life skills are defined as a group of psychosocial competencies and interpersonal skills 
that help people make informed decisions, solve problems, think critically and creatively, 
communicate effectively, build healthy relationships, empathize with others, and cope with 
and manage their lives in a healthy and productive manner.10 
Marginalized 
Groups 
Persons with disabilities, youth, women, members of minority groups, internally displaced 
persons, and non-nationals including refugees, asylum seekers, and migrant workers.11

Nonviolent 
Disciplinary 
Practices 
The nonviolent disciplinary practices included in the child discipline module are: 1) 
explaining why a behaviour is wrong, 2) taking away privileges or not allowing him/her to 
leave the house, and 3) giving him/her something else to do.13  
OECD-DAC 
Criteria 
The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance 
Committee (OECD-DAC) Network on Development Evaluation (EvalNet) has defined six 
evaluation criteria – relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and 
sustainability – and two principles for their use. These criteria are intended to guide 
evaluations.14 
Participatory 
Approach15 
Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or 
policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation 
process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting 
of the study. 
Summative 
Evaluation 
Focuses on analysing the performance at the end of the project (strengths, weaknesses, 
and achievement of intended results), but also seeks to document the key lessons learnt 
and develop robust recommendations (evidence-based) to inform the future 
implementation. 
Technical, 
Vocational 
Education and 
Training (TVET) 
TVET refers to education and training aimed at developing skills related to various 
occupational fields, production, services, and livelihoods. It includes learning opportunities 
at secondary, post-secondary, and tertiary levels, as well as work-based and continuing 
training. TVET also emphasizes the development of literacy and numeracy skills, 
transversal skills, and citizenship skills.16

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) State of Palestine (SoP) office commissioned a Summative 
Evaluation of the UNICEF-supported Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP or the 
Programme). ADAP is uniquely composed of 21 individual projects that focused on adolescent education, skills 
development, and child protection (CP). The Programme’s goal was to provide Palestinian adolescents, 
particularly the most vulnerable, with access to secure, high-quality, and inclusive learning opportunities and to 
invest in their life skills and employability though the education sector.  
Chapter 1 - Intervention Context and Object of 
Evaluation: Adolescents (between 10-19 years) constitute 
22.3 per cent17 of the population in the SoP and face 
challenges related to education access and quality, as well 
as protection risks that have been worsened by the prolonged 
humanitarian crisis and COVID-19. Adolescents (aged 15-
24) face high unemployment rates (41 per cent),18 especially 
girls, due to a volatile economy, decrease in public and 
private capacity to provide job opportunities, and an outdated 
education system. Additionally, around 90 per cent19 of 
children aged 1-14 years faced violent discipline at home. 
Consequently, 
320,439 
children 
reportedly 
required 
protection and psychosocial support.   
The object of this evaluation is the ADAP Programme which 
was a part of UNICEF’s Area Programme Document (APD) 
(2018-2022) and included 21 projects. The Programme 
focused on training and creating awareness on life skills and 
citizenship education (LSCE), non-violence and positive 
discipline. The implementation included a hybrid approach where the key public sector partners, i.e., the Ministry 
of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) were supported by 11 implementing partners 
(IP) in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The total budget was 18.12 million shekels, including 
53,200 shekels for supplies. 
Chapter 2 - Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Summative Evaluation with the primary 
purpose of demonstrating accountability by objectively assessing the Programme’s achievements against 
intended results. The secondary purpose was to identify challenges, lessons learnt, and recommendations for 
future programming. The evaluation target audience included UNICEF, MoE and MoSD, IPs, UN agencies, 
donors, and beneficiaries. The evaluation scope covered 21 projects implemented in six governorates (Gaza 
City, Deir Al Balah, Khan Yunis, Hebron, Ramallah, and Nablus) of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank between 
2018 and 2021. The evaluation excluded the assessment of UNICEF’s role in the Education Cluster 
Coordination and other education and CP interventions. 
Chapter 3 - Evaluation Criteria, Design, Methodology, and Limitations: The evaluation followed the 
established Organisation of Economic Cooperation-Development Development Assistance Committee (OECD-
DAC)20 criteria, including relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability. The evaluation also 
focused on humanitarian action criteria (coverage, coherence, and connectedness) and UNICEF’s cross-cutting 
priorities, including gender equality, equity, child rights, and accountability. 
In line with the evaluation purpose, the evaluation employed two approaches, theory-based and participatory. 
The participatory approach ensured the engagement of all key stakeholders throughout the evaluation process, 
from planning to dissemination. The theory-based approach was employed to assess the Theory of Change 
(ToC) for its completeness and validity. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, utilising both 
secondary (for quantitative data) and primary data collection methods (for qualitative data). Primary data was 
collected by conducting 37 key informant interviews (KII), 31 focus group discussions (FGD) and a validation 
workshop. Secondary data was collected through desk review of 189 documents. The evaluation team reached 
out to 279 individuals, with over 50 per cent being females and girls (i.e., 153), including public sector officials, 
UNICEF and IP staff, parents and caregivers, school staff, and adolescent boys and girls.

ii 
The evaluation team faced delays due to the absence of the beneficiary list and teacher strikes in the West 
Bank. Therefore, the approach for FGD implementation was modified, and sessions were conducted both 
virtually and in-person to obtain the perspectives of the most important stakeholder – adolescent boys and girls. 
Additionally, there were gaps in the data, including limited secondary data to map the Programme's 
achievements for CP interventions and the absence of an impact statement in the ToC and Results Framework, 
which constrained effectiveness and impact assessment. 
Chapter 4 - Evaluation Findings: Findings for each evaluation criteria are given below:  
Relevance: The evaluation findings indicated that the ADAP Programme demonstrated relevance through its 
inclusive design process, involving consultations with key stakeholders such as the MoE, MoSD, civil society 
organizations (CSO), and UN agencies. These consultations enabled the identification of stakeholders’ priorities 
and needs. Additionally, the Programme effectively utilised insights from secondary assessments to inform its 
interventions and adapt to the national and local contexts. However, the evaluation findings also suggested a 
notable gap in the direct engagement of adolescents during the design phase. The Programme missed the 
opportunity to involve adolescents, which could have provided valuable perspectives for designing the 
Programme interventions. 
Efficiency: The evaluation team faced challenges in conducting an efficiency assessment due to limited 
progress data for the CP component (Output 2.3).21 The available secondary data for the education component 
(2018-2021) indicated that the Programme achieved 76 per cent of its outputs while utilising only 68 per cent of 
the allocated funds which indicates cost efficiency. While the team acknowledges this achievement, they were 
unable to identify the factors that contributed to the cost savings. It is possible that the savings were due to 
over-budgeting or the shift from in-person to remote interventions during and after the pandemic. On time 
efficiency, the Programme faced some delays due to various factors, including school closures resulting from 
the COVID-19 pandemic, weak infrastructure to support remote teaching and learning, and teacher strikes.  
The evaluation team found that UNICEF had financial tracking systems in place to monitor and report inter-
agency and donor investments, but the limited evidence prevented assessment of whether the system facilitated 
timely course correction and adaptive management, resulting in cost and time savings. 
Effectiveness: Based on the available secondary data (Result Assessment Module (RAM) Report 2018-2022), 
the evaluation findings indicated that the Programme was largely effective for achieving outcome targets (only 
for the education component). The Programme achieved all three outcome indicators, but progress information 
for the CP component was not tracked in the RAM reports and therefore could not be assessed. Despite 
significant challenges such as COVID-19, ongoing security concerns, and frequent teachers strikes, the 
Programme achieved the education outcomes. Key factors contributing to this success included alignment of 
the ADAP Programme with national priorities, the use of a hybrid implementation model (involving IPs and the 
public sector), and the use of innovative and remote learning methods.  
The monitoring system exhibited some gaps, such as: disconnect between the indicators and targets of the IPs 
and the UNICEF ADAP results frameworks; lack of impact indicators; limitations of outcome indicators to assess 
quality/changes in the lives of beneficiaries; and insufficient evidence to show that monitoring data informed 
decision-making. A more focused approach will enable creating a usable and effective monitoring system for 
future programmes. 
Impact: Due to the absence of impact statements and indicators, the evaluation was limited in measuring the 
Programme’s impact. As such, the evaluation team explored perceived changes in impact levels among 
implementers and beneficiaries. Most of the beneficiaries perceived the interventions to have contributed 
positively, including acquiring new skills and knowledge, increasing self-confidence, improving communication, 
reducing violent behaviours, and experiencing a positive shift in disciplinary practices within communities and 
schools. Nonetheless, it was unclear to what extent these improvements resulted in job opportunities or created 
long-term behavioural changes in adolescents. The respondents also pointed out unintended impacts such as 
overburdened students and teachers due to poor scheduling of school-based activities timed with exams and 
adolescents becoming addicted to games due to the promotion of game-based learning. 
Sustainability: The evaluation findings indicated that some of the ADAP results such as the integration of LSCE 
into the Palestinian education system are expected to be fully sustained. Others, including the National Youth 
Volunteer Services Programme (NYVSP), knowledge and skill development of adolescents, and the reduction 
of violence in schools and homes, are only partially likely to be sustained. This is due to limited focus on 
transitioning learning into earning and short-term nature of CP interventions, raising concerns about their 
 
21 Output 2.3: More parents, teachers, adolescents, and other stakeholders have increased knowledge and skills to eliminate harmful practices and better protect children 
(aged 0-18) from violence, exploitation, and grave violations.

sustainability. Additionally, limited community involvement and external challenges (such as the Israeli 
occupation, Palestinians’ internal political divisions, and limited budgets for ministries) indicate continued 
technical and financial support are likely to be needed to sustain the Programme results.  
Coverage: The findings indicated that the Programme was largely successful in targeting most vulnerable 
areas, however gaps were identified particularly in addressing gender-specific vulnerabilities of male 
adolescents and those residing in Area C. The absence of consultations with adolescents during the design of 
ADAP interventions underscored the need for increased engagement with the target group. 
Coherence: The evaluation found that the ADAP Programme’s objectives and strategies were consistent with 
national policies for adolescent education and CP. These policies included the Education Sector Strategic Plan 
(2020), National Youth Strategy in State of Palestine (2020), National Policy Agenda (2017-2022), and National 
Intersectoral Violence Against Children Strategy in the Context of COVID-19 (2021-2023). Moreover, the 
Programme’s interventions were found to be in line with UNICEF’s Global Adolescent Programming Guidelines 
(2018). The evaluation also found that both the design and implementation of the Programme are largely 
consistent with the humanitarian principles – humanity, impartiality, and neutrality. However, due to Israeli 
occupation, not all communities in Area C were accessible which may have compromised the principle of 
independence.  
There was insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of external coordination with other actors to avoid 
duplication and gaps. This was attributed to the absence of a formal coordination mechanism and limited 
attention to ADAP by relevant public institutions.  
Connectedness: The evaluation findings indicated that the ADAP Programme effectively utilised internal 
synergies within UNICEF, specifically in the areas of CP, Health, Nutrition, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene 
(WASH), and Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) interventions. The CP Programme played a critical role in 
supporting education and adolescent outcomes, enabling the transfer of knowledge and skills to eliminate 
harmful practices and enhance CP in schools. The Health and WASH Sections collaborated with the ADAP 
Programme to address the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing hygiene kits, training, and 
cleaning materials to schools. The SBC Section provided cross-cutting support by conducting awareness 
sessions on non-violent discipline techniques and positive parenting. Furthermore, Programme interventions 
contributed to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG:4 (Quality Education), SDG:5 
(Gender Equality), SDG:8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG:10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG:16 
(Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).  
UNICEF Cross Cutting 
Gender Equality: The findings suggested that the ADAP Programme took into account gender and cultural 
factors, evidenced by providing separate training sessions and gender-specific skills training. However, the 
Programme design did not adequately address gender-specific determinants and conditions, such as higher 
school dropout rates for boys and their increased vulnerability to violence compared than girls. Furthermore, 
only one outcome indicator and one output indicator included gender-disaggregated targets. While the 
Programme reached a balanced number of boys and girls, there was limited reporting on results. Therefore, the 
evaluation found the ADAP Programme partially aligned with gender equality principles. 
Alignment with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda: The evaluation findings suggested that the ADAP Programme was 
partially aligned with UNICEF’s Equity Agenda. While the Programme prioritised identifying vulnerable groups 
through the Common Country Analysis (CCA) (2016), the Results Framework did not include specific targets 
for these groups and did not define a vulnerability criterion. The implementation focused on vulnerable groups, 
including adolescents with disabilities and those who were out-of-school (OOS). However, reporting did not 
include data on equity parameters, such as results achieved for vulnerable groups, disability status, or location.  
Child Rights and Accountability: The evaluation findings indicated that the Programme was aligned with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Children (CRC) principles of non-discrimination, best interests of the child, right 
to life, survival, and development, and views of the child. However, there was little to no involvement of 
adolescents in the Programme’s design. A dedicated feedback mechanism was implemented, but beneficiaries 
were unaware of it, and there was no evidence of how the Programme addressed the complaints and feedback. 
Chapter 5 – Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations 
Conclusion on Way Forward: Moving forward, the evaluation underlines the need for sustained focus on 
adolescents by all stakeholders (public sector, private entities, development partners and others). Policy 
interventions such as integration of LSCE and NYVSP are foundational and require continuous strategic and 
operational support for sustainable outcomes. The hybrid implementation model (involving public, private and 
CSO actors) has proven effective, particularly in facilitating the transition to remote teaching and learning, and

thus merits continuity. Increased advocacy and engagement with the public sector should promote acceptance 
of private and CSOs’ involvement for niche interventions, where these partners offer unique capacities and 
advantages.  
Future engagement with adolescents should underpin regular interaction with them to understand their 
challenges, aspirations, and potential pathways. Education interventions should emphasize infrastructure 
development and systemic capacities for remote/technology-based teaching and learning. This is critical to pre-
empt any future disruptions (like COVID-19 and security challenges) and for engaging learning experiences. 
Skill-building interventions must strike a balance between focus on pre-training, during training and post-training 
focus. The evaluation underscores the need for medium to long-term interventions for behaviour change, such 
as violence reduction and positive parenting. These require sustained messaging and community engagement 
for sustainability. Lastly, the next phase should prioritise an effective monitoring system for results tracking and 
evidence-based decision-making.  
Lessons Learnt: Key lessons and good practices are outlined below: 
• 
The Programme’s design and implementation were underpinned by innovative approaches. One notable 
innovation was the use of gamification for promoting learning, particularly in LSCE. This innovative 
approach proved to be an effective practice, leading to tangible outcomes in increased critical thinking and 
problem-solving skills among adolescents. The effectiveness of the gamification strategy also provides 
valuable insights for its potential application across different sectors and contexts.  
• 
The ADAP Programme (Education & Adolescents component) primarily focused on providing pre/during 
training support to adolescents. However, the post-training support aimed at fostering and improving the 
broader ecosystem for job creation and entrepreneurship was not addressed. Consequently, due to this 
gap, there is insufficient evidence to showcase the transition from learning to earning. This learning points 
out a potential design deficiency, underlining the need to balance pre/during training and post-training 
support, including access to capital financing, job placements, market access, and self-employment. This 
learning is applicable across all contexts, especially in regions where the infrastructure for job placements 
and entrepreneurship is less developed.  
• 
The ADAP Programme (CP component) support for behaviour change interventions (non-violent 
behaviours and positive parenting) had a short lifespan (six months to a year) and lacked a consistent 
approach to community engagement. Considering global evidence and feedback from participants, the 
lesson learnt is to plan behaviour change interventions with a medium to long-term lifecycle approach (2 
years or more). Moreover, these should be centred around community engagement interventions — 
organising and mobilising local youth groups, religious and community leaders, to enable messaging 
through such platforms for sustainable results. This lesson is applicable across sectors aiming for 
behavioural and normative changes, and contexts, where local platforms or groups are either readily 
available or could be mobilised for sustained messaging and localised accountabilities.  
Recommendations: Find below evaluation recommendations drawn from findings and conclusions. The 
recommendations have been improved based on the feedback received from the evaluation users: 
Recommendation 1: Keeping in view the APD 2023-25 priorities for adolescent boys and girls, UNICEF 
SoP is advised to draft an ADAP Results Framework and ToC for future guidance to develop 
projects/interventions and tracking of results. 
• 
Action # 1: Draft the ADAP Results Framework and ToC. The Results Framework must include impact 
statement and indicators, segregated outcomes and outputs, dedicated strategies, and underline allocation 
of resources for disadvantaged groups (adolescents in Area C, adolescent girls and boys, adolescents with 
disabilities, and OOS adolescents). (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF) 
• 
Action # 2: The Results Framework and ToC should be endorsed by the MoE in a high-level event. The 
Results Framework and ToC can guide future engagement with relevant public sector partners. (Primary 
Responsibility: UNICEF and MoE)  
Recommendation 2: Based on the learning from the previous ADAP phase, the future ADAP strategies 
and interventions merit a re-think and recalibration to offer better fit with the local context and achieve 
improved results for the vulnerable groups.  
• 
Action # 1: Within the Education & Adolescents component, the skills development interventions must 
strike balance between pre/during training and post post-training support such as access to finance, market 
linkages, access to employers, and business associations. (Primary Responsibility: UNICEF, Secondary 
Responsibility: MoE) 
• 
Action # 2: Establish clear vulnerability criteria to ensure the systematic inclusion of vulnerable groups in 
its programming. This criterion should include various aspects, including location, age, gender, disability 
status, etc. Specific strategies should be developed and implemented to address the unique needs of these
