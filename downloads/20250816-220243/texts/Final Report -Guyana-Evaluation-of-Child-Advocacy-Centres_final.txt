Executive Summary 
 
Introduction 
The following is a report on an independent evaluation of the integrated model and services 
provided by Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) in Guyana to child victims of sexual violence and 
their families. CACs were established by the Childcare & Protection Agency (CPA) with United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) support in eight (8) of the ten administrative regions in 
Guyana. The aim of the CPA and UNICEF’s collaborative initiative was to ensure the best 
interests of child victims of sexual violence were addressed, by introducing an integrated 
service delivery approach and inter-institution cooperation nationally.  
 
The main objectives of the CPA and UNICEF’s initiative were: 1) develop and implement an 
integrated approach for child sexual abuse investigation to avoid duplicative interviewing; 2) 
guarantee multidisciplinary involvement for all interventions to assure that the unique needs 
of children are recognised and met; 3) bring professionals to the child instead of asking 
children and their families to access services through many different portals; and 4) secure 
the involvement of communities across the country, to help prevent child abuse and offer 
child abuse victims the services and support that they need and deserve.   
 
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, and Intended Audience 
The purpose of this independent evaluation was to assess the model and services provided by 
CACs for child victims of sexual violence and their families in eight pilot regions and covered 
the period of January 2015 to March 2021. Evaluation evidence was assessed using the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance 
Committee’s criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and value 
for money. 
 
The objectives of the evaluation included: 
(i) To assess and evaluate the CAC integrative model of service delivery.  
(ii) To assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the CAC 
programme implementation over the period 2015-2021.   
(iii) To take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the goals and objectives of 
the CACs.  
(iv) To identify challenges (including the capacity to deliver) and opportunities (enablers 
factors) experienced in the delivery of prevention and support services in CACs.  
(v) To identify and document lessons learned, including those related to service design, the 
scope of support provided, resources, and implementation. 
(vi) To determine if the current strategies operational approaches of the CACs are sustainable 
or not and provide recommendations for the process of institutionalizing and scaling up of the 
CAC model and services nationally. 
 
The primary intended audiences of the evaluation includes UNICEF’s Guyana country office, 
the CPA, and the service providers ChildLink Guyana and Blossom Inc., which are managing the 
operation of CACs in the eight regions. Other secondary intended audiences, include key 
government members including Law Enforcement, Office of the DPP, Ministries of Health and 
Education, Parliamentarians, local government and municipal authorities and professionals 
working with children and parents at the local level, civil society organizations providing service 

ix 
 
in Guyana, as well, and the duty bearers and rights holders (particularly children and 
vulnerable groups). 
 
Evaluation Methodology 
The evaluation used a non-experimental design and mixed methods that included both 
quantitative and qualitative data. Furthermore, the evaluation adopted a Theory-based, 
participatory, and utilisation-focused approach, integrating the identified information needs 
of users as well as how they will use the findings. Evaluation methods included (i) Desk review; 
(ii) Inception phase consultations; (iii) Partner/key informant interviews (KIIs) with 
stakeholders; (iv) Beneficiary interviews; (v) Review of administrative data; and (vi) Value for 
money assessment. The evaluation relied on both primary and secondary data. Primary data 
sources included the data that was collected through key informant interviews (KIIs) with 
stakeholders from UNICEF, national and sub-national government, implementing partners 
(IPs), private sector and other UN agencies. A purposeful sampling approach was used to 
interview individuals who had knowledge of and/or experience with the CACs. A total of 149 
persons were interviewed, including 1 UNICEF staff, 10 CAC staff/partners, 14 key 
stakeholders, and 124 beneficiaries. 
 
Key Evaluation Findings 
Relevance 
o The analysis found that the objectives of the CAC integrated model of service delivery 
for child victims of sexual violence is aligned to six SDGs, namely SDG 3, 4, 5, 11, 16, 
and 17. 
o All 25 interviews with stakeholders and partners yielded positive responses that the 
CAC is aligned with national priorities. However, it was observed that at the 
community level there existed norms and practice that were inimical to child 
protection. These including older males targeting adolescent girls in particular.  
Effectiveness 
o The CACs, both at the operational and strategic levels, demonstrated that 
multidisciplinary involvement was essential in ensuring that the needs of children who 
are victims of sexual violence are identified, understood, and addressed.  
o CAC eliminated the need for multiple interviews from staff of participating agencies. 
However, in a few instances, matters directly reported to the police were not 
immediately referred to CAC.  
o In terms of the CACs ability to get professional from partner agency to collaborate in 
service delivery, the CAC scored an average of seven (7) on a scale of 0-10 where 10 is 
indicative of very effective.  A partner divulged that “on the operations level about 8; 
at the strategic level we are struggling, the MDT at the high level, heads need to sit 
once a quarter.” 
Impact 
o Children self-reports show that 95% of them felt that CACs had positively contributed 
to them making positive changes in their lives. 
o From a parental perspective, almost nine (9) out of ten parents felt the CACs had 
contributed to their children making positive changes in their lives. This overwhelming 
positive response on the part of parents add to the burden of evidence that the CACs 
have been contributing to positive changes in children lives after victimization 
o Rising demand for services coupled with constrained resources have forced CACs to 

x 
 
extend the responsibility of current staff which can result in physical and psychological 
burn out. It was noted that at minimum of three core staff (forensic interviewer, 
counsellor, and court support officer) will cost CACs US$2010 monthly. To increase 
staff more resources would be needed. 
Sustainability 
o CACs provide an essential service and once current levels of child sexual abuse 
continue there will be need for their service.  
o UNICEF and government subvention were essential to the maintenance of CACs 
quality of service and sustainability of operations. 
Efficiency 
o CACs reported several approaches demonstrating their efficiency in resource usage 
including bulk procurement, collaborative training, and use of electronic documents 
and reducing printing. 
o Cost of service per child victim and family was computed at US$325. When compared 
to the economic cost of violence this amount is small. In 2017, the global per 
inhabitant cost of violence was US$ $1,988. 
Value for Money Assessment 
o None of the expense categories appeared excessive, for instance, the modal value 
reported for telephone use was just about US$50 monthly, average stationery cost 
monthly was US$50 per month, and annual expenses on toys and other child stress 
relief equipment and supplies was US$150 per centre.  
o The estimated value in terms of productivity savings ranged from a minimum of 
US$67,368 and a maximum of US$114,863.  
Key Conclusions 
Relevance 
o Conclusion 1: The CAC model of integrated service delivery for child victims of sexual 
abuse and their families is harmony with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3, 4, 
5, 11, 16, and 17 by disrupting and preventing sexual abuse of children and providing 
broad child protection services for children who are victims of abuse in ways that are 
both gender sensitive and culturally grounded, safeguarding their rights and mental 
health, removing emotional barriers to continued education, building emotional 
stability and resilience, and promoting positive self-image, child development and 
wellbeing. 
o Conclusion 2: Child Advocacy Centres are also important because they offer parents 
with education and awareness about abuse helping them to understand abuse 
including the signs of child abuse and how to protect their children.  
Effectiveness 
o Conclusion 3: There is overwhelming evidence that suggests that there is a high level 
of satisfaction of the services received from the CAC among parents and children  
o Conclusion 4: CAC eliminated the need for multiple interviews from staff of 
participating agencies. However, in a few instances, matters directly reported to the 
police were not immediately referred to CAC. Additionally, it was reported that a few 
police officers are still questioning children. 
o Conclusion 5: A key to success has been partnership the CPA and two well established 
NGOs, ChildLink and Blossom. Blossom and ChildLink were able to establish 
partnerships with police and justice officials. Additionally, other factors crucial to the 
effectiveness and achievements of CACs success were their interdisciplinary  

xi 
 
Impact 
o Conclusion 6: The CAC integrated model of service delivery is demonstrating positive 
outcomes for both children and parents. 
Sustainability 
o Conclusion 7: Current levels of sexual violence against children along with the 
importance of CAC in providing a comprehensive response covering recovery and 
access to justice make a strong case for sustaining CACs. Further, UNICEF and 
Government funding of the CAC are the predictable sources of revenue for CAC and 
are important to their sustainability. 
o Conclusion 8: Judging from the cost per service in the context of the duration and 
quantity and quality of engagements with child victims of sexual abuse, one can only 
conclude that resources are used efficiently by CACs. 
Efficiency 
o Conclusion 9: The recurring costs associated with the operations of the CACs 
demonstrate efficiency in procuring materials for operations. It also confirms that 
resources are not wasted. 
o Value for Money  
o Conclusion 10: Without costing the psycho-social, parental capacity development, 
promotion of pro-social behaviour and personal development, and prevention of child 
sexual abuse, the analysis show significant return on investment. 
o  
Lessons Learned 
o Lesson 1: An important lesson learned was that CACs make significant contribution to 
children and families, including helping them to access justice, psychologically recover 
from the trauma of experiencing sexual abuse, provide training for parents to better 
interact with their children. It was noted that children and parents/caregivers who 
access CACs would have experienced traumatic events that have caused them to 
suffer physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual harm, and even post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) in some cases. Failure to process and overcome trauma can 
have long-term negative impacts on children and parents/caregivers; thus, CACs work 
with children and families have helped to improve their well-being and minimize the 
risk of such long-term negative impacts. 
o Lesson 2: It was observed that Working with boys was more challenging for CACs 
because boys were reluctant and tentative in discussing abuse. These initial hurdles 
have been overcome through patient confidence building approaches. An important 
lesson here is that there is need for continued efforts in mainstreaming gender in the 
training of forensic interviewers. 
o Lesson 3: Another lesson learned was that success of the CAC model of service in 
contingent on commitment and leadership on the part of NGO, the CPA and other 
government partners. Important too is willingness of UNICEF to support the services 
of the CACs. Programmes such as these take time to demonstrate results and in 
eliminating the bottlenecks in service delivery. Persistence and patience are required 
from UNICEF and the implementing agencies work to improve programme standards. 
o Lesson 4: A key lesson learned was that a fully functioning CAC demands consistent 
and ongoing training and support on treatment interventions, including the use of 
trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy, the laws on sexual violence in the 
country and on-the-job support to navigate the social, police, prosecutorial systems.
