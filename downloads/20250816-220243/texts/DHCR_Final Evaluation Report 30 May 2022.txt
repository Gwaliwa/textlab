GLOSSARY 
Key Terms of Evaluation 
Before-after 
Involves measuring the dependent variable both before and after the participants have been exposed to the 
independent variable.1 
Child Protection 
UNICEF uses the term ‘child protection’ to refer to preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and abuse 
against children—including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful traditional 
practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage.2 
Contribution 
analysis 
Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed 
results.3 
Early Childhood 
Development 
ECD is defined as the period from conception up to school entry. It is a unique window of opportunity for children’s 
cognitive, social, emotional and physical development, which occurs as the result of the interaction between the 
environment and the child.4  
Endline  
Quantitative (descriptive statistics) and qualitative (inferential statistics) information about the situation or condition 
after the intervention/programme / project is completed. It must ideally be done using the same set of tools and 
with the same group of beneficiaries. 
Global Evaluation 
Reports Oversight 
System (GEROS) 
The GEROS system consists of systematic and independent quality assessment of evaluation reports that have 
been uploaded to the corporate Evidence Information Systems Integration database (EISI) by UNICEF Country 
Offices, Regional Offices, HQ divisions and Evaluation Office. The purpose of the Global Evaluation Reports 
Oversight System (GEROS) is to support and strengthen the evaluation function to meet and exceed United 
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards, UN System Wide Action Plan on gender equality (UN-SWAP) and 
other UNICEF commitments (including equity and human-rights based approaches).5 
Human Rights 
based Approach 
A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is 
normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and 
protecting human rights.6 
Mixed Method 
A procedure for collecting, analysing, and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a 
single study to understand a research problem.7 
OECD DAC 
Criteria 
The OECD DAC Network on Development Evaluation (EvalNet) has defined six evaluation criteria—relevance, 
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability—and two principles for their use. These criteria are 
intended to guide evaluations.8 
Participatory 
Evaluation 
Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation 
process. This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data 
collection and analysis, and the reporting of the study.9 
Stunting 
Stunting refers to low height of a child compared to age. It is an indicator of chronic undernutrition and is caused 
by inadequate intake of nutritious food, frequent illnesses such as diarrhoea and intestinal worms, poor care 
practices, and lack of access to health and other essential services, especially in the first 1,000 days of a child’s 
life but with potential effects lasting a lifetime.10 
Summative 
Evaluations 
Summative evaluations are usually conducted at the end of an intervention and should produce objectively 
verifiable information on project / programme effectiveness. Such an evaluation involves the use of quantitative 
methods and looks at the realisation of committed outcomes or the likelihood of those materialising. Any 
unintended consequences of the intervention and lessons learnt are identified and highlighted.11 
WASH 
WASH is the collective term for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. Due to their interdependent nature, these three 
core issues are grouped together to represent a growing sector. While each is a separate field of work, they are 
dependent on the presence of the others. For example, without toilets, water sources become contaminated; 
without clean water, basic hygiene practices are not possible.12 All three areas in WASH support and strengthen 
one another. If one is missing, the others cannot progress.

Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) 
i
Executive Summary 
This is the final evaluation report of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda programme 
(henceforth referred to as DHCR or the Programme), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF), Rwanda Country Office (RCO). The DHCR Programme aimed to: increase human capital 
development in 14 districts of Rwanda by establishing optimal conditions for children (aged 0-6 years) 
to achieve their full potential and build a strong foundation to develop into adolescents with key problem-
solving and socio-emotional competencies. The Programme’s implementation was led by the 
Government of Rwanda (GoR) represented by: Ministry of Health (MINISANTE); Ministry of Gender 
and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF); Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC); and Ministry of 
Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). AAN Associates, (a Pakistan-based research and 
evaluation consulting firm) implemented the evaluation between September 2021 and May 2022.  
Intervention Context: Rwanda is a country with a population of 12.9 million people (2020). Rwanda 
has made important economic and structural reforms and recorded strong economic growth over the 
past two decades. The impact of COVID-19 (with subsequent lockdown and social distancing 
measures) sharply curtailed economic activities in 2020, causing the country’s gross domestic product 
(GDP) to drop by 0.2 percent in 2020 compared to a projected expansion of 8 percent before the 
COVID-19 outbreak.13 The country has a high stunting rate of 33 percent according to Demographic 
Health Survey (DHS 2019-2020), which is higher than the average for the Africa region (30.7 percent).14 
The bottlenecks that prevent children from reaching their full developmental potential include 
inadequate dietary intake (as only one in six children enjoys all recommended feeding practices); 
repeated infection; inadequate psychosocial stimulation (parents engaged in activities that stimulate a 
child’s development and early learning); and lack of opportunities for optimal child development.15  
Object of Evaluation: UNICEF RCO has supported the GoR to model and scale up integrated 
approaches to delivery of programmes addressing the needs and rights of young children in Rwanda. 
DHCR is driven by the intent to identify and address the cross-sectoral issues that affect children’s 
holistic development in Rwanda. The design features a multi-sectoral and integrated approach, to 
address both immediate and underlying causes affecting the attainment of optimal child growth and 
development. The focus is on systems strengthening through multiple strategies i.e., capacity-building; 
behaviour-change communication; and coordination for integrated services at central, decentralized 
and community levels. Programme implementation followed a hybrid approach featuring collaboration 
between multiple stakeholders including public agencies, private sector, and civil society organizations 
(CSOs). DHCR was implemented between 2017 and 2022 (initially planned until 2020) in 14 districts. 
The total budget was US$27 million funded by the Embassy of Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN). 
Purpose and Scope of Evaluation: This is a Summative Evaluation, with an expressed purpose to 
better understand how and under what conditions the interventions and activities were implemented 
under DHCR; and to assess the extent to which the initiative has met its objectives and achieved the 
desired results. The results from this evaluation will inform decisions by the GoR to scale up and 
continue implementation of similar approaches, including adjustments needed. The evaluation scope 
includes all EKN-funded Programme activities implemented from 2017 to 2021 in 14 targeted districts, 
i.e., Nyamagabe, Ngororero, Rutsiro, Gakenke, Burera, Rubavu, Nyaruguru, Karongi, Gicumbi, 
Nyamasheke, Gatsibo, Rusizi, Nyagatare and Musanze. 
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The overarching design include Mixed Methods16 
and Participatory17 approaches. Keeping in view the intervention design and evaluation expectations, 
the evaluation team applied a Hybrid Evaluation Design, featuring Contribution Analysis18 and 
Comparative Analysis19 (with ‘Before-After’20 sub-design). The evaluation had to drop the quasi-
experimental design (or data collection from control districts) for contamination risks due to similar 
interventions (by other actors) in control districts. Evaluation methodology included a household (HH) 
survey (sample size of 1,352 households with a mother or female caregiver as respondent)

16 Mixed Methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analysing, and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods in a single 
study to understand a research problem. 
17 Participatory evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur 
at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting of the study. 
18 Contribution analysis explores attribution by assessing the contribution a programme makes to observed results. 
(https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/participatory_evaluation). 
19 Comparative analysis is the process of comparing items to one another and distinguishing their similarities and differences. 
20 Before-after design involves measuring the dependent variable before and after the participants have been exposed to the independent variables (taken 
from FAO Marketing Research and Information Systems – Chapter 6). 

 
 
 
Endline Evaluation of the Developing Human Capital in Rwanda Programme (DHCR) 
ii
implemented in seven districts (Nyaruguru, Karongi, Rutsiro, Ngororero, Burera, Gicumbi and Gatsibo). 
The endline survey followed the same methodology and design as the programme baseline (carried out 
in 2019) for comparison purposes. Qualitative data was gathered through 30 focus group discussions 
(FGDs) (including 139 male and 154 female participants) with mothers, fathers, community health 
workers, farmers and community influencers. The evaluation team conducted 39 key informant 
interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders including UNICEF RCO, relevant public ministries, implementing 
partners (IPs) and donors. Desk review of 77 internal and external documents was undertaken to inform 
and corroborate the primary data. Evaluation design methods and implementation placed a considered 
focus on the integration of human rights-based programming, gender equality and equity by developing 
separate evaluation questions, tools, analysis and findings section for three cross-cutting programming 
priorities (treated as non-DAC criteria). Limitations of the evaluation include: data constraints that 
prevented comprehensive efficiency and effectiveness analysis (missing information on targets and 
programme progress from April – December 2021); majority of HHs that participated in the baseline 
study were ineligible to participate in the endline study which were replaced with other households 
within the same communities; and safety risks posed by COVID-19 leading to hybrid data collection 
modality (remote and in-person).  
Evaluation Findings & Conclusions: Key findings against DAC and non-DAC criteria are given below: 
Relevance: The findings indicate alignment between DHCR outcomes and strategies with those of 
national and development partners policies and plans (for the nutrition and early childhood development 
(ECD) sectors), which validates the Programme’s relevance. Ample evidence is available to suggest 
an inclusive process featuring extensive consultations, joint reviews, validation meetings and bilateral 
meetings with key stakeholders was followed to involve them in design. There is evidence of changes 
in the context and beneficiary needs due to several factors (including government restructuring, 
changes in policy mandates and COVID-19), but limited evidence is available to show if or how the 
Programme made design level adjustments in terms of changes in the results framework and budget.  
Relevance is evident as the Programme used both primary and secondary data (including the 2019 
baseline, capacity gap analysis, ethnographic study) to deepen understanding of needs, barriers, 
drivers, and local dynamics, and used this data to inform the programme design. The selection of 
programme districts is driven by a multi-factor vulnerability assessment, which adds further to DHCR’s 
relevance in terms of targeting the most impoverished and under-developed districts and communities. 
Programme design (strategies/interventions) are appropriate for addressing both the demand and 
supply-side barriers to malnourishment and development delays such as: capacity-building (of both 
duty-bearers and rights-holders); dialogue and advocacy (for uptake of promoted behaviour and 
practices); public-private partnership (for linkages with businesses and ECD centres); and evidence 
generation (for effective decision-making). 
Coherence: The findings indicate that during programme design, UNICEF RCO managed to leverage 
internal coherence by engaging multiple UNICEF’s sections. This enabled designing an intervention 
that aimed to address the causative elements behind stunting in children under 5 (U5) and holistic child 
development. The evaluation did not find significant evidence around how internal integration 
(resources and strengths across sections) was leveraged through implementation, and merits better 
documentation.  
The Programme took a systematic approach to map and leverage external complementarities across 
stakeholders. This was achieved through multiple processes e.g., i) conducting studies to map 
stakeholders and interventions to have holistic view of actors and interventions; ii) collaborative 
consultations during the proposal stage to ensure there is no duplication of efforts; iii) partnering with 
relevant government and private entities to design and implement DHCR interventions; iv) use of 
existing platforms (the National Child Development Agency (NCDA), Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) 
network, national ECD sub-cluster, child development technical working group) to coordinate, 
collaborate, plan and reflect with other development partners and relevant government agencies to 
implement DHCR activities, whilst avoiding duplication and overlap. This contributed to engaging with 
and utilising sector/cross sectoral forums.  
Effectiveness: The effectiveness measurement remains incomplete, hence inconclusive for the fact 
that out of seven outcomes, only three could be rated for relative effectiveness (for having sufficient 
information to rate outcomes on the scale). For four outcomes i.e., 1 (nutrition), 3 (water, sanitation and 
hygiene (WASH)), 6 (integrated multisectoral interventions), and 7 (private sector linkages), either data 
or targets are unavailable to compare performance data. Out of the remaining three outcomes, two 
outcomes on social protection (outcome 4) and education (outcome 5) are assessed as ‘Fully Achieved’

and one outcome (i.e., ECD – outcome 2) is rated as ‘Mostly Achieved’.21 From the achievement data 
on programme components i.e., nutrition, health, ECD, WASH, and social protection, where the 
evaluation team has compared the baseline (2019) with endline data (2022) for 46 indicators (across 
seven districts), the evaluation concludes that the Programme was ‘Partially Effective’. Out of 46 
indicators, the evaluation found incremental change in 28 indicators (61 percent) covering mostly the 
WASH and health components. There are 18 indicators (39 percent of total) where the evaluation noted 
declining trends. The plausible explanation is COVID-19 and its impact on incomes, poverty and 
restricted mobility, however, merits further exploration. The key enablers for the Programme are: 
alignment with GoR priorities resulting in ownership and commitment of public sector partners; use of 
community-based models (community-driven) resulting in community engagement and ownership; 
adaptive measures taken during COVID-19. The disabling factors that hindered achievements include 
institutional changes (NECDP becoming NCDA); frequent public sector staff turnover (in districts); and 
COVID-19 disruptions and restrictions.  
The Programme is largely a success in strengthening public sector nutrition and ECD systems, and 
packaging as integrated services. As part of system strengthening efforts, DHCR appears to be 
relatively more successful (or effective) with respect to two elements (out of five) of Enabling 
Environment22 i.e., policy and strategy (supported GoR to develop multiple policies and strategies) and 
monitoring and evaluation (supported GoR to conduct national surveys and improve nutritional 
governance). The Programme remained partially successful for others i.e., capacity-building 
(undermined by high staff turnover reported at the district level); financing and budgeting (for limited 
focus and visible results around this component) and institutional arrangements and coordination 
(stakeholders reported gaps in district level coordination). 
The community capacity development is assessed with respect to community mobilization and linkages 
development; skills and knowledge development; materials assistance; and monitoring and social 
accountability. The Programme successes are evident in organizing communities (for collective 
actions); wider community participation and engagement; leveraging influence of local influencers, i.e., 
religious leaders, theatres, faith-based organizations; and provision of skills and supplies. All these 
factors contributed to cultivating ownership and mobilizing community for collective benefit.  
Efficiency: The evaluation team is unable to draw conclusions on the Programme’s efficiency due to 
unavailability of performance data from March to December 2021. The Programme reached to 8.5 
million beneficiaries against a target of 0.5 million (the number hints to double counting of beneficiaries 
reached out by different interventions). In addition, the number was reached while using only 79 percent 
of allocated funds. As a result, it seems that the Programme set lower targets in comparison to the 
resources available. Given the Programme’s focus on nutrition and ECD, the allocation of over 55 
percent of resources to these two components justifies the allocation of resources. The average per 
beneficiary cost comes at $2.05 for the Programme which is lesser than the planned cost/beneficiary 
($2.65). The cost comparison between EKN 123 ($2.15) and EKN II ($2.05) underlines EKN II was as 
cost efficient as EKN I (in terms of cost/beneficiary). 
Impact: The Programme has two impact indicators (reduction in stunting and improvement in child 
holistic development). The national stunting numbers indicate reduction from 38 percent to 33 percent 
(from 2015-2020) which equals the Programme’s intended target of achieving 5 percent reduction in 
stunting nationally. This measurement is for national level whereas the Programme was implemented 
in 14 of the 30 districts and it may have contributed to the observed change. For Programme districts 
however, the numbers show a reduction of 1.6 percent (in 7 out of 14 Programme districts – for 6-23 
months children) between 2019-2022. The lower results for Programme districts (in comparison to 
national numbers) beg further enquiry. For holistic development, the national numbers have increased 
from 63 percent (DHS 2014-2015, among children 36-59 months) to 76 percent (DHS 2019-2020, 
among 24-59 months). However, comparison between these two values is not possible due to variation 
in age groups between the two surveys. For programme districts, the comparison remains incomplete 
(for all indicators that make up the holistic development) between the baseline (2019) and endline 
(2022), however for most of these indicators there is an upward trend in uptake of early stimulation 
activities. The unintended impact is evident in terms of improvement in fathers’ involvement in child 
development activities including shift in behaviour to save money rather than using money for personal 
expenses. 
 
21 The evaluation team applied a rating scale where ‘Mostly Achieved’ means 61-90% of intended targets achieved whereas ‘Fully Achieved’ means 91-100% 
of intended targets achieved.

23 The DHCR Programme (known as EKN II) is a second phase of an earlier project funded by the EKN Kigali, known as the ‘EKN Phase I. Phase 1 was 
implemented from 2014-2017 in 10 districts and focused on nutrition-specific interventions.
