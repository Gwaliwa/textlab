 Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste  
Executive Summary 
 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.2 states that by 2030, all children 
should have access to quality preschool education to ensure they are ready for primary 
education.1 Preschool education improves long-term educational and life outcomes in 
developing countries especially; school readiness programmes have the potential to provide 
additional support to students who are otherwise socio-economically disadvantaged.2,3 
Whilst access to education has substantially improved in recent years, Timor-Leste’s 
preschool education sector is not prepared to achieve this SGD, or its own targets.  
To help inform future planning for its preschool subsector, the Ministry of Education, Youth 
and Sport (MoEYS) commissioned this independent evaluation of Timor-Leste’s preschool 
education subsector. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Timor-Leste engaged the 
American Institutes for Research (AIR) to conduct the evaluation, with support from the 
Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosa’e (UNTL) as an in-country partner for this work.  
The evaluation focused on Timor-Leste’s preschool education subsector and covered years 
2012–2020 to align with the launch of the Policy Framework for Preschool Education. It 
fulfilled the three main objectives: (1) Develop a theory of change to capture the pathways 
towards increasing equitable access to quality preschool education in Timor-Leste; 
(2) Assess the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the 
preschool education policy and programmes in Timor-Leste; and (3) Identify lessons learned 
and make recommendations useable by the government and its key partners to inform 
decision-making on policy and programme design and implementation of the preschool 
subsector.  
Methodology 
This thematic evaluation consisted of a single round of data collection, with a desk review of 
relevant documentation and education management information system (EMIS) data, plus 
36 key informant interviews with government stakeholders at the national and municipal 
levels, international organisations such as UNICEF and the World Bank, teacher training 
institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and preschool programme providers. 
Team members from UNTL also conducted a focus group discussion with Timor-Leste’s Early 
Childhood Development (ECD) Working Group.

 Final Report: Country-Led Evaluation of Preschool Education in Timor-Leste  
Key Findings 
In this section, we 
present key findings 
related to each of the 
evaluation questions.  
Presence of 
comprehensive and 
evidence-based policies 
and plans for the 
delivery of high-quality 
preschool education. 
Taken together, Timor-
Leste’s preschool 
policies and plans address the key areas required for high-quality preschool education 
systems. However, plans are fragmented across documents and are mostly at a high level. 
There are substantial gaps in the availability of relevant data, making it very challenging for 
Timor-Leste stakeholders to engage in evidence-based planning. 
Extent to which actors in Timor-Leste’s preschool education sector collaborate and 
coordinate with one another and with actors in other sectors to meet children’s holistic 
needs. There are a variety of actors in the preschool subsector, but there is no coherent 
national plan that integrates Timor-Leste’s efforts into a larger framework. The main 
collaboration mechanism for preschool education at the national level was the ECD Working 
Group (which was established to review multisectoral ECD policy more broadly, including 
preschool education). However, the group’s work stalled due to staff turnover and the 
pandemic. At the municipal level, there are no systematic mechanisms of coordination in 
place amongst municipal education authorities, partners and the MoEYS. 
Presence of adequate governance and accountability structures and strategies. Timor-
Leste has clear lines of authority and explicitly defined roles and responsibilities for the 
subsector. National-level stakeholders indicated a need for more effective collaboration on 
financing and implementation amongst government actors and between the government 
and other organisations. Municipalities have primary responsibility for preschool financing 
and implementation, and they would like improved guidance on preschool standards.  
Budgeting and financing for the provision of cost-effective preschool education. As a 
portion of gross domestic product (GDP), the budget allocated to preschool is less than one 
tenth the recommended level (of 1 per cent of GDP). Within the education sector budget, 
the subsector receives one third or less of the recommended proportion. Timor-Leste 
appears to start with a budget allocation for preschool in the education sector plan, then 
determines how to use it best, rather than basing the budget on a comprehensive and long-
