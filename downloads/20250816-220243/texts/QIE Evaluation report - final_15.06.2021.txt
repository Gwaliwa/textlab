Executive summary  
 
The Quality Inclusive Education Initiative (QIE) aimed to be the foundation of a “friendly and inclusive 
school” for all pupils and teachers and to positively change the image of school as an institution. The 
intervention was meant to respond to the needs for capacity and professional development of headmasters and 
teachers and brought to the fore the importance of early childhood education. The results and lessons 
generated by the model were meant to inform the elaboration of new laws, standards and regulations 
applicable nationwide1. 
QIE includes child-centred interventions at school, family and community levels. The education package is 
universal, as all schoolchildren and schools may benefit from its interventions and of its results in terms of 
quality education.  The package is also modular, which means that it may be customized to the specific needs 
of a school/community, and thus it could be applied in all types of schools. QIE focuses in several of its 
components on children who are the most at-risk of dropout2.  
QIE was developed in partnership by the Romanian Ministry of National Education and UNICEF Romania, and 
implemented during September 2015 and June 2019 (4 school years), in Bacău County, in 51 schools from 44 
communities in 37 urban and rural localities.  
QIE was implemented in wide partnership with the Institute for Educational Sciences (IES)3, The Romanian 
Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education (ARACIP), Step by Step, Holtis, Împreună Agency, as 
well as with the support of the Ministry of Education, Bacău County School Inspectorate (CSI), Bacău County 
Centre for Educational Support and Resources (CCREA) and Bacău County Council.  
 
The summative evaluation of the Quality Inclusive Education package of the “Social inclusion through the 
provision of integrated social services at community level” modelling project in Romania, aimed „to assess 
whether the underlying assumptions and objectives formulated in the Theory of Change for QIE [Quality 
Inclusive Education] were validated and achieved as well as to ascertain whether QIE contributes to promoting 
the child rights to quality inclusive education”.  
The evaluation aims to be a key element in the process of promoting the scale-up of the QIE at national level. 
The evidence generated by the evaluation will be used for advocacy and policy advice with authorities and 
stakeholders at local, county and national levels including to the Ministry of Education, as regards in developing 
and amending educational policies related to prevention of dropout, absenteeism and early school leaving.  
Therefore, the evaluation observed the following objectives: 
• 
Evaluate relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the QIE component; 
• 
Identify and document the key elements that contributed to the QIE success and replicability, as well 
as main bottlenecks and barriers in implementation; 
• 
Document key lessons learned in relation to the QIE implementation and propose recommendations 
for improvement; 
• 
Make recommendations for further actions related to sustainability, scalability of the QIE as a whole 
or components of QIE throughout the country. 
• 
Identify the way in which the QIE component is relevant and produced results in addressing issues 
related to gender equality, equity and overall advancement of child rights

The evaluation covered all QIE components and activities implemented in the framework of the model during 
its lifetime (September 2015 – June 2019) and all 51 schools benefiting under QIE, located in 44 urban and 
rural communities in Bacău County. 
The summative evaluation used a mixed methods design, by combining qualitative and quantitative data 
collection and data analysis techniques. Triangulation was used in order to validate findings, including the 
triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data collected. Quantitative analyses of secondary data preceded 
in most cases qualitative field data collection, to allow explanation of possible different results through data 
collected during interviews, focus groups etc. 
Quantitative data collection and data analysis techniques used by the evaluation are counterfactual impact 
analysis, surveys and exploratory data analysis (descriptive statistics, visual representations).  
The counterfactual assessment was carried based on administrative data made available by Ministry of 
Education for the 51 QIE schools in Bacău and 6 schools in the control group in Galați County. Data recorded 
by UNICEF and implementation partners concerning activity implementation and outputs (i.e., participants in 
training, parental counselling and parental education), as well as a number of key variables among data 
collected by the Institute for Educational Sciences (IES) on children at risk and vulnerable children enrolled in 
the targeted schools were analysed using descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, correlations). Five 
surveys were conducted among headmasters, teachers, kindergarten teachers, schoolchildren in the 51 schools 
where QIE was implemented, as well as the parents of the latter.   
Qualitative data collection and data analysis techniques used by the evaluation include desk research, 
interviews, focus groups and case study.  
Extensive desk research was carried out, involving the summary, collation, analysis and/or synthesis of existing 
documents. At national level interviews were carried out with UNICEF, project partners, Ministry of Education 
and Research, World Bank and representative NGOs. At country level 2 interviews with CSI and CJRAE were 
conducted, as well as 1 focus group with county coordinators.  
Case study was a key methodological instrument applied in the framework of this evaluation, as part of the 
mixed-method approach. Based on the quantitative data at disposal, collected from school annual reports, and 
on qualitative data (good and less good examples mentioned in the 2015 in-depth assessment and project 
documents), the following schools were selected to be a part of the multiple case study: 
1. Şcoala Gimnazială Zemes (high number of roma children, and very high number of absences, but no 
children reported to dropout)  
2. Şcoala Gimnazială Horgeşti (high number of absences, high number of children dropping out of school, 
but considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations) 
3. Şcoala Gimnazială Frumoasa, Balcani (low number of absences, no children reported to dropout, 
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations) 
4. Şcoala Gimnazială Colonești (high number of absences, no children reported to dropout, considered a 
less good practice by some QIE partner organisations)  
5. Şcoala Gimnazială Nr. 2 Targu Ocna (high number of absences, but no children reported to dropout, 
considered a good practice by some QIE partner organisations) 
6. Şcoala Gimnazială "Dr. Alexandru Safran" (moderate number of absences, no children reported to 
dropout, considered a less good practice by some QIE partner organisations) 
The evaluation was undertaken during the crisis triggered by COVID pandemic, however, the methodology 
planned could be applied to a very large extent. Most instruments were deployed on-line (and in this respect 
on-line schooling helped evaluation as the stakeholders involved already had a degree of understanding and 
were used to working with virtual communication platforms). Where baselines were not available, 
administrative data was used or questions in the survey were formulated in such a manner that progress is 
indicated (in 2020 compared to 2015). For example, changes of attitude, values and awareness, at the level of 
teachers, children (including adolescents) and parents were very difficult to measure, as there is no baseline 
on these dimensions. The risk of bias was, though, limited, as multiple triangulation was ensured during 
secondary analysis and findings of the evaluations are based multiple data sources: documents, quantitative 
data analysis and survey results.

Based on evidence collected and analyses carried out, the evaluation concludes that the Quality Inclusive 
Education package was highly relevant. The project addressed all children and adolescents, including children 
in vulnerable categories, in both urban and rural areas, and this was the adequate strategy to answer the 
problems identified and ensure project effectiveness (i.e., to tackle more than barrier to participation to school 
but take a step forward and offer quality education).  
A strong feature of QIE from a relevance perspective, but also impact, is its “integrated” approach, i.e., QIE 
created a broad context focused on learning interactions and collaboration between traditionally separate 
groups - pupils, teachers, parents, institutions such as ARACIP - and it redefined the relationships among these 
actors, particularly at local level, for the benefit of the child.  
The implemented activities have a high degree of relevance as they addressed directly causes of school dropout 
such as family educational difficulties, limited interest in learning, limited involvement in class/school, limited 
material base, limited communication between parents and school or insufficient help from teachers, and their 
associated needs. Based on evidence collected, QIE objectives, activities and results are also highly relevant in 
relation to the European and national strategic and legislative framework. QIE is fully aligned to all national 
strategies, as it proposed a model to implement existing legal provisions as regards integrated interventions. 
The evaluation has identified a degree of flexibility maintained throughout the implementation process. In this 
vein, although not without challenges, activities were adjusted in order for the project to adequately respond 
to further needs identified on the spot. However, the evaluation identified a (rather limited) number of 
additional activities that would have further enhanced the relevance and effectiveness of the model and could 
be taken into consideration when QIE is scale-up.   
The child rights approach was embedded already in the project Theory of Change, as QIE addresses bottlenecks 
and barriers in access to and retention in education for children and adolescents at risk, in order to  ensure that 
the right to education of every child is observed without discrimination. A differentiated approach for girls and 
boys was applied only when deemed appropriate, otherwise equal and non-discriminatory participation in all 
activities was ensured. The gender dimension was addressed in training sessions, monitoring visits and 
exchanges of experience, however, specific activities addressing different needs of boys and girls were not 
planned / developed.  
In general, the evaluation found that QIE triggers changes in terms of increased participation but also improved 
atmosphere, i.e., better communication and collaboration, in school. However, maintaining the effects 
registered and, thus, continuing reform at school level, greatly depends on the intensity of the intervention (e.g., 
if all or a majority of teachers are instructed), on its continuous implementation (as opposed to an on-off, 
project-based activity) but also on external factors, particular to the educational system in Romania and to the 
wider socio-economic context. Rural – urban dimension of school and path dependency, i.e., an open mentality 
and management capacity already in place at school level, also influence effects and impact obtained.    
In the schools participating in the project QIE had an important contribution, in terms of redefining and 
strengthening:  
• 
the relation between school-local authorities (the local authorities better understood their role in 
supporting the educational act by ensuring cooperation between school and the social 
assistants/teams/policies but also to endow and renovate school buildings, in some cases);    
• 
 the teacher-parent relationship (parents understood that school can also have another approach to 
schoolchildren’ problems, that it is oriented towards the support of schoolchildren, especially those at 
risk); 
• 
parents’ relationship with the school and teachers (e.g., parents understood that school is not only 
resource consuming, but also a service provider and that their role is not only material, but also 
emotional and supportive in the education process); 
• 
the concept of pupils at risk and transforming this category into a more visible one and, moreover, 
transforming the children who were considered ‘predestined to a fate of non-fulfilment’ into pupils 
who can be supported by joint school-family efforts; 
• 
the “inclusive school” concept in the perspective of school headmasters and of the other stakeholders.  

9 
 
In terms of impact, the evaluation highlight positive effects of QIE in terms of school participation, namely as 
regards number of schoolchildren enrolled, number of schoolchildren enrolled at the end of the year, number 
of schoolchildren completing their graduation requirements by the end of the year and schoolchildren 
repeating grades”. Overall, due to increased attention paid to vulnerable children by the school management 
and teachers, in closer partnership with parents, some results were confirmed for this target group.  
However, QIE’s impact in terms of absenteeism and drop out is rather indirect and restricted by several 
external factors contributing in this regard. Family material and social circumstances (i.e., conflicts, alcoholism, 
involvement of children in household chores etc.) remain the key reasons for absentees and dropping out and 
this confirms the need for wider social and economic measures with effects locally as well as closer 
collaboration and better social services at community level. School drop-out is more widespread in the last 
years of lower secondary school, when children move towards high school/vocational schools and among girls 
of Roma ethnicity. 
Overall, positive changes at school management level have been identified as a result of school headmasters 
and their teams’ participation in activities organised by QIE. School management is more involved and directly 
encourages teamwork and communication among teachers, but also between teachers, children, parents and 
other school specialists. Headmasters understand better their role and facilitate access to resources, including 
for infrastructure works, and, in this sense, they are more oriented towards development and more focused on 
accessing available grants. On the other side, there is room for improvement as regards school management 
and drafting school planning documents, for the latter in terms of collecting evidence to support Plan’s 
development and implementation and formulating realistic implementation plans including additional, 
customised support for vulnerable groups.  
Changes induced by the model at school management level, while positive in many schools, are stronger in 
schools already having an open organization culture and/or a champion determined to develop the school. On 
the other side, the evidence collected also indicated that QIE’s impact at management level may be very limited 
where school headmasters are not interested and open to a new vision / modern approaches. The same is valid 
in cases where headmasters are replaced and organisational culture may be weak from a strategic planning 
perspective.  
QIE had an important positive effect in terms of improved relationship with the community in general, 
including parents and local authorities. As regards the latter, cooperation was strengthened with social 
assistants identifying and working with vulnerable families. QIE also made many participating schools more 
child-friendly, by offering a more welcoming environment and a more friendly looking learning space 
decorated also during non-formal activities organised under mini-grants.” However, significant room for 
improvement exists in this regard, too, if we take into account the fact that less than 20% of children consulted 
in the framework of this evaluation declared that feel safer when they study/ go to school compared to some 
years before, and this perception is only mildly influenced by recent developments caused by COVID 19.  
At the same time, although stakeholders consulted in the framework of the evaluation positively assessed the 
training activities implemented, continuous intervention is needed for schools to reach expected standards as 
regards providing good quality teaching and learning processes with individualized instruction appropriate to 
each child’s developmental level; using active, cooperative, innovative and democratic learning methods and 
structured content and select good quality materials and resources. Still, the evaluation identified a series of 
impacts at teachers’ level i.e., teachers collaborate more with schoolchildren and parents, promote a healthy 
climate in school, and continue to use in class, although to a more moderate extent, materials promoting 
diversity.  
Changes in case of early education teachers are similar as those available for school teachers. At this level, the 
difference was made, as in the case of schools, by the 360° approach taken (i.e., a combination of educational 
resources/materials, training for all or a majority of teachers, exchanging experiences with other teachers and 
activities focused on enhancing collaboration with parents, including parental education). Materials and 
equipment purchased for kindergartens and schools as well as extracurricular activities (the latter two in the 
framework of the microgrants) had an important contribution to effects identified by this evaluation. 
 

10 
At the same time, ample parental education activities implemented under QIE as well as other activities 
involving parents (i.e., parents counselling, extracurricular activities) had positive impacts in terms of parents’ 
involvement and connectedness with the school; an improved relationship with children as a result of 
improved communication and quality time spent together. However, while already involved parents and 
parents of schoolchildren performing well in school, as well as young parents embraced and benefited of 
activities implemented, parents of vulnerable children were more difficult to involve.  
The evaluation observed that tolerant and non-discriminatory attitudes develop more gradually. From a 
conceptual perspective, evidence collected reflect a good, broader understanding of the concepts of inclusive 
education. School headmasters, teachers, and parents are significantly more aware of every child’s uniqueness 
and particular needs, however, at a more subtle level, interviews and focus groups with these stakeholders 
capture attitudes of segregation or denial of vulnerabilities in communities, especially on ethnic or socio-
economic criteria. Acceptance of children with disabilities seems to have increased slightly more compared to 
other vulnerable categories.  
Overall, UNICEF has been a long standing and reputed partner for the Ministry of Education (MoE) in Romania. 
Support delivered by UNICEF in the form of technical assistance for drafting legislative acts, methodologies, 
strategies and different studies to fundament policy alternatives has been in all case perceived as highly 
relevant, of high quality and useful. Unfortunately, instability at political level hampered the adoption of some 
inputs provided by UNICEF (i.e., related to early education, parental education, the methodology for standard 
cost per ante-pre-schoolchild). In the absence of a National Parenting Strategy adopted by the government, this 
highly relevant policy instrument cannot be applied country-wide and thus its positive effects, supported by 
findings of this evaluation, manifest only where parental education is carried out trough singular projects.               
As regards “efficiency”, the evaluation observed that QIE used its budget in an economical way, with smaller 
unit cost compared to other intervention in the field of education and aiming at increasing access and 
participation to school as well as developing teachers’ capacity to implement effective teaching and learning 
methods. The County School Inspectorate Bacău and nine schools participating in QIE raised approximately 
RON 865,000 (EUR 158,800) from Erasmus+ and other European and national programme, therefore 
surpassing the investment in technical assistance in the first year after QIE ended its implementation. In 
conclusion, technical assistance for schools is a needed and worth investment, given that the investment in 
technical assistance for schools has been recovered by schools that have been successful in fundraising 
activities.  
In longer run, the evaluation found that stakeholders generally have an adequate understanding of the need to 
continue all activities proposed by QIE. There is sufficient determination and experience to continue and 
improve existing practices regarding (i) the diversification of the offer of school and extracurricular activities 
that motivate and involve all schoolchildren, (ii) the use of teaching strategies adapted to the needs of 
schoolchildren from vulnerable groups and (iii) in the area of strategic management, with an emphasis on 
reducing dropout and increasing school participation.  
However, the capacity of schools is insufficient for further development and facilitation of involvement of 
parents/ community in school activities, parenting education and parenting counselling activities, counselling 
and mediation support services for children from vulnerable groups, project writing activities / funding 
applications. Further resources and interventions are needed for continuing the activities initiated by QIE, for 
maintaining and further strengthening the results obtained and for achieving a long-term, solid impact on 
schoolchildren.     
QIE can be rolled out and scaled up entirely or partially, starting with the most disadvantaged schools and / or 
counties. Initiatives including almost all QIE components show that replication is possible at local and national 
level. Some QIE components (as separate initiatives) are already rolled out under the coordination of the 
Ministry of Education, UNICEF, its implementing partners or other non-governmental organisations. European, 
Norwegian and EEA funds, as well as limited national funds are available or will be available (in the 
programming period 2021-2027 for EU funds) for this replication. In this context, it is important to note that 
scaling up the model (as it stands) at national level requires less than 2% of the budget of the Ministry of 
Education in the first year of implementation and less than 1% every year afterwards according to the costing 
model developed by UNICEF, which makes QIE roll-out highly cost-effective.

In planning and performing QIE’s roll out, the integrated approach 
should be maintained, as one of the key strong points of the 
project.  
However, responsible actors need to include in any case, in the 
customised packages delivered at school level, comprehensive 
training for a majority of teachers in school (differentiated by 
levels of seniority/experience) as well as equipment and didactic 
materials, in complementarity with recent measures taken to 
ensure on-line schooling. In the same vein, activities targeting 
non-discrimination and tolerance should be continued and 
enhanced, for the aimed change to occur.

Interventions in educational area, overall and in the framework of 
rolled-out QIE, should provide for actions aligned to different 
needs of boys and girls. Such gender-customised actions should be 
considered also for the activity of the school counsellor.

To ensure success in rolling out QIE, the role, responsibilities and 
interventions of local authorities in the area of education should 
be clearly detailed for each case (community), in line with the local 
and country development strategies and legislation in place. 
Additional mechanisms for cooperation with local institutions 
(with the mayor's office) should be developed and more applied 
cooperation with social assistance services should be ensured.

The Ministry of Education should put in place effective 
mechanisms for assessing regularly and ensuring the quality of the

QIE roll out should take into consideration different needs of 
schools involved, from the perspective of quality and motivation 
of human resources including school headmasters, of vulnerable 
categories presence/predominance in school, especially Roma 
children and, in the same vein, from the perspective of rural and 
urban dimension.

Independent of QIE rollout perspectives, interventions as 
implemented by QIE need to be continued in the participating 
schools, for reform at their level to be completed. In this regard 
the evaluation recommends the development of a mechanism 
through which the County School Inspectorates take up methods, 
materials, instruments developed under QIE and integrate them in 
the existing educational procedures and practices at SCI and 
school level (e.g., in the activities of Teachers’ Houses and 
Methodical Groups, whose capacity needs to be strengthened).

1. Evaluation background 
 
1.1. 
Object of the evaluation 
The Quality Inclusive Education Initiative (QIE) aimed to be the foundation of a “friendly and inclusive school” 
for all pupils and teachers and to positively change the image of school as an institution. The intervention was 
meant to respond to the needs for capacity and professional development of headmasters and teachers and 
brought to the fore the importance of early childhood education. The results and lessons generated by the 
model were meant to inform the elaboration of new laws, standards and regulations applicable nationwide4. 
QIE was developed in partnership by the Romanian Ministry of National Education and UNICEF Romania, and 
implemented during September 2015 and June 2019 (4 school years), in Bacău County, in 51 schools from 44 
communities in 37 urban5 and rural6 localities. To the initially 45 schools selected (one school/community), six 
new school units from the same communities were added to the project in the school year 2017-2018. 
The total budget allocated for QIE was approximately US 3 million (for the period 2015-2019) and the project 
was implemented in partnership with the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Pre-academic Education 
(ARACIP), the Romanian Institute of Educational Sciences (IES7), “Impreuna” Community Development Agency 
(Impreuna Agency), HOLTIS Association and “Step-by-Step” Centre for Education and Professional 
Development at national level. Also, broad partnerships have been established at the level of Bacau County with 
the County Council (CC), County School Inspectorate (CSI) and the County Center for Resources and Educational 
Assistance (CJRAE). 
QIE includes child-centred interventions at school, family and community levels. The education package is 
universal, as all schoolchildren and schools may benefit from its interventions and of its results in terms of 
quality education.  The package is also modular, which means that it may be customized to the specific needs 
of a school/community, and thus it could be applied in all types of schools. QIE focuses in several of its 
components on children who are the most at-risk of dropout8.  
The activities were grouped in 6 components, mentioned below.   
 
1) School Management Component 
2) Teaching and Learning Methods Component 
3) Role Models (non-cognitive skills) Component 
4) Parenting Support Component 
5) Early Education Component 
6) Micro-grant Component 
Other activities implemented were: 
a) Local communication and behaviour change campaign targeting public service providers from 
administration, health, education and social sector for reducing stigma and discrimination against 
Roma: capacity building of local professionals was enhanced in order to recognize and fight 
discrimination related to the access of public services  
b) Communication, Monitoring and Advocacy, activities carried out on a permanent basis.  
QIE is a comprehensive integrated model consisting of a multitude of interventions, tackling various problems 
and causes of absenteeism and dropout, with a clear focus on enhancing the quality and inclusiveness of 
education (see figure 1 below). QIE includes several interventions and targets multiple groups of key right 
holders (children, with a focus on children at risk, parents, preschool and school personnel) and duty bearers
