Executive Summary 
This section presents the summary of the findings of the study “Evaluation of the National Strategy on 
the Protection and Promotion of Children's Rights” carried out under contract no. 43289903/29.11.2019 
made between UNICEF Romania and Pluriconsult S.R.L. The evaluation was performed in December 
2019 -June 2021, in compliance with the Terms of Reference (Annex 1) and the Inception Report (Annex 
2).  
According to the Terms of Reference, the subject matter of this evaluation is the National Strategy on 
the Protection and Promotion of Children's Rights 2014-2020 (Annexes 3 and 4). The document was 
approved in 2014 by the Government of Romania by Decision no. 1113/2014 initiated by the Minister of 
Labour, Family, Social Protection and the Elderly (currently the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection). 
The Strategy is aimed at promoting investments in the development and wellbeing of children, based 
on a holistic and integrated approach adopted by all the public agencies and authorities, with a view to 
respecting children's rights, meeting their needs and ensuring their universal access to services. The 
strategy includes four general objectives: 
1. improve children's access to quality services; 
2. uphold children's rights and promote the social inclusion of children in vulnerable circumstances; 
3. prevent and combat any forms of violence; 
4. foster children's participation in relevant decision -making processes. 
Each of the general objectives (impact level) includes a set of specific objectives (outcome level) with 
proposed measures (output level) to achieve them, including expected outcomes. 
The purpose of the evaluation was to provide evidence on the outcomes achieved through a 
multisector approach to upholding children’s rights. The evaluation is summative, but also includes a 
formative dimension, which means not only measuring outcomes against targets, but also providing 
evidence on inter-institutional and inter-sector cooperation, participation of civil society, private sector 
and individuals, and development of horizontal and vertical institutional relationships between various 
stakeholders. 
According to the Terms of Reference, the evaluation had four specific objectives, thus: 
● 
review the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the measures 
ensuing from the Strategy; 
● 
review the Strategy design and implementation processes and provide conclusion and 
recommendations on what did and did not work and on how to improve the next strategy; 
● 
document the lessons learned about and make recommendations for improvement of the 
implementation of the Strategy; 
● 
identify how the Strategy led to outcomes for children in terms of gender issues, fairness and 
overall respect for their rights. 
Scope of the evaluation: in terms of timeframe, the evaluation covered all the years when the Strategy 
was implemented, with limitations regarding the data availability for 2020. In terms of geographic 
coverage, the evaluation was carried out nationwide, looking at the implementation of the Strategy in 
the entire country. 
In terms of stakeholders and users of the evaluation, the evaluation is meant to provide central and 
local level stakeholders, including children, with a thorough picture on the implementation of the 
Strategy. 
In terms of the methodology employed, the evaluation looked at the relevance, consistency, 
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the Strategy. The evaluation was based on the 
change theory and used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to triangulate information 
through a variety of means and tools. The evaluation team considered all the available data and opinions 
of the stakeholders, such as to come up with findings that are as impartial and representative as 
possible.  Three categories of data were considered under the quantitative component of the evaluation, 
thus: 1/ administrative data on child protection, health, education and justice collected based on the 
Strategy indicators, 2/ data from official reports and documents of national and international agencies 
and from other reports prepared by the academia and NGOs during the Strategy implementation period, 
as well as data from two national online surveys carried out for the purposes of this evaluation with 
DGASPC and SPAS. Qualitative data were collected in 19 focus groups with target groups (children and

parents) of social, educational and medical services and with the staff of the public services (DGASPC, 
DSP, ISJ, IPJ, SPAS), 3 group interviews with teenagers involved in participative processes, and 89 
individual in-depth interviews with local, county and national stakeholders, non-governmental 
organisations and international organisations. 
Main Findings and Conclusions 
Relevance 
The National Strategy on the Protection and Promotion of Children's Rights 2014-2020 was an important 
step ahead in asserting then concept of children’s rights in Romanian public policies and in various 
economic sectors. In recent years, children's rights have become part of both the public discourse and 
action, materialised in programmes and projects meant to contribute to developing the services provided 
to children, irrespective of their ethnicity, gender, financial status, etc.  
The method proposed by the Strategy to approach children’s rights issues was based on an integrated 
intervention, whose effectiveness was validated in previous projects implemented in partnership with 
local and central stakeholders from both the governmental and NGO sectors. 
A logical correlation exists between the objectives (general and specific), outcomes and activities. The 
measures and actions are relevant and contribute to the achievement of the proposed goal and 
objectives. The Strategy is based on an ample set of data and addressed to social groups whose 
relevance has been confirmed by numerous other national and international studies. Nevertheless, the 
highly generic and insufficiently broken-down data, lack of community needs analyses to thoroughly 
identify the issues and high dynamics thereof limited the identification of deep causes of the various 
vulnerabilities associated to the Strategy target groups.  
The development of the Strategy was preceded by a multi-sectoral analysis of the children's wellbeing 
on all levels (social welfare, education health, justice, participation) and wide consultation of all 
stakeholders (ministries and their subordinated entities with responsibilities in the protection of children 
and upholding their rights, general social assistance and child protection departments, but also civil 
society’s organisations working in the field). The consulted stakeholders proposed other measures to 
tackle certain problems identified in the activities they had implemented. Most of these measures 
proposed by the consulted stakeholders were included in the final text of the Strategy, though they 
should have been better prioritised based on an estimation of available resources. 
The Strategy goal, measures and actions did match the needs of the Romanian children and their 
families at the time of its development and, even though new issues emerged, many of the proposed 
measures continue to be relevant, since the problems identifies in 2014 are still actual, the time required 
for their resolution extending beyond one public policy cycle. Though the Strategy intended to cover all 
the identified categories of vulnerable children in the status quo analysis and public consultations, the 
approach to vulnerable children remained rather general, insufficient for addressing some specific 
categories of children and provide them with prospects for significantly improved services. 
Most sector strategies developed for 2014 - 2020 include provisions on the protection of children and 
their rights. The child protection provisions included in county or local development strategies were 
based on the objectives and measures proposed in the Strategy. Moreover, the Strategy informed the 
strategic documents and projects financed from public funds, partnerships with public entities and 
advocacy campaigns/ projects of some NGOs. 
Consistency  
The Strategy is consistent with the Romania's international commitments, including the principles of the 
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities (UN CRDP) and the Optional Protocol to this Convention, objectives and targets set 
forth in the Europe 2020 Strategy regarding the reduction of poverty, priorities of the Council of Europe 
Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2012-2015) and the provisions of the Commission Recommendation 
din 20 February 2013 Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage (2013/112/UE). 
The education and health measures laid out in the Strategy were defined based on the national sectoral 
strategies. The child inclusion measures proposed in the Strategy were considered in the National 
Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction for the period 2015-2020. However, it is difficult to 
differentiate in the Operational Plan between the outcomes achieved following the implementation of 
the Strategy and those obtained as a result of implementing the measures laid down in the sectoral 
strategies. Moreover, the failure to prioritise the indicators and clearly define impact, outcome and output

indicators significantly reduced the internal consistency of the Strategy’s Operational Plan and its overall 
evaluability. 
The Strategy implementation consistency should have been ensured by the Coordination Committee for 
Protection and Advancement of Children’s Rights, set up as a communication and coordination 
mechanism. This Committee, which was also provided for in regulations on the organisation and 
operation of ANPDCA (GD 299/2014) and ANDPDCA (GD 102/2019), was never operational and only 
met once in the period 2014 - 2020. 
Various experiences of NGOs were used in the process of developing and implementing the Strategy 
in areas such as: deinstitutionalisation of children in residential facilities, preventing and fighting violence 
against children, methods for identifying children in vulnerable situations, methods for working with youth 
in the special protection system. Considering the high level of alignment between the Strategy priorities 
and UNICEF’s regional and national priorities, we also emphasise the good cooperation of national 
partners and UNICEF, which increased the implementation consistency. 
Effectiveness 
Numerous proposals were made between 2014-2020 to improve or expand the existing public policy 
framework covering the needs of the target groups identified in the Strategy and the development of 
public social assistance services continued both by increasing their number and scope, and by 
accrediting them as social services providers.  
Much progress was made towards developing the system’s capacity to provide quality services to 
children, such as: the opportunity to provide a minimum package of services was considered; the 
development of integrated community-based services was initiated; campaigns were organised to 
promote adoption and the adoption process was made more efficient; the involvement of the community 
in the realisation of children's rights was considered by the development of consultative community-
based structures; actions were taken to instate a national system for monitoring and evaluating the state 
of children in Romania; limited progress was made in the rehabilitation and social reintegration of 
children with disabilities and the provision of dedicated places for SEN students in high school and 
vocational education was advocated; the legal framework on and development of support services for 
children with parents working abroad were completed; campaigns were delivered to raise awareness 
on the phenomenon of violence against children; minimum quality standards were developed and 
adopted on the services provided to child victims of trafficking in human beings. Insignificant progress 
was made regarding street children and Roma children. 
With a view to developing the capacity of the system to provide quality services to children, the Strategy 
included a number of measures aimed at increasing the personnel capacity to provide such services, 
besides increasing their range and scope. Training sessions were delivered in the field of child protection 
and adoption; analysing, defining and implementing inter-sectoral child protection policies; and project 
management. Whilst progress was made in the first two areas, the developments in the field of project 
management were rather modest. 
The main enablers that contributed to the achievement of the national objectives of the Strategy were 
the good work in relationship between ANDPDCA and NGOs, progress made in inter-agency 
cooperation, ANDPDCA’s working together with international bodies such as UNICEF or the World 
Bank, the implementation by ANDPDCA and other relevant public entities of projects financed from 
operational programmes, etc. The main enablers that contributed to the achievement of the local 
objectives of the Strategy were the opportunities afforded by European Funds, legal framework, 
existence of individual/ group initiatives of local stakeholders, etc. By and large, it seems that the “recipe 
for success” lays in the good coordination of the national, county and local levels. 
The main deterrents for the achievement of the Strategy objectives were the lack of Strategy monitoring, 
challenges in providing coordination, inconsistent distribution of human and financial resources, financial 
appropriations deemed insufficient, low levels of social services’ contracting, lack of flexibility in 
accessing European Funds, insufficient communication between the central and local levels and 
institutional changes. The institutional and political changes in ministries caused a high turnover in staff 
responsible for the implementation of the measures. 
The implementation of the Strategy was based on the budget appropriations from various national 
sectoral programmes, relevant sectoral strategies for 2014-2020, European and other international 
development programmes, and, to a lesser extent, local resources. The lack of budget planning was an

important deterring factor in the implementation, as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of the 
Strategy.  
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted significantly on the implementation of the Strategy measures in 
2020. On the one hand, a number of measures were adopted to simplify the working procedures and 
beneficiaries’ access to online services; on the other hand, the pandemic worsened certain social 
problems, by reducing the activity of day centres and limiting children's access to education and health. 
At the same time, the number of domestic violence cases increased during the pandemic. The main 
deterrents for the achievement of the local objectives were the lack of political will, insufficient local 
personnel to assess the needs, poor cooperation between public entities and NGOs, lack of initiative 
and failure to assume responsibility and, in some cases, lack of cooperation between the DGASPC 
management and the county councils.  
Efficiency 
The integrated implementation of the Strategy was achieved to a lesser extent. The Strategy included 
measures already laid down in the sectoral strategies of the ministries, and each public authority of the 
central government implemented the measures of their relevant strategies, without systematically 
providing monitoring data to ANDPDCA. The integrated implementation of the Strategy measures was, 
to some extent, also impacted by the position of ANDPDCA as an entity subordinated to the Ministry of 
Labour, which arguably reduced sometimes the efficiency in its working together with line ministries and 
local authorities. Many of the measures included in the Strategy were aimed at the local level, and the 
designated line ministries failed to make the local public entities accountable for their implementation, 
many of the actions being shouldered by the DGASPCs. 
The integration of the measures aimed at protecting and promoting children's rights was incomplete. 
Thus, despite the existence of administrative measures that form the premises for inter-ministerial 
cooperation,1 the financing and integrated implementation of the various types of interventions is still at 
an early stage. Examples of integrated interventions and approaches are few and far between, mainly 
reflecting local initiatives, and not so much systemic national approaches, The integrated approach was 
neither facilitated in the area of European Funds, since the complementary financing of projects from 
different operational programmes was not possible. 
The financing of the activities laid out in the Strategy was based on “staying within the limits of each 
ministry’s budget” which, in fact, have no budget line dedicated to the Strategy. An estimate of the costs 
of the measures proposed in the Strategy was developed with the technical and financial support of 
UNICEF, but it was never used. The Strategy being mainly based on financial resources from European 
Funds caused delays in the implementation of the measures, but also difficulties in monitoring their 
outcomes, since projects financed from EU Funds are monitored by the management authorities.  
One of the limits in the implementation of the Strategy was the lack of a mechanism for the systematic 
monitoring of the measures and their integrated character. Though the Operational Plan of the 2014-
2016 Strategy included actions and performance indicators for each measure, the implementation was 
never monitored. Furthermore, though a study was carried out to update the Operational Plan, its 
findings were never used, such that the initial Plan, which had a number of gaps, remained in force. 
Thus, very many indicators were proposed for monitoring the progress in the implementation of the 
Strategy measures and actions and their definition was often too generic or inconsistent with institutional 
data collection practices, which made it very difficult to collect progress data. 
The Strategy provided for training of the social protection personnel on topics such as: 1/ child protection 
and adoption, 2/ analysing, defining and implementing inter-sectoral child protection policies, and 3/ 
project management. The number of DGASPC, SPAS, DAS and social assistance units personnel 
participating in child right and adoption training programmes increased in the period 2014 - 2019. Also, 
training sessions on various topics were delivered in the different projects implemented by ANDPDCA 
and the Ministry of Labour. Nevertheless, the training needs of the personnel involved in the provision 
of social services remains rather high. 
Sustainability 
The measures with high sustainability potential are those provided for in other sectoral strategies 
(development of SPASs. Integrated community centres, etc.), those that were allocated resources

during the implementation of the Strategy (deinstitutionalization, development of family-based services, 
etc.), and those encouraged and supported at European and international level (violence against 
children, children’s participation, support for poor children, disabled children, etc.). At the same time, the 
measures aimed at implementing integrated community-based services are proposed to be continued 
in the 2021-2027 Programming Period, under the Operational Programme Inclusion and Social Dignity. 
Generally, the legal framework is stable and regularly improved based on consultations with local 
stakeholders and NGOs. However, it is necessary to permanently inform and explain the means for 
consistent enforcement of the legal framework, allocation of adequate resources and monitoring the 
implementation.  
The use of minimum quality standards, cost standards and working procedures at local level entails 
actions to cut back bureaucracy, encourage social workers to do field work, allocate financial and logistic 
resources, better inter-institutional cooperation (public-public, public-private), provision of consistent 
working methods, continuous professional supervision and development, and recruitment of persons 
that meet the minimum education and experience requirements for positions involving social work. 
The coordination of the public social assistance services by the DGASPCs is very important for the 
consistent implementation of public policies (including work standards and methods). Moreover, the 
implementation of the standards and methodologies should be monitoring and evaluated regularly, 
allowing for their revision when necessary. Yet the practice of services providers (be they public or 
private) indicates that the minimum quality standards are in fact maximal. No cost standards exist yet 
for prevention services (provision of community-based services). 
The involvement of the local stakeholders, in particular of the local authorities, was either 
inexistent or insufficient in certain communities. Where consultative community structures are 
in place and active, they demonstrated their usefulness as a mechanism for mobilising local 
resources and cooperation to deal locally with children's social problems. 
Impact  
The evaluation shows modest improvements in the status of children from disadvantaged social and 
economic backgrounds, in the context where the number of children living in poverty and with numerous 
social problems is still high; nevertheless, some progress has been made. In the context of the COVID-
19 pandemic, sustained efforts will be needed in the upcoming period to maintain these advancements, 
since there are indications that these children’s situation worsened from the onset of the pandemic and 
the existing gaps widened.  
In the period 2014 - 2019, the share of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion dropped significantly, 
down to 35.8%. However, Romania has the highest rate of children at risk of poverty and social exclusion 
in Europe. 
The number of children in the special protection system decreased from 58,178 (31 December 2014) to 
50,401 (31 December 2019), that is by 13.4%. The total number of beneficiaries of the services to 
prevent the separation of children from their families increased from 55,833 to 68,475 (22,6%) as a 
result of the development of these services. 
A total of 23 institutions were closed down in this period. Whilst 166 residential care centres (83 
traditional and 83 modulated) existed at the end of 2014, in December 2019 their number was down to 
143 (91 traditional and 52 modulated). Regarding the categories of children addressed by these centres, 
the number of centres for disabled children decreased by 25 and the number of centres for non-disabled 
children increased by 2. Though the number or traditional and modulated residential care centres did 
not decrease much, the number of children sheltered in these centres decreased from 7,974 in 2014 to 
4,427 in 2019. The number of traditional and modulated residential care centres run by NGOs decreased 
too. 
The data on the number of children aged 0-2 years receiving residential services show a decrease from 
716 to 359. Even though the maximum age for placement in residential care was increased from 3 to 7 
years in 2019, the number of children aged 3 to 6 in such facilities decreased significantly anyway in the 
period 2014-2019, from 2,032 to 665. 
In the period 2014 - 2019, the number of disabled children increased from 70,493 to 72,349. The share 
of disabled children in education increased from 55% in 2014 to 62% in 2019. Nevertheless, work is still 
needed to suitably integrate them in the mainstream schools, for instance, to provide them with the 
required support services (support teachers), reduce discrimination, make accommodations to

educational premises, etc. The number of disabled children attending special schools decreased from 
12,127 in 2014 to 10,884 in 2019. The number of day-care centres for disabled children increased from 
159 to 211 in the period 2017 - 2019. 
The total number of confirmed cases of violence against children increased from 12,542 in 2014 to 
15,996 in 2019. An increase in the total number of abuse, neglect and exploitation cases is noted, but 
also a reduction in the number of exploitation for criminal purposes. 
The main indicators of the impact of the educational system showed no improvements. Thus, the 
financing of the education system remains much below the OECD average and far from the real needs, 
the rate of school enrolment is decreasing (except for ante-pre-school), school dropout is increasing, 
students perform modestly in national and international tests, and the rate of functional illiteracy is high. 
The indicators proposed in the Strategy for measuring the achievement of these objectives were not 
met. 
The Strategy aimed at reducing by 5% the gap in the access to services of children in rural areas. 
Considering the available data broken down by living environments, we can appreciate that no 
significant progress was made in this period. Not only that the urban-rural gap failed to close, as planned 
in the Strategy, but it widened. Indicators such as the rate of school enrolment, school dropout rate, 
children’s performance in national and international tests, etc. have significantly lower values in rural 
compared to urban areas. The number and level training of teachers in urban areas is higher than in 
rural schools. In this context, schools are polarised in terms of access to resources, and the students’ 
school performance follows the same trend. In the conditions described above, the impact of the 
Strategy on the quality of education services and life of school-aged children was rather modest.  
However, the Strategy had a positive impact on some of the measures that impact on children's health 
status. Thus, child mortality is decreasing, but maintaining the rural-urban disparities, and the 
immunisation rates are on an upward trend. 
Children in conflict with the law are a category that should receive more attention in the future, since the 
current Strategy failed to close the rural-urban gap, which continues to be very wide in the case of these 
children. More should be invested in the training of experts, in order to increase the quality of these 
children's life. Judicial procedure standards are in place that are observed, but the services are wither 
inexistent in certain areas, or are ineffective, since their development was the responsibility of the local 
authorities whose involvement was modest, depending on their respective resources and skills. For this 
reason, rural-urban, rural-rural and regional differences exist, which explains the high reoffending rates.  
Progress was made in this period regarding the capacity of some SPASs and DGASPCs to manage 
children's issues at local and county level. Personnel training was one of the measures set forth in the 
Strategy - training sessions were delivered on various topics, but the investment in training remains 
insufficient. One of the mentioned problems is the personnel turnover and the need for regular training 
to give all new employees the opportunity to develop intersectoral team working skills, which remains a 
fairly uncommon practice. 
Lessons for the Next Strategy 
In the absence of a methodological approach focusing on the impact of the Strategy on children’s lives, 
including a clear definition of the types of planned effects, from outputs to outcomes and impact, the risk 
exists to excessively plan the pursuit of more or less relevant outputs of the type “number of campaigns 
[...]”, to the detriment of giving due consideration to the access, quality and fairness issues identified in 
the initial stock taking of the system for the protection and promotion of the rights of children. The 
Operational Plan of the next Strategy should include impact indicators derived from the strategic vision 
on its long-term effects, in the context of the structural reforms envisaged by PNRR, the new Operational 
Programmes and the new European Child Guarantee. 
It is important that the Strategy objectives be matched with those of the sectoral strategies, to the level 
where the latter substitute the Strategy. Given that the entity responsible for implementing the Strategy 
had no formalised coordination role with the ministries, no list of clearly defined intervention programmes 
existed and no projected budget was available, the positive and negative outcomes are difficult to 
associate with the implementation of the Strategy.  
Equal access to quality services for all children cannot be ensured in the absence of professionalised 
and numerically sufficient human resources. The situation is even more serious in rural and 
socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, where the education level of human resources is low, and 
support staff is in most cases absent. A manifest and sustainable positive change in the system for the
