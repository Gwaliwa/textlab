EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

12 
 
This is an evaluation report of the UNICEF Education Programme (2018-2022). The evaluation was conducted 
between December 2021- December 2022.  
Background 
The Education Programme Strategy (1) for the UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 focuses on three major 
priority areas: a) out-of-school children; b) quality learning and teaching; and c) early childhood education, 
under the larger outcome of ensuring that ’Girls and boys, particularly the most disadvantaged, participate 
in quality early childhood and elementary education with learning outcomes at grade-appropriate levels, by 
2022’. The outcome was reached through five output result areas, and an additional output was added 
(Output 506 on COVID-response) after the Mid-Term Strategic Reflection in 2022(2), to capture responses to 
and adaptations in programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF’s educational programming,  
interventions and implementation modalities , is based on its classification of states into three typologies: 
High Burden, Tribal States and Transition states. More context and background to the evaluation and the 
Education Programme is provided in Sections 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. 
Purpose of the Evaluation and its Audience 
The overarching purpose of the evaluation was to generate learnings on implementation modalities – what 
worked and how; as well as what gaps emerged, if any – in the interventions rolled out since 2018 under the 
UNICEF Education Programme in India. The evaluation findings and recommendations will feed into UNICEF 
India’s upcoming Country Programme (beginning in 2023 and decision-making on education policies and 
processes at national and sub-national levels). The overall goal and objectives of the evaluation is presented 
in Section 1.4 and the intended audience is presented in Section 1.7. 
The scope of the evaluation encompassed the Education Programme from 2018-2021 and covered all the six 
output areas. The geographic scope of the evaluation was national but also with an in-depth focus on a 
sample of seven states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu) 
among three state typologies for the purpose of primary data collection.  The primary intended audience for 
the results from this study is UNICEF staff, government and other stakeholders who will be involved in the 
next UNICEF Education Programme. The scope of the evaluation is elucidated in Section 1.5. 
Evaluation Methodology 
This evaluation is theory-based and utilised evaluation methods of Contribution Analysis and Process Tracing, 
especially Bayesian Updating. Evaluation evidence was assessed using the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) criteria of relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability. Questions related to equity, gender equality and 
human rights considerations, especially those pertaining to marginalised and vulnerable populations, were 
integrated into all of the evaluation criteria. The criteria and corresponding questions are presented in 
Section 1.6. 
The evaluation study utilised mixed-method research, including extensive analysis of the documents, Results 
Assessment Module (RAM) reports, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with 
the UNICEF and stakeholders at the national, state and district levels. Contribution Analysis with elements of 
Process Tracing, in particular, Bayesian Confidence Updating was employed to test  the effectiveness of the 
Theory of Change (ToC). Contribution Analysis provided the overarching framework to arrive at credible 
causal claims about the UNICEF Education Programme’s contribution to output result areas, considering 
other factors that may have influenced the achievement of these result areas. The evaluation team, in 
consultation with UNICEF, developed six contribution claims around the six output areas, and constructed 
output-specific ToC using the COM-B (Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation- Behavioural Change) approach.
