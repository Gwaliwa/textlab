The implementation of this study, ‘Inclusive education evaluation by using Big Data sources’, 
would not have been possible without extensive contributions from a range of organisations 
and people. We are grateful to the officials/experts of UNICEF Kazakhstan for trusting us 
with this study and providing the financial support to undertake our research. We would like 
to thank Tatiana Aderkhina and Raushan Ibrasheva for their input at the inception phase of 
the project, as well as for their comments on the preliminary findings presentation. We are 
also thankful to the Junction Bulgaria team, whose work on the formative evaluation 
provided us with valuable insights on the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan. We 
would also like to express our gratitude to the reviewers of the inception phase presentation 
at UNICEF.  
We are grateful to all the individuals and organisations who posted their perspectives on 
inclusive education in Kazakhstan on publicly accessible social media platforms, without 
which this research would not have been possible.  
We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of OPM staff members Varun 
Vashistha and Vladimir Imnaishvili in managing the administrative and financial aspects of 
this study. We would also like to thank Matilda Eriksson for assisting us with operational 
details of Meltwater, which was used for analysing one component of social media data in 
the study. 
All opinions expressed, and any mistakes in the report, remain the responsibility of the OPM 
team.

Exclusion: No recognition of the right or capacity of 
children with disabilities to education, and consequent 
denial of access to education in any form.  
Segregation: Placement of children with disabilities in 
separate environments designed or used to respond to 
particular or various impairments, in isolation from 
children without disabilities. 
Integration: Placement of children with disabilities in 
existing mainstream educational institutions, as long as 
the child can adjust to fit the standardised requirements 
of such institutions. 
Inclusion: A process of systemic reform embodying 
changes and modifications in content, teaching 
methods, approaches, structures, and strategies in 
education to overcome barriers. It requires a 
commitment to changing the system to fit the student.

We also pay attention to measures that are not specific to inclusive education, but which can 
contribute to an enabling environment for inclusive education, such as measures to prevent 
disability, for early identification, and to protect children from violence and abuse in the 
education system.  
This evaluation is important for a variety of reasons. First, it complements a formative 
evaluation commissioned by UNICEF that is ongoing at the time of writing and that seeks to 
assess how state education programmes have contributed to improving the inclusive 
education landscape in Kazakhstan. We refer to this parallel formative evaluation as the 
‘Junction Bulgaria study’. Second, instead of focusing on specific programmes, this study 
uses innovative analytical methods to compile and synthesise publicly accessible social 
media and online news information from two key stakeholder groups, whose perspectives 
are categorised into two text corpora and analysed. The first group of stakeholders 
comprises of the general online public in Kazakhstan, and includes parents, teachers, and 
youth overall. The second stakeholder group caters to the views and institutional knowledge 
of organisations active in inclusive education activities in Kazakhstan. Third, the use of non-
traditional data and analytical methods provides a space for experimentation and 
engagement with different viewpoints, some of which may be difficult to observe and are 
thus often left out of traditional methods and approaches.

Executive summary 
Introduction 
To better understand the inclusive education landscape in Kazakhstan, the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commissioned the present study with the objective of 
understanding different stakeholder perspectives as expressed via social media and online 
news media, using social media listening (SML) tools. This research is expected to generate 
insights for UNICEF and the Ministry of Education, Government of Kazakhstan, to inform 
future strategies and policies in this area. The findings provide insights for leading scientific 
institutions in Kazakhstan actively working in the field of inclusive education. Other 
development partners such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the 
World Bank, as well as multiple other non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working and 
supporting investments in education in Kazakhstan, are also likely to benefit from these 
findings.  
Evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope 
The primary research objective is to use SML tools and quantitative text analysis tools to 
understand the perspectives of individuals and organisations, as expressed in text online, on 
inclusive education in Kazakhstan. By quantitatively analysing non-traditional online news 
and social media sources of data, we present insights and formulate recommendations 
based on viewpoints from different stakeholders that might otherwise be difficult to observe. 
Our research complements an ongoing formative evaluation (the Junction Bulgaria study).  
This evaluation aims to answer three evaluation questions (EQs) for both stakeholder groups.  
1. What is the content of social and online media discussions on inclusive education 
in Kazakhstan? We interpret ‘content’ to relate to what these discussions ‘look like’, i.e. 
what is being said, where, by whom, and when. Note that we purposefully only deploy 
quantitative text analysis techniques to answer this question. This means that 
descriptions of this ‘content’ rely on quantitative analytical techniques.  
2. What do people mention as factors ‘holding back’ (barriers) inclusive education? 
We interpret ‘barriers’ broadly, in the sense that we try to find out what is being 
mentioned online when problems and issues with improving access and promoting the 
rights of children to inclusive education are discussed. As above, we deploy quantitative 
text analysis techniques to answer this EQ.  
3. Do people mention state programmes at all? Here, we search for a predefined list of 
state programmes.  
This study was designed to be formative and descriptive in nature and is thus a part 
of a broader formative evaluation exercise. The focus is on describing online news and 
discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan rather than on evaluating an ‘object’.  
In the inception phase, detailed discussions were undertaken with UNICEF to define 
and operationalise ‘inclusive education’ in the context of this study. Based on these 
discussions, children under 18 years of age with disabilities were identified as the target

group of interest. This includes children with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or 
sensory impairments, which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their effective 
participation in society on an equal basis with others. This approach integrates the medical 
and social model of disability in our conceptualisation of disability (UNESCO, UNICEF, & 
FCDO, 2021).  
A vital component of operationalising inclusion relates to the level of education where this 
inclusion occurs or is desired. In this study, we focus on children in preschool as well as 
those receiving primary and secondary education. Due to multiple considerations, as 
mentioned later, we also limit our study to the relatively recent past, from the beginning of 
2022 until May 2023, where our data is restricted to cover conversations and posts online 
captured by our online text scrapers.  
Methodology 
To study the EQs from different perspectives and triangulate insights, we focused on two 
primary stakeholder groups, whose publicly accessible social media data were organised 
into two different text corpora (collections of text data). We summarise each below.  
1. Text data in Corpus 1 represents discussions of the general online public. This was 
created using Meltwater, an online platform which offers scraping and analytics of 
social media and online news data.  
As a first step in building a search query for Corpus 1 in Meltwater, we identified multiple 
subtopics within the broad topic of inclusive education through a literature review and expert 
discussions. For each subtopic, we created a combination of keywords in Russian and 
Kazakh that accurately described the chosen topic and considered the specifics of each 
language and the different groups of interest. Once our subtopics and keywords were 
defined, we initiated search queries, scraping online discussions on inclusive education in 
Kazakhstan. In our search queries, we limited the geography to Kazakhstan by including a 
‘Location’ query that specified our results must mention locations within Kazakhstan. To 
ensure the quality of this search, we repeatedly validated queries by human review.  
2. Text data from accounts and websites of specific organisations active in the inclusive 
education space in Kazakhstan were collected as part of Corpus 2 and built using 
self-programmed scrapers. 
Through a purposive research design, we identified multiple organisations and their publicly 
accessible social media handles and websites, which were scraped via a self-written 
programme using Python that downloaded publicly accessible text. A major component of 
Corpus 2 came from Instagram channels, Telegram groups and channels, and web sources 
such as blogs and news outlets.  
Findings 
For EQ 1, we summarise key characteristics of the social and online media discussions on 
inclusive education in Kazakhstan as follows. 
1. Inclusive education in Kazakhstan is a topic of ongoing discussion, albeit a small 
one compared to general discussions on education online. Analysis of Corpus 1 and 
Corpus 2 shows an overall increasing trend in discussions on inclusive education.

However, we estimate that inclusive education discussions in Corpus 1 make up only 
about 3–6% of all online text on education more broadly.  
2. The general public’s online engagement (Corpus 1) with inclusive education is 
higher on news sites, blogs, and Facebook than on other social media sites. 
Organisations working on inclusive education (Corpus 2), however, mostly use platforms 
like Instagram and Telegram. 
3. Analysis of top news by reach in Corpus 1 shows that the Government of 
Kazakhstan is successfully promoting its active measures to develop inclusive 
education with the introduction of modern technologies, the creation of 
feedback channels, and initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of children with special 
educational needs (SEN). This shows that the government’s messaging has a wide 
reach, and that they are successfully highlighting and promoting these activities.  
4. Spatial patterns of online conversations from Corpus 2 show that these 
discussions are mostly concentrated in large urban cities like Astana and Almaty, 
even after accounting for their higher population densities. This is suggestive of relatively 
higher engagement on inclusive education in these areas. 
5. Negative news in Corpus 1 often focused on the lack of protection of the rights of 
children with SEN, as well as on the quality of their education. Meanwhile, positive 
news highlighted measures taken to support children with autism, to prevent disability 
in newborns, to increase the capacity building of teachers, and for social protection.  
6. A hashtag analysis in Corpus 1 shows that autism and cerebral palsy are the most 
widely discussed disabilities. Also, the adoption of testing for children with SEN is 
actively discussed, as indicated by the United National Testing (ЕНТ) hashtag. Among 
non-profit organisations, work of the Bulat Utemuratov Foundation has received 
attention and positive discussion for its contribution to education for children with autism.  
7. Analysis of the most frequently used words from Corpus 2 shows discussions 
emphasised the capacity building of teachers, specialists and measures to support 
inclusive education. As before, autism was the most discussed disability. 
8. Topic analysis on Corpus 2 identified the most common themes of discussions, 
and again features the capacity building of teachers, school education content 
and pedagogy as prominent topics. Simultaneously, early diagnosis and treatment, 
social support and opportunities for children, were also vital themes of discussion.  
For EQ 2, our key findings are as follows. 
9. An analysis of ‘Rights and Barriers’ from Corpus 1 reveals that incidents of abuse, 
violence, and bullying in kindergartens, schools, universities, and families are 
being mentioned as major issues affecting adequate access to inclusive 
education. We understand that these have been identified by the Government of 
Kazakhstan, which has made efforts to address quality issues, improve standards, and 
establish minimum safety requirements in early childhood education.  
10. In Corpus 2, the need for improved teacher training and the capacity building of 
teachers and specialists who can support the SEN of children feature prominently 
as major barriers to be overcome.

11. In discussions on inclusive education online, girls are significantly 
underrepresented. With an eye on assessing differences in how inclusive education 
discussions make references to boys and girls, we check if girls or boys are 
disproportionately represented in discussions on inclusive education when compared to 
discussions about education with no mention of disability. We find that the share of 
messages that mention boys and girls across the corpora of ‘education and 
disability’ and ‘education’ is comparable. However, the share of messages that 
mention boys in such discussions is about three times larger than girls and accounts for 
about 75% of the overall discussions. This suggests that girls, and possibly their specific 
needs, are underrepresented in such discussions.  
For EQ 3, our key finding is as follows. 
12. We find limited mentions of specific programmes on inclusive education in 
Corpus 1 and Corpus 2. In the latter, we do find mentions of ‘Educated Nation’ 
(Образованная нация) and ‘Comfort School’ (Комфортная школа). This is not to say 
that these programmes are not important, but it indicates that specific issues, rather than 
government programmes, are being discussed more widely on social media. It may also 
imply that the government is not able to promote programmes in a way that they are 
picked up in social media discourse around inclusive education.  
Key policy recommendations 
1. Timing and choice of broadcasting platform for key messages: We find that 
engagement with inclusive education rises with the start of the academic year and tapers 
off gradually. It is sensitive to initiatives such as the month of raising awareness about 
autism. Similarly, general public’s online engagement is higher on news portals and 
blogs, whereas social media engagement on Instagram and Telegram is higher for 
organisations working on inclusive education. This information can be leveraged by the 
Government of Kazakhstan, particularly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of 
Information and Communications, to relay key messages on inclusive education using 
varied platforms for different stakeholders. In this context, evidence shows positive 
effects of such media messaging on children’s education (Keefer & Khemani, 2014).  
2. Focus on enhancing the accessibility of preschool, primary, and secondary 
education facilities via accessibility audits: Despite positive perceptions around the 
increased investment on upgrading school infrastructure and introducing modern 
technologies, the Junction Bulgaria team found that there is a requirement for even 
higher investment in physical infrastructure. Accessibility audits can help prioritise 
necessary modifications and ensure compliance with accessibility standards to enhance 
physical access to educational facilities. Certain relevant voluntary initiatives have 
already emerged—notably Accessible Kazakhstan—and could provide guidance for the 
Government of Kazakhstan to institutionalise this model for educational facilities.  
3. Investment in human capital: Our findings across corpora indicate a perception of lack 
of capacity building for teachers. Provision of training and professional development 
opportunities for teachers and staff members on inclusive education practices, disability 
awareness, and accessibility guidelines will enable educators to better support students 
with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning environment. It could also contribute 
towards a more individual approach being taken to students with SEN.

4. Coverage of social media dark areas: The social data media data on which this 
analysis is based comes from larger cities like Astana and Almaty. However, more 
research is needed to understand perceptions of, and barriers to, inclusive education in 
other parts of the country.  
5. Gender-sensitive assessment of educational needs: Our results show that girls are 
relatively underrepresented in online discussions on inclusive education in Kazakhstan, 
suggesting a lack of attention paid to the differential needs of girls in the educational 
system. This calls for a collection of indicators disaggregated by gender within the 
education sector in order to identify gender-specific factors limiting access to inclusive 
education. It also calls for a general focus on gender-sensitive messaging on the needs 
of girls in inclusive education.  
6. Early childhood interventions: Early diagnosis and treatment of disability is a recurring 
topic in our corpora. Early prevention and identification of disabilities, as well as provision 
of services for early childhood development for children with SEN, are crucial to ensure 
their educational needs are addressed from the outset. Positive news online indicates 
some progress has been made in measures taken to prevent disability in newborns and 
young children, including through better equipping of perinatal centres. These initiatives 
should be expanded in coverage and coupled with correctional support to prepare young 
children with SEN to study in public schools.  
7. Adaptation of standardised testing: The ЕНТ hashtag appeared commonly in our 
analysis, showing active discussions around the need to adapt standardised tests to the 
needs of children with SEN. Our findings from top news in Corpus 1 indicate that the 
Government of Kazakhstan has provided an additional 40 minutes for children with SEN 
during such tests, showing that progress on this issue is already underway. Further 
adjustments could be made to adapt testing materials, for instance for children who 
cannot see the text. 
Key recommendations for future use of SML in evaluations 
1. Designing EQs based on what SML can and cannot answer: As against traditional 
impact evaluations that are focussed on causal impact of an intervention, SML is better 
suited to address descriptive questions that are intended to capture the perspectives of 
stakeholders on a specific topic of online discussion. 
2. Validation of online data: Building search queries should be iterative and based on 
expert discussions. The list of keywords should account for linguistic or cultural 
sensitivities, while being simple enough to ensure a sizeable text corpus for analysis.  
3. Accounting for exclusion and inclusion bias: Inequalities in access to social media 
may exclude certain groups from online discussions, thereby limiting the 
representativeness at the national, or regional level. Bias from extreme views on social 
media than in person also highlights the need for expert discussions to validate the 
relevance of online posts. 
4. External Validity: As online discussions are not necessarily representative of the entire 
population and in some cases the number of posts is small, the evaluation should clearly 
state whether the results can be generalisable.
