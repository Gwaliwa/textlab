EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Overview 
i. 
The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Seed Fund program1 is an initial investment under the Multi Year 
Resilience Program Plan (MYRP). The MYRP aims to (re)engage children aged 3 to 17 in learning by 
providing equitable access to safe and inclusive learning spaces where children can acquire the 
foundational, socio-emotional, life and, where relevant, vocational skills necessary to continue their 
education and be prepared for adult life. The ECW was implemented over a three-year and six-month period 
(January 2020 -September 2023). It addresses specific critical interventions that build on lessons learned 
and achievements from previous ECW investments in Syria which ended in September 2019.2 UNICEF is 
the lead grant holder of the ECW program. The programme is jointly managed by a Programme 
Management Unit (PMU) composed of two grantees, UNICEF and the second grantee. Activities are 
implemented directly as well as through contracted service providers and partners.  
ii. 
The ECW program supported education programming in formal non-accredited education or non-formal 
education (NFE) settings. UNICEF is implementing the ECW in seven governorates, namely: Idleb, Aleppo, 
Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor, Hama, and Homs. The reach includes 80,558 directly supported children 
(40,109 girls) and 5,126 intermediate supported children (2,266 girls). This represents slightly over 100 per 
cent of the cumulative target.3 Of these, UNICEF has reached 69,453 (34,668 girls) (as of August 2022).  
iii. 
These activities seek to respond to the urgent educational needs of children in Syria, where approximately 2 
million children in Syria (40 per cent girls) are out of school, and an additional 1.5 million are at risk of 
dropping out.4 Child labor remains a key reason for children being out-of-school in all regions in Syria, with 
nearly 48 per cent of children not attending school due to child labour/work to support the household. Early 
and forced marriages have increased across Syria, compounding barriers to accessing education and 
detracting from achievement of SDG5 (Gender Equality).5 The fragmented educational system poses 
particular challenges for internally displaced persons (IDPs) to smoothly transfer or integrate into the 
education systems which vary by area.  
iv. 
Program activities are organized around four outcomes with related activities. First, the program seeks to 
equitably respond to the educational needs of girls and boys (Outcome 1) through light rehabilitation of 
learning spaces to make them safer and more accessible, providing transportation and equipping learning 
spaces with adequate learning and teaching supplies. At the same time, the program sought to improve 
teacher capacity to deliver foundation, socio-emotional and life skills (Outcome 2) through training and 
financial support combined with establishing referral pathways to specialised protection services. UNICEF 
temporarily paused ECW activities following devastating earthquakes that hit Syria and Turkey in February 
2023 with a subsequent reprioritization of responses.  
v. 
The program also sought to support more equitable learning opportunities for the education sector in Syria 
more broadly (Outcome 3) with UNICEF responsible for the development of a summative or placement 
assessment tool. Activities have been delayed as the PMU sought to meet the immediate needs of rights 
holders over support to education sector members. Outcome 4-resource mobilization, aimed to encourage 
the continuation of funding from traditional and non-traditional donors, including the private sector, to 
support the bridging of the funding gap. Activities under this outcome have also been delayed. 
vi. 
The main purpose of this Final Evaluation (FE) is to support the PMU of UNICEF, partners and donors in 
evaluating the results achieved; helping to identify gaps and key bottlenecks; and assessing the extent to 
which the implementation of the ECW Program in the Whole of Syria has been equitable and inclusive.6

Furthermore, the evaluation intends to assess whether it has been implemented in an efficient, effective, 
and well-coordinated manner.  
vii. 
The objective of this FE is to provide accountability to donors and rights holders, 
including IDPs and host communities, with respect to whether activities, through the 
implementation of the ECW program, are fit for purpose in response to the education 
needs of Syrian children, adolescent girls and boys. While there was no dedicated 
objective of assessing the contribution to human rights and gender equality, this has 
been mainstreamed within the aforementioned objectives with cross-cutting issues 
explored as a standalone evaluation criterion. The evaluation is timely for UNICEF and 
the donor, the primary intended users, to use findings to inform learning for designing 
and implementing the next phase of the ECW program. 
viii. 
This evaluation applied a mixed-methods approach that was participatory, inclusive and 
respondent-group sensitive. Primary data was collected in both government controlled 
areas (GCA) and non-government controlled areas (NGCA) with data collection taking 
place between February and June 2023. Data collection involved a thorough desk 
review in combination of remote and face to face methods including key informant 
interviews (KIIs), focus-group discussions (FGDs), quantitative surveys, and classroom 
and facility observations. Following the earthquakes, UNICEF requested a contract 
extension to conduct a post-earthquake assessment including a light desk review and 
direct observations. 
ix. 
Evaluation findings were derived from analysis of a wide range of primary and 
secondary data sources for triangulation to reduce potential bias and strengthen 
credibility of findings. The evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation 
Group (UNEG) ethical standards for evaluation. The ET referred to relevant guidance to ensure appropriate 
data collection protocols were in place to protect child participants.7 Findings were consistently 
disaggregated by gender.  
x. 
Key findings and Conclusions 
xi. 
Key findings and conclusions (in bold) are presented below, organized by evaluation criteria.  
xii. 
Program activities were relevant to the educational and psycho-social support (PSS) needs of children in 
program areas as well as emerging needs. UNICEF and partners took several steps to ensure program 
relevance including seeking feedback from rightsholders, assessing learning outcomes and adapting 
programming to shifts in the operating context. However, the fact that the program did not dedicate a 
specific component for children with disabilities (CwDs) in its initial design meant that the responsiveness 
of the program to the needs of CwDs has not been prioritized nor systematic. The limited involvement of 
rightsholders -particularly those who are most vulnerable such as CwDs, IDPs and caregivers representing 
them – during decisions on what activities to implement in the design phase (proposals) was a limiting 
factor in ensuring relevance. 
xiii. 
Following the earthquakes, UNICEF took swift action in prioritising responses for the most urgent needs to 
support the safe re-opening of schools. This included the identification of the need to provide for children 
and teachers with psychosocial support and health and safety awareness. UNICEF’s rapid post-earthquakes 
response was relevant given the damage to physical infrastructure as a result of the earthquakes, as 
reported in the SitReps and confirmed through school observations. 
xiv. 
The program as it was designed is coherent with other humanitarian responses and clusters though 
implementation is not always standardized beyond meeting minimum standards. Harmonisation requests 
need to be assessed in light of the operational context. Standardisation of implementation depends heavily 
on the different realities on the ground and the operational context in general, which vary greatly from one 
 
 
7 UNICEF’s pre-existing ‘Strategic Guidance Note on Institutionalizing Ethical Practice for UNICEF Research,’ and the ‘Evaluation 
Technical Note No. 1, Children Participating in Research, Monitoring and Evaluation’ to ensure ethical safeguards were respected 
concerning data collection with children. Data collection took place in compliance with UNICEF and Child Watch International 
Research Network (et al)’s ‘Ethical Research Involving Children’ – specifically in the areas of ‘Harms and Benefits’

area to the next. Therefore, aligned implementation is only possible to a degree and should focus on setting 
minimum standards rather than full alignment across all contexts. 
xv. 
Donor funding interests are not wholly consistent with needs in the supported areas, especially regarding 
early child development (ECD) and secondary education and vocational learning opportunities. The 
Education Response Snapshot issues by the Whole of Syria Cluster called for support for community based 
ECD and opportunities for adolescents, both of which are currently absent from the ECW. According to 
interviewed staff, the primary reasons cited were the lack of donor appetite to fund these activities and the 
absence of ECD and secondary NFE curriculum. It was also highlighted that donor requirements and 
parameters can at times limit the interventions UNICEF can provide. 
xvi. 
The program has been effective in extending learning opportunities and improving learning outcomes for 
affected populations meeting or surpassing most program output and outcome targets. Overachievement 
in student participation and learning outcomes is a positive indication of the ECW program effectiveness. 
However, differences in inclusion and learning outcomes shows that vulnerable populations, particularly 
CwDs, have not been as effectively supported. Despite systematic investigation throughout primary and 
secondary data collection, no unintended effects were identified. 
xvii. 
Teachers are largely positive about the effectiveness of training and learning circles in improving teaching 
and PSS capacities. Positive changes in teaching strategies can be observed and are appreciated by 
students despite teaching practices remaining largely teacher centred as opposed to more active learning 
strategies that involve higher order thinking skills. Stipends provided to teachers, although greatly valued, 
were reported to not be adequate to meet teachers needs and approximately a third of surveyed teachers 
reporting delays in payment delivery. Many teachers interviewed mentioned that they would leave their 
current jobs if they found other opportunities with higher salaries, even if they were not in their fields. 
Space and materials to implement interactive teaching methods remain a primary challenge reported by 
teachers.  
xviii. 
Protection form Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and child protection mechanisms were in place, as 
were referral mechanisms used to refer children in need of specialized care. However, it is not clear from 
monitoring data to what extent they were followed. Findings from the teacher survey show gaps in PSS 
training, referrals for students as well as in teacher capacity to identify PSS systems. Teachers used non-
violent methods to manage classroom behaviour, with a few exceptions of corporal punishment. In 
contrast, children frequently reported parents’ use of corporal punishment.  
xix. 
While most activities were cancelled or delayed under Outcome 4: resource mobilization, a major 
achievement was the October 2023 meeting as it brought the donors together to discuss key challenges to 
implementation. This advocacy effort aimed at improving and/or clarifying the current red lines to enable 
better alignment of program activities with financial restrictions on use of funds for the renewal program. 
The meeting also facilitated coordination among donors.  
xx. 
Most outcomes and outputs targets were achieved indicating efficient use of resources despite internal and 
external factors affecting implementation. UNICEF’s establishment of standards and mechanisms, their 
flexibility in responding to changing context, and the establishment of feedback and complaints 
mechanisms and third-party monitoring (TPM) helped ensure compliance, accountability and efficiency. 
However, implementation varied across learning centres and very few accountability mechanisms were 
observed or reported to be sufficiently inclusive.  
xxi. 
As cluster lead/co-lead for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Nutrition and Education clusters, 
UNICEF was at the forefront of ensuring that assessments were rapidly undertaken to assess damage to 
learning facilities following the earthquake and ensuring that facilities would be safe for children to return. 
UNICEF worked collaboratively with partners to rapidly identify the impacts of the earthquakes on the ECW 
program and responded in a timely manner to address a range of needs which ensured minimal disruption 
to continued learning. 
xxii. 
The program showed attention to cross-cutting issues, involving a broad range of persons with acute 
humanitarian and education needs. Boys and girls were reached equitably. Inclusion of IDPs (63 per cent of 
rightsholders) demonstrates the program’s success in including marginalised groups. Currently, referral 
services are providing an essential link for CwDs to access more specialized services; it is anticipated that 
the eventual roll out of the capacity building plan would address current inconsistencies in identification and 
response.
