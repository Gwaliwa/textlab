Executive Summary 
This evaluation assessed a pilot programme for the prevention of bullying in a school setting, launched in 2014 
under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak Chairwoman of The General Women’s Union 
The Supreme Chairperson of the family Development Foundation, and President of The Supreme Council for 
Motherhood and Childhood, and as a collaboration between the UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO) and the Supreme 
Council for Motherhood & Childhood (SCMC).  The evaluation was conducted to support SCMC and UNICEF work 
on child protection in the UAE, specifically case management in schools and the establishment of links to systems 
outside schools. The programme was implemented in two phases. In the first phase, which started in 2014, the 
programme was rolled out in 14 schools in Abu Dhabi.  The second phase was implemented in 64 schools from 
2016 to 2017. The programme was expanded to 64 schools, extending from Abu Dhabi to the Northern Emirates. 
In 2018, the program was handed over to the Ministry of Education, which in turn, mainstreamed in all schools. 
The evaluation assessed the pilot programme using the criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, 
coherence, and sustainability. The evaluation identified critical lessons learnt, best practices, and key 
recommendations.  
SCMC and UNICEF GAO initiated The UAE Programme for the Prevention of Bullying in Schools, by carrying out 
a preliminary analysis of the school environment in the UAE in order to establish a framework for protection and 
safety in schools and a learning environment. The results of the school analysis showed that bullying does occur 
in schools, especially among cycle II students. Hence, there was a need to develop a bullying prevention model 
suitable for implementation in the UAE. 
Initially, more than 15 specialized programs for international best practices in Antibullying were reviewed and 3 
programs were selected and presented in a 2-day seminar organized by UNICEF GAO and SCMC in Abu Dhabi 
from 21-22 May 2014. The seminar was attended by various education, health and protection authorities and 
resulted in forming a national committee to oversee the development of a bullying prevention model suitable 
for implementation in UAE schools. During this seminar, experiences from Australia, Finland (KiVa program) and 
the United States (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) were presented, and experts shared their research/ 
school-based models to combat bullying and the methodologies, approaches used, some of their educational 
material, lessons learnt and evidence of the effectiveness of these models in their respective countries. 
Tailored and comprehensive intervention was programmed through the production of a bullying prevention 
training manual based on six methods of intervention: direct sanctions, restorative practice, mediation, support 
group, shared concern, and victim empowerment. The programme was implemented in 14 schools in Abu Dhabi 
in the first phase and expanded to 64 schools in the second phase – 28 Schools in Abu Dhabi and 36 schools in 
Dubai and the Northern Emirates.  
The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the programme’s relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence, and 
sustainability in mitigating bullying in the target schools, and thereby advise how UNICEF can best support the 
UAE and balance the government’s objectives and priorities with the UNICEF mandate. The evaluation aims to 
assess the pilot phase of the programme, gauge the programme’s accessibility with a focus on equity and gender 
equality, support the overall work on child protection in the country, and identify key lessons and best practices 
to enrich evidence-based decision-making. The evaluation’s intended primary audiences are UNICEF GAO, the SCMC, 
and the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the UAE. 
A mixed participatory approach was used in the evaluation. Following a desk review, the evaluator selected a 
sample of 12 schools involved in the programme and 2 schools outside the programme. She conducted seven 
key informant interviews and ran surveys among nine school principals, 112 parents, 62 social workers and 
School Discipline Committee members, and 1,330 students. Additionally, risk mapping was conducted with 93 
students. The evaluator presented her preliminary findings for validation.  

 
 
The evaluation yielded following findings.  
 
Relevance: The evaluation found the programme to be highly relevant to the United Arab Emirates Supreme 
Council for Motherhood and Childhood 2017–2021 Strategy and to the Ministry of Education Strategy. The 
evaluation concludes that the programme design was based on sound evidence and informed by global best 
practices. The programme design contributed to the achievement of the intended results and outcomes via 
relevant interventions, including staff training, training materials, and anti-bullying guides in Arabic and English. 
Nevertheless, the evaluator notes that the programme did not define the logical framework required for the 
programme, the programme’s theory of change, programme outcomes, an activities timeline, or monitoring 
plan.  The programme was found to be relevant to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. More specifically, 
in terms of its non-discrimination principles, the programme effectively worked to eliminate all types of 
discriminations. Children’s views and opinions were prioritised at all stages of the programme. Finally, the 
evaluation found that the programme was consistent with a human-rights-based approach from the 
perspectives of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, equality, universality, and indivisibility.  
 
Coherence: The evaluation concludes that the programme is aligned with relevant school policies and the school 
code of conduct. The programme contributed to changes in social behaviour. It promoted the mobilisation of an 
anti-bullying and violence mechanism in the pilot schools. While the programme did not offer a case 
management structure similar to that of the school code of conduct, the schools used the programme manuals, 
training materials, and pre- and post-knowledge assessments.  The evaluation found that the pilot programme 
and the MOE’s child protection and wellbeing programme complemented each other. 
 
Efficiency: The programme was drawn up and implemented by UNICEF, the SCMC, and the MOE. The MOE 
devised a national anti-bullying policy that covered all aspects of the programme. However, this pursuit of this 
policy was limited by three factors that affected the programme. First, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, lessons 
were halted, and new bullying issues emerged. Secondly, the MOE was split into two entities: the MOE and the 
Emirates Schools Establishment. It took time for the programme to be embedded at the MOE after this structural 
reform. 
 
UNICEF’s engagement with governments in the Gulf Region is different from the UNICEF work model deployed 
in many other UNICEF offices where it is fully dedicated not only to education, but also to management, 
reporting, and monitoring. Over time, this lack of involvement may limit UNICEF’s contribution to the 
programme. More needs to be done by the government to strengthen UNICEF’s engagement at local level and 
throughout the programme’s timeline in order to deepen the impact of the resulting achievements.  
  
Effectiveness: The programme reached the target group at the pilot schools on several levels. Schools drew up 
their own annual programmes. Results from the school committee questionnaire showed that the programme 
raised awareness among at least 80% of school students each year; more than 90% of school staff and social 
workers raised students’ awareness of bullying; 96.4% of them documented incidents of bullying; and 90.5% 
planned and participated in the anti-bullying week organised by the MOE. The programme made progress 
towards its planned objectives of creating a safe school environment and preventing violence and bullying in 
school. One of the programme’s milestones was the production of evidence-based anti-bullying manuals that 
are based on global best practices. It was drawn up, distributed, and used for training purposes. Results from 
student questionnaires indicated consistently lower bullying rates in the pilot schools compared to the control 
group. For example, the likelihood of students becoming victims is significantly lower in the intervention group. 
Students in the intervention group are 27.3% less likely to be called names, 41.2% less likely to get picked on by 
other students, 35.4% less likely to be made fun of, 46.8% less likely get hit by others, and 73.6% less likely to 
receive unpleasant computer, phone, and/or online messages from other students.  
 

 
 
Overall, the programme improved the school environment in each of the pilot schools to varying degrees and 
offered the whole school community a different level of understanding as regards the prevention of school 
violence and bullying. In terms of equity, the programme reached the most vulnerable children. The evaluation 
found that school staff and management systematically assess the students’ situation and offer support. Schools 
have tailored the programme to students with disabilities. With regard to students facing neglect within the 
family, although the number is not high, schools mentioned that these cases were a challenge to manage. Some 
students from lone-parent families sometimes act aggressively and their peers are unable to challenge such 
behaviour. While aspects like these are not the focus of the programme, this needs to be looked at during the 
next phase.    
 
The UAE government’s commitment to recognising and responding to bullying issues, and to engaging in 
evidence-based interventions, is a critical factor in the effectiveness of the programme. The programme also 
benefited from extensive international experience in the design phase. Schools were willing and eager to benefit 
from the training provided. The school trainer provided training on an annual basis, ensuring that the quality of 
the trainer training was high and making sure that content was available in both Arabic and English. 
 
Sustainability: The programme established strong buy-in via the training of trainers among national 
counterparts as a programme tool. The training of trainers allowed schools to lead the programme as most of 
the trainees were school principals and experienced social workers. The training of trainers was a key 
implementation mechanism. The evaluation concludes that the programme is legally and institutionally 
sustainable, with a component of financial sustainability depending on the situation playing out in the country. 
 
The evaluation suggests the following set of recommendations.  
 
1. Strengthen the service response at national level, continue programme interventions. The government is 
recommended to review and support the legal and policy framework for child protection systems. At 
national level, the Ministry of Education can partner with other ministries, civil society organisations, etc. 
Take evidence-based approaches drawing on comprehensive data and a systematic evaluation of the 
existing programmes and their impacts.  
 
2. Encourage pilot schools to continue adopting interventions under the programme. UNICEF, the SCMC, and 
the MOE should draw up a plan to ensure continuity in the support of pilot schools in their efforts to 
implement the programme. It is recommended that pilot schools’ efforts and contributions to the 
programme from 2014 to the present be acknowledged and rewarded.  
 
3. Strengthen the programme manuals. UNICEF and the SCMC should have the programme manuals reviewed 
by an expert group to update the content. More examples of situations from school life can be added so that 
school staff can easily investigate and verify cases. They should adopt up-to-date and child-friendly training 
materials and mainstream gender equality at all programme levels.  
 
4. Update  the anti-bullying materials. The materials should be updated to ensure the diversity and localisation 
of content. This can be done by adding more modules to meet emerging needs defined by the students 
participating in this study and by their parents, and ensuring the localisation of content to reflect cultural 
differences and diversity across the Emirates. 
 
5. Develop a results framework for the programme. UNICEF should provide more support to stakeholders 
from the SCMC and MOE in taking the lead with national stakeholders to develop a results agenda with clear, 
quantified targets. The programme needs to document a theory of change to identify assumptions, risks and 
bottlenecks, and develop a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework.
