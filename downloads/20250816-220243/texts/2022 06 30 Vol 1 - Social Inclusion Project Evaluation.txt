EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This report presents the independent evaluation of the Project “Social Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with 
Disabilities in the Western Balkans and Moldova” (2018-2021). The report outlines the evaluation’s background and 
approach, findings, lessons learned, conclusions and recommendations. The evaluation was conducted from 
October 2021 to June 2022. 
 
OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
 
The Project aimed to promote social inclusion in the context of early child development (ECD) policies and services, 
especially for boys and girls from ethnic minority groups such as Roma1, as well as boys and girls with 
developmental challenges and disabilities. It covered Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*2, Moldova, 
Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, at the central government level and in selected municipalities. 
Implementation of relevant national strategies in the geographic area covered by the Project has faced challenges 
due to, among others, inter-sectoral coordination, inclusiveness and quality of services, as well as inadequate 
financing of relevant social care, protection and pre-primary education (PPE) services.  
 
The Project included two outcomes. The first outcome concerned ECD support to families/parents/caregivers and 
children within the communities, including nurturing care, health services, early detection and intervention services. 
Under this outcome, the outputs dealt, firstly, with the enhancement of services to beneficiaries with regard to 
relevant policies and their implementation. This covered the development of national and sub-national policies and 
mechanisms that contribute to realization of rights; accompanying enhancement of knowledge and skills of service 
providers; increased support to the availability of the innovative services for children and parents/caregivers; 
expansion of the early child intervention services and building of the awareness on the importance of child 
development among parents/caregivers. The second outcome focused on development of PPE in targeted areas, 
with one output on capacity building of the relevant professionals.  
 
The Project was funded by Austrian Development Agency (ADA), with matching UNICEF funding. The total Project 
budget stood at 2,513,160 EUR, with ADA contribution totalling 1,799,999 EUR and UNICEF contributing 713,117 
EUR. 
 
EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND INTENDED AUDIENCE 
 
The overall purpose of the evaluation is to inform the evaluation users about the achievements of the Project, 
contributing and adverse factors, and lessons learned, which support accountability and evidence-based decision 
making. The chosen approach was therefore mostly summative, creating understanding of the effects of the Project 
and ensuring accountability for resources and results. It had a secondary formative element to promote 
organisational learning based on the impact of the Project on the direct/immediate and end beneficiaries (when 
possible). When taken together, these two aspects should support organisational learning and informed decision 
making concerning the Project follow up.  
 
The evaluation provides an independent assessment of the performance of the Project in relation to expected 
results, offers actionable recommendations for UNICEF for improving its work at country3 and regional levels, and 
for enhancing the sustainability of the attained changes. It also identifies lessons learned, good practices and 
innovative approaches, which may serve UNICEF and actors working toward improving ECD systems which are 
inclusive of vulnerable children, including Roma children and children with disabilities.

UNICEF ECARO and relevant Country Offices (COs), and the donor agency ADA are considered as the primary 
users of the evaluation. Relevant government decision makers, civil society organizations (CSOs), implementing 
partners, other United Nations Agencies working in related fields, and pertinent rights-holders are its secondary 
users. Overall, the evaluation report and management response are intended to be public, thus fulfilling UNICEF’s 
commitment to transparency and accountability. 
 
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 
 
This evaluation applies a theory-based approach: it tests the validity of the Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) against 
its implementation. At each level of the ToC, the evaluation first determined whether the envisaged change took 
place and whether the assumptions underlying the theory were realized. Then, contribution analysis was used to 
check the plausibility and, wherever possible, the extent of the Project’s contribution to these changes.  
 
After the initial analysis of the original Project ToC, certain structural shortfalls were identified.  Subsequently, the 
evaluation team reconstructed the ToC, in consultation with UNICEF, and assigned the underlying assumptions to 
its appropriate levels, so that the resulting format became more usable for the evaluation purpose. 
 
The evaluation framework was based on the OECD/DAC criteria of relevance, effectiveness, impact, 
sustainability, and coherence. These criteria were translated into evaluation questions and adapted to the ToC-
based evaluation format. Together with sub-questions, these formed the evaluation matrix.  
 
Primary data collection included 73 interviews with UNICEF staff, donor and other international partners, CSOs, 
national duty bearers in relevant ministries/agencies, staff/service providers in sampled municipalities, and 
parents/caregivers. The evaluation team also undertook a comprehensive review of UNICEF publications, and of 
the Project’s documentation, reports, and documentary products. The evaluation team further collected secondary 
documentary data, such as third-party publications.  The evaluation made two “deep dive” analyses of the changes 
triggered by the Project, respectively in Kosovo* and North Macedonia.   
 
Owing to the restrictions linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluation activities were carried out remotely, online. 
This presented certain challenges in accessing interviewees and duty-bearers in “deep dive” countries, since these 
were engaged as frontline personnel in addressing the pandemic. The limitations affected the depth of collected 
data, but the evaluation modality was adjusted, with most interviewees contacted online. 
 
KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
The evaluation found that through this Project, UNICEF managed to effectively leverage its evidence-based 
knowledge, skills and long-term presence in the field. UNICEF applied their knowledge of the local contexts and 
situation analyses to the Project design, and to address the needs of the duty bearers and CSOs working on ECD. 
All the while, the Project maintained the capacity to adjust the interventions, by drawing on close communication 
with stakeholders. 
 
The prior, close partnerships of UNICEF with national stakeholders meant that the national policy, legislative and 
regulatory frameworks already echoed the UNICEF approach to inclusive ECD, and/or increasingly did so through 
Project implementation. This mutually re-enforcing relationship between the UNICEF approach and national 
normative frameworks made the Project-related interventions highly relevant. It is also in line with the systems 
approach promoted by UNICEF, which prioritizes the strengthening of country-level inclusive systems that respond 
to the needs of every rights holder – and indeed every child.  
 
The systems approach was compatible with the donor-driven focus on specific groups of children (Roma children 

8 
 
and children with disabilities)4, but not always fully aligned. In certain national contexts – contrary to the assumptions 
– it was assessed that the vulnerability of the targeted groups, while valid, was not always the most in need 
compared to that of other groups. It was sometimes difficult for duty bearers to understand this prioritization. Yet, 
the evaluation found that UNICEF addressed and resolved this problem through engagement with the donor and 
subsequent programmatic adjustments to cover other vulnerable groups and continue the Project relevancy to 
stakeholders’ needs. 
 
The evaluation assessed the extent to which the Project was able to consider the different situations of men/boys 
and women/girls in relation to ECD and inclusion of the target groups. The evaluation found that the Project activities 
indeed focused on gender transformative results, both when training ECD professionals, and when reaching out to 
a gender-balanced range of beneficiaries. However, the Project documents and reports did not explicitly link the 
design of these activities with the gender analysis performed by UNICEF as a part of its country programming cycle. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the Project’s implementation. Firstly, the modality of in-person 
interaction, which is the essence of the modelled services (PPE services, home visiting, health services, direct 
support and guidance to parents/caregivers, early identification, and intervention services for the most vulnerable 
children at home) was no longer viable. In addition, many of the Project’s national partners were at the frontlines of 
pandemic response. Despite these unprecedented challenges, all Project partners maintained their engagement 
and helped the Project adapt to the exigencies imposed by the pandemic. UNICEF staff also performed effectively 
in ensuring transition to new, online implementation modalities – especially in education and training – by working 
in close partnership with implementing CSOs, national authorities, and service providers at municipal or community 
levels. The flexibility shown by the donor in accepting some unavoidable delays made such adaptation possible. 
 
The Project contributed substantially to the realization of expected changes in the national policies and legal 
frameworks of the respective countries. This is especially apparent when it comes to promoting a holistic approach 
to ECD (integrating health, social care/protection, and child-centered PPE). These elements have become more 
deeply embedded in the policies and legal acts recently adopted in the countries. That said, the implementation of 
better ECD policy and legislation, their funding, and their translation into institutionalized practice, are still a work in 
progress. 
 
The effectiveness of the Project has been documented through its role in strengthening networked ECD 
practitioners who share a common commitment and have compatible skills and vision for ECD in their respective 
fields of work. Training, networking, and adjustment of both formal and informal institutional arrangements around 
the newly acquired skills of the professionals have enabled the Project to model health, social care, child protection 
and PPE services to the rights holders, including in remote areas. The practitioners and parents/caregivers that 
were interviewed reported that certain changes of attitudes are taking place, and that the trained professionals 
increasingly use the skills promoted through the Project. Quantitatively, the Project has reached all, and exceeded 
several, of its targets in terms of the number of beneficiaries reached. 
 
The evaluation found that the Project’s monitoring was strong, but disproportionally burdensome, when considering 
the Project’s budget, broken down by year and country. The Project’s targets, which were exclusively quantitative, 
did not lend themselves to qualitative analysis of processes and trends: this is regrettable in the context of a systems 
approach, which works on the establishment of long-term institutional process and behavioural changes. In addition, 
despite UNICEF’s efforts to collect baseline and monitor quantitative data (in particular with the Multi-Indicator 
Cluster Surveys), the Project faced weaknesses in the national administrative data. Even though the Project helped 
mitigate some of these shortcomings, – by, for example, establishing a national registry of children with disabilities 
in Serbia and by elaborating data collection tools – this has not been the Project’s primary intended purpose, and 
the financial and capacity resources were insufficient for resolving the problem. Finally, the Project ToC placed 
expectations of changes disproportionately high compared to the budget and duration of the Project, and it did not 
identify internal and external assumptions at each level of change, which created overly ambitious reporting 
demands. 
 
4 This targeted approach stems from the high priority placed by ADA as a part of its strategic objectives, to poverty reduction 
(https://www.entwicklung.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/Publikationen/Leitlinien/Englisch/PD_Poverty_reduction_Dec2009_EN.pdf)  
and gender (https://www.entwicklung.at/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/Publikationen/Leitlinien/Englisch/PD_Gender_2017_EN.pdf).

Looking at impact, overall, the Project made inroads towards inclusive ECD, especially when compared to its 
timeline and resources. The institutions engaged in the Project have advanced significantly towards expanding 
coverage and access to ECD, specifically social care/protection, health and PPE services in pilot municipalities 
even though the COVID-19 pandemic and limited human resources have dampened the prospects of making such 
transformation systemic. By continuing to strengthen partnerships with key institutions, the Project contributed 
meaningfully to the duty bearers’ awareness of the ECD needs, gaps and opportunities which has improved policy 
and affected the quality of services. The parents/caregivers who did access the modelled services self-report 
changed attitudes towards their children, towards services, and towards their own role. These successes are largely 
attributable to the personal commitment of change champions at national and local levels, connection with whom 
UNICEF continues to nurture. The Project’s choice to strengthen and improve existing services, rather than to 
create new ones (with a few exceptions), was conducive to secure the necessary public funding. Yet, as the 
interviews attest, the duty bearers are reaching the limits of what can be improved within the available human 
resources. 
 
The evaluation found that UNICEF is the right partner for this Project and has leveraged its strengths to achieve 
results. The intervention was conceived as a part of the long-term engagement of UNICEF for the realisation of 
ECD standards and approach and thus remained fundamentally coherent with UNICEF’s strategy. By optimizing its 
key comparative advantages – presence in the field, expertise of its staff, quality of its evidence generation– the 
Project has achieved considerable success with relatively limited resources. The process of the Project helped 
further diversify the existing long-term partnerships cultivated by UNICEF at national and local levels, which were 
in turn used to expand the generation and application of knowledge.  
 
In several countries, UNICEF also acted as a “convener”. The breadth and depth of the changes observed goes 
beyond the Project: it is also attributable to the existing partnerships and accrued reputation of UNICEF in the field, 
and to the action of other donor and international partners who complemented or followed on UNICEF’s action. 
Because of its long-term, professional cooperation with CSOs and duty bearers who work on ECD at both national 
and local levels, and because of its wealth of evidence-based knowledge and guidance, UNICEF was able to 
convene the relevant stakeholders and act as a trusted adviser. Matching funds from other donors helped expand 
and magnify the impact of the Project results.  
 
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
1. ADA would better optimise future investments into UNICEF projects by allowing UNICEF ECARO programmes 
(such as ECD) to develop full-fledged theories of change at a realistic level for future complex projects, as this 
would increase the feasibility and tailoring of future projects.   
 
2. UNICEF ECARO should continue to advocate to donors and, when successful, support countries to systematize 
early detection, early intervention services and standard-based functional assessments.  
 
3. UNICEF ECARO should strengthen, expand and sustain multidisciplinary networks of ECD professionals at 
national and regional levels. 
 
4. UNICEF ECARO should build tools to monitor attitude, behavioural and practice changes among trained 
practitioners. 
 
5. UNICEF ECARO should continue providing policy guidance to country offices on systematically promoting job 
descriptions and internal regulations of ECD duty bearers based on the products already elaborated. 
 
6. For future complex projects, UNICEF ECARO should develop basic information products/documents for 
communication purposes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This report presents the results of the evaluation of the Project “Social Inclusion of Roma Children and Children with 
Disabilities in the Western Balkans and Moldova” (2018-2021). This Project was funded by the Austrian Development 
Agency (ADA) (1.8 million EUR) jointly with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) (0.7 million EUR) for a total 
budget of 2.5 million EUR. It was implemented by UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO) and 
seven Country Offices (COs) in the region: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*5, Moldova, Montenegro, North 
Macedonia, and Serbia. 
The purpose of this report is to communicate the findings, conclusions and recommendations derived from an 
independent, theory-based evaluation of the Project. The evaluation is both summative, presenting how the Theory of 
Change (ToC) resulted in outputs, outcomes and impact through the reference period, and formative, demonstrating 
what dynamics enabled the results to ultimately contribute to long-term impact, and how future follow-up activities 
could be framed. The report includes evidence-based lessons learned and recommendations for UNICEF and ADA. 
The evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO), and managed by 
the UNICEF ECARO Evaluation team, with inputs from the Early Child Development (ECD) team.  
The evaluation team was comprised of: 
• 
Ms. Camille Massey, International Consultant/Team Leader 
• 
Ms. Blerta Perolli-Shehu, Evaluation Specialist 
• 
Mr. Zarko Sunderic, Evaluation Specialist. 
 
The evaluation process followed three phases: 
• 
Inception: review of initial documentation, elaboration of the methodology, identification of stakeholders, 
consultations and one workshop with UNICEF ECD team and COs, development of Inception Report; 
• 
Data collection and field work: remote data collection, 73 interviews (including 63 women and 10 men), 
review of the documentation, consultations with key UNICEF RO and CO stakeholders on preliminary 
findings; 
• 
Data analysis and reporting: analysis of interview notes, analysis of documentation, report drafting, remote 
consultation with key stakeholders, and finalisation of the Evaluation Report. 
 
The evaluation process started on 10 October 2021, and ended in June 2022, as per the agreed timeline.  
 
The interviews and consultations, as well as the validation of findings recommendations were done remotely, as 
per standard COVID-19 prevention measures.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Context  
Social Inclusion 
Western Balkan countries and Moldova have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC), the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. All the countries6 are committed to the

The adjunction of the asterisk is intended as a reminder of this proviso.  
6 The word ‘countries’ in this report is used to refer to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia and 
Serbia. For Kosovo this should be understood strictly in the context of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999). 

11 
 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Agenda and have in place a robust framework of policies, legislative 
frameworks and national strategies with regard to social inclusion, and protection of the human rights of women 
and children as well as vulnerable populations, such as ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. Yet, annual 
progress reports of the European Commission point to weaknesses in ensuring realization of fundamental rights of 
Roma7 and people/children with disability across Moldova and Western Balkans region. Roma has continued to 
face discrimination, harassment and hate crime because of their ethnic origin, as underlined by the recent report 
from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.8 Further, the rights of persons with disabilities, including 
their transition to community-based care and independent living, need to be effectively protected in line with the 
requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
 
The Project document outlines particular barriers in social inclusion of the most vulnerable since services provided 
tend to be concentrated, both in quality and quantity, in urban areas and outreach to rural areas is weak; the quality 
of universal or primary level services is low; the capacities of service providers are limited, new services around 
early intervention and disability prevention are missing and parents/caregivers` involvement as well as involvement 
of community-based and civil society organizations as potential partners in  advocacy and service provision 
represents another challenge.  
 
While countries have made progress in revising national legislation and policies, the institutional capacities for 
implementation remain weak. The biggest challenge is the predominant medical approach, i.e., “curing” a disability, 
as opposed to the social approach which builds on the strengths of the individual and ensures that their 
environments are supportive and enabling rather than restrictive.  
 
According to UNICEF ECARO, the European Union (EU) accession is a cornerstone influencing factor for the 
Project countries, which have been investing efforts to harmonize policies and legislation to meet European 
standards. However, a sizeable number of children are socially excluded and face risks and deprivations, which 
limit their ability to reach their full potential.  
 
Boys and girls from ethnic minority groups such as Roma, as well as boys and girls with developmental challenges 
and disabilities suffer disproportionately from poverty, poor access to services and social benefits, exclusion, and 
discrimination; they more often suffer from violence, separation from their families and placement in residential care 
institutions or special schools. Social and gender norms negatively impact the social inclusion of vulnerable children, 
and additionally hamper and limit Roma girls’ participation in education on account of several reasons, including 
early marriage.9  
 
The situation of the Project’s target groups with regard to social inclusion and in the context of ECD at the onset of 
the Project constituted the baseline against which change will be assessed by this evaluation. According to the 
Project document,10 while the situation varied from one country to another, at the launch of the Project, the countries 
covered could be characterized as having slow implementation of reforms, especially the implementation of key 
national strategies, poor inter-sectoral coordination and quality of services, as well as inadequate financing of social 
services. 
Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
The impact of COVID-19, according to UNICEF sources11, in Europe and Central Asia went beyond health risks, 
especially for children from poor families, ethnic minorities and children with disabilities, who have been 
disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access to essential and support services increased 
as was the isolation and stigmatization of children with disabilities and children from minority communities.
