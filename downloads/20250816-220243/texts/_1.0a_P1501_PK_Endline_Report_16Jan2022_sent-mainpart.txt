Executive Summary
According to 2020 data, every ﬁfth person of Pakistan’s 220 million plus population is in the 10-19 age group. These
adolescents face several of the most demanding challenges in South Asia. The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey
2017-18 showed that, on average, 3.6% of 20- to 24-year-old women were married by the age of 15, and 18.3% by the
age of 18 (National Institute of Population Studies 2018). With only every third woman having access to contraceptives
in 2019, early childbirth follows early marriages. In 2019, on average, 38 out of 1,000 girls of age 15-19 were reported
to have given birth. This is close to the average in South Asia (not considering high-income countries), with only
Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal reporting higher rates (World Bank Open Data 2021).
One of the implications of early marriages and pregnancies is early school drop-out. Compulsory education is 10
years in Pakistan, yet only 52.4% of boys and 46.3% of girls completed lower secondary education in the relevant age
group in 2019. Only Afghanistan displays lower levels in South Asia and has a worse gender gap. Not surprisingly,
eventually only every ﬁfth woman (20.1%) participated in the labor force in 2019, which is the lowest rate in South Asia
(Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2020).
Against this background, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) program “Improving Adolescent Lives
in Pakistan (IALP)” aimed to reduce child marriage rates, decrease the number of early pregnancies, and increase
school attendance. The program aimed to empower adolescents to become “agents of change” for themselves and their
communities, while voicing their rights and needs. The IALP program operated in villages of two districts each of
Punjab and Sindh provinces: Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Ghotki, and Khairpur. The program focused on three
groups: Adolescents, families, and community representatives, as well as public authorities.
Scope of the Program
The Improving Adolescent Lives in Pakistan (IALP) program intended to bring change through its two interventions,
a Child Protection intervention and an educational intervention, which addressed two diﬀerent mechanisms, broadly
deﬁned as (1) a change in knowledge about rights and gender roles, as well as (2) education. 446 rural communities
were selected for Child Protection (CP) activities, including dialogues, workshops, and street theaters. Following a
set of workshops, selected adolescents were expected to become group leaders (“adolescent champions”) and conduct
peer-learning workshops and meetings by themselves with assistance from a social worker.
Additionally, in 100
rural communities of Sindh with poor educational outcomes, new Non-Formal Basic Education (NFBE) Centers were
established. The Non-Formal Basic Education (NFBE) and village education committee component was implemented
to provide non-formal education to out-of-school adolescents, that is, children who have never been enrolled, who
have dropped out, or who were at the risk of dropping out. The second group that the program targeted included
families, communities and local decision-makers, providing them with knowledge about adolescents’ rights and how to
protect and advocate in their favor. Finally, for the same purpose and with similar activities, the program also involved
public authorities and service providers. It addressed children’s rights and communication skills by providing access
to relevant knowledge, skills, and services. In a key innovation, the program also encouraged boys and men to question
institutional practices and social norms.
Although the baseline survey took place in 2015, preparatory work and recruitment of implementing partners delayed
implementation. Program implementation was most intense between end-2017 and December 2019. Throughout
implementation, UNICEF reported that they reached over 12.5 million people, directly and indirectly through program
activities and social mobilization.
About the Evaluation
Given the limited and mixed causal evidence on the impacts of empowerment programs aiming to change gender norms
and reduce child marriage (without additional monetary incentives), rigorous causal evidence on innovative approaches
to design, combine, and improve empowerment programs is needed. Evaluation insights can help ﬁll the evidence gap
and support policy makers as well as UNICEF and the IKEA Foundation to strengthen future programs and inform
policy advocacy.
This evaluation aims to identify the causal impact of the IALP program as a whole, and to learn about selected
potential mechanisms of change. A related objective is to examine the cost eﬀectiveness of the program.
The evaluation was designed as a cluster Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with 446 of 653 revenue villages
randomly assigned to the program group and 207 to the control (no treatment) group, following a baseline survey in

2
2015. Cross randomization helps to compare diﬀerent program components across the program areas. Hereby, the
proportion between the genders mobilized in a village was experimentally varied. In 141 of the 446 villages more female
participants were mobilized, while more male participants were mobilized in 129 of the villages. In the remaining 176
villages there was no gender-speciﬁc mobilization for the Child Protection activities. The establishment of alternative,
non-formal basic education centers was cross-randomized to the Child Protection activities in a subset of 100 villages.
The endline quantitative and qualitative data collection was conducted in late 2020 and ended in August 2021. 7,415
eligible adolescents, parents of adolescents, community leaders and key service providers were interviewed in program
and control areas to share their knowledge and experiences on the topics of interest to the program.
In the analysis of this rich set of information, the key evaluation questions are:
1. Did the IALP program inﬂuence attitudes and social norms and reduce child marriage rates, decrease the number
of early pregnancies, and increase school enrollment for adolescents as aimed?
2. How eﬀective were the Child Protection and NFBE components of the IALP program, as standalone interventions
and when combined?
3. How eﬀective was the approach of targeting men and boys to achieve the program’s goals?
Additionally, 16 qualitative key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with stakeholders of the IALP program as part
of the qualitative data collection. These included UNICEF and government oﬃcials, as well as staﬀof the implementing
partners from both provinces. KIIs provided additional insight into the experience of key informants with designing and
implementing IALP program activities. Hereby the focus was on the challenges faced during implementation, perceived
consequences of the IALP program, and recommendations of stakeholders for future programming.
Findings and Implications
The evaluation shows that the IALP program has a statistically signiﬁcant positive impact on child marriage reduction.
Compared to the control group, the overall IALP program reduces child marriage for the relevant age group (10-17) by
33% for the full sample and 50% for girls (with the average child marriage prevalence in the control areas being 0.9%
for the full and 1.4% for the girls sample, respectively). For adolescents age 15-17, the overall IALP eﬀect is a reduction
by 42% for the full sample and 51% for girls. These eﬀects are sizable given the low average prevalence in the control
areas of 1.9% for the full sample and of 3.3% for girls only, i.e., the outcomes for the group of people who had not
been assigned to the program. When restricting the sample to the NFBE-eligible sample of villages, the reported child
marriage prevalence is higher, and, as expected, program impacts are positive and even slightly higher. Overall, the
IALP program has a positive impact on child marriage reduction relative to the low level of child marriage captured in
the surveys, with the program eﬀects being higher for girls. Given sample size restrictions, however, no statistically
signiﬁcant and meaningful result can be captured for changes in child pregnancy rates.
Moreover, the IALP program increases self-reported engagement rates for boys age 10-17, while their marriage rates
do not change. Accordingly, it increases the (indirectly) reported likelihood that boys (age 11-16) will be married next
year. The evidence on changes in engagement and delay of marriage indicates a postponement in line with the original
program expectations. Finally, adolescents in the NFBE areas of the IALP program report that the dowry amount paid by
their families reduces.
The evaluation randomly sampled children who were eligible for non-formal basic education in program and
comparison areas.
Based on the comparison of the two groups, it ﬁnds an increased attendance of non-formal
educational institutions, which further implies an improvement in selected learning outcomes for the population eligible
for NFBE relative to the control group. When comparing learning outcomes of NFBE eligible children to comparable
children in NFBE non-eligible areas, the evaluation ﬁnds positive impacts on reading skills, with the eﬀects being mainly
driven by improved outcomes amongst male respondents. Moreover, children residing in areas where the two program
components (Child Protection and NFBE) were jointly implemented are not only more likely to attend the non-formal
education centers, but also less likely to miss school, and more likely to want to continue with secondary education.
The eﬀects here are particularly strong for girls. A higher uptake of non-formal education may have a direct eﬀect on
attendance of formal educational institutions. The data reveals potential evidence of crowding-out eﬀects from formal
education, as female household members (age 11-23) are reportedly less likely to attend primary and male household
members (age 11-23) secondary education due to the program. This eﬀect is particularly strong in NFBE-eligible villages,
where the Child Protection program targeted primarily girls. Moreover, potentially because these informal school forms

3
had not mixed genders in class while formal schools did, the results show selective evidence for a program-induced
change in the preference that girls and boys should be educated separately.
To understand the potential underlying drivers of change, the evaluation looks at changes in perceptions, attitudes,
actions and interactions of adolescents themselves as well as of the key local stakeholders and service providers
surrounding them. While patterns in the intergenerational dialogue do not change, the results indicate an increase of
interaction between adolescents. Girls’ incidence of intragenerational dialogues among adolescents increases. Selective
evidence reﬂects an increase in communication amongst adolescents regarding their fears and emotions, as well as the
likelihood that girls talk to their brother about their future marriage. Moreover, especially where girls were targeted by
the program, the results indicate an increase of girls’ average score on the interpersonal communication competence
scale, reﬂecting positive impact on girls’ communication skills.
In terms of empowerment, especially male respondents in areas where the two program components were jointly
implemented (Child Protection (CP) and NFBE) have a higher likelihood to report that they were reached on topics related
to “child rights and entitlements”. Due to the program, male adolescents do reportedly feel more conﬁdent in their
interactions with key stakeholders. Eventually, the program also reduces the acceptance of using corporal punishment
on children and leads to a decrease in the experience of corporal punishment by adolescents. Male respondents are, for
instance, less likely to accept the usage of corporal punishment on daughters when they discuss their marriage timing.
However, scope for improvement remains: Adolescents and parents of adolescents in program areas are no more likely
to report that the adolescents’ conﬁdence in day-to-day situations changes when being compared to control areas. And
adolescents, especially girls, still feel uncomfortable performing a set of daily tasks by themselves both in program and
control areas. Accordingly, there is no reported evidence on changes in self-eﬃcacy or on changes in actions taken to
ensure adherence to adolescent rights in the last year. Eventually, the evaluation results also show a small but negative
impact on the reported wellbeing of female adolescents over the last two weeks (before the endline survey), which
may be due to the program or the end of it. The eﬀect may be linked to girls feeling left behind after the program
ended, as indicated in qualitative interviews, suggesting the need for further programming and engagement. Future
implementation would beneﬁt from stronger monitoring and a midline evaluation to identify potential negative eﬀects
early on during implementation. Given that the evaluation came about a year after the program ended, future research
can help to better unpack the causes of these negative eﬀects.
Targeting men and boys pays oﬀ. Findings indicate that the IALP program reduces agreement with the statement
that it is OK for parents to marry sons before the age of 18 and reduces agreement to marry girls before the age of 16 in
program areas, especially among males. This change may translate to diﬀerent marriage outcomes in future. However,
with every second person accepting marriages of girls before the age of 18, and every third person before the age of
16, there is much room for improvement and additional programming. The importance of engaging men, who may
facilitate participation of women and girls, is also stressed in qualitative interviews.
The evaluation captures no general improvement in the overall situation with respect to the provision and access
of adolescent-friendly services when comparing program and control areas. However, an improvement in access to
non-formal educational services and a moderately better provision of marriage services as reported by the marriage
registrars in the villages can be constituted.
Notably, despite being implemented over a relatively short period given the challenges at hand, the program manages
to change attitudes and behaviors towards the expected and desired direction, including a reduction in child marriage, an
increase in peer dialogues, and changes in attitudes towards marriage age and adolescents in general. To change deeply
rooted social norms and traditions and to improve the magnitude of eﬀects, a longer, more intense implementation
period with greater outreach is recommended. Given a large number of beneﬁciaries who were reportedly indirectly
engaged through social outreach activities such as street theater, a higher number of directly targeted individuals would
have been important. In fact, the overall ﬁndings suggests only limited scope of direct program uptake, reducing
the ability to capture greater impacts. This is less of a concern in Sindh, where greater uptake of the program is
correlated with higher impacts. The involvement of men and boys when addressing topics related to child marriage
is recommended. No recommendation is made on whether the educational or the Child Protection activities were
more successful in reaching better outcomes, while in some instances the joint implementation of both approaches
was reportedly helpful. Moreover, central institutions such as marriage registrars would need to be more intensively
and directly targeted to ensure adherence to laws and a change in attitudes towards child marriages and its negative
consequences. In this regard, the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative results points to converging insights.
Moreover, the importance of community engagement and a careful consideration of sustainability of the intervention
was felt to be of great importance by key informants. Last but not least, apart from the impacts the program was able
to generate, the evaluation reveals high levels of adolescents’ overall vulnerability (in program and control areas) and

4
thus the need to continue exploring impactful approaches to address these needs. This relates, for instance, to high level
of drop-outs, corporal punishments, low levels of conﬁdence and self-eﬃcacy, as well as high levels of inegalitarian
views.
A cost beneﬁt analysis reveals that, under the assumptions of analysis, beneﬁts of the IALP program largely cover
its costs. The beneﬁt-to-cost ratio is close to 1, i.e., costs exceed beneﬁts only to a small extent. Hereby, the result
constitutes only a lower bound since not all beneﬁts were monetized and further positive changes can be expected given
changes in attitudes and potential long-term eﬀects.

General Information
Funding Research presented in this evaluation has been commissioned by United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
Regional Oﬃce for South Asia through the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, Inc. (3ie), with funding of the
IKEA Foundation. Program implementation was managed by UNICEF Pakistan. The views expressed in this report are
not necessarily those of UNICEF, 3ie (Thematic Window 12) or its members. This impact evaluation has been submitted
to 3ie in fulﬁllment of requirements under grant TW12.1009 issued under TW 12 Improving Adolescents’ Lives program.
Researchers and their Role The authors of the evaluation are Alexandra Avdeenko (corresponding author) and Markus
Frölich.1 The views and opinions expressed are those of the authors’ and do not necessarily reﬂect the oﬃcial policy
or position of UNICEF or 3ie. All content is the sole responsibility of the authors and does not represent the opinions
of 3ie, its donors or its board of commissioners. Any errors and omissions are the sole responsibility of the authors.
All aﬃliations of the authors listed in the title page are those that were in eﬀect at the time the report was accepted.

Finally, the researchers had no direct decision-making power over whether and how to implement the program.
Quality Assurance The 3ie technical quality assurance team comprises Sayak Khatua, an anonymous external impact
evaluation design expert reviewer and an anonymous external sector expert reviewer, with overall technical supervision
by Sebastian Martinez.
Researcher Independence and Financial Conﬂicts of Interest No contractual limitations existed on the ability of the
researchers to report the results of the evaluation. The researchers have no ﬁnancial conﬂicts of interest with regard to
the results of the research. The researchers’ contract for this evaluation was with 3ie.
Scope The impact evaluation of the Improving Adolescent Lives in Pakistan (IALP) programme is part of a larger
package of impact evaluations covering the IAL program in three countries (Afghanistan, India and Pakistan). The
Terms of Reference (ToR) for the assignment covered all these evaluations as well as other M&E services. The Pakistan
evaluation included a baseline survey conducted in 2015 and an endline impact evaluation drawing on endline survey
data collected in 2020-2021. The endline impact evaluation scope of work was reviewed and adjusted in the ﬁrst quarter
of 2020 and adjusted again in October 2020 to adapt the workplan and design to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
The pre-analysis plan agreed in October 2020 deﬁnes the scope of work and design of this impact evaluation. The
pre-analysis plan is available for consultation.
Evaluation Process The original Terms of Reference (TOR) was between 3ie and UNICEF, and between 3ie and Uni-
versity of Mannheim/ C4ED, with several rounds of extension mostly due to COVID-19 related delays in the endline
survey timing. A Pre-analysis Plans (PAPs) was developed over time and documented the changes. The ﬁnal version
is publicly available under AEARCTR-0006438 at the American Economic Association website. The original TOR is
available upon request.2 Despite contractual extensions, the content of the TOR did not change over time.
Timeline 3ie’s call for proposal was issued on February 26th, 2015. The baseline data collection spanned from June
2015 (piloting) to January 2016 (full survey). The assignment into the program vs. control group was performed in
winter 2016 for the CP activities and summer 2017 for the NFBE activities (cross-randomized). The Program implemen-
tation took place between summer 2017 and winter 2019, both program components started after the respective program
assignment plan. The implementation was conducted by three local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), including
a change in implementing partners in Punjab. The prioritization of non-formal basic education (over an original focus
on secondary school education) was introduced over the course of the program. The endline data collection oﬃcially
began on December 15th 2020 (ﬁrst registered interviews) and ended on August 15th, 2021. Originally, the endline
data collection was planned for January 2020, the diﬀerence in timing being caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19
pandemic. The qualitative interviews were conducted between February 2021 and June 2021. The ﬁrst draft of the ﬁnal
