EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Summary 
1. This report consolidates the findings of the Summative Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the education 
sector in Angola, implemented by the Angolan Central Office (ACO) between 2015 and 2019. 
2. In accordance with the Terms of Reference, this evaluation aims to “assess the contribution of the Education 
Programme in improving institutional capability and the provision of services in the education sector in the 
country, at the national and subnational levels, based on international standards and norms of education 
assessment, through approaches in relation to gender, equity and children rights, while also considering 
political, social, economic, and institutional challenges, limitations and opportunities, etc." 
3. The evaluation examines, on one side, the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of UNICEF 
interventions in the context of the development of the education sector and, on the other, the coherence, 
coverage and coordination of interventions in the emergency context. 
4. The total budget for the Education Programme was 7.431.270,28 USD and the total expenditure for its 
implementation was 7.859.649,38 USD. This budget was part of a larger budget for the 2015-2019 Country 
Program of Cooperation (CPC). 
 
Purposes and Objectives 
5. The purpose of this evaluation is to a) analyse the contribution of the ACO Education Programme to the 
improvement of institutional capability and the provision of services in the education sector in the country, 
within the scope of the 2015-2019 CPC; and b) provide knowledge to support the operationalization of the 
activities already planned in the 2020-2022 CPC for the education sector. 
6. To conduct this analysis, the evaluation team used the evaluation criteria and evaluation questions as 
defined in the Terms of Reference (ToR) for this project, revised during the preparation of the Inception Report 
(IR). 
7. Five specific objectives were defined for this evaluation: 
• 
To critically analyse the performance of the ACO Education Programme in terms of relevance, 
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability in development contexts, and in terms of coherence, 
coverage and coordination in emergency contexts during the 2015-2019 country program; 
• 
To provide evidence on the achievements of predicted or unforeseen results at the national and 
subnational levels, and on the main factors that facilitated or limited these achievements; 
• 
To conduct a critical review of the Theory of Change (ToC) reconstructed for the 2015-2019 CPC and 
the deviations that occurred during this period, identifying the role of gender, equity and children 
rights approaches in the design and implementation; 
• 
To identify the key components of the current cooperation cycle, which can be expanded in the new 
cycle, considering the focus on integrated, decentralized approaches that prioritize early childhood 
education, girls' education and information management; 
• 
To recommend evidence-based results and conclusions about the contribution of the Education 
Programme to the country's education system and services, as well as recommendations for the new 
cycle of cooperation. 
 
Target audience 
8. This assessment was commissioned by UNICEF’s Angola Country Office. In general, the audience for this 
assessment mainly includes UNICEF teams, both at the national level (Education Section, Management 
Section) and at the regional level (Regional Office sections). However, considering that the Angolan Ministry 
of Education (MED) was the main and major partner and direct beneficiary of the Programme's contributions, 

 
 
 
 
ii 
 
there is an understanding that the key management teams of the Ministry of Education are part of the target 
audience, as well as the Provincial Education Offices. 
Approaches and Criteria 
9. This assessment was carried out using a participatory approach using mixed methods of data collection and 
analysis. 
10. Through a qualitative approach, the evaluation team analysed legislation, official documents of the 
Government of Angola (GoA), official documents for planning and monitoring the progress of the 
Programme, administrative records and consultancy reports from the Programme and partners. The 
provinces of Bié, Cunene and Huíla were selected for the fieldwork, where a total of 77 semi-structured 
individual and group interviews were conducted. 
11. As part of it quantitative approach, the evaluation team had access to the Result Assessment Module (RAM) 
reports, aggregated budget data, as well as the quantitative information from the Country Office Annual 
Reports (COAR). Secondary data and statistics that make up the evaluation matrix were also requested from 
different departments of the Ministry of Education (detailed in the "Approaches and methods" section of this 
report). 
12. In line with the ToR, the criteria used in this evaluation correspond to a subset of those proposed by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD - 
DAC) and adopted by the UNICEF Evaluation Office. Based on these guidelines, and as already mentioned in 
paragraph 3, the adopted criteria to analyse the development context were relevance, effectiveness, 
efficiency and sustainability; and in the emergency context, the criteria of coherence, coverage and 
coordination. 
Main findings 
13. In general, UNICEF's contribution to the education sector in Angola was guided by national priorities defined 
in national regulations, and sought to act within the scope of the main difficulties evidenced by national 
statistics. The Cooperation activities were adjusted when necessary to meet national and subnational 
emergencies and needs, and were implemented in coordination with the government, seeking 
complementarity in actions. These adjustments, however, were not disruptive, and it was possible to draw a 
consistent inferred ToC over time.  The institutional performance of the MED was strengthened, particularly 
from the activities of the management pillar characterized by training and support for the 
professionalization of national and local managers. 
14. Within the development context, the Programme's interventions analysed were relevance, effectiveness, 
efficiency and sustainability. 
15. Relevance: the evidence collected allows us to state that the Education Programme for the 2015-2019 period 
was relevant for the education sector in Angola. Cooperation themes were aligned with national needs and 
government priorities, and the cooperation focused on central national policies, through advocacy activities 
and technical support, allowing the Education Programme to contribute to the structuring of the national 
education policy in a comprehensive and strategic way. On the other hand, the economic crisis that the 
country faced and continues to face, and its recent rise to the category of middle-income country, thus 
limiting the flow of donations to the country, created a scenario of budget constraint that affects the 
cooperation, reducing predicted co-financing capabilities by the government. In future cooperation, it will be 
strategic to design mechanisms to guarantee co-financing by the government in such a way that it is possible 
to effectively carry out the prioritized activities, maintaining the relevance of the cooperation. 
16. Although limited in scope, UNICEF's role at the local level is valued by subnational governments for the 
benefits in places that receive pilot interventions. Governments and school communities aim not only for the 
continuity of UNICEF-funded interventions, but also maintain the expectation of greater investment, which 
suggests the need to align expectations in the local action.

17. Even though teenagers in Angola nowadays are more likely to improve their health and well-being than a 
decade ago, many still lack access to essential information and quality services. Despite the fact that youth 
policies, especially the strengthening of life skills in education, are a national priority and institutional priority 
for UNICEF, the theme was explored in a non-systematic way in the 2015-2019 cooperation cycle through 
poorly integrated curriculum development and teacher training actions in life skills theme, situational 
analysis on access, retention and the transition from primary to secondary schools and education for girls in 
the 1st year. 
18. Effectiveness: Technical support and advocacy for the preparation of studies and policy documents stood out 
as approaches to contribute to the construction of national policies for special education, early childhood, 
and teacher training. As they focus on the national education policy, on fundamental themes to promote 
access, quality and management, these results are considered crucial, and with great potential to impact the 
well-being of children in Angola. In addition to the development of national regulations, in the case of the 
policy for special education and the policy for early childhood, results were achieved for the implementation 
of public policy. In the area of professionalization of school management, we highlight the support for the 
development of educational statistics, systematized in the SIGE at the national level, and in the School 
Charter, at the subnational level, even though training for the use and timely dissemination of information 
are still important challenges. Support for training helped both to professionalize management and to 
strengthen leadership and families, although the scope cannot be determined due to the lack of 
administrative records, and its sustainability is a matter of concern. Worthy of mention are the studies 
related to the General State Budget (GSB) that subsidized both public employees and society for a more 
qualified impact in favour of education. The improvement in school conditions was limited to the reference 
created in the Child-Friendly Schools (EAC), and to technical support for researching the reasons for school 
dropout rates. In terms of curriculum standards and learning assessments, the results were modest, as 
technical support for curriculum evolution and the development of national learning assessments has not 
yet evolved into a curricular overhaul or into the consolidation of an assessment system at the national level. 
19. Among the main external factors that limited the scope of the results, we can highlight: changes in the 
government structure; the low number and technical capability of the employees at national and 
subnational level responsible for implementing the initiatives; the high turnover of government employees; 
the reduced fundraising capacity of UNICEF, but mainly from the government, due to the economic crisis; 
the asynchrony between the GoA budget cycle and the UNICEF planning process, generating a mismatch 
that impairs the inclusion of the priorities defined in the cooperation in the public budget; infrastructure 
problems (school, sanitation and roadways); the insufficient number of teachers; structural barriers and 
discriminatory social norms reflected in practices such as early marriage, gender-based violence, and boys 
favouring in family investments in education, and that, while the Constitution of the Angolan Republic 
defines access to education as a fundamental right for all, without any form of gender discrimination. 
20. Efficiency: within the scope of efficiency analysis, considering the data available (which did not include 
detailed expenditure data or opportunity cost in alternative actions) it was possible to verify that the 
efficiency of the program was negatively affected by the actions’ territorial and thematic dispersion, by the 
size of the teams in relation to the purposes of the Programme and by the need for continuous agreement 
with a wide network of partners. UNICEF's flexibility, while valued by partners, results in a loss of focus on 
actions of greater strength, and therefore loss of efficiency. 
21. The advocacy strategy in the construction of national policies is considered to be more efficient due to its 
potential national impact. Subnational efficiency, on the other hand, should be analysed based on the 
effective gain of scale of initiatives such as TUPPI and EAC. The preparation of trainers is a strategy adopted 
with potential efficiency gains due to the possibility of expansion. However, the lack of administrative 
records makes verification difficult. Intersectoral action, carried out within the scope of the two projects 
mentioned above, and also during humanitarian aid, presents itself as an opportunity to improve efficiency. 
The change in the cooperation structure, prioritizing early childhood care, reinforced the efficiency of the 
Programme, as this is an age group in which investments offer higher returns. 
22. The high turnover of government employees, the lack of communication and coordination between different 
departments, changes in government structure and limited technical capabilities are four external factors of 

 
 
 
 
iv 
 
inefficiency that could have had employed palliative measures. Inside UNICEF, the high turnover of the 
Education Programme leader and prolonged periods without leadership also generated a loss of efficiency 
due to the learning curve that must be faced with changes. 
23. Sustainability: an important sign for sustainability is the incorporation of the cooperation results in the 
country's public policies, and the existence of budgetary resources for its continuity. In this sense, among the 
results of the Programme, the consolidation of national policies, especially those about special education, 
stand out. 
24. The greatest threat to sustainability lies in external factors, particularly the lack of public resources to 
implement public policies, to execute the expected counterparts and scale up pilot experiences. Public 
employee turnover also threatens sustainability, as investments in technical support, preparation and 
consolidation of partnerships need to be constantly renewed. 
25. While sustainability results largely depend on the government, other actions, such as building partnerships 
with the third sector, the academy, other international associations and funding organizations, while also 
expanding the range of partners around the initiatives, are all key factors for sustainability. During the period 
under review, partnerships were consolidated with ADRA, Mosaiko, ISCED in Huíla and the World Bank, 
examples from which a broader support network could be consolidated. 
26. In the emergency context, the Programme's coherence, coverage and coordination are analysed. 
27. Coherence: The logic of emergency actions has changed over time. Although the Education Programme 
planned under result 1 (Output 1 on access) activities in emergency contexts in partnership with the central 
government (MED / DNEG and DNASE) since the first work plan for the 2015-2016 biennium, it was only in 
2017 that the theme gained prominence as a singular expected result (separate from output 1). 
28. The evaluation sought to identify what was done by the Programme to mitigate the effects of the crises faced 
by the country on children, especially to their equal access to quality education (Annex VI). At this point, it is 
important to highlight that there is little documentation on actions in emergency contexts. 
29. Even so, ACO's Annual Reports provide a breakdown of what was done by the Programme in the context of 
emergency actions. This information shows alignment with the needs, contexts and priorities of the 
government and helps in dimensioning the effort undertaken. 
30. Considering all limitations, the external coherence of the program was guaranteed by communication with 
external actors, especially with provincial governments, particularly in the identification of needs and the 
definition of measures to be taken. In addition, the actions were designed based on demands arising from 
the government, which guaranteed this alignment. 
31. Coverage: There is no systematized, standardized, and accessible information that allows viewing how many 
and which people were assisted by the Programme. There are many gaps in the information available in all 
the different internal reports. The coverage data for emergency actions bring few numbers and without any 
distinction of the beneficiary's profile. Thus, the analysis of coverage is limited to the analysis of local needs 
in the different territories of Angola, in view of the geographical location and type of intervention carried out. 
32. By analysing the type of intervention carried out, such as responses to migratory and drought crises, and by 
considering both the discourse of the interviewees and the reference documents for this evaluation, it 
appears that UNICEF's actions, in view of its possibilities and limitations, sought to prioritize the most severe 
situations. The evidence shows clear concern and targeted approach to serve the most vulnerable in all 
actions carried out by the Programme, such as either in development or emergency contexts, in the selection 
of geographic coverage or in the definition of the assisted population. 
33. Coordination: Through document and interviewees' discourse analysis, it is possible to affirm that there were 
mechanisms for UNICEF to coordinate its actions with other actors, mechanisms that also aimed at 
promoting the improvement of the MED performance. 

 
 
 
 
v 
 
34. It is possible to confirm that there was some integration in the response to the prioritized emergency 
situations, and interviewees from UNICEF, the Central Government and the provincial governments affirm 
that this coordination existed and facilitated the work, and that there is a common perception that this joint 
action was essential. The information gathered during the fieldwork allows us to state that UNICEF 
interventions were determined according to the MED demands, with which UNICEF maintains a constant 
dialogue. 
35. On the other hand, the perception of UNICEF interviewees is also that the articulation with other actors still 
needs to be improved, as the structures of mitigation and damage reduction are not well developed, neither 
at the central level nor in the provinces, nor is there a structure to coordinate emergency planning. The lack 
of a consolidated network implies the challenge of starting articulation with each action, resulting in longer 
response times. 
Gender, equity and children's rights: equity, especially that of gender, is a transversal factor to successive 
NDPs and the GoA has approved several legal instruments aimed at promoting Gender Equality and Equity 
in order to respond in a sustainable and multisectoral manner. The transversal priorities proposed by the 
UNICEF program (early childhood development, adolescents, gender and humanitarian action), acted as 
catalysts for policies for equity. 
The effectiveness of the response in the complexity of the humanitarian context is less evident, especially in 
cases related to the defence of the rights of girls and women who require an informed programming about 
risks and prevention systems. 
Even though at the national level UNICEF plays a leading role as an advocate for gender equity, national 
information systems need to be strengthened to collect, analyse and use data disaggregated by gender to 
ensure the integration of this perspective into program actions. 
The use of communication methods with a gender perspective were reinforced in the programme's action 
plans to ensure the active participation of children, youth and communities, as well as a sustainable 
behaviour change. Nevertheless, there is no robust gender analysis nor are there priority strategies for 
change, which are effective and evidence-based in line with a gender action plan. 
It is in the health sector that the gender theme is most effective and reinforced, especially in the area of 
maternal and child health, affecting development in early childhood. 
In addition, the Programme did not explicitly describe the objectives of gender equality and empowerment, 
including approaches that address cultural, social and political barriers to gender equality in the context of 
implementing activities. 
 
Limitations 
36. The main limitations of the evaluation carried out include: 
• 
Face-to-face fieldwork prevented by the pandemic - the lack of face-to-face visits, especially in the 
case of provinces, municipalities and schools, made it difficult for researchers to get closer to the 
reality of the interviewees and, thus, to specific information, making information collection and 
analysis more challenging; 
• 
Low access to educational statistics - as identified during the elaboration of the IR, there was a 
shortage of educational statistics, which were requested to the authorities with a low rate of return. 
This was partially overcome with publications obtained through UNICEF; 
• 
Changes in monitoring instruments and logical frameworks of the cooperation, staff turnover in the 
government and in the Education Programme, and the lack of comprehensive documentation have 
hampered the task of drawing a complete picture of the cooperation over time. Thanks to UNICEF's 

 
 
 
 
vi 
 
efforts to facilitate communication, the evaluation team had access to a notable number of former 
national government employees and the organization itself. In the case of the subnational level, 
however, the interviews were limited to employees on duty. 
• 
Despite UNICEF's efforts, interviews with former UNICEF representatives and with a former employee 
that was frequently cited by interviewees could not be conducted, particularly at the subnational 
level. 
Conclusions 
37. As a result of the evaluation, the assessment team came to a series of conclusions based on the evidence 
collected and lessons learned, including: 
• 
The Education Program for the 2015-2016 period was effectively guided by the national priorities 
defined in the national regulations, and sought to act within the scope of the main difficulties 
evidenced by national statistics, as well as to align itself with the agenda for the Sustainable 
Development Goals and with UNICEF’s global planning 
• 
Cooperation activities were adjusted when necessary to meet national and subnational needs and 
emergencies, without compromising the logic of action reflected in the Theory of Change, and were 
implemented in coordination with the government, seeking complementarity in actions. 
• 
The institutional performance of the MED was strengthened, particularly from the activities of the 
management pillar, characterized by training and support for the professionalization of national and 
local managers. 
• 
The most comprehensive results, with the greatest potential for impact on the situation of Angolan 
children, were achieved through technical support strategies and advocacy actions. These strategies 
were applied notably for (i) the approval of national policies for inclusive education, early childhood 
and teacher training; (ii) to contribute mainly to the implementation of inclusive education policies; 
(iii) for the development of service models (TUPPI and EAC), and (iv) for the consolidation of school 
management systems (SIGE and the School Charter). Items (i), (ii) and (iv) structure national policies 
that will impact children across the country, making more accurate diagnoses feasible, providing 
normative support and guiding their effective implementation. Although they have not reached a 
large number of children and families, EAC and particularly TUPPI, given its low implementation cost, 
have created models with the potential to become national public policies. 
• 
In the case of interventions in emergency contexts, it can be concluded that, although the Education 
Programme works to ensure a coordinated approach with other actors, and seeks to reach those who 
need it most, the lack of response protocols and shared multisectoral contingency plans compromises 
the result, since the cyclical nature of disasters would allow for pre-emptive planning and the 
articulation of a local network that may respond faster. 
• 
In addition, integrated approaches tend to be more effective, especially those that have adopted the 
school as a reference platform for multisectoral interventions. Therefore, in order for integration to 
be successful, it will be necessary to also make the partners aware of the benefits of multisectoral 
implementation and for them to be willing to work under this new paradigm.
