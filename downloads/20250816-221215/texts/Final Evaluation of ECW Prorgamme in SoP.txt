Executive Summary 
Purpose, Including Intended Audience(s)  
The purpose of this external evaluation was to learn and assess the results of Education Cannot Wait (ECW) facilitated Multi 
Year Resilience Programme (MYRP)-2019-2021 in the State of Palestine (SoP) and provide recommendations for any future 
MYRP in SoP in terms of its design and implementation modality.  
The main users of the evaluation are the Ministry of Education (MoE), ECW, Education Cluster partners, the Education Sector 
Working Group (ESWG) members, the donor community, and key education stakeholders. 
Objectives and Brief Description of Intervention 
The ECW/MYRP was implemented in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip between 2019 and 2023. The programme aimed at 
ensuring that crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years) have sustained and safe access to 
improved quality and relevance of education in inclusive and protective environments. The programme sought to achieve this 
through three outcomes: 
Outcome 1 
Improved, sustained and safe equitable, inclusive and gender-responsive access to education and 
learning opportunities for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys (6-17 years old)  
Outcome 2 
Improved quality and relevance of education for crisis-affected vulnerable and marginalized girls and boys 
(6-17 years old) in inclusive and protective environments  
Outcome 3 
Strengthened capacity of the education system to respond to chronic humanitarian needs and to deliver 
a coordinated and mainstreamed response 
 
Methodology 
The evaluation employed a mixed methods approach, which collects both qualitative and quantitative data. The following data 
collection tools were developed and deployed by the consultancy team: MYRP Beneficiary Survey, MYRP Beneficiary FGD, 
Teacher Training and Recruitment Survey, Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs, and Client and Stakeholder KIIs. The sample 
achieved includes 807 MYRP Beneficiary Surveys, 74 MYRP Beneficiary FGD (with a total of 359 participants), 123 Teacher 
Training and Recruitment Surveys, 75 Implementing Staff (Teacher) KIIs, and 33 Client and Stakeholder KIIs.  
Main Conclusions 
The report identified the following conclusions, linking to each of the key evaluation questions: 
 
EQ1: How relevant, appropriate, and significant is the SoP ECW/MYRP at the country level? How can these aspects 
be strengthened in any future MYRPs in SoP? 
 
A review of the approach taken to respond to, and reduce differentiated inequalities and needs (including those 
resulting from age, gender, geographic, disability and/or socio-economic factors), suggests that MYRP design and 
implementation intended to impact vulnerable groups by focusing on schools located in areas most impacted by 
protracted crises, where children face barriers to access and continuity of education and communities are 
experiencing the highest levels of poverty, limited access to services and resources, and are isolated in a manner that 
increases their vulnerabilities and marginalisation, while reinforcing certain tradition norms, behaviour and practices 
detrimental to specific groups or individuals. Further efforts to pivot programming to emergent COVID-19 needs also 
further promoted a view of intended responsiveness to the needs of children in target zones. The reprogramming of 
MYRP highlights the programme’s flexibility and adaptiveness. Allocation of ‘flexible funds’ also highlights the 
responsiveness of MYRP in SoP. However, the lack of strong MEAL and outcome monitoring/documentation, and 
dependence on self-reporting of implementing partners, makes it challenging to establish the degree to which 
programming directly responded to the priority needs of children in SoP. This stems from disjointed design affecting 
the establishment of a harmonised MEAL framework, potentially compounded by ECW reporting requirements, i.e.  
‘reach’ figures. A related issue is the disjointedness and fragmentation of interventions due to siloed projectisation 
within the wider MYRP design.

 
EQ2: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP aligning with, complementing, and leveraging international and national 
humanitarian-development system(s) and related plans, policies, and frameworks? How can these aspects be 
strengthened in future SoP MYRPs? 
 
The SoP MYRP was aligned and integrated with other systems and related plans, including in the national education 
system and related governmental plans (Education Sector Strategic Plan, Joint Advocacy and Protection Strategy, 
the UNRWA Mid-Term Strategy, the Humanitarian Response Plan, and the National Inter-sectoral Violence against 
Children Strategy in the Context of Covid-19 2021-2023); however, this may have been (in the case of this specific 
MYRP) to the detriment of differentiable impact arising from ECW’s seed funding, and certainly to the detriment of 
EiE- and nexus-focussed outcomes and impacts. The core constituency of vulnerable and marginalised children, who 
are the main targets as per ECW’s strategic priorities and articulated in the MYRP as Bedouins, Herders etc., were 
not demonstrably served by its programming. Likewise, there is an apparent lack of alignment with the wider 
Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). To be concrete, given that the MYRP did not appear to have its own coherent 
theory of change, that it was used to fund subcomponents of other siloed education programmes and activities, rather 
than a cohesive, holistic set of its own interventions, and that there was limited coordination between the implementing 
partners, clear impacts and effects arising from highly atomised ECW-funded activities were difficult to identify. 
 
EQ3: How does the SoP ECW/MYRP align with, complement, and leverage ECW Global strategic plan, core functions 
and other investment modalities (FER)? How can this be strengthened? 
 
There was a nominal alignment to ECW’s global strategic plan and objectives described in the planning phase and 
initial application, namely to support in the education of 8 million children across the whole of ECW’s portfolio, and to 
increase political support to education in crises; increase financing for education in crises; Improve joint planning and 
responses; strengthen capacity to respond; and improve accountability. However, given the high degree of 
integration/fragmentation across modality types, partners, and regions, it is challenging to establish the degree to 
which ECW actually contributed to the achievement of these objectives. Strengthening this alignment, and desired 
impacts, have been addressed in the relevant section below.  
 
EQ4: To what extent is the SoP ECW/MYRP managed in an efficient, timely and transparent manner? How can these 
aspects be strengthened in any future MYRPs? 
 
The efficiency of the MYRP, given the high degree of integration in other programmes implemented by the partners, 
can be seen as a strength of the programme, in spite of the typical bureaucratic and other hurdles faced in the course 
of implementation. Primary delays in implementation arise in early phases of the project, and as a result of the COVID 
crisis; however, partners managed to achieve required outputs before the end of the programme.  
 
EQ5: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP created political commitment to address the needs of children 
and youth (boys/girls) affected by conflict and crisis on a global and in-country level? 
 
The MYRP has garnered significant political commitment from domestic leadership in SoP. This is most clearly 
expressed in the MoE’s leading role in the MYRP’s governance structure, where the Minister of Education is co-chair 
of the Steering Committee (SC) and a senior MoE official from the MoE’s ECW Core team is the co-chair of the 
Technical Committee (TC) (ECW narrative report for period 01/2020 – 12/2020, 2021). Since December 2019, the 
MoE has taken a series of steps to affirm and consolidate its role in ECW/MYRP governance. These include creating 
a team of six officials to liaise with the MYRP’s PMU on management issues, and fostering communication between 
MoE officials and the SC and TC by bringing six and 11 officials to them respectively (Ibid.). During 2021, the technical 
meetings including the Y3 reprogramming exercise had MoE officials at the core of discussions. The MoE’s Deputy 
Minister led the exercise with the PMU and all five MYRP partners involved (Ibid.). UNICEF SOP’s most recent 
narrative report to ECW states that this political commitment has helped ensure ‘solid technical discussions and better 
information flow within the Ministry and with the ECW partners’ (Ibid., p. 14). Furthermore, MoE has played a proactive 
leadership role, appointing a dedicated focal person, reorganising the governance structure, and providing an office 
space to PMU for effective coordination and decision making, such as identification of priority needs for allocation of 
‘Flexible Funds’. 
 
EQ6: To what extent and how has the SoP ECW/MYRP contributed directly &/or indirectly to mobilizing and leveraging 
funds at country level? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this regard? 
 
It does not appear that additional international or national resources were mobilised in support of the broader MYRP, 
nor does it appear that seed funds contributed toward generation of additional funds earmqarked for MYRP 
implementation. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case in SoP: seed funds largely contributed toward other 
programmes, priorities, and activities defined by the implementing partners operating in their siloes. This challenge 
has been described at length in other sections of the report; it does appear that this inversion of mobilisation (i.e., that 

 
 
| v | 
seed funds were mobilised to other strategies and priorities, rather than vice versa) resulted in the dilution of 
perceivable or discernible impact arising from ECW's support.  Including strategic stakeholders (such as donors, multi-
lateral agencies, and other resource arrangements such as JFA and the GPE) in the Steering Committee to monitor 
‘resource mobilisation’ as one of the KPIs of MYRP requires significant restructuring of governance arrangements. 
The current governance arrangement face potential conflicts of interest, and are overly narrow in scope and remit. 
 
EQ7: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen a joint, (humanitarian-development) 
coordinated, evidence-based, and inclusive approach to EiEPC programming in the State of Palestine? How can 
these aspects be strengthened in MYRP? 
 
The MYRP appears to have contributed to the strengthening of existing relationships between various partners and 
stakeholders across SoP through the implementation of joint programming, though there were challenges in the 
collection and analysis of evidence and data, and related response. Establishment of key units (like the PMU), and 
strengthening of existing coordination entities were also highlighted as key, positive outcomes arising from this seed 
fund.  Since new strategies are due to be developed in the following months, the PMU could serve a coordinating role 
to ensure alignment of plans/programmes, including the new ESSP and MYRP, and resources from donors such as 
ECW, GPE, JFA, the WB, USAID etc. 
 
EQ8: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP strengthen country and local capacities at individual, 
organizational and institutional levels for improved EiEPC programming? How can the MYRPs be strengthened in this 
regard? 
 
There were a variety of trainings provided to local authorities, which many cited as contributing directly to improved 
capacities at the national and local level; furthermore, many of the downstream partners for MYRP implementation 
were national and local in nature. However, once again, due to the high level of fragmentation of support, limited 
documentary evidence on outcomes and impact, and turnover of local authorities, it is a substantial challenge to point 
directly to the MYRP’s impact on capacity, both across national and international partners.  Furthermore, it is not 
possible to establish whether training leads to capacity building and learning outcomes without a structured, evidence- 
and measurement-based approach, such as pre- and post-training assessment and/or training impact assessment. 
Additionally, capacity improvement and systems strengthening did not form part of Results Framework (RF) as 
intermediate outcomes/results contributing to the overall outcomes/results. As such, there is a lack of evidence to 
measure and attribute the impact of training/capacity building/system strengthening inputs.

EQ9: To what extent and how did the SoP ECW/MYRP promote and strengthen: (i) the availability of quality data on 
education needs/gaps in SoP, and (ii) the measurement of output and outcome results? How can the MYRPs be 
strengthened in this regard? 
 
This was one of the primary deficiencies of the programme highlighted both by investigation and by key informants. 
Limited evidence and data was generated, and no evidence on outcomes provided; all evidence generated was on 
an output basis, and this appeared to be inconsistent and unstructured, with most of it provided in laconic narrative 
reports and none of it independently verifiable. Lack of a unified MEAL Framework and Plan is an important gap, which 
originates from the fragmentation and projectisation of MYRP. 
 
EQ10: What is the progress made towards the different collective beneficiary results as identified in the country result 
frameworks (access, continuity, equity and gender equality, quality and learning, safety)? How can the MYRP be 
strengthened in this regard? 
 
Once again, results beyond outputs were a substantial challenge to establish, given (once again) the high degree of 
fragmentation of support, as well as the limited documentary evidence on outcomes collected in the course of the 
programme.  
 
EQ11: How is the SoP ECW/MYRP promoting and strengthening sustainable and resilient education systems and 
solutions so far? How can it be strengthened in this regard? 
 
It has been very difficult to determine the specific impact of the programme, not least in terms of its impact on resilience 
to crisis or conflict (which is already a very subtle, and difficult to define area). Integration in other larger responses 
and actions by the high quantity of implementing partners, and resulting difficulty in discerning unique or differentiable 
impact, have much to do with this. Similarly, the way in which the programme and its linked activities were intended 
to improve conflict resilience do not appear to have been well defined from the outset, making it even harder to 
comment concretely on this research question. Nuanced conflict analysis, vulnerability analysis, and factoring in 
resilience within the MYRP design and establishing indicator/s for measuring resilience could be considered for next 
generation of MYRP.

 
EQ12: To what extent have cross-cutting themes such as gender, age, disability, vulnerability, child and 
human rights, and accountability been integrated in the programme? 
 
Crosscutting themes (including all of those mentioned) do appear to have broadly informed implementation of the 
MYRP, with nearly all stakeholders praising this aspect of programming; however, the degree to which this was 
intentional (rather than an incidental) effect of integration in other, established programmes led by experienced UN 
and international partners remained unclear, especially in light of the high degree of fragmentation mentioned in the 
findings section of this document. Feedback from stakeholders suggests that programme design was undermined by 
a lack of the use of specific tools or programming frameworks (e.g. GEDSI, etc.). 
 
Recommendations 
The MYRP faced similar challenges across the ECW portfolio; their recent shift has resulted from their learnings in the past 
(many of which reflect those from the SoP MYRP): smaller but targeted beneficiary scale, offering holistic support to smaller 
numbers of children impacted by emergency and/or crisis; work on ensuring ECW's 'value-add’ (i.e. in legitimate emergency 
response and/or crisis programming vs complement to development-focussed programming like GPE ESPIGs); minimising the 
number of partners involved; strengthening MEAL and developing a standardised MYRP level MEAL plan to ensure that 
reporting is consistent, up-to-date, and includes metrics of outcome in learning, access, and equity. 
In line with the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, the following are presented as the key recommendations for future 
development and implementation of MYRPs within the Palestinian context:   
 
Recommendation 1:  Design Strengthening  
Adopt a targeted, strategic and crisis-focused approach, built on concrete evidence and a data-driven basis, ensuring 
that resilience is clearly defined, and informed by a robust multi-dimensional barrier analysis addressing the needs of 
vulnerable groups. 
 
Recommendation 2:  Effective MYRP Delivery  
Ensure that interventions are communicated effectively to beneficiary communities, and streamline partnership 
arrangement based on VfM, localisation of aid, and AAP principles and commitment, selecting implementing partners 
through open and competitive bidding process. 
 
Recommendation 3: Sector-wide Alignment  
Develop a digital and centralised platform for tracking resource mobilisation and alignment, in which nexus-focussed 
activities are defined, specifying how they can add value.  
 
Recommendation 4: Effective Coordination and Resource Mobilization 
Clearly and realistically define the scale and types of additional resources to be leveraged and how the MYRP can do 
so, while aligning future programming with other funding sources and mechanisms and ensuring that economies of 
scale are achieved where possible. 
 
Recommendation 5: Strengthening Governance of MYRP 
Ensure government roles and responsibilities are clearly/well integrated from the outset of the programme, avoiding 
potential conflict of interests, and that the government has a leading role in leadership and oversight of programming, 
while building on PMU successes and capacity. 
 
Recommendation 6:  Robust monitoring, impact measurement and accountability of MYRP 
Partners should be actively encouraged to report on outcomes, and link programming to impact, maintaining (and 
sharing) quantitative data on clear and measurable outcomes, and ensuring output data is systematically collected and 
independently verifiable.

Chapter 1: Context and Description of the 
Object of the Evaluation1 
1.1 Intervention Context 
The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) facilitated Multi Year Resilience Programme (MYRP) was implemented in the State of 
Palestine (SoP) between June 2019 and December 2022. The following sub-sections provide contextual information for the 
intervention. 
1.1.1 Context 
The State of Palestine is located in Western Asia, 
bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt, Israel, 
and Jordan. The total population of the State of 
Palestine in 2023 is estimated to be 5,483,450 
people (Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 
2021). As of 2021, the country’s GDP was 
US$18.04 Billion, with a per capita GDP of 
US$3,052.6 (The World Bank, 2021). The State of 
Palestine is currently recognized by 138 of 193 
United 
Nations 
(UN) 
member 
states. 
The 
humanitarian situation in Palestine is among the 
world’s most long-standing protection crises. 
Hebron is the largest Governorate in the West Bank 
in terms of area (997 km2), population (729,139 - 
approximately 23% of the West Bank population), 
and economic activity (17,661 active businesses, 
comprising 18% of the West Bank’s total). In 
contrast, Hebron also has the highest poverty rate 
in the West Bank (not including refugee camps) with 
32.5% of its population classified as poor compared 
to an average of 18%, with 22% of HHs either 
severely or moderately food insecure, compared to 
the West Bank average of 16%. The Governorate 
has been divided into Areas A, B and C since the 
Oslo accords of 1995. Approximately 67,850 Palestinians (11% of Hebron governorate population) live in Area C of Hebron, 
which also includes 51.1% of the agricultural land.  
Over 60% of the West Bank is classified as Area C. Area C is the only contiguous area in the West Bank and contains the bulk 
of Palestinian agricultural and grazing land, as well as land reserves and resources that are essential for Palestinian growth and 
development. According to OCHA, an estimated 297,900 people live in 532 residential areas in Area C, comprising some of 
the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank in terms of humanitarian needs.  
The total Palestinian population in Jerusalem stands at around 323,700, 76% of whom live under the poverty line including 83.4% 
of children. 
1.9 million Palestinians live in Gaza, of which 1.3 million people are registered refugees with UNRWA. Gazans face a 
socioeconomic crisis that puts them in a state of de-development. The socioeconomic conditions in Gaza are characterized by 
a high unemployment rate of 53.7 percent (41.1 percent for men and 71.5 percent for women). In addition to the high
