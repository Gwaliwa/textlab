EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Overview of the intervention 
The IALA programme was set up in 2017 and run until 2020 with funding from the IKEA Foundation (IF) as a 
multi-year, multi-country intervention covering three countries – Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan – to improve 
the lives of adolescents by increasing their influence over decisions affecting their lives. The programme sought 
to empower adolescents and young adults aged between 10 and 19 years, by enhancing their knowledge, improv-
ing their access to information, and supporting their rights to healthier and safer lifestyles. Besides adolescents, 
IALA also had interventions directed towards parents of adolescents as well as community and religious leaders, 
who were all identified as crucial change agents in creating a suitable environment for engendering the new prac-
tices imparted to adolescents. In Afghanistan, the programme was implemented in all eight districts of the 
Bamyan province and in three out of the seven districts of the Badghis province.   
The overall objective of the IALA programme was to reduce the harmful traditional practices that adolescents in 
Afghanistan are exposed to and empower them as agents of change with the knowledge and confidence to reduce 
their exposure to these. IALA had three main goals: 1) reducing child marriage, 2) lowering the incidence of teen-
age pregnancy, and 3) enhancing female educational outcomes in the form of increased secondary school (re)en-
rolment. The programme also encouraged a healthy and creative lifestyle by imparting important life skills to 
adolescents and creating a space for them to discuss the topics they consider important for their wellbeing and 
overall empowerment. These discussions were facilitated by the creation of the Multipurpose Adolescent Groups 
(MAGs), that provided a safe space for adolescents to communicate the barriers and issues afflicting their ability 
to participate in making choices that affect their lives. The programme set two outcomes1: 1) that by the end of 
the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate with each other and policy mak-
ers to share information among peers through various avenues (such as social media forums, mobile technolo-
gies) and traditional methods of communication at the local levels, and at least 52,334 (50% female and 50% 
male) adolescents are mobilized as agents of change for themselves and their communities through engaging in 
adolescent groups/Shuras; 2) that by the end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents, and 
influential individuals from communities in the 11 districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, espe-
cially girls, to access services, participate in decision making, and prevent their exposure to harmful traditional 
practices leading to abuse and exploitation.  
Objectives and intended audience 
This report focuses on examining the theoretical causal chain of the IALA programme and on assessing the pro-
gramme’s performance based on the key criteria of relevance, fidelity, coverage, effectiveness, and sustainability. 
The report identifies which aspects of the programme worked well, and outlines good practices, lessons learned, 
and recommendations - with the objective of providing evidence of what works and shedding light on what is 
required to remove barriers and promote enablers for the successful delivery of similar programmes for the tar-
get groups. Based on the key mechanisms and findings outlined in the report, it is possible to adjust assumptions 
and expectations and to reassign levels of effort to activities and outputs.  
Since IALA involves many actors, there is a varied audience that can benefit from this report. At the programme-
matic end, Aga Khan Foundation Afghanistan (AKFA) and World Vision Afghanistan (WVA) will benefit from the 
insights provided regarding programme implementation, while UNICEF can benefit from insights regarding pro-
gramme design. The report can further inform other institutional and international actors working on child pro-
tection and child rights in Afghanistan and the broader South Asia region, by providing insights and offering op-
erational recommendations for future programming. The report can inform them about the assumptions and 
steppingstones that might be similar or require context-specific adaptations, and thereby ensure the design or 
implementation of programmes can be successful for the intended objectives. 
Evaluation methodology 
This summative evaluation of IALA was conducted using a purely qualitative approach. Prior to this, a baseline 
study was carried out in 2017, and a follow up midline quantitative impact study was conducted in 2019. The 
data collection for IALA Afghanistan’s endline was originally envisaged to be undertaken on a much larger scale, 
to answer all research questions relevant for the evaluation. The plan was to increase the sample size by inter-
viewing respondents from additional villages in Bamyan and Badghis (using recall data to perform matching) and 
by extending the analysis to Herat and Daikundi, both provinces that were not included in the midline evaluation 
(but for which we had baseline data). However, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the active conflict in the country 
between the Taliban and the government forces at the time of the evaluation design, the possibility of an extended 
data collection became untenable, and it was hence decided that the summative evaluation would rely only on a 
qualitative component to address the gaps that midline data were unable to address.

For the current study, semi-structured in-depth interviews (IDIs) with a purposive sample of beneficiaries, com-
munity members, teachers, and trainers were supplemented by key informant interviews (KIIs) with relevant 
staff and officials. To explore the programme in-depth, insights from both implementing partners (Agha Khan 
Foundation, World Vision) and participants were gathered. For programme implementing partners, KIIs and for 
beneficiaries IDIs were conducted in both treatment provinces (Bamyan & Badghis). KIIs helped to gather infor-
mation and critical perceptions on programme design and implementation, while the IDIs identified success sto-
ries, changes, challenges, and perceptions about the programme. 
The findings from the qualitative data were analysed using Process Tracing (PT) to understand whether the re-
sults of the IALA programme are consistent with its Theory of Change and to see if alternative explanations can 
be ruled out. PT is a case-based approach to Causal-Process Observations (CPOs) which enables the examination 
of specific cases in greater detail. For this evaluation, a combination of theory-testing PT and explaining-outcome 
PT approaches were employed. Theory-testing PT was used to test the validity and assumptions of the Theory of 
Change developed in the midline evaluation. Explaining-outcome PT helped to obtain a good understanding of 
how the causal mechanisms worked, by breaking down the outcomes into a series of intermediate outcomes and 
testing the intervening steps against competing hypotheses, based on the evidence gathered. The PT method 
helped the C4ED team determine whether the apparently interlocking components of the IALA programme were 
effectively united in a process to produce the final desired outcomes, namely the increased educational, health 
and social empowerment of adolescents in the selected Afghani provinces of Badghis and Bamyan.  
Key findings 
The IALA programme adopted a holistic approach, which was found to have overall engaged the right participants 
for adolescent empowerment. The programme adopted a unique content and design by placing adolescents at 
the centre of the intervention, while also engaging relevant groups of adults in their target areas (parents, com-
munity and religious leaders). The programme’s contents were found to be relevant to the target groups, both for 
adolescents’ contexts and learning needs as well as for parents and leaders. The practical learning style was con-
sidered engaging and useful to both adolescents and communities.  
IALA’s implementation faced some challenges in delivering its activities and outputs, with the biggest one being 
the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted most programme activities in the last quarter. Various other challenges 
emanated both from both the contexts in which the activities were carried out and from design and operational 
aspects of the programme. These challenges had tangible effects on implementation and acted as barriers to the 
target groups’ full utilization of the programme. One set of challenges was connected to communities’ traditional 
social and gender norms and the characteristics of their contexts and practices, which presented difficulties for 
engaging adolescents and community members and for sharing the messages from the programme. Such chal-
lenges included: some communities’ resistance to changing views and behaviours towards adolescents’ rights, 
particularly at the beginning of the intervention and in more remote and/or rural areas; the need to adapt to a 
gender segregated MAG structure in some areas due to socio-cultural traditions; a high proportion of illiteracy, 
which called for changes in training design and introduced difficulties to MAG operations; and communities’ live-
lihood conditions, which included child labour, affecting the attendance and participation particularly of vulner-
able adolescents. The challenges connected to the programme’s design and operations included: a limited and 
insufficiently systematic engagement of parents and leaders in MAG activities; a potentially insufficient adapta-
tion to some local conditions, including seasonal activities, and the needs of the vulnerable adolescents in the 
MAG structure and mentoring; a limited budget for community activities and lacking budget for MAG premises; 
and some delays incurred in the implementation of community-level activities (development of action plans in 
Badghis).  
Regarding Outcome 1 of IALA2, the findings show that adolescents acquired relevant knowledge regarding their 
rights and life skills applicable to their lives, and that they were able to communicate with their peers, at most 
times with their families and sometimes with community and religious leaders, although communication with 
policy makers could not be established. Adolescents acted as agents of change for peers and families in their 
communities, campaigning outside the MAGs to promote access to education and the prevention of child mar-
riages. They did this via different means, including peer to peer mentoring, reaching out to the families in their 
communities, and sometimes talking to community or religious leaders to help them solve problems. They also 
carried out various awareness raising campaigns and other social actions. There is also evidence that the most 
effective communication occurred not through the use of technological aids or radio but rather through activities 
such as peer-to-peer outreach, door to door and artistic activities.  
 
2 By end of the programme, adolescents from two target provinces are able to communicate with each other and policy makers 
through various avenues (such as social media forums, mobile technologies) to share information among peers and traditional 
methods of communication at the local levels, and at least 52,334 (50% female and 50% male) adolescents are mobilized as 
agents of change for themselves and their communities through engaging in adolescent groups/Shuras.

Regarding Outcome 23, though sensitisation of religious leaders (RL), community leaders (CL), parents, and com-
munities at large took place, there is considerable unevenness in the extent to which the adults in the communi-
ties were reached, and how this translated into their engagement in actions of child protection in line with Out-
come 2. As IALA used Islamic teachings to centre its messaging on child rights to a large extent, it could circumvent 
societal resistance. Communities were to a large extent appreciative of the teachings received on children’s rights, 
a knowledge that they reported to not have had before. However, it is evident that messages were interpreted 
differently by each category of respondents, and that there were different levels of commitment to each set of 
messages. There is almost universal appreciation of the importance of education for the future of children, though 
most stakeholders acknowledged that economic realities affect a person’s access to education. This is especially 
important, as adults’ support for adolescent education is for both boys and girls, but girls are much more affected 
by societal norms on education. Child marriage is a topic which shows more variation in the levels of acceptance 
by distinct stakeholder groups. There is evidence that some RLs have the view that marriages should only happen 
after puberty. However, most RLs considered marriages to be advisable above the age of 18, even though they 
could be permissible earlier. Parents tend to have the view that adolescents should only get married after the legal 
age, though child marriages occurred or where in some cases prevented by individuals taking part in the pro-
gramme. There is some evidence that spaces have opened up for adolescents, and that they are included in deci-
sion-making; however, parents continue to be the ones taking the final decisions. Early pregnancy was not found 
to be very salient among respondents. Those who mentioned it, typically referred to it as one among the many 
problems caused by child marriage, which reflects the inextricable links between the social norms of pregnancy 
and marriage. 
Key conclusions 
The findings suggest that the IALA programme has raised awareness of the importance of the rights and protec-
tion of adolescents in the target areas of Afghanistan, both within target communities and among government 
counterparts. IALA put adolescents at the centre of the intervention and promoted their empowerment not only 
through raising awareness of their rights but also through providing relevant and applicable skills that adoles-
cents could relate to and incorporate to improve their circumstances and contexts. Moreover, IALA brought about 
a practical approach to teaching and learning which was instructional in terms of teaching contents and teaching 
practices; adolescents’ learning experience was boosted first-hand by giving them a key role in the MAG structure 
and organisation and by becoming peer educators from the get-go. MAG’s practical approach, which was different 
from school, was considered complementary, useful, highly valued, and something that adolescents had not seen 
before. Thus, IALA’s teaching contents and styles were both new and relevant to their target population. 
Even though IALA’s activities seem to have raised the awareness of communities about children’s rights, espe-
cially considering that these were mostly new topics for the community members, not all have embraced these 
ideas. With the sudden and still ongoing political transition since the take-over of political power by the Taliban 
in August 2021, many of these gains are threatened. For example, there are indications that despite the greater 
awareness of the importance of education within the population, access to education has become impossible or 
much more challenging with the closure of schools and the increased exclusion of girls from schools. Moreover, 
an increase in child marriages of girls was identified as a potential danger under the new Taliban administration. 
Key recommendations 
➢ Consider the target groups’ economic realities in programme design. 
➢ Explore potential linkages with government actors and the private sector for supporting options of set-
ting up more higher learning courses, TVET classes, or alternative approaches, such as livelihood train-
ing accessible for girls, to address barriers to female empowerment 
➢ Strengthen trainers’ preparation for teaching illiterate children and mixed groups, including disabled 
children.  
➢ Ensure systematic engagement of key adults, particularly parents, through targeted activities/educa-
tional programmes. 
➢ Plan for enhancements to training and cascade learning through longer-term, spaced out, and varied 
incorporation of contents and inclusion of adolescents in design, to boost their engagement. 
➢ Establish closer programme monitoring by UNICEF with centralised oversight of monitoring data.  
➢ Reconsider the channels used for messaging. 
➢ Provide a specific budget for MAG premises and plan for an increase of budgeting for community activi-
ties. 
➢ Plan for programme continuation and expansion to neighbouring villages.  
 
3 By end of the programme, 60,651 religious leaders, elders, parents, and influential individuals from the community in the 11 
districts of the 2 target provinces support adolescents, especially girls, to access services, participate in decision making, and 
prevent their exposure to harmful traditional practices leading to abuse and exploitation.

1 BACKGROUND 
1.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT 
Afghanistan is a mountainous and landlocked country of about 39 million inhabitants (2020), most of whom live 
in tribal and kinship communities in rural areas (World Population Review, 2022). The country’s decades-long 
armed conflicts coupled with deeply ingrained harmful traditional practices, such as child marriage, has had se-
vere emotional and health consequences for women and children (Li et al., 2018). 
As of 2021, Afghanistan entered the early dividend stage of the demographic transition with a steady decrease in 
birth rates and an increase in the working age population, resulting in an economic window of opportunity. To 
seize this opportunity, it is crucial that Afghanistan makes the necessary investments to anticipate the ‘adolescent 
bulge’ entering the labour market in the coming years. Adolescents currently constitute 26% of the population 
(UNICEF ROSA, 2019). However, the country’s growing adolescent population is prone to many risks, as they have 
suffered from years of violence, abuse, and harmful traditional practices that affect their lives. To take the example 
of exclusion from education, factors such as being female, social norms, and child marriage, as well as traditional 
and religious beliefs are responsible for keeping adolescents – especially girls – out of school. Evidently, exclusion 
from education has profound impacts on adolescents and, when coupled with pre-existing socioeconomic chal-
lenges, gives rise to child labour and early marriage (UNICEF, 2021). The situation for this vulnerable segment of 
the population is further exacerbated by both the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent regime change in Afghani-
stan (UNICEF, 2022).  
Although marrying off children under the age of 15 is illegal in Afghanistan, it is a common practice, particularly 
in rural areas.  For the period 2005-2019, the rate of child marriage by the age of 18 was at 28%4. Poverty, strong 
patriarchal values, and poor access to education all drive child marriage in Afghanistan. According to UNICEF data 
for 2017, the adolescent birth rate was 62 per 1000 girls aged 15-19, which can be seen as a consequence of early 
child marriage and of lacking or limited access to reproductive health services5. Child marriages usually serve to 
strengthen ties with rival families and ethnic groups, as part of deals, or to settle debts and disputes. Poor families 
often end up selling daughters for large dowries from wealthy people, and the husbands are usually much older. 
The decisions to sell off girls for marriage are made by men, while wives, mothers, sisters and the girls themselves 
have little or no say. Furthermore, a quarter of women suffering from obstetric fistula, which can condemn women 
to ill-health and ostracism, were below the age of 16 when they married (UNFPA Afghanistan, 2021).  
As of August 2021, Taliban assumed national political power in Afghanistan, and the new political developments 
have pushed the country into economic crisis with immediate repercussions across an economy already facing 
daunting development challenges (World Bank, 2021). Leadership transitions and implications for basic services 
and financial systems have brought further turmoil to a country that has experienced four decades of prolonged 
conflict, recurrent natural disasters, chronic poverty, and disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 (UNICEF, 2022). 
It is estimated that about 24 million people – of which about 12 million are children – are in need for humanitarian 
assistance (ibid.). Moreover, the recent political transition has consequences for vulnerable populations in the 
country, especially women and children, with UNICEF (2021) reporting a rise in child marriage due to the political 
and economic situation.  
The IALA programme was developed to be implemented in two provinces of Afghanistan: Bamyan and Badghis. 
Bamyan is in the centre of Afghanistan, with a population of 368.395 people, 190.310 of which are males and 
178,085 of which are females (2011). During the same period, half the population was 16 years old or younger. 
Bamyan scored higher than the national average on literacy rates (38.1%) in the population aged 10 years and 
above, with the male and female literacy rates being 50% and 25%, respectively. Around 5% of the population of 
Bamyan aged 5 years or older suffered from at least one functional difficulty (Bamyan Socio-Demographic and 
Economic Survey, 2011). In 2018, the rate of child marriage in Bamyan rested at 31% (UNICEF, 2018).  
Badghis is located in the western part of Afghanistan, bordering Faryab, Ghor, and Herat provinces, and Turk-
menistan, with a population of 499.393 people, 254.854 of which are males and 244.539 are females. Only around 
3% of the provincial population is urban, while 97% live in rural areas. Badghis has a literacy rate of only 11%, 
with the male and female literacy rates being 14% and 7%, respectively (Provincial Development Plan: Badghis 
Provincial Profile, 2010). Notably, Badghis is among the provinces with the highest rate (55%) of child marriage 
(UNICEF, 2018). 
Afghanistan ratified the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1994 and is committed to protecting the right to 
life and education of every child. Respecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is enshrined in its Consti-
tution. Furthermore, Article 43 sets forth the right of all citizens to a free education up to the B.A. level (Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan 1/26/2004). Since 2001, education has been a priority area of action for the government 
and is managed by the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), and religious
