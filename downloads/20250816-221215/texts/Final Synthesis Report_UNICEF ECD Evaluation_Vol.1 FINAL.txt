MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION 
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT 
Executive Summary 
Evaluation purpose, objectives, and scope  
Evaluation purpose: The evaluation’s overarching purpose was to provide UNICEF Country Offices 
(COs), UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO), and national governments and 
partners with a critical assessment of the key adaptations made in UNICEF’s Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) programmes in the region to meet the needs of young children and families in 
the context of COVID-19. The secondary purpose was two-fold. First, it was to generate insight to 
inform further development of the evaluated ECD activities. Second, it was to provide evidence to 
inform future ECD efforts in similar emergencies. The evaluation was carried out in Croatia, Georgia, 
Moldova, and Ukraine. 
Evaluation scope: The evaluation focused on interventions that: ● were introduced directly in 
response to COVID-19 or adapted to the context; ● entailed capacity building or information support 
for frontline workers; ● and were viewed by a given UNICEF CO as useful to have feedback on for future 
programming. These entailed both newly started interventions and those adapted to COVID-19 that 
have already been part of ECD programmes. The evaluation concerned interventions implemented 
between March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, and August 2021.  
All selected interventions were assessed in terms of their relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability. 
They were assessed in the context of broader UNICEF ECD and COVID-19 programming. 
Evaluation methodology  
Evaluation approach: The evaluation process was based on a developmental evaluation approach 
due to a.) the dynamically changing context of the evaluated interventions and b.) their innovative 
nature. As such, the evaluation focused on generating real-time evidence and learning for UNICEF 
Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine COs that can be used to enhance current programs.  
The evaluation also included elements of a formative evaluation to highlight how the adapted or new 
initiatives are working and what can be learned for future programming. During the evaluation, 
simplified theories of change for the nine more deeply assessed interventions were developed.  
The effectiveness of the remaining interventions was assessed based on results as provided in the 
documentation, where available. 
Data collection: The methodology was based on rapid data collection and analysis cycles, timely 
feedback, and evaluative synthesis and reflection. A mix of qualitative and quantitative research 
methods was used to collect and analyze the data. Desk research encompassed primary and 
secondary sources concerning ECD in four in-depth countries, UNICEF’s programmes, and COVID-19 
related activities in these countries, as well as the assessed interventions specifically. Two to three 
cycles of data collection per country, depending on the CO preferences, were conducted. Each cycle 
included: ● a survey with frontline workers; ● Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with frontline workers, 
Implementing Partners, selected governmental officials, local leaders of public services, and UNICEF 
CO staff; ● a reflection workshop (with exceptions), to discuss findings from Analytical Briefs, from 
which takeaways were recorded. In addition, the evaluation team completed Key Informant 
Interviews with UNICEF staff and Implementing Partners of selected interventions.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION 
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT 
Limitations: Collecting “good enough” evidence outweighed methodological rigor and involvement 
of rights holders in the evaluation process. Online surveys may have excluded frontline workers with 
few digital skills and ICT equipment from participating in the evaluation. Limited secondary and 
primary data were available on interventions not covered by the rapid data collection cycles.  
The evaluation process also revealed certain limitations for UNICEF to implement a developmental 
evaluation (DE) approach to guide adaptation to complex, unpredictable situations such as the 
current global health crisis.  
Evaluation context  
Various restrictions introduced to prevent the transmission of the virus and control the COVID-19 
pandemic have affected early childhood development programmes in the ECA region in multiple 
ways. Some of the main disruptions have entailed: i) loss of access to high-quality early learning;1 
and ii) partial or complete suspension of other face-to-face child and family support services, 
including ECI, nutrition and vaccination programmes, and routine health services for children and 
pregnant women.2 The insights generated on previous epidemics show that the long-term 
consequences of such disruptions for children may include threats to child survival and health, and 
risks for child safety.3  
The implications of these disruptions were not evenly distributed and affected vulnerable children 
and families the most. The global health crisis remains a particularly challenging experience for 
children with developmental delays and/or disabilities, at risk of harm, from families with low 
socioeconomic status, living with single parents, from remote areas. It puts young children at risk of 
falling behind because they and their caregivers often do not receive adequate support and do not 
possess sufficient resources, knowledge, and skills to adjust to the changes instigated by the 
emergency. In addition, social isolation affects the emotional state of family members, especially 
women. During the pandemic, the burden of caring responsibilities was disproportionally higher for 
women than men, particularly during preschools and other care facilities closure.4 
Key findings 
Relevance 
The findings show that, in general, the adaptations in the UNICEF-support for ECD-related services 
were well-suited to respond to the COVID-19 implications in addressing the needs of caregivers 
and children, including those from vulnerable groups. The support concentrated on the caregivers’ 
immediate needs for (i) information and guidance to address the new context and stresses in daily

routines, for enhancing care and learning; (ii) safeguarded access to services adapted to the new 
reality; (iii) access to PPE and hygiene supplies. 
The core purposes of assessed interventions fit well with UNICEF ECD programming and remain 
valid in an emergency context. They respond to systemic gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, such 
as the lack of access to tailored information and support, including mental health support, weak 
coordination among child-related services and policies, neglected health education and promotion, 
limited parent-frontline worker cooperation, and insufficient competencies among ECD staff to 
provide services in the pandemic context. However, without further efforts to strengthen and prioritize 
building strong ECD systems in the ECA region, the systematic bottlenecks may impede the longevity 
of the COVID-induced interventions.  
However, service provision during the pandemic (especially using remote technologies) and 
related trainings for frontline workers have not always considered the specific needs of different 
groups of young children and their families and the ECD professionals working with them.  
Evidence shows that digital solutions are not equally accessible and relevant for all groups, types of 
services, and issues to be addressed. It means that without sufficient infrastructure, equipment, and 
skills, the online mode of delivery alone may decrease access to opportunities for vulnerable children 
and 
parents 
and frontline 
workers in disadvantaged regions. In addition, the 
online 
trainings/meetings appeared to be more difficult for the frontline workers to stay engaged and 
motivated. Without the possibility of real-life simulation, they were also described as less suitable for 
gaining very practical skills. Finally, attitudes towards remote services – their perception as less 
attractive, useful, or trustworthy – can also become a barrier to take-up. For instance, more 
resistance was noted among caregivers to engage on issues related to psychological or emotional 
problems or engage in their children’s ECI. However, in the latter’s case, traditionally high reliance on 
institutional care and the need to be relieved from caregiving duties, e.g., to socialize, have also 
played a role.  
The findings indicate that needs assessment is essential for relevant and flexible COVID-19 
response. While a systematic approach to determining needs has been rather difficult to implement 
during the emergency, less sophisticated pre- and post-training needs assessment has been viewed 
as helpful in capturing the changing needs throughout the pandemic and serving as a feedback 
mechanism. A factor that partially compensated for the limitations in this area and ensured access 
to information on current needs related to the ECD services was the collaboration of line ministries, 
UNICEF, and other donors.  
Effectiveness 
The evaluated interventions equipped the frontline workers with skills and knowledge on how to 
(i) safely deliver face-to-face ECD services, (ii) deliver ECD services remotely, and (iii) support 
caregivers in organizing learning and implementing ECI for their children at homes. Shifting the 
capacity-building activities to an online mode enabled continuity in training provision. In turn, 
adapting the content of the trainings and e-courses to new COVID-19 realities helped improve the 
frontline workers’ awareness and preparedness to adjust the way they provide ECD services. 
Depending on the intervention, from 87% to 100% of the frontline workers surveyed apply the 
knowledge and skills gained from the trainings, courses, and mentoring sessions in their daily work.  
Coupled with providing direct information, guidance, and ECD services to the rights-holders, the 
interventions contributed to continued ECD service delivery for young children and their families

FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT 
in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The interventions also delivered on many critical needs of 
young children and their families that existed before the pandemic, thus contributing to the broader 
UNICEF and national ECD goals in the countries. This was mainly achieved through improving the 
frontline workers’ competencies in using modern, child-centered, and family-centered ECD 
practices. 
The online mode for capacity-building activities or providing ECD Information and services 
directly to the rights holders enabled a broad reach. Many of the interventions far exceeded the 
planned number of beneficiaries trained. They also yielded unintended effects. First, according to the 
key informants, they popularized online professional development in the four countries. Second, the 
savings made by shifting trainings from face-to-face to the online mode enabled the development 
of additional outputs (e.g., manuals or supplementary materials).  
However, the online mode reduced the attractiveness of the trainings for some frontline workers. 
Integrating opportunities for group interaction and follow-up mentoring was seen as necessary to 
alleviate this shortcoming. In addition, requiring digital skills and equipment was considered less 
effective in reaching the most vulnerable young children and their families. In this context, UNICEF’s 
efforts to ensure access to ICT equipment and assistance for the caregivers were assessed as 
valuable facilitating actions. Distributing information offline and on social media also increased the 
accessibility of the assessed services for the most vulnerable. 
At the same time, due to their one-off nature, the majority of the assessed capacity-building 
interventions have not been able to fully prepare the frontline workers to carry out their work in the 
targeted areas. ECD frontline workers who shared their views with the evaluators reported needing 
substantial further mentoring, guidance, and peer-to-peer support to do their work. In the context of 
the pandemic, the need for more guidance on how to (i) provide remote ECD services and (ii) work 
with caregivers and support them in organizing ECE and ECI at home was frequently voiced. 
The effectiveness of the interventions was limited by the low preparedness of caregivers to engage 
in structured activities that support children’s learning and development in the family context, 
poor digital skills, and limited access to ICT equipment among frontline workers and the 
caregivers, and the current policy and regulatory environments. Regarding the former, the 
evaluation showed that caregivers are often skeptical of the effectiveness of online support 
modalities and lack the confidence to become the main providers of structured ECI and ECE for their 
children.  
Finally, COVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing weaknesses in the policy and regulatory environment 
that continued to impact the interventions. These included insufficient financing, poor quality of ECD 
services and infrastructure, lack of multi-sectoral coordination, inadequacies in the legal frameworks, 
insufficient support for professional development and low wages of ECD workers, and lack of financial 
and legal bases for remote provision of ECD services.  
Sustainability 
UNICEF COs in Croatia, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine have taken steps to ensure the sustainability 
of the assessed adaptations introduced in response to COVID-19. There are plans to continue them 
in a new format and context, make them more targeted, include them in national policies, and make 
the learnings available for a wider audience. Notably, the experiences gained from some of the 
responses to COVID-19 are used as an opportunity to strengthen policies and systems concerning 

/ 11 
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION
ECD. Including them in ECD policy and planning contributes to the sustainability of their results and 
more resilient ECD service provision. At the same time, policy – or the lack of it – can hinder the 
sustainability of interventions assessed in this report. For instance, several issues in the regulatory 
and institutional framework concerning EI affect effective ECI service provision in Croatia and Ukraine.   
Prospects for sustainability also increase if the intervention outputs are embedded in a 
professional development system and have the support of relevant stakeholders. Some 
considerable efforts and plans have been identified in this regard, such as the inclusion of manuals, 
recommendations, and online courses into regular professional development programmes. 
Ensuring wider access to the adapted approaches to capacity-building activities is essential to 
achieving sustainable outcomes. In this sense, activities directed at building a broader 
understanding and awareness among peer frontline workers and a wider audience promoted the 
sustainability of the results and measures. This refers to issues such as the importance of 
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic, positive parenting,  cooperation between 
ECD staff and their engagement with parents, or the quality of remote service provision. A range of 
tools and steps implemented across the interventions have been identified to address them with 
potential for further dissemination of the interventions’ outputs and experiences. 
In their effort to adapt their ECD programmes in response to COVID-19, UNICEF COs and RO also aim 
to enhance the longer-term resilience of ECD systems to render them better suited to withstanding 
similar shocks in the future. In this regard, they applied the following main resilience-enhancing 
approaches: 1) alternative and flexible modes of delivering services; 2) coordination of activities 
across government and key stakeholders; 3) organizational learning culture responsive to crises. 
While it was not possible to assess conclusively to what extent these approaches improve the 
resilience of services, especially in the long run, the report presents some notable achievements in 
this regard. 
Conclusions 
In general, the adaptations in the UNICEF-supported ECD services were well suited to respond to the 
COVID-19 context in addressing the needs of caregivers and children. They addressed caregivers’ 
immediate needs for information and guidance to adjust to the new reality of their child’s 
development and safeguarded access to services, PPE, and hygiene supplies. Vulnerable groups 
have been at the center of UNICEF ECD programmes and their adaptations during the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, crucial challenges emerged for reaching out to disadvantaged groups via 
remote modalities. The reasons for this included limited/lack of information about vulnerable children 
and families and their needs and not enough specific guidance on using remote technologies for 
these target groups. 
Increased digitalization of capacity-building activities and service provision in the ECD area was 
one of the main changes accelerated by COVID-19. It made it possible to continue the ECD service 
provision and professional development of ECD staff during the pandemic. The flexibility and cost-
effectiveness of this form of delivery made the interventions more accessible in remote geographical 
areas. Moreover, there is now greater scope for applying distant forms of interaction. However, digital 
solutions are not equally relevant and effective for all groups, types of services, and problems.  
Without sufficient infrastructure, equipment, and skills, choosing an online mode of delivery as the 
only option may decrease access to opportunities for vulnerable children, parents, and frontline 
workers.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION 
FINAL SYNTHESIS REPORT 
The evaluation findings highlight a great need for creating more opportunities for current and 
future frontline workers’ professional development. The main area where improvements are 
needed to increase staff preparedness is the lack of continuous supervision and support to ensure 
the quality of services. More opportunities for networking and exchanging knowledge with peers 
and/or other professionals are also needed. Frontline workers require more guidance and support in 
delivering modern ECD services both in and beyond the context of the pandemic. Communication 
between frontline workers and caregivers is a key area where frontline workers need more training 
and support.  
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed some systemic bottlenecks and gaps in the level of 
preparedness among state actors for a global health crisis, which hinder the effectiveness and 
sustainability of the assessed interventions.5 Caregivers’ awareness and attitudes towards 
pandemic-related changes in service provision is another key factor that hampers quality ECD 
provision during the pandemic.  
UNICEF and its partners’ rapid and responsive reaction to COVID-19 helped ensure ECD services’ 
continued relevance. UNICEF’s management of the interventions and focus on activities directed at 
learning from COVID-19 represent a good example of an adaptive approach. They also reflect the 
flexibility and adaptability of UNICEF COs in an emergency. This was facilitated by collecting “good 
enough” evidence during the emergency to grasp the key needs and respond appropriately.  
Lessons learned  
Lesson learned # 1: The long-standing collaboration between UNICEF, line ministries, civil society 
actors, and donors makes UNICEF and its partners better equipped to cope with the unprecedented 
context and contributes to organizational resilience. 
Lesson learned # 2: Designated strategies to ensure the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups are 
needed when using ICT solutions to deliver ECD services and information to young children and their 
families. 
Lesson learned # 3: Comprehensive information and methodological and mental health support for 
caregivers are essential to provide effective remote ECD support to young children and their families. 
Lesson learned # 4: Delivering capacity-building activities entirely online should be opted for only 
when face-to-face contact is impossible, and hybrid mode should be preferred otherwise. 
Lesson learned # 5: The COVID-19 crisis magnified the value of rapid-learning to adapt the support 
and service delivery to the emergency context.
