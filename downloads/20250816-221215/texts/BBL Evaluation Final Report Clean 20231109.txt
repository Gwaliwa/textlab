Definitions  
To avoid unnecessary confusion, the Bringing Back Learning Evaluation (BBL Evaluation) has applied the 
following definitions for common concepts used. The BBL Evaluation recognizes that there are many other 
definitions that might be valid for other circumstances. 
Concept 
Working definition 
Accessibility 
The extent to which project activities can be reached / obtained by targeted 
beneficiaries; e.g., knowledge about the possibilities to participate, location of 
distributions, etc. 
Activity 
Actions taken or work performed through which inputs, such as funds, technical 
assistance and other types of resources are mobilized to produce specific 
outputs. 
Advocacy 
Any attempt to persuade another side to agree to one’s point of view 
Capacity 
Development / 
Building / 
Strengthening 
The process by which individuals, groups, organizations, institutions and 
countries develop, enhance and organize their systems, resources and 
knowledge, all reflected in their abilities, individually and collectively, to perform 
functions, solve problems and achieve objectives. 
Coherence 
The extent to which activities of different actors are complementary or 
contradictory. 
Communication 
The process of transmitting information in a way that will be understood and thus 
communication goes beyond simple information dissemination. To ensure that 
the information will be understood any communication should be based on a 
good knowledge of the context of the target group, in terms of values, priorities, 
resources, capacities, etc. Communication becomes even more important and 
takes on added dimensions when it involves inter-cultural or inter-organizational 
communication. 
Consultation 
An inclusive process that finds out what targeted stakeholders think about 
specific activities, projects, or approaches. Focus groups, questionnaires, and 
interviews are common consultation techniques. 
Coordination 
The process of systematically analyzing a situation, developing relevant 
information, and informing appropriate command authority of viable alternatives 
for selection of the most effective combination of available resources to meet 
specific objectives. 
Equity 
All children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential 
without discrimination, bias or favouritism. 
Equity based 
approach 
An approach that seeks to understand and address the root causes of inequity 
so that all children, particularly those who suffer the worst deprivations in society, 
have access to education, health care, sanitation, clean water, protection, and 
other services necessary for their survival, growth and development. 
Gender equality 
Women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, 
opportunities, and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women 
and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike. 
National 
This refers to the whole country. In the survey, the national level refers to 
legislation mandated by the central government. 
Ownership 
The targeted stakeholders such as communities, local and national authorities 
exercise effective leadership over the project activities. Ownership is closely

Concept 
Working definition 
linked to effective participation, which should allow only to implement activities 
that have been identified as priorities by the targeted stakeholders. 
Participation 
Participation is about including targeted stakeholders in decision-making 
processes, including identifying needs and solutions and be actively involved in 
project and program design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation.  
Common participatory techniques include facilitated community meetings and 
workshops. 
Social Protection 
Policies and programmes designed to protect people from shocks and stresses 
throughout their lives. It can include safety nets, social insurance schemes, cash 
transfers, labour market regulations or facilitated access to essential services. 
Stakeholders 
Agencies, organizations, groups, or individuals who have a direct or indirect role 
and interest in the objectives and implementation of the project and its evaluation. 
Sub‐national 
This refers to administrative levels that fall below the national level. In the context 
of Myanmar these are states/regions, districts, townships.

Executive Summary 
This report details Evaluation of the Bringing Back Learning Programme (BBL) for Myanmar, termed 
the BBL Evaluation.  The BBL Programme is a programme designed to respond to the twin crisis which 
have emerged in Myanmar.  The first being the Covid-19 pandemic which reached Myanmar on 23 March 
2020.  The second being the February 2021 military takeover d'état in Myanmar when the democratically 
elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed 
by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's military, which then vested power in a military junta.  The confluence of 
Covid-19 and the military takeover has resulted in millions of children and youth now facing 
significant challenges in accessing and continuing with their education due to a multitude of complex 
factors, particularly the most vulnerable children, with long-lasting consequences for their cognitive 
development and their socio-economic futures. 
The BBL programme seeks to address the crisis by providing targeted girls and boys, aged 3 to 18 years 
old, who have been out of learning and have not yet started or completed a primary level education, 
with catch up and remedial education opportunities within their community, with a particular focus 
on literacy, numeracy, life skills and Social and Emotional Learning.  It seeks to achieve this by: i) 
providing girls and boys aged between 3 years old and 18 years old, whose learning has been disrupted, 
with access to education literacy, numeracy, and wellbeing support; ii) Ensuring facilitators, CSO resource 
persons, and community members are well equipped with relevant capacities and receive appropriate 
technical support to deliver context responsive gender sensitive, equity-focused, quality education and 
wellbeing support.  The BBL Programme has special emphasis on those vulnerable children most likely to 
have been impacted by the crisis.  This aligns with the Joint Response Framework2 (JRF) objective of 
ensuring that children and youth in Myanmar re-engage in quality, meaningful, inclusive and gender 
responsive learning in safe, protective environments, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable 
learners such as children from Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), migrant communities, ethnic 
minorities and girls and boys with disabilities or developmental delays and adolescent girls. 
The BBL Programme operates under the modalities of the BBL were developed to be in accordance with 
general guidelines for with the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) guidance3,4 which advise the ‘do no 
harm’ principle and embody the spirit of partnership with CSO and NGO. This has placed an emphasis 
on implementing activities through alternative modalities including partnering with International Non 
Government Organisations (INGO) and National Non Government Organisations (NNGO), community-
based organizations and CSOs, whilst not excluding any child from accessing services.  The BBL 
Programme has a wide geographic focus being active in 14 regions with high deprivation, and 199 
townships throughout Myanmar.  NGO/CSO selected as implementation partners are responsible for 
strengthening and delivering education services in accordance with separate Implementation Partner (IP) 
agreements. 
Sources of funding include Japan, Norway, Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Korea 
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) as 
AusAID.  During 2021 to 2022 GPE funds were utilised to implement the BBL.  UNICEF and DFAT signed 
an agreement in February 2022 to enable utilisation of DFAT funding from June 2022 to June 2023.

4 In non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), education is provided through a range of non-state education service 
providers such as monastic schools and ethnic education working groups and departments.  The guidelines 
stipulate limited engagement with DFA and on implementing activities through alternative modalities including 
partnering with INGO/NNGO, community-based organizations and CSOs, whilst not excluding any child from 
accessing services.
