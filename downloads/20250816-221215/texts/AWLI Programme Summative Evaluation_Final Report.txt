DEFINITIONS 
 
 
Violence Against Women and Children 
Advocacy 
Advocacy supports interventions designed to ensure that the concerns and 
voices of communities, including those marginalised, are reflected in the 
decision making at the community level or higher. 
Child marriage 
From Article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child is any 
human being under the age of 18 unless, under state law, majority is attained 
earlier.   
Early marriage 
“Early marriage” is often used interchangeably with “child marriage” and refers 
to marriages in which one or both spouses are under 18 years old. However, 
early marriage is also sometimes used to describe marriages in which one or 
both spouses are 18 or older, but with a compromised ability to grant consent.1 
Forced marriage 
A forced marriage is any marriage which occurs without the full and free 
consent of one or both of the parties and/or where one or both of the parties 
is/are unable to end or leave the marriage, including as a result of duress or 
intense social or family pressure.2 
 
Social Mobilization 
Behaviour 
change 
communication 
(BCC) 
An approach designed to enhance awareness, knowledge, perceived 
susceptibility, perceived severity, and attitudes and provides the skills needed 
to change harmful behaviours (i.e., early marriage) or to adopt beneficial 
behaviours (i.e., extend girls education).3 
Community 
engagement 
An approach used to share information and engage with people in local 
communities. 
Communication 
for social change 
Seeks to strengthen community capacity to advocate for change and create 
linkages among partners and networks to influence and reinforce social norms 
and cultural practices to create an environment that supports long-term, 
sustainable change.   
Social 
mobilisation 
Social mobilisation is a process that engages and motivates a wide range of 
partners and allies at the provincial and community levels to raise awareness 
of and demand for a particular development objective through dialogue.    
Social and 
Behaviour 
Change (SBC) 
communication 
which is often 
combined with 
BCC 
Another approach designed to enhance interpersonal interactions and support 
within informal networks of relations (i.e., family, friends, peers, neighbors).  
Uses positive normative pressures through training [peer education, life skills 
education, reflect circles] to assist in adopting or reinforcing a new behaviour.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
This UNICEF-commissioned Summative Evaluation of the Afghan Women’s Leadership Initiative in Support 
for Adolescent Girls (AWLI) in Afghanistan covered programme implementation from 2015 through 2020.  
The AWLI programme was originally a three-year programme, from 30 September 2015 through September 
2018 and had a budget of USD 6,949,735.23. However, the programme underwent a no cost extension, 
which essentially resulted in a five-year implementation period. 
 
The programme objectives were to: 
 
Change perceptions on the acceptability of early and forced marriage and mobilize communities to 
delay marriage by raising awareness of adolescent girls’ rights, the laws in place to protect them, the 
negative consequences of early marriage, and the importance of educating girls; 
 
Empower adolescent girls to make informed life choices through education, vocational and life skills 
training, and peer support networks; and 
 
Map and document the status of adolescent girls in Afghanistan. 
 
In response to the Pandemic, a fourth objective was added, “to provide key supplies to adolescent girls 
affected by COVID-19 to prepare them to return to schools when schools are reopened and to have 
continued access and quality education. The AWLI programme completed all implementation on 31 
December 2020.  
 
AWLI’s outreach extended to five provinces, (1) Nangahar, (2) Samangan; (3) Ghor; (4) Herat; and (5) 
Farah, and within each province, four districts were prioritized (totaling 20 districts).  The AWLI programme 
delivered an ambitious range of seven interventions designed to reach the most vulnerable adolescent girls.  
They include:  1. Community Dialogues; 2. Reflect Circles; 3. Safe Spaces and formal and informal 
networks; 4. Mini Media Clubs; and 5.  Community-Based Life Skills Training (for girls only).  A sixth 
intervention, Unconditional Cash Grant, and a seventh activity, Community-Based Livelihood Training for 
adolescent girls, were only undertaken in Herat and Samangan provinces, respectively. Through a 
Programme Cooperation Agreement with ActionAid, and a Consortium of three different non-governmental 
organizations, Empowerment Centre for Women, the Organisation for Humanitarian Welfare, and Women 
Activities and Social Services Association, the UNICEF Afghanistan Country Office (ACO) effectively 
leveraged their influence, innovations, and expertise to realize women and children’s rights in Afghanistan.   
 
EVALUATION PURPOSE & OBJECTIVES 
As per the Terms of Reference (ToR), the purpose of this evaluation is to contribute to:  
(i) 
evidence-based and risk-informed programming on increasing access of out-of-school (OoS) 
adolescent girls to secondary education; 
(ii) 
programming on changing societal perceptions about: (a) child marriage practices; and (b) girls’ 
empowerment in Afghanistan; and  
(iii) 
institutional learning about the complex relationships linking financial incentives, education, and 
perceptions on child marriage/girls’ empowerment.  
As there is limited global evidence connecting these variables (i.e., school attendance, perceptions on child 
marriage, and girl’s empowerment), the results from this evaluation are also expected to add value to the 
global movements to end child marriage and promote girl’s education.   
 
 
 

 
 
 
10 
This summative evaluation’s objectives are to: 
 
Measure the relevance, effectiveness, cohesion, efficiency, sustainability and impact of the AWLI 
programme in regard to increasing school enrolment of adolescent girls and stimulating social 
behaviour change related to perceptions of child marriage and girls’ empowerment; and 
 
Identify [and confirm] gaps in the programme results chain/Theory of Change (ToC), lessons learned, 
and provide recommendations on how to design, implement, and scale up similar programmes in the 
rest of Afghanistan. 
 
The intended audience is UNICEF, the United States Government (Secretary’s Office of Global Women’s 
Issues), and practitioners dedicated to the movement to end early marriage.  
 
EVALUATION METHODOLOGY 
This evaluation employs a combination of a theory-driven approach and utilization-focused approach and 
relies heavily on a ToC in order to understand better the degree to which programme participants have 
been impacted by the programme.   The overall design of this study is mixed methods, leveraging both 
qualitative and quantitative evidence to answer the Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) (see below).  The 
main information sources collected and used were:  
 
1. Documents which included pre-existing qualitative and quantitative information based on the existing 
logframe activity, outputs, and baseline data;  
2. Primary data from key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) at community 
levels; and  
3. Existing M&E data, including Post Distribution Monitoring and UNICEF’s Results Assessment Module. 
 
The Team Leader traveled to Afghanistan and consulted with stakeholders (n=54), and roughly a one-half 
of the sample was female.  Although the programme covers five provinces, only three, provinces 
were selected for primary data collection, including Herat, Nangarhar, and Samangan.  Nine districts were 
sampled with a total of 162 persons interviewed and an additional 11 people from focus group discussions 
with Implementing Partners (IPs).  The entire sample is 67% female. 
 
KEY EVALUATION QUESTIONS 
The evaluation adhered to the OECD-DAC evaluation criteria and therefore responded to the following 
questions: 
Relevance: Assessment of alignment of the AWLI 
interventions to the local context as well as national 
strategies and policies of Afghanistan and UNICEF, 
especially among the most deprived sections of the 
population, including validating existing adolescent 
programming ToC. 
 
To what extent does the programme design and 
implementation fit the local context, including the 
conflict context, and what measures were taken to 
adapt to changes in the context? 
 
Is the programme aligned with the national 
strategies and policies of Afghanistan and the 
UNICEF Global Strategic Plan 2018-2021? 
 
To what extent does the programme address and 
meet the needs of adolescent girls and their 
families, especially those that are OoS? 
 
 
Effectiveness: The extent to which the programme’s 
intended results were achieved at the output level. 
 
To what extent did UNICEF deliver on its intended 
outputs?   
 
What were the major factors influencing the 
successful delivery of outputs?  
 
To what extent were the programme interventions 
taken up by target programme beneficiaries? 
 
Which factors impeded programme delivery and 
take-up and how could these have been overcome?  
 
Did the programme effectively manage conflict-
related risks? 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
11 
Efficiency: The extent to which the programme’s 
outputs were delivered in a timely and cost-efficient 
manner:   
 
Were the programme outputs achieved according to 
the work plan and timeline?  
 
Were the programme outputs achieved according to 
the budget and cost-efficiently? 
 
What were the major factors influencing the efficient 
delivery of outputs?  
 
Sustainability: 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
AWLI 
interventions can be scaled up, and the capacity of 
Government partners to assume the responsibility of 
carrying these initiatives forward:    
 
What strategies and interventions of the programme 
are most likely to be scaled up or sustained after the 
implementation of the programme? 
 
What would facilitate or impede the scale-up of the 
AWLI intervention? 
 
Have beneficiaries indicated any interest in seeing 
the programme scaled? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Coherence: The extent to which other interventions with 
similar objectives complement or contradict the 
programme and vice versa. 
 
How compatible was the AWLI programme with 
other interventions aimed at:  
1. 
achieving girl’s empowerment? 
2. 
increasing school attendance?  
3. 
reducing child marriage?  
Please include internationally-led, nationally-led, and 
local grassroots interventions. What synergies, linkages, 
contradictions, duplications, exist?  
 
Impact: The extent to which the project has increased 
secondary school enrolment of out of school adolescent 
girls and changed social behaviours and attitudes 
towards child marriage:     
 
What difference has the project made in changing 
perceptions of the target groups on child marriage? 
Have they delayed marriage by raising awareness 
on the rights of adolescent girls to education, or for 
other reasons?  
 
Has the project made a difference in adolescent 
girls’ lives by increasing their ability to make life 
choices?  
 
How successful has the combination of social 
mobilization activities and cash transfers been on 
increasing secondary enrolment rates of adolescent 
girls and changing social behaviour towards child 
marriage vis-à-vis social mobilization interventions 
alone? 
 
What were the effects, intended or unintended, that 
the programme had on sources of tension and 
sources of cohesion in the 20 districts where it 
worked, and how were these monitored over time?  
 
 
Findings 
Relevance 
AWLI’s design emanates from an evidence-based assessment of national priorities at the provincial levels, 
regional research trends, and a thorough alignment with both national strategies and UNICEF’s Strategic & Action 
Plans.  Frequently, prevention programmes which seek to fulfill a gender inequality goal isolate women and girls 
and fail to recognize the interconnected nature of the linkages among gender inequality, limited access to 
education, and small enterprise.  However, AWLI is unique, in that it applied a multi-sectoral approach to promote 
girls’ education and reduce early marriage by recognizing the social, economic, political, cultural, and religious 
drivers of child marriage.  It also targeted the needs of vulnerable, out of school girls in conflict and hard-to-reach 
contexts with the promotion of education.  Findings illustrate, however, that AWLI could have been more inclusive, 
focusing on girls and boys, as the inclusion of men and boys tends to result in greater programme sustainability 
with longer lasting behavior change. 

 
 
 
12 
Effectiveness 
The AWLI programme delivered almost all of its planned 
outputs. While the number of adolescents that the programme 
reached exceeded its target, the number of girls directly 
experiencing the programme was only 82 percent (or 164,207 
out of 200,000) of its target. Stakeholders reported that a strong 
feature of the programme was the premise of solving one’s own 
problems within the community, which may have contributed to 
the unanimous request for the programme to continue. The 
positive reflections about AWLI do not imply that there were no 
challenges. Indeed, there were many factors which impeded 
programme delivery. For example, IPs initially experienced 
verbal and physical resistance from communities, because 
talking about early marriage and the promotion of girl’s 
education were, and continue to be, very sensitive topics. 
However, five key innovations laid the foundation for attitudinal 
and behaviour change at the community level (see text box). 
 
While it is recognized that Community-based Livelihood Training was only implemented in Samangan, and 
Unconditional Cash Grants were only distributed in Herat, the Mini Media Clubs, Safe Spaces, Community-based 
Life Skills Training were implemented equally to all provinces. The uptake, however, varied remarkably in each 
province.  For example, in Samangan, the adolescent girls who were exposed to “tailoring” through the 
Community-based Livelihood Training continue to engage in this activity. All recipients of an Unconditional Cash 
Grant reported spending funds on education, although some mentioned spending funds on other items.  The Mini 
Media Clubs also had good uptake, as IP service providers in Nangahar and Herat noted that the children share 
the messages discussed at the club with their families when they go back home.  The use of Safe Space facilities 
was variable.  For example, in Samangan and Nangahar, the communities in these provinces are more traditional, 
and so the Safe Spaces, functioned more like venues for awareness raising meetings.  The demand for the Safe 
Space services in Herat, however, exceeded supply.  Through the Community-based Life Skills Training, 
programme participants were exposed to hygiene practices, and, unlike the other provinces a set of beneficiaries 
in Samangan opened as small shop which sells hygiene products and offers consultations to women.  Finally, 
several factors limited the effective delivery of programme services, including: (1) partner capacity limitations; (2) 
government policies on Community -based Livelihood Training; and (3) insecurity.   
 
Efficiency 
In spite of established procedures and practices guiding implementation processes, it was noted that there were 
multiple changes in key leadership positions within UNICEF Afghanistan. The ACO is categorized as a Non-Family 
Duty Station, which means that staff are allowed Rest and Recuperation (R&R) travel to support a work-life 
balance. Evaluation findings indicate that there were three different country representatives over five years and 
three different AWLI programme managers during the same period. The change in leadership adversely affected 
the efficiency of programme management. Other factors hindering the efficient delivery of outputs and reducing 
the programme’s ability to fully meet its targets  included: (1) capacity limitations of the consultants who 
experienced significant challenges conducting the baseline assessment, and (2) movement restrictions linked to 
the Pandemic.  Moreover, though monitoring data was gender disaggregated, some data was not consistently 
separated by age, which is a critical gap when managing a programme that focuses on adolescents.  UNICEF 
has used a mix of strategies to implement AWLI, and one of the most cost-efficient ones was during the Pandemic. 
Findings show that the  procurement of recreation and hygiene kits and handwashing stations (the fourth objective) 
was successful, as this component not only expended a preexisting surplus of funds, but it also exceeded the 
planned target.   
Sustainability 

Having a clear message.   

Involving male messengers who are 
respected and trusted; 

The IP employed knowledgeable staff 
who both knew the Quran and worked 
with powerful community actors;  

The IPs leveraged female community 
champions and government officials 
who wanted to help; and  

Ensured that a literate person took part 
in the Reflect Circles, so that they 
could follow up on the results from the 
Problems and Solutions Tree.
