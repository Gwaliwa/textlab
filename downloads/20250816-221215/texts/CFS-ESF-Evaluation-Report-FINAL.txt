Executive Summary 
In 2019, UNICEF’s Eastern Caribbean Area (ECA) office contracted the American Institutes 
for Research (AIR) to conduct an evaluation of UNICEF’s Child Friendly Schools (CFS) 
framework in use in the ECA, and its version for secondary schools called Effective Schools 
(ES). This evaluation was intended to inform the effective scaling and use of the CFS/ES in 
the region. AIR engaged Targeted Developed Consulting (TDC) as a regional partner for this 
evaluation. This document is the report of findings from AIR’s and TDC’s evaluation.  
Overview of the Child Friendly Schools/Effective Schools Framework 
UNICEF first introduced the CFS framework globally in 
the 1990s. The UNICEF ECA office began to promote the 
use of the CFS/ES framework in the region in 2007, and 
it was endorsed by the Organisation of Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) Ministers of Education and the 
CARICOM Council on Human and Social Development. 
In 2014, the ECA OFFICE adapted CFS for secondary schools, under the name Effective 
Schools. The CFS/ES framework is intended to help countries and schools achieve United 
Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality 
education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all). In the ECA, CFS/ES was 
intended to help countries and schools address poor educational outcomes (especially for 
boys and for children from marginalised backgrounds), due in part to low school safety and 
school effectiveness.  
Dimensions and cross-cutting themes. The CFS/ES framework incorporates five key 
dimensions and two crosscutting themes. The dimensions are behaviour management, 
school safety and security, student participation, life skills, and inclusive education. The 
crosscutting themes are gender equality and parental involvement.  
How it works. At the regional level, UNICEF and its partners (OECS, CARICOM and the 
University of the West Indies) provide leadership, funding, and/or technical assistance to 
help countries adopt CFS/ES. At the country level, CFS/ES is promoted through CFS/ES focal 
points (embedded in ministries of education), government policymakers and education 
officials, teacher training institutions, school staff, parents and community partners.  
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Intended Audience 
Purpose. The purpose of the evaluation of the CFS/ES framework was threefold: (1) Inform 
strategic planning in the education sector across the ECA; (2) provide stakeholders with an 
understanding of the effectiveness and efficiency of CFS/ES planning, implementation and 
monitoring activities in the ECA, in order to update/refine the frameworks and improve 
CFS/ES is not a programme, 
but rather a framework or 
model that countries can use 
to guide their thinking, 
planning, and programming.

programme design; and (3) ensure that countries in the ECA provide students with a safe 
and effective learning environment.  
Objectives. The four objectives for this work were to determine (1) the effectiveness of 
CFS/ES in changing education policy, practice and school culture at the central ministry and 
school levels; (2) programme relevance and sustainability and the operational effectiveness 
and efficiency of the current approaches, and recommend course corrections; 
(3) implications and requirements for full scale-up and rollout of redesigned CFS/ES 
programming within the context of wider educational reforms; and (4) opportunities, 
constraints, lessons and good practices from ongoing processes. 
Intended audience. The primary audience for this evaluation included governments in the 
ECA and UNICEF. Secondary users included other regional actors such as the OECS 
Commission, the CARICOM Secretariat and other non-governmental organizations, and 
international development partners, and stakeholders from other child- and family-serving 
systems at the country or regional levels. 
Methodology 
The research team conducted a process evaluation of the CFS/ES framework involving a 
desk review, primary qualitative data collection, and extant data analysis. The summative 
portion of the evaluation documented progress related to the introduction and uptake of 
the CFS/ES framework, while the formative portion generated evidence-based 
recommendations to improve uptake and effectiveness of CFS/ES across the ECA. The 
evaluation focused on Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia. It 
included 55 interviews with government officials, representatives from regional-level 
organizations, education consultants, heads of teacher training institutions, and school 
heads; and 53 focus groups and 10 surveys of teachers, non-teaching staff, parents, and 
students.1 The evaluation also included a desk review across the region, and interviews with 
CFS/ES focal points in all 12 of the regions countries/territories.  
Key Findings  
The evaluation addressed five areas under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria: relevance, 
coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.2  
Relevance. Countries and schools had adopted several aspects of CFS/ES, and most 
stakeholders considered the programming to be necessary and beneficial. For many 
stakeholders, CFS/ES was synonymous with the adoption of positive behaviour management 
(PBM), rather than being viewed more holistically. Teachers and other school staff saw the

other school staff, parents, and students.

benefits of promoting positive student behaviours and giving acknowledgement, and took 
steps to do so. Educators thought it was important for their schools to improve safety and 
address bullying. 
Countries saw the value of governance, coordination, and management to promote CFS/ES 
(or its elements), but faced difficulties in doing these things in practice. Where a Health and 
Family Life Education (HFLE) was in use, educators and parents agreed that the topics 
addressed were appropriate.  
For many, “student participation” was synonymous with students signing up for activities. 
Across the ECA, there was little evidence for policies related to student councils. Educators 
had mixed views on whether it was appropriate for students to be given a voice or power.  
And finally, inclusive education was not a priority in the region, and received little attention. 
Coherence. CFS/ES programming is being integrated with other sector-level initiatives and 
requirements at both regional and national levels. At the school level, there was a barrier to 
the adoption of CFS/ES, in that teachers felt like it was another programme that had to be 
added to their other responsibilities. They did not view CFS/ES framework as providing 
better ways to do things that they were already doing, and or to help them achieve their 
goals. Teachers also noted that they did not have all of the resources they needed to 
increase their use of student-centred teaching or student supports. Introduction of ES into 
secondary schools is currently hampered by a combination of lack of buy-in and lack of 
resources. Despite these challenges, schools were making progress in adopting CFS/ES 
framework. There was cross-sectoral collaboration to meet the holistic needs of children at 
the national level, but there was little evidence for this at the school level.   
Efficiency. There was little evidence that countries leveraged other activities to improve 
adoption of CFS/ES programming. The implementation of CFS/ES framework is very focused 
on national focal points and guidance counsellors and has not fully expanded to include 
ownership by education systems and educators more broadly.  
Effectiveness. Countries highly valued the support they received for CFS/ES at the regional 
level, but lacked sufficient monetary and human resources to implement CFS/ES to the 
extent that they would want. Educators also still struggled with how to implement CFS/ES 
on the ground, and there were requests for additional training, technical assistance and 
examples/models that could help build educator capacity.  
To address student misbehavior, schools were using some PBM, but negative methods were 
also much in use (especially if positive methods did not seem to work). School safety was a 
concern, with students bullied by peers as well as by some teachers. Many schools 
encouraged students’ heathy eating and exercise. And finally, inclusive education was not a 
priority in the region, and there was little evidence that schools were promoting it.

Across the region, students did engage in decision making in some classrooms, but most 
schools did not provide opportunities for students to participate in decision making in ways 
that would impact their school. There were gaps in available student attendance data. 
Student attendance rates in Saint Lucia were relatively flat since the introduction of CFS/ES 
framework (and the evaluation team did not have data from elsewhere), and this pattern 
was the same for girls and for boys. The team was unable to identify any consistent 
relationships between the introduction of CS/ES and student persistence in school. 
Sustainability. The CFS/ES model is reflected in some education policies in the region, but 
there are persistent policy gaps in critical areas such as positive discipline. Governments are 
concerned about lack of financial and human resources to implement and continue CFS/ES 
(but also miss opportunities to gain efficiencies). Countries lack effective monitoring or QA 
systems, including in areas aligned with CFS/ES. This data deficit makes it difficult for 
countries to make evidence-based decisions in the education sector. 
Conclusions  
This section presents our conclusions in reference to the relevance, coherence, efficiency, 
effectiveness, and sustainability of the CFS/ES framework.  
Relevance. Stakeholders at the regional, national, and school levels found the CFS/ES 
framework to be relevant, and there was buy-in at all of these levels for CFS overall. On the 
positive side, the framework helped countries built up their national cross-sector 
collaboration in an effort to help achieve the goals of CFS/ES – however, this collaboration 
did not extend to the school level, where it would be beneficial. Educators were uncertain 
or had mixed views about the relevance of some aspects of CFS/ES framework – especially 
in areas such as student participation and PBM.   
Coherence. At the national level, the CFS/ES initiative had external coherence with other 
initiatives within the education sector as well as those in adjacent sectors, such as child 
protection. Some aspects of CFS/ES (such as differentiated instruction and student-centred 
learning) were starting to be integrated into the curricula of teacher training institutions. 
However, CFS/ES initiatives were often not coherent with other things that were happening 
at the classroom level, with CFS/ES being viewed as “one more thing” for teachers to 
accomplish, rather than a new way to accomplish existing work. In terms of internal 
coherence, CFS/ES principles aligned with schools and teacher training institutions’ existing 
efforts to adopt approaches that characterized CFS/ES principles, such as differentiated 
instruction and student-centred learning. 
Efficiency. There was substantial room for improvement in terms of the extent to which 
CFS/ES delivered, or is likely to deliver, results in an economical and timely way. Schools 
were not making efforts to leverage other activities or initiatives to promote CFS/ES-related 
information or goals. As noted above, many teachers viewed CFS/ES as something extra to
