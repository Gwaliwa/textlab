The Formative Evaluation of the Domestic

I 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This report is produced as part of the Formative Evaluation of the Domestic Violence 
Prevention Programme (hereinafter referred to as DVPP or the Programme) designed and 
implemented by the National Family Safety Programme (NFSP), a semi-government entity that 
operates under the Ministry of National Guard (Health Affairs). The Programme was rolled out as 
a pilot to educate and sensitize communities to the risks of domestic violence (DV) and child abuse 
(CA) - with particular focus on women, girls, boys and older people.  
At the request of NFSP, UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO) commissioned this formative evaluation 
which was implemented parallel to the pilot roll out. AAN Associates17 was contracted to plan and 
implement this evaluation (undertaken between November 2020 to October 2021). The 
evaluation’s implementation and analysis (of programme effectiveness and efficiency) were 
constrained by the absence of key documentation such as a proposal, results framework, budget, 
progress reports and expenditure statements. Where appropriate and plausible, primary data was 
gathered to deepen understanding of the intervention, obtain findings (around achievements and 
challenges) and draw conclusions and recommendations. The report comprises five chapters and 
a series of appendices. 
Context and Intervention  
The Government of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (GoKSA) recognises both issues of DV and CA. Data 
(2010-2015) suggest that one in every three women in KSA is a victim of domestic violence and 
the lifetime prevalence of DV ranges between 39.3% and 44.5%.18 In KSA in 2020, there were 
approximately 1,601 cases of CA recorded, subjected to at least one form of child abuse.19 The 
breadth and the relative acceptance of these violations justifies the need for intervention. There is 
growing realization within the GoKSA of the need to address the issue by promoting prevention 
and instituting measures to effectively respond to DV and CA cases. One key institutional response 
by the GoKSA includes the formation of NFSP (in 2005), with a mandate to support policy and 
advocacy actions to help end DV and CA in KSA.  
Object of the Evaluation  
The DVPP is a pilot intervention led by the NFSP. The Programme aims to strengthen the capacity 
of educators, social workers, childcare providers, families and parents to advocate for prevention 
of DV and more effectively respond to child rights violations. Though originally planned to be rolled 
out in 2020, implementation was delayed by a year due to COVID-19 related restrictions. The 
pilot’s implementation was initiated in January 2021 for an anticipated 12 months. Implementation 
of the pilot was initially planned for Riyadh and one other location; however, Programme’s 
geographic scope has been expanded to all 13 provinces (nationwide).  
The Programme has three strategic pillars or components i.e., forging partnerships to leverage 
partners’ outreach to target communities (with seven public sector and CSOs);20 training and 
capacity building of partners’ staff (mainly the staff that interfaces with the communities at large, 
including social workers, educators, childcare providers and others); and community education 
and awareness through the cadre of trained network of extension workers (referred to as 
Awareness Specialists). 
The NFSP developed a training package of eight modules comprising: 1) First thousand days of 
life (module for infant and mother health); 2) Do not shake me (Shaken Baby Syndrome);21 3) We 
wish you safety (prevention module on child neglect) 4) Your family your safety (prevention module

on parental treatment of children); 5) My child is my responsibility (prevention module on sexual 
violence against children); 6) No bullying (prevention module on peer violence); 7) They are 
success (prevention module on violence against women); 8) Charity (prevention module on 
violence against elderly). The plan included training of Master Trainers (by the NFSP), where each 
Master Trainer is expected to train at least 100 frontline staff, who in turn organize community 
sessions and train 200 community members. The Programme’s sensitisation approach included 
application of interpersonal communication approaches (IPC) to reach out to community members 
to educate them about the problem, causes, manifestations, rights and available recourses, to 
enable them to take effective preventive and response actions.  
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope  
This evaluation is formative in nature. It was commissioned with the intent to focus on learning to 
inform future design and implementation. The purpose of this evaluation is to systematically assess 
the design and implementation of the pilot; identify gaps and challenges; and outline 
recommendations to inform the future scale-up. Evaluation objectives include: i) assessment of 
the training package for appropriateness to the local context and alignment with national and 
international standards; ii) obtain feedback from the trainees (Master Trainers and Awareness 
Specialists) on the training contents and delivery approaches; iii) document perceptions of 
community members on perceived changes in knowledge, awareness and practices around DV 
and CA; and iv) identify gaps and challenges and outline recommendations for future upscaling.  
The evaluation scope includes assessment of activities undertaken in the pilot phase, implemented 
in all 13 provinces of KSA from November 2020 – October 2021. The evaluation followed the 
selected OECD-DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's - Development 
Assistance Committee) criteria i.e., relevance, effectiveness and efficiency. Keeping in view the 
nature of the social problems (DV and CA) and evaluation expectations, the evaluators added 
dimensions of the Human-Rights-Based-Approach (HRBA), gender equality (GE) and equity, 
considered as cross-cutting programming priorities (addressed as non-DAC criterion).  
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations  
The evaluation is participatory22 whereby all key stakeholders were consulted, and their opinions 
have informed the evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations. The evaluators applied 
a Hybrid evaluation design23 featuring two sub-designs i.e., descriptive content analysis24 and 
contribution analysis25 (more details are available in the report).  
The evaluation relied primarily on qualitative methods. A total of 12 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) 
were conducted with stakeholders including NFSP, Implementing Partners (IPs) and UNICEF GAO 
(six male and six female participants). Moreover, 8 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were 
conducted with 23 male and 33 female participants (including Master Trainers, Awareness 
Specialists and community members). The evaluation team also observed two training events. The 
evaluators interacted with 68 participants (including 29 male and 39 female participants) who 
informed the evaluation findings and recommendations. The evaluation is further informed by the 
findings from the desk research of 72 internal and external documents. The evaluation design, 
methods and implementation placed a considered focus on the integration of human rights-based 
programming, gender equality and equity. Integration was ensured by developing separate 
evaluation questions, tools, analysis and findings sections for three cross-cutting programming 
priorities.  
 
22 Participatory Evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. 
This involvement can occur at any stage of the evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and 
analysis and the reporting of the study 
23 Hybrid design combines specific elements of particular study designs to maximise the quality and rigour of the study output. 
24Descriptive content analysis examines the quantitative and qualitative data collected through methods such as e.g., 
document analysis and literature review with the aim of summarising the informational contents of these data with respect to 
the research question. The informational content is presented in a straight and descriptive summary structured according to the 
needs of the study.  
25 Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to observed results.

III 
Limitations of the evaluation include: remote data collection (created a selection bias for those with 
access to tools such as internet and phones); lack of documentation (compensated for by collection 
of primary data); and reduced field data collection (planned FGDs were reduced due to 
considerable delays in roll out of community sessions).  
Evaluation Findings and Preliminary Conclusions 
Relevance  
The Programme is concluded to be ‘Relevant’ for prioritizing two widespread, multi-faceted social 
problems (DV and CA) that carry serious consequences for women, boys, girls and older persons. 
The significance and relevance are illuminated for the fact that these are prevalent issues in Saudi 
and are embedded in upbringing processes and affects infants, girls, boys, married women and 
older persons. Over time, there has been growing realization by public authorities to take 
appropriate policy and institutional actions to address these issues. Prioritization of the issue is 
evident from the fact that these issues are registered in public sector documents such as Saudi 
Vision 2030, Child Protection Law (2014) and Regulation on Protection against Abuse (2012), 
among others. The fact that a NFSP-sponsored initiative is currently being implemented shows the 
importance that these issues have attained over time. The contents (of the training modules) are 
largely appropriate, however with an overwhelming focus on addressing behavioural causes of CA 
and DV. The content excluded the legislative, policy and socioeconomic causes contributing to 
perpetuation of such behaviours.  
Effectiveness  
Keeping in view evaluation expectations, the evaluation team used the three Programme 
strategies/components for assessment of effectiveness including: i) multi-stakeholder 
partnerships; ii) training and capacity development of partners; and iii) community education and 
awareness. For partnerships, the Programme is assessed as ‘Partly Effective’ for successfully 
engaging 7 of the 10 planned partners. Moreover, selection of partners offers a mix of public sector 
and CSO partners, with outreach and technical capacities. There are evident gaps around 
formalization and coordination/management of partnerships. Similarly, the training and capacity 
development component is assessed as ‘Partly Effective’. Reasons include: i) successful 
development of eight training modules; ii) application of cascade training approach whereby NFSP 
trained the Master Trainers, who in turn train Awareness Specialists, expected to organise 
sessions for community members; and iii) evident coherence and consistency of training contents 
with national and international norms and standards. Gaps in training content include: lack of 
relevant information on available response mechanisms for lodging complaint against perpetrators; 
insufficient training delivery time (e.g., 8 modules in one session highlighted by extension workers); 
and absence of in house roll-out plans (e.g. duration for completion of planned workshops and 
target audience) affected the timely completion of the pilot phase. The community awareness 
component was not assessed, as the Programme is significantly behind schedule (only one IP has 
managed to conduct26 limited community sessions). Feedback from community sessions indicate 
that communities are appreciative of the initiative and are hopeful for the trainings to change public 
perception on DV and CA over time.  
Programme design and implementation thus far is marked by multiple enablers and disablers. The 
key enablers include: commitment and capacities of NFSP to lead this intervention (with 
established rapport in the sector); training contents being useful to the communities; and 
availability of willing and capable partners that provide wider outreach to target communities. The 
achievements were undermined by multiple disablers including: gaps in formalizing engagement 
with partners resulting in limited clarity around roles and expectations between NFSP and partners; 
and limited/no incentives for partners’ staff to participate in the Programme. The evaluators noted 
gaps in the training content and delivery. These include: limited clarity around goals and objectives 
for each module; inappropriate and missing citations; limited focus on persons with disability

(PWDs); and insufficient training delivery time. Gaps in the monitoring system included reliance on 
self-reporting and lack of instructions to use evaluation tools.  
Efficiency 
Based on available information (drawn mostly from primary sources), the approach of leveraging 
partnerships (using the staff and volunteers from IPs for wider outreach) is deemed cost and time 
efficient. Programme implementation is behind schedule and the key reasons for delay include: 
delayed nominations of Master Trainers and finalisation of their agreements; lack of clarity and 
timeline (from NFSP) for IPs to roll out internal training and community sessions; and unavailability 
of partner staff due to long breaks from work for observance of rituals (such as Ramadan and Hajj). 
These delays affected the progress thus far and it looks unlikely that Programme will be completed 
in the planned 12 months. Using existing human resources (within IPs) undercuts the need for 
funds. In terms of human resources, adequate staff and volunteers are available with the IPs. 
However, there are evident capability gaps (mostly in terms of training background of Master 
Trainers and Awareness Specialists), coupled by limited incentives and motivation for staff and 
volunteers. This being a pilot, the focus has been on rolling out the programme using the planned 
approach, rather than exploring alternatives. The evaluators nevertheless looked at successful 
examples of behavioural change programmes and cited two examples (Egypt and Democratic 
Republic of Congo), which highlight the use of mass media (including social media) and 
engagement with influencers (social and religious leaders) for better outreach and influence on 
changing behaviours around under-discussed issues of the community. 
Gender Equality, Equity and HRBA  
Gender Equality: The findings suggest partial integration of gender equality principles in the design, 
implementation and tracking of results. The training contents demonstrate a considerable focus on 
causes, manifestation, implications, needs and recourses for women, girls, boys and older 
persons. This shows a demonstrated focus on creating contents based on sex and age. The 
trainers (both Master Trainers and Awareness Specialists) include a noticeable number of women 
trainers. This bodes well as these women are likely better able to reach out to women and children, 
whilst overcoming sex-based segregation. The shift to online training (of trainers and the 
community sessions) is likely to enable more women and girls to participate. However, the 
Programme does not focus on tracking gender-based results.  
Equity: The training contents highlight groups at greater risk e.g., married women, women from 
low economic strata or low education level, children from broken families or single parents, and 
others. This bodes well for equity integration in terms of contents. There are gaps, such as limited 
focus on PWDs, non-citizens and others.  
HRBA: The Programme was assessed on key elements of HRBA (often referred to as PANEL).27 
The Programme is in compliance with: a) Partnerships: for forging partnerships with relevant 
actors; b) Empowerment: whereby community members know about their rights; and c) Legality: 
for aligning with national and international laws. The Programme falls short in complying with the 
principles of non-discrimination and equality (given the Programme’s implementation excluded 
non-Arabic speakers and people without access to internet to online training), and accountability 
(implementation lacks a complaint or reporting mechanism). 
Conclusions 
Given the enormity of the scale and consequences of DV and CA for victims and the community, 
the evaluation team concludes that the intervention is much needed for a context like KSA. While 
the intervention merits continuity, evaluators underline the need for sweeping yet urgent design 
and operational changes to help women, older persons, boys and girls to benefit fully and widely. 
The aspects around which a considered re-thinking is needed include: partnership formalisation 
and management; training content improvements and delivery improvisation; engagement with
