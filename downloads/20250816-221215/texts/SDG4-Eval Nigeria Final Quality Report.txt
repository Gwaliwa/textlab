Nigeria is the first country in the Global South to have 
undergone independent evaluations of SDG3-Health 
and SDG4-Education. With these evaluations, both the 
Government of Nigeria and the development partners join 
forces to reshape evidence-based policies, strategies and 
investments that will help Nigeria accelerate its progress 
towards achieving these SDGs.  
The independent SDG4-Education Evaluation is a 
systematic and rigorous policy analysis of the effectiveness, 
impact and underlying driving factors influencing the 
Education Sector Strategic Plan 2016–2019’s progress 
towards SDG4 in Nigeria. The findings of this strategic 
evaluation furnish further evidence for improving the 
rights of children to education in Nigeria and how 
the Government of Nigeria, along with development 
partners and civil society, can best address systemic gaps 
and challenges, including the negative effects of the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to progress on our shared 
commitment to the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
This report documents the evidence of how Nigeria 
is progressing in its implementation of its National 
Strategic Education Plan, a roadmap for bringing learning 
skills to all Nigerian children. The report includes 
findings, conclusions, and key recommendations for the 
Government of Nigeria to consider to strengthen policy 
and improve education financing and learning systems to 
meet the ambitious goals and targets of the SDG4. We are 
positive that the recommendations from the evaluation 
will enable the Government of Nigeria to make further 
progress on achieving SDG4 targets by 2030.
We would like to recognize the leadership role played 
by OSSAP-SDGs, the Federal Ministry of Finance, 
Budget and National Planning, and the Federal Ministry 
of Education, and we are grateful for the technical and 
financial support provided by UNICEF Nigeria Country 
Office. We thank UNICEF’s Evaluation Manager 
and Education Section for shepherding this strategic 
evaluation in close collaboration with OSSAP-SDGs and 
we appreciate all key players from the academia, civil 
society and development partners (UNDP, UNESCO, UN 
RCO, FCDO, USAID, the World Bank) that contributed 
to the assessment. 
On behalf of the Government of Nigeria and UNICEF 
Nigeria Country Office, we take this opportunity to 
reiterate our commitment to continue working together 
to achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda, 
including SDG4, which is to improve universal access to 
inclusive quality basic education in Nigeria.
The Federal Government of Nigeria is fully committed to achieving the global agenda of universal 
prosperity for all Nigerian citizens in accordance with the SDGs Equity Principle of “Leaving No One 
Behind”. Consequently, the government has made adequate institutional framework for the SDGs to 
ensure strong leadership and coordination for the development agenda. This institutional framework, 
which has its anchor in the Presidency, is called the Office of the Special Assistant to the President 
on Sustainable Goals (OSSAP-SDGs). This Office is decentralized to all 36 States and to key ministries. 
The Global Agenda has been fully domesticated in the country through the development of SDGs 
Implementation Plan 2020–2021 and is well aligned with the National Development Plan and the 
Sectors Strategic Plans. Nigeria has also successfully completed the 2017 and 2020 Voluntary National 
Reviews (VNR).
