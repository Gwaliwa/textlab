Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India 
Evaluation Report 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Background and Context:  
The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (Novel 
Coronavirus Disease 2019), which 
first struck India in March 2020, 
created 
an 
unprecedented 
emergency 
globally, 
its 
effects 
reaching far beyond the health sector 
to almost all other areas of social and 
economic well-being. Health and 
nutrition as critical developmental 
indicators suffered in many parts of 
the country due to halted service 
delivery and public confusion around 
health-related guidelines. This confusion resulted froma lack of clear-cut and lucid communication around 
masking, lockdown protocol and what constituted essential services, as well as if government-mandated 
health and nutrition outlets would continue to function. For example, the number of pregnant women that 
received 4 or more Antenatal Care (ANC) check-ups in India reduced by more than 40% in April 2020 compared 
to the pre-lockdown period (Jan 20 - March 20). Further, given that most health functionaries were 
predominantly engaged in COVID-19 related activities, Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) check-ups were 
40% lower in April 2020 vis-à-vis April 2019.1  
However, overall, the Government of India’s (GoI) response to COVID-19 was pre-emptive, proactive and 
graded with a high level of political commitment. Indeed, the government took several preventive and 
mitigating measures such as progressive tightening of international travel, issuing of advisories for the 
members of the public, setting up of quarantine facilities, contact tracing of persons infected by the virus and 
various social distancing measures. Further, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and GoI 
drafted and shared the Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks - COVID-19. Accordingly, public health measures 
and non-pharmaceutical measures were implemented in all states/UTs. State, district, and block officials were 
trained on COVID-19 responses.  
 
The Government of India imposed a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the disease and further 
extended it until July 2020. India also launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on 16 January 2021. However, 
new variants of COVID-19 were detected, which propelled India into a second wave in March 2021 that 
resulted in higher death and infection rates. By June 2021, India was again able to reduce the number of

COVID-19 cases in the country. This decrease was possible because of the sustained vaccination drive, massive 
information campaigns, lockdowns, and public strict compliance COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior (CAB). The 
third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India between January and March 2022, marked by the rise of the 
Omicron variant.  
Waves of COVID-19 in India 
Wave 1: March -June 2020  
Wave 2: March – June 2021 
Wave 3: (January -March 2022) 
UNICEF India worked closely with World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Family 
Welfare focusing its efforts to support coordinated action for the preparedness, containment, and mitigation 
of the outbreak from March 2020 till the present. UNICEF adopted a multi-sectoral approach to its response 
strategy, coordinating with relevant Ministries involved in the response, to enable policies that protect the 
rights of the most vulnerable, especially women and children. UNICEF response plan was designed in early 
2020, soon after the onset of the pandemic, with two major goals: (a) minimizing the spread and mortality of 
the pandemic, and (b) mitigating its socio-economic impact on women and children. UNICEF’s efforts focused 
on: 
I. 
Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) to build resilient communities. 
II. Improve Infection and Prevention Control (IPC) and provide critical medical and water, sanitation, and 
hygiene (WASH) supplies. 
III. Support the provision of continued access to essential health and nutrition services for women, children, 
and vulnerable communities, including case management. 
IV. Data collection social science research for public health decision making. 
V. Support access to continuous education, social protection, child protection and gender-based violence 
(GBV) services. 
VI. Coordination, technical support, and operational costs. 
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed following any explicit ToC. The response 
was developed at the onset of the pandemic and there was not much sufficient time to develop a ToC. It 
mainly relied on the experience of managing H1N1 and its SBCC strategy. The UNICEF response also lacked a 
results framework because of which comparative inferences and achievements could not be assessed against 
any set milestones. 
Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation:  
UNICEF India commissioned IPE Global Limited to carry out a Real-Time Evaluation (RTE) of its COVID-19 
Response Strategy to assess and improve the relevance, coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency2 of its COVID-
19 crisis response, by providing real-time feedback and recommendations for improvement across the 
different pillars of response outlined above. The objectives of the evaluation included:  
• 
Providing feedback to the UNICEF India Crisis Management Team (CrMT) on the relevance, coverage, 
efficiency, and effectiveness of its COVID-19 response.  
• 
Identifying challenges and bottlenecks in service delivery and providing recommendations for 
improvement. 
• 
Involving partners and stakeholders in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure it is more participatory

ToR – relevance, coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency.

and responsive to needs on the ground.  
• 
Acting as a real-time lesson learning exercise that adjusts and improves planning and performance, 
allowing for ongoing correction of the current crisis response, but also collecting lessons for future health 
emergencies.  
• 
Identify gaps in UNICEF India’s ongoing evidence-gathering efforts and recommend suggestions. 
• 
Collect data for use in future evaluation/s of UNICEF’s response. 
The evaluation team assessed UNICEF’s technical assistance to support the Government of India in addressing 
the COVID-19 crisis at the national, state and district level. The evaluation has used Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) evaluation criteria of 
relevance, coverage, efficiency, and effectiveness3. The evaluation has assessed UNICEF’s contribution from 
the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020) till the evaluation of each pillar had started i.e.: 
Evaluation Pillar 
Pillar-specific evaluation period 
Pillar 1 
March 2020 – November 2020 
Pillar 2 
March 2020 – February 2021 
Pillar 5 
March 2020 – July 2021 
Pillar 3 
March 2020 – January 2022 
The evaluation did not evaluate pillars 4 and 6 because it was mutually decided with the UNICEF research and 
evaluation team, given the dynamic COVID-19 context, that the evaluation of these 2 pillars will not serve the 
purpose of real-time learning. Hence, these 2 pillars were dropped from the evaluation’s scope of work.  
Evaluation Methodology: 
A participatory, consultative, and utilization-focused approach was deployed for the evaluation to assess 
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response for each pillar against the OECD-DAC criteria mentioned above. The RTE focused 
on the delivery and implementation of the UNICEF India COVID-19 Response Plan indicators in five evaluation 
states: Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra. A longitudinal-observation design was 
used to review the data (documents for undertaking desk review) on a monthly/ongoing basis to provide 
feedback and recommendations to improve UNICEF’s ongoing COVID-19 response. A combination of methods 
(desk review of UNICEF’s share link data covering all real-time data/reports against each of the pillars, 
qualitative interviews, and secondary data analysis) were used for this evaluation. The primary data collection 
mainly relied on qualitative methods [Key Informants Interviews (KIIs)] of different sets of stakeholders – 
UNICEF officials at the National and State levels, State and District/Block Government officials and Civil Society 
Organizations (CSO)/implementation partners. The KIIs were conducted with the key stakeholders who 
UNICEF had partnered with or that were involved in/responsible for the design and implementation of the 
COVID-19 response activities. These KIIs were undertaken virtually (using online platforms such as Microsoft 
Teams and telephonic calls) asface-to-face/on-ground data collection was not feasible due to the pandemic’s 
restrictions. Overall, the modes of data collection were outlined in the ToR and mutually agreed upon with 
UNICEF.  
Overview of the Challenges and Limitations during Evaluation: 
• 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, all data collection took place remotely and online mode. Therefore, 
community or beneficiary-level interviews couldn’t be conducted.  
• 
The rapid nature of data collection and analysis meant that gold standards of reliability could not be

followed. The evaluation team mitigated these limitations by triangulating the evaluation results reported 
in each brief with monitoring data, field and reports received from UNICEF (national and state offices), 
and other sources to ensure that multiple sources informed the reported findings of evidence. 
• 
There have been substantial delays in scheduling interviews during the COVID-19 waves in India. The 
COVID-19 waves in India affected the turnaround time of UNICEF’s teams and the unavailability of 
stakeholders. Moreover, incorporating real-time learning in the evaluation approach also led to the 
extension of the evaluation timeline.  
• 
It was of paramount importance to ensure this RTE does not get in the way of the response and overwhelm 
already inundated officials. Another limitation of this evaluation was that it needed to respond to the 
unfolding situation; therefore, long-term planning was not possible. Response pillars for investigation and 
participants were chosen in collaboration with UNICEF on a rolling basis.  
• 
Since the pandemic has affected the whole population, the government and UNICEF’s response plan 
targeted the whole population, including the marginalized and vulnerable. Therefore, it is important to 
highlight that though gender and equity have been the underlying theme of the pillar-specific evaluations, 
it was not explicitly (and in isolation) focused upon by UNICEF while providing essential supplies and 
support. Therefore, the evaluation  reflect gender and equity as an underlying theme but not an explicit 
and standalone area of inquiry. However, UNICEF’s support towards women and children-centric services 
(such as routine immunization, antenatal care, etc.), as well as the evaluation of the latter,  are evidence 
of a targeted attention to this group. 
• 
Given the amount of crucial information, the length of the executive summary and comprehensive report 
exceeds the suggested length as per the Global Evaluation Report Oversight System format. Condensing 
the information in the report or executive summary may have led to the loss of pivotal information 
necessary for depth for any key user. 
Key Conclusions on Findings:  
The key findings of this evaluation study are grouped under OECD-DAC criteria of relevance, coverage, 
effectiveness, and efficiency. Each of them has been summarized below: 
Relevance: 
The evaluation revealed that the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response were highly 
relevant and fully aligned with the government priorities since UNICEF’s response plan was developed in close 
consultation with the national and state governments to address their needs. The response plan was 
developed in March 2020, and then regularly updated to adapt to the evolving pandemic situation and partner 
government’s requests. Often, UNICEF’s activities provided supplementary support to the ongoing 
government activities and helped in their bolstering and scale-up. For instance, government priorities w.r.t. 
Education largely focused on enabling continuity of education. To address the government priorities, UNICEF 
focused on providing support towards continuity of education through providing state-specific strategic 
support towards home-based learning, preparation and mobilization of materials and content; and supported 
unhindered Early Childhood Development by promoting gender-responsive parenting. 
The evaluation found that the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF were tailored to the local 
(socio-cultural) context of different states. UNICEF India followed the ROSA (Regional Office for South Asia) 
and HQ guidelines (and standard indicators) to structure its COVID-19 response. The global guidelines provided 
a wide array of activities and only those sections of the global guidelines were adopted that suited the Indian 
context. Rapid assessments were undertaken to identify the state's needs. These were accommodated in the 
form of HPM indicators in UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. UNICEF supported state governments across all 5
