EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Programme Description 
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) North Macedonia 2016–2020 Country Programme highlighted the inclusion 
of children with disabilities and introduced a disability component to all programmes. These efforts align with several 
sustainable development goals (SDGs): SDG 1 as it relates to the financial costs to families of children with disabilities; SDG 
3 as it relates to providing equitable and quality health care to children with disabilities, including identification and 
habilitation/rehabilitation services; SDG 4 as it relates to providing quality inclusive education; and SDG 10 as it relates to 
reducing inequalities between people with and without disabilities.  
At the mid-point of programme implementation in early 2018, UNICEF, in collaboration with the government and key 
partners, conducted a Light Strategic Review of the country programme, resulting in a shift in the program’s strategic 
direction and a broadened focus from specific groups of vulnerable children to major issues concerning all children. While 
this shift was considered necessary to accelerate reforms for the social good of children given the country’s readiness in 
light of a leadership change, addressing the needs of children with disabilities and the commitment to inclusion remained 
in UNICEF’s programme.   
UNICEF North Macedonia’s most prominent efforts toward policy reform and advocacy for the rights of children with 
disabilities can be summarized in the following six sectors.  
1. Social Protection: Introducing a new model of disability assessment based on the International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) and adopting a rights-based model of disability in the country’s welfare 
system. 
2. Child Protection: Supporting the country’s effort to strengthen the childcare system, ensuring the 
deinstitutionalisation of all children, and developing community-based services for children with disabilities and their 
families.  
3. Education: Developing a legal framework and inclusive practices that support the inclusion of children with disabilities 
in the mainstream education system by 2023 and transforming ‘special’ schools to resource centres that support the 
effort toward inclusion. 
4. Health: Enhancing the capacities of front-line health care workers, including family doctors and patronage nurses, 
and training them in early detection and early intervention for children with developmental disabilities. 
5. Communication: Communication for social and behaviour change initiatives included awareness campaigns to 
address the public’s negative attitudes and perceptions toward disability, community dialogue events, public 
advocacy to support sector-specific reforms, and partnerships to promote inclusion in sport and culture.  
6. COVID-19 Pandemic Response: Developing online individualized support for children with disabilities and their 
families in early intervention, early stimulation, speech therapy, and psychological support. 
 
 
 
Evaluation Purpose, Methodology, and Limitations 
The purpose of this evaluation is to examine how and to what extent UNICEF North Macedonia’s inclusion programming 
from 2016-2020 has contributed to addressing system-level bottlenecks impacting access to social, health, and education 
services for children with disabilities and their ability to live in caring family environments, as is their right. The objective of 
the evaluation is to inform UNICEF’s ongoing and future programming on behalf of children with disabilities and their 
families. The intended audience is UNICEF country office programme officers and relevant duty bearers within and outside 
of the government. UNICEF formed an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) composed of duty bearers and other 
stakeholders from across sectors, including government officials, advisors, and implementers. The ERG convened during 
the inception phase of the evaluation as well as at its conclusion, to hear the findings and refine and prioritize the 
recommendations. 
Inclusive Development Partners (IDP) used the below methodologies for the evaluation: 
• 
Planning and programme inquiry meetings with UNICEF programme officers to guide the evaluation design and 
methodology and to validate findings.  
• 
Desk-based review and portfolio analysis of UNICEF’s existing documentation and other existing documentation, 
reports, and data.  
• 
Country mission and data collection. Overall, feedback was collected from 42 stakeholders through key 
informant interviews and focus group discussions and from 2,552 stakeholders via online surveys. 

 
 
6 
• 
Data analysis using evaluative frameworks (rubrics) based on the quality of the data and its alignment with global 
normative standards for best practices in inclusion, per the CRPD and existing evidence.  
This evaluation’s primary limitation was the lack of reliable or consistent data related to children with disabilities from 
before and during the period of this evaluation. The sectorial approach used by UNICEF was an additional limitation, as it 
focused not only on children with disabilities but also on other vulnerable categories of children. This created some 
methodological challenges because it was necessary to extract interventions targeting children with disabilities from those 
that, to some extent, also targeted other children. In order to mitigate this, the team conducted a set of targeted meetings 
with relevant representatives of the different sectors in order to extrapolate the specific interventions that were related 
to inclusion of children with disabilities, and following data collection, held additional meetings to validate findings. 
Evaluation Findings 
Relevance: UNICEF interventions were internally coherent and contributed strongly to producing the intended outcomes 
(though, in some cases, outcome measurement data was not available). The work led to significant progress in addressing 
the needs of children with disabilities and their families, but within each sector, some needs or intended outcomes have 
not yet been met. UNICEF made strong efforts to involve relevant partners, but perceptions of stakeholder involvement 
varied by stakeholder, and not all felt sufficiently involved.  
Coherence: UNICEF worked to align actions and interventions and they were, to a significant extent, mutually 
complementary and harmonized. UNICEF engaged multiple actors from the government, organizations of people with 
disabilities, and the international donor community, and worked hard to align with other activities and to ensure the 
synergy of all efforts.  
Effectiveness: UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to increasing the availability and supply of services as 
well as qualified human resources. Children who have benefitted from the deinstitutionalisation process have much better 
living conditions, but those living in small group homes need more individualized support than they are receiving. 
Educators found that the training on inclusive education was very effective and expressed that they need more training 
and additional personnel to support children with disabilities in mainstream schools. Medical professionals found their 
training helpful in understanding and identifying disability and reducing unnecessary referrals; however, the overall lack 
of health system personnel and infrastructure remains a barrier. The presence or absence of political will is a critical factor 
in achievements and challenges related to UNICEF objectives. Social perceptions are also a key a factor. 
Efficiency: Stakeholders agreed that UNICEF’s budget and human and technical resources were adequately budgeted 
across all sectors, and a good division of expenses among donor organisations avoided the multiplication of costs. The 
same programme results could not have been achieved with less resources; many stakeholders observed that more 
resources were and are needed.  
Impact: Although available data for rigorously measuring impact is limited, existing data and stakeholder reports indicated 
that UNICEF’s inclusion programming made a significant impact, although geographical disparities in programme reach, 
and gender and socioeconomic differences also exist generally and in relation to location (urban versus rural). UNICEF 
significantly helped to positively shift the paradigm and improve public understanding on disability, but also acknowledged 
that more work is needed to eliminate stigma and discrimination. Tangible services offered within and across sectors 
(especially in social and child protection and education) contributed to needs being met to varying degrees, and UNICEF’s 
simultaneous communications campaigns reinforced these efforts by pushing citizens to confront their assumptions and 
biases. Caregivers, especially, were pleased that the public’s perception of their children had improved.   
Sustainability: UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies, though with varying degrees of detail and 
specificity to enable implementation. Similarly, budget allocations exist in all sectors, but many stakeholders and 
beneficiaries deem funding to be inadequate. Quality-assurance mechanisms are lagging and may need further 
development; however, direct training in relation to this has taken place in the education sector with state education 
inspectors. The country remains dependent on foreign technical and financial support for quality-assurance mechanisms 
and capacity-building mechanisms. Long-term sustainability requires local governments to be more actively engaged in 
the process.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
Relevance 
Conclusion 1. UNICEF’s interventions, which were based upon needs assessments, were relevant to the needs of 
children with disabilities and their families, addressed many of these needs, and were planned and implemented with 
the inclusion of key stakeholders. Participation from caregivers and OPDs could be strengthened, and data points to 
gender disparities in access to services.  
Strategic Recommendation (SR) 1. To ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and their inclusion in society is set 
on the political agenda and that policies are relevant and include measures for ensuring sustainable provision of social 
services, facilitate networking and opportunities for advocacy between rights holders, particularly representatives of OPDs 
and parents of children with disabilities, with duty-bearers, particularly members of parliament and representatives of 
political parties. Priority: MEDIUM. Responsible party: GOV.  
• 
Operational Recommendation (OR) 1.1 Support and facilitate the work of the members of the National Coordination 
Body for implementation of the CRPD related to inclusion of CwD. The support should focus on improvement of 
coordination among the members and cooperation with CSOs and OPDs.  
• 
OR 1.2 Provide support for implementation of the measures and activities planned in the National Strategy for 
Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities related to inclusion of Children with Disabilities. The Strategy and corresponding 
action plan should ensure that the interventions in this area are well planned, coordinated among different sectors 
and in accordance with the HRBA, the CRPD and the latest global evidence on best practices.   
• 
OR 1.3 Support coordination, networking and coalition building activities for OPDs advocating for inclusion of children 
with disabilities in different sectors and on behalf of different disability types. Establish a structured consultation 
mechanism for engaging OPDs and parents of children with disabilities in the planning and implementation processes 
within UNICEF as well as in sectors where UNICEF works.  
SR 2. Take measures to understand and address the gender gap in children with disabilities accessing social services. 
Conduct research to examine the cause(s) behind fewer females than males using social services as well as whether there 
are different needs across genders, and, based on the findings, design or adjust training and programme interventions to 
close gaps and target needs more accurately. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF. 
• 
OR 2. Conduct another KAP study that includes collecting data related to gender disparities, support gender 
mainstreaming in policy making processes, and develop training modules for duty-bearers on gender-specific aspects 
of service provision.  
Coherence  
Conclusion 2. Across all sectors, UNICEF engaged multiple actors and made concerted efforts to align with other 
activities and efforts in the country. Nevertheless, the lack of a clear, detailed TOC to drive and focus programming, as 
well as the lack (in many cases) of baseline data to inform goal and target setting as well as measurement of progress, 
may have limited the potential for even greater coherence and synergy.  
SR 3. Develop a robust and detailed TOC that is informed by baseline data, which allows for outcome goals related to 
increases, decreases, and improvements to be set and measured with more rigor than stakeholder perceptions can 
provide. UNICEF would lead this effort but validate assumptions, goals, and targets with both Government duty bearers 
as well as rights holders among the disability population. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF.   
• 
OR 3. Conduct another KAP study to continue measuring changes in the general population. Also conduct baseline 
studies of duty-bearers, by sector, ahead of interventions, to understand needs and assess skills and knowledge. 
Analyse data for themes that transcend sectors and can inform the ToC and support alignment and coherence during 
intervention planning. 
Effectiveness 
Conclusion 3. UNICEF-supported interventions contributed greatly to eliminating bottlenecks by increasing the 
availability and supply of services as well as qualified human resources and facilitated large positive changes in public 
perception of disability and inclusion.  

 
 
8 
SR 4. Carry forward capacity-building activities with targeted trainings as well as develop other tools, such as long-term 
mentoring and peer-to-peer activities, which are approaches that educators, social workers and other service providers 
view as successful and desired. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV. 
• 
OR 4.1 Introduce methodologies that will measure the impact of the capacity-building activities for a long period of 
time after they have been completed.  
• 
OR 4.2. Provide a clear transition plan for supporting students’ move from primary into secondary school, which 
includes training secondary school teachers and support staff and ensuring that the adequate support measures are 
in included in plans and budgets. Support Resource Centres to engage and train additional staff and provide technical 
resources for effective support to schools.  
SR 5.  Enhance the development of a diverse and functional set of services for children with disabilities such as: alternative 
care units’ foster care as a substitute for small group homes, support for the transition of existing day care centres into 
Disability Support Centres, tailored services for social inclusion of children with disabilities, and gender mainstreaming in 
service planning and provision. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV. 
• 
OR 5.1. Provide technical support to the MLSP and other relevant stakeholders for further development of alternative 
and foster care, including support in development of policies and standards, trainings as well as direct support to 
alternative and foster care units.  
• 
OR 5.2. To better ensure that children with disabilities living in small group homes have access to educational and 
other activities necessary to support their inclusion in communities, provide children currently residing in them with 
better supports, including personal assistants outside of the care provided by the SGH staff and increased involvement 
and engagement from the children themselves, their parents, and the surrounding communities in planning and 
carrying out services. In addition, support municipalities, local CSOs, sport clubs, and cultural centres in developing 
and conducting cultural, sport and other socially meaningful activities for inclusion of children with disabilities living 
in small group homes, alternative care units and foster care.  
SR 6. Promote legislative amendments that will ensure that families of children with disabilities are subsidized for specific 
disability-related costs (e.g., medical treatments and diagnostics, specialist care, medication and supplements, assistive 
devices, transport costs, etc.), so that those costs do not create or exacerbate a state of poverty for these families. Priority: 
HIGH. Responsible party: GOV.  
• 
OR 6. Collect healthcare needs and cost data from families through the KAP survey mentioned above in OR 2. Work 
with relevant government ministries and agencies to assess the feasibility of covering additional costs as well as to 
identify and negotiate efficiencies with service or product providers. Explore social entrepreneurship as a means of 
supplementing outstanding benefits (see SR 10 below). 
Efficiency 
Conclusion 4. While in-depth financial analysis was outside the scope of this evaluation, stakeholders agreed that 
UNICEF funding as well as human and technical resources were adequately budgeted across all sectors, and there was 
a good division of expenses among donor organisations to avoid the multiplication of costs.  
SR 7. Advocate for greater and more efficient public spending on children with disabilities, including better and more 
equitable availability of support services. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV. 
OR 7. A state-conducted financial analysis of current spending could uncover ways to increase efficiency among 
existing service providers as well as inform the provision of new services in areas of the country that still lack support 
for children with disabilities. Service providers themselves, as well as families of children with disabilities, are likely to 
have useful insights into how to make the most of public spending.   
Impact 
Conclusion 5. Many sectors lacked clear, measurable targets for intervention outcomes related to inclusion at the start 
of the 2016-2020 programme. However, M&E reporting showed progress on the majority of output indicators related 
to inclusion of children with disabilities, and all stakeholders as well as documentation pointed to UNICEF’s positive 
impact on shifting public perception of disability.  

 
 
9 
SR 8. Further strengthen internal monitoring systems for tracking progress and support and impel State efforts for setting 
up an adequate and accessible unified system for collecting and processing data on children with disabilities. Do this in 
cooperation with relevant ministries, institutions, and the State Statistical Office. Priority: HIGH. Responsible party: GOV. 
• 
OR 8.1 Negotiate and facilitate collaboration and sharing between the health, education, and social protection 
management information systems (HMIS and EMIS), so that all relevant data regarding children with disabilities is 
accessible by qualified service providers. Such data will also provide baseline figures that can inform UNICEF 
programming, which will further enable impact evaluation.  
• 
OR 8.2. Developing a more robust and detailed ToC (SR 2) and using baseline data to set targets can drive robust 
impact and outcome measurement, which will enable more targeted planning for future and ongoing interventions. 
SR 9. Continue and expand efforts to shift public opinion on disability through communications and awareness raising 
campaigns that draw from and highlight recent successes. Priority: MED. Responsible party: UNICEF 
• 
OR 9. Work with families of children with and without disabilities, OPDs, educators, and heath care providers to 
share positive experiences within schools, health centres, and during daily life of children with disabilities being 
included in ways they were not previously.  
Sustainability 
Conclusion 6. Across all four sectors, UNICEF interventions are integrated into national policies and budgets, which is an 
important outcome and a strong foundation for sustainability.  
SR 10. Encourage efforts for the increased sustainability of social services through decentralising and introducing social 
entrepreneurship as an innovative means for funding social services. Priority: LOW. Responsible party: GOV. 
• 
OR 10.1 In cooperation with other international donors, support local government efforts to set up and implement a 
local social protection program that will be focused on inclusion of children with disabilities. Social services could be 
much more cost-efficient if planned and implemented by the local government, which is closer to the citizens. Support 
the Government to strengthen the donations from the central budget to the local government and require that they 
match the funds from their own sources or local donors. In addition, track spending to ensure that the funds are used 
for children with disabilities. 
• 
OR 10.2 Train OPDs and other CSOs that provide services to introduce and utilize social entrepreneurship endeavours 
as a means to enhance sustainable funding for service provision. Train service providers on skills for fund-raising and 
conducting economic activities for funding their efforts so that they can secure additional sources of financing that 
will allow for continuous provision of services that are less dependent on international donor support.    
 
Lessons learned 
1. The interventions implemented by UNICEF would have benefited from a more detailed ToC document which 
precisely defines the causal linkages within and across its programs and the potential internal and external factors 
which may impede or slow down implementation of sector-level interventions. This would have also enabled more 
effective progress monitoring and measurement of outcomes and impact. 
2. UNICEF’s inclusion interventions were gender-neutral in design, but data showing disparities in boys’ and girls’ 
enrolment in social services and education indicates that more attention should be paid to the different and unique 
needs of girls, and programming should include gender-specific elements and associated training for service 
providers.  
3. Although UNICEF interventions are national in scope, the consultative and decision-making processes were mainly 
centralized and did not always consider the regional perspectives and specifics. This resulted in the centralization of 
services and prevalence of the needs of rights holders from the capital city.

PART 1. INTRODUCTION 
This report presents the main findings, conclusions, and recommendations of an evaluation of UNICEF Interventions 
Addressing Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in North Macedonia implemented from 2016 to 2020. The 
evaluation was commissioned by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and conducted by Inclusive 
Development Partners (IDP) in 2022.    
The purpose of the evaluation was to examine how and to what extent UNICEF North Macedonia’s inclusion 
programming has contributed in addressing system-level bottlenecks impacting the access to rights for children with 
disabilities in the area of social protection, healthcare and education, their ability to live in caring family 
environments, as well as their right to equality in line with the international conventions for human rights protection.  
The objective of the evaluation is to inform UNICEF’s ongoing and future programming in order to ensure full 
realization of the rights of children with disabilities and their families and addressing any gender gaps that may exist 
in the access to rights. The intended audience is UNICEF country office programme officers and relevant duty 
bearers within and outside of the government.  
This report of findings is organised in three parts, structured as follows: 
Part 1 describes the country context within which UNICEF’s disability inclusion efforts took place and includes a 
description of the interventions; an overview of the evaluation, including the purpose, objectives, and scope as well 
as IDP’s approach and methodology; and a summary of the evaluation’s limitations. 
Part 2 presents the evaluation findings in relation to six Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) evaluation criteria and the practice sectors of 
interest, as required in the Terms of Reference (TOR).  
Part 3 provides conclusions and recommendations.  
 
Country Context 
Republic of North Macedonia is located in south-eastern Europe. It is a NATO member and a candidate for 
membership in the European Union (EU). On 19 July 2022, the EU opened accession negotiations with North 
Macedonia1. North Macedonia has ratified most international human rights instruments on both the United 
Nations (UN) and European levels, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).  
North Macedonia has a multi-ethnic society with a resident population of 1,836,713.2 It faces negative population 
growth of -5.4% (data from 2021). The main ethnic groups are Macedonians who comprise 58.4% of the population 
and Albanians who are 24.3%. Other ethnic groups include Turks, Romani, Serbs, Bosniaks, and Vlachs.3 The 
Macedonian and the Albanian languages are the official languages;4 however, in local self-governments, other 
languages may also have official status. 
The country is governed by a centre-left led coalition of political parties with a mandate until 2024, and this coalition 
holds a narrow majority in the legislature. The current ruling coalition took power in 2017 following a severe and 
 
1 The continuation of the negotiation process, following the initial screening phase, is conditioned by a mandatory constitutional 
amendment required for resolution of a bilateral dispute with Bulgaria.
