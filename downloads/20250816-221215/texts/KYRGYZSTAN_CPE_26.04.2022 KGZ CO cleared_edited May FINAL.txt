Executive summary 
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Programme (CP) for 
the period 2018 to June 2021, focusing on UNICEF’s activities across its three core Outcomes. The evaluation 
examines the relevance and coherence of the CP, the work of the UNICEF Country Office (CO) with partners, 
and the impact generated for children. The evaluation is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation 
commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in 
Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine. The evaluation aims to support the planning process for the 
next programming period and to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability. Its objectives are to identify good 
practices, draw lessons, and inform forward-looking recommendations. The evaluation assesses the 
linkages between international, regional, national and institutional strategies to bring about overall 
improvement in the status of children. It also evaluates the extent to which interventions focus on and 
deliver results for the most vulnerable categories of children in Kyrgyzstan. Finally, it evaluates the 
performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF levels. 
Overview of the Country Programme, 2018–2022 
The CP has three mutually reinforcing core Outcomes: 1) Child Rights Based Mechanisms for Decision 
Making; 2) Equitable Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning and Development; 3) Child Protection 
and Access to Justice.  
Outcome 1: Child Rights Based Mechanisms for Decision Making.  
State institutions have capacity to generate and utilize evidence for child rights monitoring, advocacy and 
policy formulation. Social sector ministries and parliament have improved capacity to manage and 
oversight public finance for children 
Outcome 2: Equitable Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning, and Development.  
Healthcare professionals can provide quality perinatal, modern home-visiting services. The Government 
can produce multisectoral policies and standards to guide and monitor nutrition services for the most 
disadvantaged women and children. Service providers can provide adolescent friendly services, including 
HIV prevention for especially vulnerable adolescents (EVA) and most-at-risk adolescents (MARA)ECD/ECE 
institutional capacities strengthened to deliver quality early development, learning and school readiness 
for all, especially the most disadvantaged girls and boys. The education system can provide quality and 
inclusive learning and development to the most disadvantaged children and adolescents 
Outcome 3: Child Protection and Access to Justice.  
The education system can provide quality and inclusive learning and development to the most 
disadvantaged children and adolescents. Justice and administrative bodies can facilitate children’s access 
to justice services and redress mechanisms Adolescents have and use opportunities to contribute to 
decision-making processes 
The CP integrated activities and strategies across all three outcomes to change social norms that are not 
favourable to child rights. In addition, the CP used multiple strategies to encourage child and youth 
participation across all outcomes. Specific activities on this area included in Outcome 3. 
The CP was revised in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with several new outputs and activities 
added to ensure a swift and appropriate response to children’s emerging and urgent needs. 
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences 
This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral evaluations and specialized studies 
conducted in the past five years. The evaluation’s purpose is to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability to 
national stakeholders by evaluating its contribution to results for children at scale, particularly for the most 
vulnerable children in specific areas. The evaluation also aims to inform the development of the next 
UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by collating the lessons learned from activities and results. 
This allows the best use of UNICEF’s change strategies in the future. 

 
 
iv
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. Secondary 
users are the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, UN agencies and development partners with a presence 
in Kyrgyzstan. The evaluation builds on the agreements made among these partners and assists the 
establishment of strategies for their ongoing collaboration in the next planning and programme cycle. 
Evaluation context 
The evaluation was conducted in a context marked by instability and uncertainty. The global COVID-19 
pandemic changed lives in Kyrgyzstan, as it did worldwide. The pandemic meant irregular school 
attendance, and school closures were particularly harmful for the most vulnerable children. This was 
mitigated by the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) developing a remote learning platform for pre-
school and school-aged students, with UNICEF support. The pandemic also hampered access to health 
services, including mental health services for caregivers, children and youth. The pandemic affected their 
mental well-being, with more than 60 per cent of adolescents reporting elevated levels of pandemic-related 
anxiety1, and one fifth of households reported challenges in accessing healthcare services.  
Beyond these immediate effects, the pandemic has had severe socio-economic consequences. Kyrgyzstan's 
real gross domestic product (GDP) declining by 8.6 per cent. In 2020, 50 per cent of households reported a 
reduction in income. By 2021, falling remittances and incomes, rising unemployment, and rising prices and 
health expenditures had caused the poverty rate to climb to 25 per cent.2 
In addition to the dramatic changes spurred by the pandemic, Kyrgyzstan experienced political changes in 
2020-2021. These resulted in a new regime and a new Constitution that have been in place since January 
2021.  
Evaluation methodology 
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC) 
developed by the UNICEF CO. The evaluation questions were structured around the OECD DAC3 criteria of 
relevance, coherence and impact. The evaluation criteria of effectiveness and sustainability were also 
covered to a certain extent by the evaluation, being reflected in subsequent evaluation questions under the 
larger impact criterion. An Evaluation Matrix was developed during the inception phase to map out 
evaluation questions and sub-questions, judgement criteria, data collection methods and data sources.  
An in-depth impact assessment included three selected areas: early childhood development, adolescents’ 
engagement and participation, and social protection to provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and 
strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. These areas were selected during the inception phase of 
the evaluation, based on previously set criteria and consultations with the UNICEF CO in Kyrgyzstan. Other 
evaluation methods used for the evaluation included stakeholder and social network analysis using 
systems-based evaluation principles. 
The evaluation employed qualitative data collection methods, including a wide-ranging document review 
and 30 key interviews in Bishkek and the regions. The CO supported the identification of respondents who 
were consulted using semi-structured interviews. They included interviewees from UNICEF, government 
entities, UN agencies and other development agencies, and civil society organizations (CSOs). In addition, 
UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social network analysis.  
The evaluation methodology fully considered the ethical obligations of evaluators. Child rights, equity and 
gender were highlighted throughout the evaluation.

v 
The UNICEF CP 2018-2022 in Kyrgyzstan was based on evidence and lessons learned from the 
implementation of previous interventions, from needs assessments, and from studies conducted before and 
during the implementation of the Programme. According to the CP priorities and the context analysis, 
UNICEF aimed to affect all children in Kyrgyzstan in both the planning and implementation phases of the 
CP. Periodic, planned interventions identified and addressed the needs of vulnerable children including 
girls, children with disabilities, and children affected by poverty and social exclusion. Additional 
interventions addressed the emerging needs that arose when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.  
The CP expanded its focus on adolescents and youth. It especially examined the proactive engagement in 
community dialogue, skills and competence building, employability, and peacebuilding potential of youth 
from large minority groups and youth living in in Kyrgyzstan’s border regions.  
The proposed solutions for the development of services for children included services for early childhood 
development and education (ECD and ECE) respective of the limited resources available at local level in 
small towns and villages. Proposed solutions also encouraged the use of community resources to address 
the needs of children in rural areas. 
The alignment of the CP to children’s needs and the national priorities was based on national statistics and 
strategic planning for children’s rights and well-being. Children’s needs were further identified as UNICEF 
Kyrgyzstan responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives included the provision of essential 
supplies to medical personnel working at the frontlines when these supplies were scarce. UNICEF 
supported the procurement of supplies to front-line medical workers, COVID-19 medication for health 
facilities, and technical assistance for healthcare providers. UNICEF also supported the MoES’s effort to 
provide remote learning to the more than 1.4 million preschool and school-aged children in 2020, and then 
re-open schools safely. UNICEF assisted the provision of a Humanitarian Cash Transfer (HCT) for families 
affected economically. Throughout the pandemic, UNICEF coordinated its activities with development 
partners and other UN agencies. in the country for the overall response to the pandemic. 
Coherence 
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan used its comparative advantages related to its expertise, strategic focus and 
adaptability enabled it to build and sustain effective partnerships with the Government of the Kyrgyz 
Republic, UN agencies and development partners, and CSOs. 
UNICEF used its comparative advantages effectively in collaborating with a range of different partners to 
drive change for children and their families in Kyrgyzstan. Partnerships contributing to the assessed impact 
of UNICEF included bilateral cooperation with UN agencies and other international organizations, 
implementing partners (as in the case of programmes for adolescents’ engagement and participation), and 
partnerships in the framework of the United Nations Development Framework (UNDAF) and the 
Development Partners Coordination Council (DPCC). Partnership was an important implementing strategy 
for UNICEF in Kyrgyzstan, enabling the CO to create synergies with other organizations and institutions, 
partnership with stakeholders but it was not highlighted as a strategic element in the Country Programme 
Document. An exception to this limited visibility of the strategic approach to partnership was UNICEF’s 
partnership with the Government, that shapes and leads the Country Programme implementation.  
Keeping true to the priorities and objectives of UNICEF and the wider UN, the CO developed strategic 
partnerships with a range of partners to enhance the delivery of the CP. Social network analysis shows 
UNICEF was a key and active partner in a strong and large network of stakeholders working for the 
realization of children’s rights in Kyrgyzstan. UNICEF’s most strategic partners were public institutions at 
the central level, including sectoral ministries, public service providers, institutes. UNICEF focused 
resources and provided information for these partners, and their agendas, in turn, influenced UNICEF 
activities. Local partners were also instrumental for UNICEF’s impact, especially for model projects to 
evaluate innovative approaches to improve national policies. Partnership with UN agencies and 
development partners on common points of interest allowed UNICEF to enhance its advocacy capacity 

 
 
vi
when promoting recommendations to the Government. Finally, CSOs were key partners for advocacy and 
implementation, enabling UNICEF to mobilize and engage local communities. 
Impact 
Evidence showed UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s progress in the realization of child rights in most areas where it 
works. UNICEF contributed to the following areas:  
• 
the adoption of the revised Child Code in July 2021 by Kyrgyzstan’s Parliament 
• 
the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) 
in 2019 
• 
healthcare and nutrition for children, visible in the reduction of infant and child mortality rates 
• 
clinical standards, protocols and the capacity of medical staff in maternal, child and adolescent 
health in several healthcare facilities 
• 
vaccination capacity 
• 
the adoption of the Food Security and Nutrition Programme 2019-2023 
• 
access to early childhood education and government commitment to accelerate progress in this area 
• 
the ‘Education Development Programme for 2021-2040’ (EDS) and the Action Plan for 2021-2023, 
adopted on 4 May 2021 
• 
an education management information system (EMIS) 
legal aid for children 
• 
adolescent participation in targeted communities.  
UNICEF used five key strategies to obtain these impacts:  
• 
advocacy for policy development and change regarding national strategies and legal frameworks 
• 
technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services 
• 
support for capacity building through the training of duty bearers (in the fields of education, health, 
law-enforcement, judiciary) 
• 
engagement on advocacy with civil society partners at national and local level 
• 
engagement with development partners, especially, but not only, through the Development 
Partners Coordination Council (DPCC).  
There are, however, other areas where the CP has enhanced the lives of the children and young people who 
have taken part in specific activities but has been unable to achieve impact at scale. This usually resulted 
from limited strategic and legal provisions for initiatives that required institutional strengthening for full 
implementation. Lack of impact at scale in some areas was also linked to the limited number of communities 
participating in key interventions. There was less change in trends related to gender-based violence (GBV), 
however, and more activities must address the presence of specific social norms and values that conflict 
with the human rights approach. For example, the 2021 Situation Analysis identified the continued 
practices of child marriage, kidnapping for forced marriage, and public tolerance of GBV and violence 
against children. However, UNICEF implemented model projects successfully in partnership with local 
government structures and/or CSOs. These projects included the development of home-visiting standards, 
the development of services for children with disabilities, and support for child- and youth-friendly cities. 
In these cases, development and scale-up were essential for impact at national level. 
In addition to these limitations, political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic generated significant 
sustainability risks in 2020. These challenges to the impact and sustainability of UNICEF’s work include…  
• 
institutional instability 
• 
continuous civil service turnover 
• 
limited capacity for service provision for the realization of child rights at central and local level 
• 
limited policy coordination and cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation 
• 
limited availability of disaggregated data  
• 
limited use of available data for decision making concerning children 

 
 
vii 
• 
limited fiscal space and financial resources, especially a limited public budget dedicated to services 
for children  
• 
social norms that are not in line with human rights values concerning the position of children in 
society and family 
• 
a widespread acceptance of violence against children and women, including the acceptance of child 
marriage and kidnapping for forced marriage. 
Conclusions 
The assessment on relevance and impact shows that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan responded to the needs of children 
in the country, especially those who are the most vulnerable and has supported policy and institutional 
development. This success was based, in large part, on advocacy and technical assistance to strengthen data 
analysis and research on children’s needs and to promote evidence-based decision making. This ensured 
that the needs of vulnerable children inform governmental priorities, regardless of political and 
institutional changes.  The elaboration of strategic documents and of specific instruments, including the 
planned scale-up of the Child Development Centres (CDCs), were evidence of effectiveness. 
In addition to its evidence-based advocacy strategy, UNICEF developed and engaged strategic partnerships 
that moved its agenda forward. This was evidenced by the CP design and adaptation in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and other contextual changes over the past two years. 
UNICEF supported the government’s initiatives to strengthen its capacity to collect, analyse and use data 
through capacity building programmes, including trainings for key stakeholders. UNICEF also worked with 
state officials on budgeting for social services. UNICEF’s impact on improving the lives of children was most 
apparent on a national scale when UNICEF implemented its strategic focus alongside institutional 
strengthening activities. For instance, these strategic partnerships resulted in improvements in maternal 
and child health in maternity hospitals and in ECE (as part of the larger area of ECD). This approach 
represents good practice that can be used to promote results at national scale in other sub-areas of ECD, 
including early interventions for children with disabilities and home visiting services. 
UNICEF identified and reassessed bottlenecks throughout the implementation of the CP and implemented 
strategies to cope with them in a changing context. This included advocacy interventions and capacity 
building programmes, strengthening cross-sectoral cooperation to compensate for political and civil service 
instability and the associated risks to sustainability.  
Stakeholders appreciated UNICEF’s contribution to behavioural changes among duty bearers and 
caregivers, but this impact was limited by deeply embedded social norms and values. It may take longer 
than the timeframe of a single CP to see substantial results impact in areas such as UNICEF’s work to end 
violence against children and child marriage or improve the situation for children with disabilities.  
In addition, it takes time to generate observable impact in areas that require cross-sectoral cooperation. 
There is, for example, the need to strengthen coordination between different government institutions 
resulted in slow progress on the development of an early identification system for and provision of services 
for children with disabilities. 
UNICEF improved its approach to gender equality during the CP, with substantial efforts to apply a strategic 
and systemic approach in all outcome areas. This evaluation concludes that the strategic approach to gender 
equality increased UNICEF’s effectiveness and chances of impact, as evidenced by girls’ increased access to 
services.  
UNICEF’s case study on the impact on social protection, interviews, and workshops with the CO 
representatives and staff showed that social work is insufficiently effective in the country. The lack of social 
workers’ numbers, training, prestige, and influence left them unable to fulfil the role of central actors for 
social inclusion and child protection despite stakeholder interviewers indicating support for social workers 
in this role.  

 
 
viii
Lessons learned 
Comparing UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s experience in ECD and ECE offers lessons for generating change for 
children at scale. UNICEF worked with the Government and development partners to integrate ECE with 
the strategic priorities for the country, with the MoES creating a dedicated ECE department. UNICEF 
supported capacity building, and trainings to improve ECE budgeting at national and local levels. UNICEF 
also promoted building the Child Development Centres. This combination of strategic, institutional and local 
activities contributed to increased access to ECE for children across the country. In contrast, the strategic 
approach and institutional strengthening activities were not as strong in the promotion of home visits, 
another component of ECD policy, resulting in fewer visible results in this area.  
Experience in ECD and ECE shows the need to develop a vision for strategically strengthening duty bearing 
institutions for the benefit of staff and rights holders. A systematic approach would also facilitate the 
monitoring and addressing problems that arise during the programme.  
Innovative approaches based on model/piloting projects and the use of innovative technologies have 
generated impact for children at local levels, as seen in UNICEF’s work on adolescent and youth 
participation. However, these approaches require strategic development on institutional and technical 
levels if they are to be scaled up by the government. Successful upscale requires full government ownership. 
This involves planning and budgeting at governmental scale from the outset. and continuous monitoring 
and evaluation of a programme before and after upscale to inform the institutionalization of programmes 
at government level.  
The impact assessment conducted for this report confirms the importance of evidence-driven decisions for 
the sake of children, but that is not enough for results at scale. This assessment shows that evidence driven 
policies can produce results at scale when implemented with strategic partnerships and resourcing for 
children.  
Partnerships with other UN Agencies, local developmental partners and CSOs produced the greatest results 
when they strategically meet the advocacy goals. UNICEF Kyrgyzstan was successful in leveraging its 
partnership strategy in some areas, such as social protection, child protection, and ECD, and this could be a 
model for UNICEF’s work in other countries.  
The years 2020 and 2021 demonstrated the value of youth engagement in a young society. Young volunteers 
helped respond to COVID-19, participated in many UNICEF activities, and showed political activism. The 
youth of Kyrgyzstan have demanded a voice and shown their importance in shaping Kyrgyzstan’s future.  
Recommendations 
Recommendation 1. Continue to strengthen evidence-based, innovative and diverse approaches in 
Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC). This recommendation 
considers the social norms that hinder the promotion of child rights. UNICEF should focus on capacity 
building for partners. This will allow a systematic approach that shifts away from stand-alone and donor-
driven campaigns. C4D and C4BC strategies and interventions should be informed by data and evidence 
driven policy making, as well as social listening. Digital engagement, social mobilization, the engagement of 
young people and communities, and the use of mobile games and social media can contribute to knowledge 
building, uptake of and demand for services, and changing harmful behaviours and social norms. 
Recommendation 2. Develop clear advocacy strategies and sustainability strategies for each 
modelling/pilot project, and gain support from development partners and other UN agencies to 
enhance the impact of advocacy in promoting new policy measures. Evidence collected and lessons 
learned reveal conditions that need to be met from the moment of planning local pilot and model projects. 
Projects were most effective when they included realistic strategies for upscale, a recognition of budget 
limitations and budget uptake by the government, plans for strengthening institutional capacity at local and 
national level, and means for ongoing monitoring and evaluation. New measures institutionalized by the 

 
 
ix
government increased the linkage between data analysis and service delivery, increasing the capacity for 
evidence-based decision making. 
Recommendation 3. The leveraging of partnerships should be continued and extended, particularly 
in child protection and social protection, including social cash benefits as well as the development 
of social services and social work. This supports access for the most vulnerable children to other key 
services such as child protection, health, education, justice. Placing social work at the centre of a support 
ecosystem would increase access for the most vulnerable children to other key services. Implementing this 
recommendation requires a comprehensive evaluation of the existing social protection system to establish 
a strategy for reform. It also requires the development of social service workers’ competencies and public 
image.  
Recommendation 4. Support the development of cross-sectoral cooperation in areas where it is 
essential for the realization of child rights and most prominently for the realization of the rights of 
children with disabilities. This includes ECE, adolescent empowerment and engagement, fighting violence 
against children, and mitigating the impact of climate change on children. Planning cross-sectoral 
approaches at the national level contributes to developing cross-sectoral practices at the local level. 
Recommendation 5. Continue and extend support for the participation of children and adolescents 
in decision making in relation to public institutions at national and local level. UNICEF should 
advocate, with the government and development partners/donors, for consistent support for youth 
organizations and youth consultative bodies. It should especially promote the participation of children and 
adolescents in schools, as an entry point for developing their wider public participation.  
Recommendation 6. Develop a strategic approach for partnership and cooperation with 
development partners, other UN agencies and civil society. Strategic partnerships should extend the 
scope of partnership and cooperation to enhance the impact of advocacy and enlarge the circle of 
partners. A stakeholder analysis at outcome or output levels during CPD planning should identify the most 
influential potential partners and establish partnerships in the initial phases of the advocacy processes. 
Strategic partners should assist in planning specific advocacy activities.  
Recommendation 7. Introduce monitoring tools to trace more clearly the change pathways from 
UNICEF activities to results for children. Documenting the path from monitoring and research to 
government policy decisions, to implementation at national and local levels, to the assessment of the results 
for children should inform future evaluations and decisions. Improving the registration of institutional 
memory and tracing the connections between advocacy, policy, and declarations on policies or institutional 
changes would yield a better understanding of how policy change happens.
