Executive Summary
Introduction 
a. 
In line with the UNICEF Evaluation 
Policy, the purpose of this Country Programme 
Evaluation (CPE) 2018-2022 was to provide 
impartial and independent evidence to assist the 
UNICEF Jordan Country Office and Jordan 
authorities and decision-makers in designing the 
next UNICEF programming cycle as well the UN 
system joint programming in Jordan.  
b. 
The CPE examined the entire Country 
Programme, including the period during the 
evaluation, with a particular focus on the 
Education, Health, Social Policy / Social 
Protection, and WASH sections, and the 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth and 
Adolescent Development and Child Protection 
programming were considered within the 
context of the overall Country Programme and 
through Outcome Harvesting of completed 
evaluations, reports, and interviews and other 
key documents.   
Approach and Methodology 
c. 
The evaluation was guided by the OECD-
DAC 
evaluation 
criteria 
of 
Relevance, 
Coherence, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Impact and 
Sustainability. The criterion of Connectedness 
was also considered as the programme is 
covering 
implementation 
in 
a 
nexus 
environment where the humanitarian response 
has significant impact on development work. 
Gender and human rights as cross-cutting issues 
were also considered. 
d. 
The CPE combined summative and 
formative approaches. The former was used to 
assess the performance of the programme 
towards achieving planned and unplanned 
results; while the latter served to identify lessons 
learned and recommendations which contribute 
to the next CPD. 
e. 
Participatory and utilization-focused 
approaches 
were 
deployed, 
ensuring 
engagement with key evaluation users at each 
stage of the evaluation process, and fostering 
ownership of and use of the evaluation results.   
f. 
A 
mixed-methods 
approach 
was 
adopted, enabling the CPE to triangulate various 
sources of information and perspectives. As 
such, quantitative and qualitative techniques 
were used to ensure a comprehensive, robust, 
and evidence-based understanding of the 
programme under evaluation, which in turn 
allowed for the development of insightful 
findings, reliable conclusions, relevant lessons 
learned and targeted recommendations.  
Relevance 
g. 
UNICEF Jordan designed a CP that was 
relevant to the needs of vulnerable populations 
in the country, aligned with government 
priorities, 
supportive 
of 
UNICEF 
change 
strategies and emerging priorities. The CP is well 
aligned with the humanitarian and development 
situation of Jordan and responds to priority 
needs of vulnerable children in the country, 
which continues to grapple with the human and 
financial implications of the protracted Syrian 
crisis.  Importantly, the CP has been flexible in 
developing and adapting programming to 
quickly react to the crisis caused by the COVID -
19 pandemic. 
h. 
Programmatically, the relevance of the 
CP stems from the use of the vulnerability-based 
approach across the different CP components. 
Using this approach, the CP targets all vulnerable 
children, regardless of status, ability, or 
nationality, with an emphasis on the most 
vulnerable. In so doing, it has recognized the 
potential for increased tension and societal 

 
 
 
 ii 
challenges caused by prolonged settlement of 
refugees and has, therefore, promoted social 
cohesion in all interventions. 
i. 
Progress has been made on integration 
of cross cutting issues but enriching, entrenching 
and producing improved results requires more 
resources and determination. Integration of 
children with disabilities into programming has 
occurred 
and 
demonstrable 
progress 
in 
expanding support for Persons with Disabilities 
(PWD) in some areas has been notable, for 
example in the form of the National Registry for 
Children with Hearing Disabilities. Efforts have 
been made to integrate the cross-cutting issue of 
gender in UNICEF interventions, however 
achieving 
transformational 
change 
will 
necessitate continued and expanded efforts. A 
climate lens (not just responsive but preferably 
robust programming) has not been observed in 
planning, although some movement is taking 
place in raising awareness of the climate crisis 
and engaging youth and adolescents through 
selected programming. 
Coherence 
j. 
The CP is in line with the strategies of 
other stakeholders in Jordan. Coherence has 
been 
ensured 
through 
engagement, 
consultation, 
and 
coordination 
with 
stakeholders (through the Jordan Response 
Plan) in the development and implementation of 
UNICEF’s programs. The aim has been to avoid 
duplication, while ensuring complementarity 
with other actors’ interventions. Through Sector 
Working groups, UNICEF as a Sector lead or 
member, collaborates with other partners to 
ensure investments are focused, coherent and 
responsive to the needs of the most vulnerable.  
k. 
While UNICEF’s leadership role in 
education has been observed, it could be 
improved in the WASH sector where UNICEF is 
the lead Agency. While programming has 
ensured that no one is left behind in one of the 
most water insecure countries, UNICEF has been 
challenged to mobilize expanded contributions 
or enriched government participation. 
l. 
Government 
of 
Jordan 
(GoJ) 
participation could be more vigorous in some 
program areas, and there remains concern CP 
resources are placing coordination function 
ahead of advocacy in some areas (i.e., providing 
services for the government instead of 
advocating for change with the government). 
Efficiency  
m. 
UNICEF’s Programme demonstrating 
economical / financial efficiency, and the CP has 
achieved efficiency gains in its work in refugee 
camps through local contracting and reducing 
administrative costs. This approach has also 
allowed for improved use of human resources, 
making staff resources available to work in other 
aspects of the programming. Technology 
solutions have produced system level change, 
such as those used in the TAKAFUL programme. 
Electronic registration, payment, and money 
transfers (digitally) has enabled the National Aid 
Fund (NAF) to cover all 12 governorates in a cost-
effective way. 
n. 
Additionally, 
UNICEF 
has 
further 
increased 
efficiency 
through 
“direct 
implementation and rationalization” strategies, 
notably in the Makani programme where the 
cost per child was modest and budgetary 
allocations to different programme components 
and other cost categories were adequate. With 
the rationalization strategy, UNICEF phased out 
and/or terminated partnerships with some 
NGOs and INGOs whose performance was weak. 
These measures created opportunities for 
substantial savings but also better distribution of 
resources.  
o. 
Regarding timely implementation of the 
Country Programme, the lens must be viewed 
pre- and post-COVID period. Prior to the COVID-
19 outbreak, the program was implemented in a 
timely 
manner. 
In 
COVID-period, 
delays 
encountered were principally beyond UNICEF’s 

 
 
 
 iii 
control, due to the security measures, the health 
regulation system of COVID-19, and due to GoJ 
procedures. For example, the implementation of 
Early Childhood Education was delayed due to a 
lack of funding at MoE despite planning 
completed 
by 
UNICEF, 
including 
training 
workshops for the new Parenting Awareness 
programme. 
Effectiveness  
p. 
UNICEF reporting indicates that nearly 
all programmes are on track or have met 
expectations and are contributing towards 
stated programme outcomes. This analysis takes 
into account the dislocation and delays to 
planned programmes as a result of COVID-19.  
q. 
UNICEF Jordan has strengthened the 
capacity of government institutions and civil 
society organizations, notably through the 
development of sector planning documents, 
strategies, and policies. This is evident in the 
work of the Education, WASH, SPP and Child 
Protection sections. For example, in 2019, with 
UNICEF support, the GoJ launched the National 
Social Protection Strategy 2019-2025. To ensure 
implementation of this strategy, UNICEF equally 
supported the MoSD and the Ministry of 
Planning and International Cooperation to 
finalize a three-year work plan, and to initiate an 
Implementation Support Unit to oversee the 
coordination 
and 
implementation of 
the 
strategy. Together, these instruments have 
helped to strategically reposition the country in 
terms of social protection, and to move a step 
from improved policies to actual policy 
implementation, thus allowing to change the 
conditions of children in the country. 
r. 
The UNICEF multifaceted approach has 
allowed for supporting a comprehensive set of 
interventions in the most disadvantaged 
districts. In that regard, the Makani programme 
provided a package of integrated social 
protection services in three main areas: learning 
support 
services, 
community-based 
child 
protection and life skills training. In all three 
service areas, UNICEF ensured outreach and 
appropriate referral services, thus enhancing 
access of vulnerable children and youth to 
solutions and systems available outside the 
Makani program. 
s. 
The CP supported the establishment of 
improved information systems that enable 
situation monitoring and research on children’s 
issues. Notably, NAF was supported with the 
development 
and 
maintenance 
of 
a 
management information system, including a 
two-way SMS platform to facilitate registration 
and communication with beneficiaries, opening 
of mobile wallets, and processing of grievances.  
UNICEF coordinated with NAF to develop a 
baseline 
report 
on 
the 
socio-economic 
conditions of the families applying for the NAF 
cash assistance program Takaful, with specific 
focus on the multiple deprivations faced by 
children of those families. This report has served 
to increase the level of accountability of social 
programming by the GoJ, while providing 
evidence 
to 
better 
inform 
policies 
and 
amendments.  
t. 
The CP supported activities aimed at 
generating evidence and knowledge on issues 
relating to the rights of children and adolescents 
in the country. This evidence is used by various 
national and regional partners to inform 
relevant social protection measures. The 
Geographic 
Multidimensional 
Vulnerability 
Analysis is one such activity, which helped create 
a harmonized and standardized tool that allows 
an in-depth understanding of the determinants 
of children’s vulnerability and poverty in Jordan. 
u. 
Delivery of programmes focuses on 
short-term/intermediate 
results 
where 
reporting indicates progress at all levels. Analysis 
and 
enhanced 
reporting 
on 
longer-term 
outcomes would improve appreciation of 
UNICEF’s longer-term efforts and mobilization of 
contributions. 
v. 
Political and economic factors have 
been 
the major 
factors 
influencing the 
achievement of CP results, the continuity 

 
 
 
 iv 
between social policy work and implementation 
and in some cases the level of investments. 
Frequent changes within Ministries have forced 
UNICEF to often repeatedly re-engage with new 
personnel who may take new positions on 
initiatives. This is an inefficient approach, but 
certainly not one within the control of UNICEF 
unless the initiative is dropped or downgraded. 
w. 
Despite efforts to respond to the COVID-
19 crisis, the pandemic has limited continued 
progress in all programme components. For 
example, Challenges remain in the ability of 
children to engage with distance education due 
to limitations of data, connectivity, compatible 
devices, and IT skills. Girls and children with 
disabilities face challenges and need targeted 
support. 
x. 
Internal factors that influence the 
achievement of the CP results (example: in 
health and nutrition sectors) include a lack of 
resources, and opportunities for increased 
communication, integration across sectors, and 
evaluation of interventions. 
Sustainability  
y. 
UNICEF Jordan has made substantial 
efforts to work with a wide spectrum of 
stakeholders to develop lasting partnerships, 
which can be maintained beyond the current CP.  
For instance, through a strategic partnership for 
the National NAF (i.e., Takaful Programs) 
ensuring thousands have received critical 
support, the CP has enabled changes to the NAF 
that are structural and long term and will be 
sustainable through commitments of GoJ. 
z. 
UNICEF 
system 
strengthening 
programmes have fostered national ownership 
to a high degree. Their efforts were integrated 
within the existing operating system through 
partnership models, such as Takaful, NAF, ECE, 
MAAN, Learning Bridges, with the MOE. In 
addition, the communication and coordination 
between UNICEF and key stakeholders created a 
greater foundation for their ownership. Finally, 
UNICEF’s respect for the technical expertise of 
their partners allowed for best practices and 
decision making to be decided by the partners. 
aa. 
In the SPSP Section, the design and 
implementation of programmes such as Makani 
and Hajati emerged through collaborative 
processes between UNICEF Jordan and key 
government institutions, as well as development 
partners operating in the social protection 
sector. By embedding these programmes within 
a planning mechanism that is both multi-sectoral 
and inter-agency, the programmes were not just 
perceived as UNICEF’s programmes, but were 
appreciated and actually owned by all involved 
actors. 
UNICEF efforts in education, WASH, Youth and 
Adolescent Development, Child Protection 
combined have contributed to the sustainability 
of results. Similarly, efforts in Health and 
Nutrition have ensured improved practice on 
care for new-borns and children and positive 
parenting. Importantly, UNICEF has supported 
longer term reflection on child and youth 
development 
which 
has 
led 
to 
system 
enhancements and supports effecting change 
which is enduring and integrated into the GoJ 
policies, plans and programs. 
bb. 
However, the evaluation found that, for 
some interventions, ownership of results is 
unlikely or not fully guaranteed. For example, 
the temporary nature of the camps makes the 
sustainability 
of 
UNICEF-supported 
WASH 
infrastructure 
and 
associated 
services 
challenging. The Government of Jordan is not in 
favour 
of 
making 
camp 
infrastructure 
permanent, and it is not always clear what the 
fate of the water and wastewater systems 
developed with the support of UNICEF in the 
camps will be, should the camps get closed. 
Impact 
cc. 
Innovative 
initiatives 
have 
been 
identified at community level and executed 
which have helped to diminish potential conflicts 

 
 
 
 v 
and promote greater social cohesion. At a higher 
level, 
universities 
and 
institutions 
have 
integrated Syrian refugee students into the 
higher education system. For example, LTUC 
targets Syrian students from the refugee camps 
and other refugee nationalities with the support 
of UNICEF to obtain the necessary documents. T 
dd. 
here 
are 
indications 
that 
overall 
acceptance, cooperation, and social cohesion at 
the community level between the host 
community and the refugees has increased. 
Amongst children and youth, UNICEF reports a 
35% increase in willingness to play and work with 
other 
students 
of 
different 
ages 
and 
nationalities. 
Different 
programme 
interventions contributed to social cohesion. For 
example, the expansion of WASH services to the 
most vulnerable people in Jordan (e.g., through 
rehabilitation of WASH systems in highly 
vulnerable areas) contributed to the protection 
of human rights and social cohesion in 
communities. 
ee. 
Despite efforts to promote social 
cohesion and inclusion, one of the remaining 
challenges in Jordan is limited participation of 
women in the labor force as compared to men. 
This finding is consistent with the most recent 
statistics on women employment in Jordan.  
Connectedness  
ff. 
UNICEF-supported programmes have 
allowed the GoJ to deal with the emergency 
needs of families and children, while at the same 
time providing a solution to developmental 
issues such as fighting child labour and preparing 
the youth for labour market. The program also 
strove 
to 
transition 
from 
emergency 
interventions 
to 
a 
more 
nexus-oriented 
approach. 
Importantly, in the areas of Education and 
WASH, the humanitarian interventions have 
supported progress towards the humanitarian to 
development 
shift 
or 
contributed 
to 
development interventions (Nexus). However, 
achieving a fully developed nexus approach in 
the 
Jordan 
requires 
high-level 
political 
commitment, a clear vision and long-term 
resources going forward. To assist the transition, 
UNICEF is changing its advocacy approach to 
ensure donors understand the need to provide 
resources for the development-humanitarian 
nexus.     
Lessons Learned  
gg. 
The key lessons from the analysis of the 
findings are as follows: (1) an early start of 
planning and partner engagement delivers 
better 
understanding 
of 
objectives, 
coordination, and collaboration ; (2) flexibility 
and agility are key to effective programming in a 
complex and ever-changing context; (3) Cash 
Plus approaches may have a more powerful and 
long-lasting effects than cash transfer alone; and 
(4) a  more inclusive and targeting approach with 
more relaxed targeting thresholds is beneficial 
for 
addressing 
economic 
and 
social 
vulnerabilities of children and families. 
Recommendations  
Recommendation 1: New planned programming 
of UNICEF should be based on the most current 
situation building on the data provided by the 
vulnerability analysis considering the regional 
context and impact of COVID-19. Early evidence 
points to an increasing number of vulnerable 
persons in Jordan, and a corresponding decline 
in the vulnerable populations’ economic and 
social situational context and environment. A 
potential implication of this is increased tension 
between camps and host communities which 
limit social cohesion. To mitigate the effect of 
dislocation, workshops can be organized to 
connect all groups of the community and foster 
stronger bonds between camp residents and 
host communities. Priority: High, Stakeholder: 
UNICEF Jordan 

 
 
 
 vi 
Recommendation 2: ICT is clearly a key area of 
intervention in education, and there is potential 
sector for growth at national level, with long-
term shift in education training using ICT related, 
particularly in the area of skills development, 
where Jordan has been challenged to move the 
needle forward. The next UNICEF CP 5-year 
strategy needs to include and focus on digital 
literacy access to technology and access to 
internet for learning. Not only does this enable 
accessibility in times of crisis but serves to 
address remote communities who need support 
and improved access. As can been seen during 
COVID-19 closure, this system change work 
enable UNICEF to support the Government of 
Jordan to enhance social protection coverage 
and 
coordination 
of 
social 
protection 
programmes (work which should also be built 
upon). Priority: Medium, Stakeholder: UNICEF, 
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information 
and Communications Technology, and Ministry 
of Social Development. 
Recommendation 3: The Jordan Country Office 
should continue its efforts towards (and 
advocacy for) a full application of the 
humanitarian-development (nexus) approach to 
ensure 
that 
UNCIEF’s 
humanitarian 
interventions 
create 
benefits 
for 
the 
developmental interventions and have a lasting 
impact on the living conditions of the Jordanian 
populations. As part of the change strategy 
advanced by the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-
2025 this includes systematically linking analysis, 
planning and monitoring of results and 
financing.  Reflecting on pasts efforts and work 
in what has been considered as Nexus 
programming, identifying and monitoring results 
will enable improved identification of what the 
approach has yield and progress achieved along 
the humanitarian to development continuum. 
Priority: High, Stakeholder: UNICEF Jordan   
Recommendation 4: In the next programming 
cycle, the UNICEF Jordan Country Office should 
apply a gender, climate, and disability lens in a 
targeted way with an eye on achieving 
measurable substantial results.  This is of critical 
importance 
as 
UNICEF 
has 
elevated 
programming on gender, disability rights and 
ensuring a sustainable climate and environment 
within its Strategic Plan 2022-2025.  
The next CP should increase efforts to integrate 
identifiable gender-equality programming for 
transformative results., working across all 
country programs in pursuit of the UNICEF 
objectives of redressing gender inequalities, 
removing structural barriers, working to change 
harmful gender norms, and empowering girls, 
women and disadvantaged people from diverse 
population groups.  
Climate change is expected to have a significant 
impact on Jordan, most likely leading to 
increased 
temperatures, 
variation 
in 
precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, 
and 
flash 
flooding. 
UNICEF 
Jordan 
has 
implemented some interventions aimed to 
contribute 
to 
creating 
climate 
resilient 
institutions and communities in the country, 
thus indirectly strengthening Jordan’s capacity 
to deal with climate change. It should continue 
and build upon with support safe and 
sustainable climate and environment for 
children, maintaining WASH programming and 
continuing the involvement of youth as engines 
for leading awareness on the importance of 
addressing climate issues.  
Its efforts in promoting and protecting the rights 
of 
children 
with 
disabilities 
could 
be 
supplemented with enhanced commitments to 
capacity building for teachers and support for 
service delivery for communities in remote areas 
with 
vulnerable 
children. 
Priority: 
High, 
Stakeholder: UNICEF, Ministry of Education, 
Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Water & 
Irrigation 
Recommendation 5: Careful consideration of 
priorities and presentation of the new Country 
Program through string engagement with 
stakeholders is important. UNICEF should 
present programming adjustment and changes 
as a reflection of addressing the needs of the 
most vulnerable; the increased demands being 

 
 
 
 vii 
placed on UNICEF to ensure there is a sound 
understanding of the approach and the reduced 
resources available for the Jordan CP, to ensure 
there is misunderstanding that this is an 
indication of reduced UNICEF interest or needs 
of 
Jordan’s 
children.  
Priority: 
Medium  
Stakeholder: UNICEF
