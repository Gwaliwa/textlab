Executive summary 
 
Objective, object, and process of the evaluation 
The overall purpose of the evaluation is to assess to what extent the undertaken reforms in 
Kazakhstan from 2011 to 2020 have contributed to strengthening the system for the 
prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of children, as well as to examine 
enabling conditions and bottlenecks that will require further improvement. 
The object of the evaluation is the Kazakh system for the prevention and response to 
violence, abuse, and neglect of children. The evaluation used the definition of violence 
against children (VAC) as in Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of which 
Kazakhstan is a State Party: violence against children (VAC) includes physical, emotional, 
sexual violence as well as negligent treatment. According to UNICEF, the goal of a system for 
the prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of children is that all children, 
both girls and boys, grow up with greater freedom from all forms of violence and those who 
do experience violence benefit from greater access to care, support and other services 
needed to ensure physical, mental, and social well-being. Preventing and responding to VAC 
is one of the goals of a national child protection system (CPS). A CPS comprises formal and 
informal structures, functions, and capacities, that cut across ministerial competencies and 
include both public and societal actors. Thus, a key feature of a CPS is its multisectoral nature 
that gathers its impact by integrating the competencies and actions of different duty-
bearers. The strength of a CPS derives from fostering the interaction of its components, 
namely (1.) laws and policies, (2.) governance structure, (3.) a continuum of services from 
primary and secondary prevention to response, (4.) data collection, monitoring and 
oversight, (5.) human and financial and infrastructure resources, (6.) social participation and 
norms.  
The evaluation is conceived as a formative evaluation. It is meant to inform the future 
government strategy concerning preventing and responding to VAC, as derived from the 
obligation of the CRC and to SDG target 16.2 of the Agenda 2030. Specifically, is it meant to 
identify priorities for short-term and mid-term action by the whole of government as led by 
the President of the Republic and coordinated by the Prime Minister and by the respective 
ministries, namely, MoES, MoIA, MoJ, MoLSP, MoPH as well as the Judiciary. It is also meant 
to inform implementation at subnational level, by oblast administration and municipal 
governments. Furthermore, the evaluation shall guide the future action of UNICEF in 
Kazakhstan. Finally, nongovernmental organizations shall benefit from the evidence. 
The evaluation’s timeframe covers the period from 2011 to 2020. In 2011, the Child Protection 
System did not exist as such and was based on a pre-1991 Soviet model, relying heavily on 
institutionalisation and with an under-developed children’s services sector. Child Protection 
was used as a generic term to cover any support and welfare services provided to children as 
well as the administrative process associated with the arranging, monitoring, funding, and 
delivering of those services. The main legal basis in 2011 was constituted by the Law on 
Special Social Services adopted in 2008, which, however, lacked secondary regulation for its 
implementation. In 2011, the governance structure of child protection was fragmented and

there was limited availability of child protection services, while those available were not 
meeting international standards. 
Methodology. The study is based both on an extensive review of secondary sources, a 
legislative and policy review, as well as primary research tools. A methodological choice was 
taken to base the primary investigation in this evaluation principally on qualitative tools, such 
as interviews, focus discussion groups and case studies. A refined set of research questions 
were defined in an evaluation matrix that is composed of 20 research questions, including 
indicators and sources for verification. As a key structuring principle, the CPS components 
have been chosen rather than the standard evaluation criteria (relevance, effectiveness, 
efficiency, coherence, sustainability, and impact). The report is structured against these 20 
research questions. 
The research was commissioned by the Kazakh Human Rights Commissioner and UNICEF. 
These organizations managed the relation to the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG). The ERG 
is composed of a cross-section of line ministries, representatives from public institutions as 
well as child rights activists and non-governmental service providers. The ERG had been 
involved in three strategic moments of the research, namely in the Inception phase when 
defining the focus and methodology (January 2021), in the definition of the theory of change 
after presenting the interim findings (June 2021), and the validation of the final report 
(September 2021).  
Children were not interviewed for the research. A comprehensive ethics review was 
conducted, and approval was obtained by UNICEF´s ethical review board. The evaluation 
team ensured full protection of the participants in the evaluation and has applied the ethical 
standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis. No disclosure of ongoing 
violence or abuse happened during the evaluation. The evaluators declare to have no conflict 
of interest. 
Key findings 
The CPS in Kazakhstan has made remarkable progress in the last 10 years. These are 
noticeable in the high number of national laws, policies, protocols, and standard operating 
procedures that have been adopted and/or are under discussion at the time of writing.  
It is equally evident that these reforms haven’t been driven by a common vision and plan to 
adequately address violence against children. They have the initiative of individual sectors 
(health, education, and law enforcement in particular) but without enough cross-sectoral 
consultation, coordination and learning.  
The CPS as a concept was not there in 2011 and 2021 is still little or differently understood by 
policymakers, officials, and professionals. Secondly, it is still too fragmented to be able to 
provide to children at risk or victims of violence the multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary 
support that they need to avoid or repair the experience of violence.  
The evaluation found evidence of delays, bottlenecks, and opportunities for further 
strengthening each of the six components of the CPS (see individual sections below). But it 
also confirmed the findings from the inception phase according to which two components 
require priority investment and attention by the President and the Government: these are (1)

the component of prevention and response services and (2) the component on governance 
at central and sub-national level.  
Strengthening and establishing new services is urgently needed as the ones that exist do 
provide some bits and pieces of prevention, support and rehabilitation. But they result in a 
piecemeal approach that does not guarantee full coverage of needs, across age groups, 
gender, situation of vulnerabilities and access across all territory. Specialised and integrated 
services for child victims of violence, including sexual violence, do not exist. 
Strengthening the governance of the CPS is equally urgent, both at central and sub-national 
levels. The responsibility for developing, implementing, evaluating policies, programmes, 
and services on violence against children still sit within each line-ministries and this has not 
provided for strong enough accountability and execution of policies.  
The CPS in Kazakhstan is still too fragmented and built on sectors in a siloed way. Several 
components of it have been strengthened during the last decade that demonstrates that 
Kazakhstan is on the right track to bring those pieces under a clearer and unified framework 
and vision. 
Laws and policies 
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in introducing legislation prohibiting 
violence in schools, childcare and penal institutions. 
In terms of prohibition, the Kazakh legislation is quite comprehensive in protecting children 
from physical and sexual violence. Nevertheless, it presents two main gaps: (1) it still lacks 
definitions of child abuse, mental violence, abuse, insult, bullying and self-harm; and (2) 
Corporal punishment is still lawful at home, in pre-school day care centres for older children.  
In terms of the legal basis for prevention and response services, besides the development of 
several sectoral laws that have established services for children, there are still some gaps: (1) 
the experience of violence, abuse and neglect does not trigger direct eligibility for special 
social services but only if violence leads to social deprivation and social maladjustment; (2) 
specialised services for child victims of violence de facto do not exist under the law. 
Fighting violence against children has become a national policy priority in the last five years. 
The second half of the decade has seen the adoption of several sectoral policies (on social 
development, on public health, on education) that set the agenda to further develop and 
modernise the country until 2025. Nevertheless, policies have followed sectoral siloes and 
have left the system fragmented. Fighting domestic violence has received the most attention 
and a cross-sectoral one; nevertheless, it de-facto focuses on women and not really on 
women and children. As of 2021, Kazakhstan does not have a centralised and unifying policy 
on child protection/violence against children. 
Governance 
In Kazakhstan, the governance of the CPS has not evolved much from 2011. Although multiple 
laws and policies were adopted in the last decade, these have been the initiatives by 
individual sectors in a siloed way. As in 2021, there is no single central government body 
responsible for setting state policies on child protection /violence against children. This has 
continued to result in a segmented approach with fragmented sectoral initiatives: multiple

agencies develop and implement programmes without sufficient collaboration and 
coordination resulting in gaps. 
Unlike Child Protection, gender issues and violence against women have been better 
coordinated at the central level. The Commission on Gender, Family and Demographic 
Policies has contributed to the adoption of the Concept of Family and Gender Policy till 2030. 
Many stakeholders used the Commission on Gender as a good example of effective multi-
sectoral coordination, while also recognising its limitation in resources and capacities. 
The lack of coordination at the national level is transposed at the sub-national level. Although 
the evaluation found some anecdotal evidence of increased cooperation between health, 
education, social protection, law enforcement agencies and NGOs, this cooperation is 
voluntary, depending on the goodwill of professionals and not based on cross-sectoral 
protocols or memorandum of understanding. 
At the local level, the delivery of child protection services is carried out in a fragmented way 
and follows sectoral lines. There are several bodies responsible for delivering the services to 
children and their families but none of them has a coordinating function. The only official 
body with a mandated function for coordination is the multi-sectoral Commissions on Minor’s 
Affairs. Nevertheless, its role is limited to assessing the need for the alternative care of 
children and out-of-home placement.  
Two informants stressed that coordination works a little better at the local level as all 
sectoral departments work under the executive bodies of Akimats and Oblast administration 
and therefore the accountability is stronger. This is something that would need further 
research. 
Prevention and Response Services 
The Law on Special Social Services (2008) created the legal basis for the development of 
social services for children and families. Several specialised social services were created in 
the last decade and across services, but very few of them with the prevention or response to 
VAC as the central objective. 
In the prevention of violence against children, the notable exceptions are the universal 
patronage nurses introduced in 2017 and the piloting of the whole-school violence prevention 
programmes in 2014 (which was discontinued because of lack of funding). This has resulted 
in a piecemeal approach that presents overlaps (for example between youth health centres 
and youth resource centres, of between school psychologists and school pedagogues) and 
overlooked areas such as parenting programmes. At the same time school programmes 
directed at prevention offer resources to school administration and psychologists to 
incorporate violence prevention lessons into the existing school curriculum, but their 
capacity seems to be limited by an approach that is perceived to be stigmatising and punitive 
and sheading bad reputation on schools. Targeted social assistance has been introduced and 
strengthened, nevertheless, it is not accompanied by any violence prevention in family or 
parent support. 
When it comes to response services, specialised services for child victims of violence are very 
rare in Kazakhstan, both in terms of availability and coverage. Support services for child 
victims of violence (treatment, psycho-social and mental health, recovery, and reintegration)

are mainly residential, are provided both by NGOs and the State. They only provide support 
to children who are eligible for them but not to their parents or siblings if they would need 
it. There is a small number of crisis centres – both state and private – available for women 
victims of violence, that potentially offer service for girls, but they de-facto are primarily 
targeted at women. 
Oversight and monitoring, quality of services 
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has taken considerable steps to develop its national surveillance 
system on violence against children. With the support from UN agencies, it carried out 
several nationally representative surveys (amongst them MICS, VAW, and HBSC). 
Surveillance using criminal and administrative data has nevertheless lagged, and little 
progress has been made since 2011. As of 2020, Kazakhstan, besides the collection of criminal 
data, still lacks national standards and indicators for collecting data on VAC and no inter-
agency protocols to facilitate the sharing of administrative data across sectors and ministries, 
agencies, and services providers. 
Human Rights Institutions established in Kazakhstan has played a significant role in 
monitoring and exposing the status of violence against children in Kazakhstan. Although not 
fully compliant with the Paris Principle, the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights has 
been championing the issue of violence against children in state-run institutions, in schools 
and lately in the family. Under the same office, the National Prevention Mechanism to 
prevent torture is mandated to visit children’s institutions. Finally, a Children’s 
ombudsperson was appointed in 2016, but without the necessary resources to fully exercise 
its functions. 
As of 2015, different line ministries have adopted quality standards and sectoral practices to 
deal with the identification, referral, and support of child victims of violence. All the 
standards were developed based on the Law on Special Social Services of 2008 (last 
amended in 2019). Only a few of them (the most noticeable exception is the SOP on VAC for 
medical staff) require the services to carry out multi-disciplinary needs assessment, develop 
an individualised plan and assign a case manager to monitor it and follow it up. None of them 
requests the services to consult children in the assessment of their needs and in the 
identification of services that are made available to him/her. 
Human and financial resources 
Since the adoption of the Law on Specialised Social Services in 2008, Kazakhstan has invested 
enormously in the planning, development and support of the social service workforce. It has 
established the necessary legal and regulatory framework, the classifications of cadres and 
other professionals, certification requirements and practice. Nevertheless, every sector has 
taken its path without coordinating with other sectors or learning from similar processes. 
This is particularly problematic for an area of work, such as preventing and responding to 
violence against children, where the collaboration across sectors and disciplines brings 
better outcomes for children than what each sector can achieve alone. Kazakhstan has the 
ambition to strengthen the social sector, by building on what exists and unifying and 
consolidating standards and regulatory frameworks across ministerial silos.
