1. Executive Summary  
1.1. Introduction 
In Guinea-Bissau, COVID-19 has exacerbated a deep learning crisis, related to many challenges in the 
education system, including a lack of inclusive and safe school infrastructures, qualified human 
resources and didactic and pedagogical resources, as well as teachers' strikes. When the first cases of 
COVID-19 were detected in Guinea-Bissau, all educational institutions (from pre-school to higher 
education) closed, further compounding the above challenges, reducing the learning time of students, 
and enhancing the risk of drop-out. 
To respond to an emergency, UNICEF Guinea-Bissau received an emergency funding from the GPE for 
a total amount of USD 3,5 million. Initially designed to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December 
2021), the implementation cycle of the interventions covered by this funding was extended twice by a 
total of ten months, until the end of October 2022.  
The main objective of the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was to support 
the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the 
coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the 
continuity of learning and well-being for children and youth, especially for the most vulnerable affected 
by the outbreak. 
This included the following specific objectives: i) To support response coordination and real-time 
monitoring (focusing on the most vulnerable);ii) To ensure safe school operations including through 
hygiene supplies and risk communication; iii) To support continuity of learning through access to 
remote learning programs as appropriate for Guinea Bissau; iv) To scale-up psychosocial, health, 
WASH, and nutrition services within the Education sector; v) To ensure a safe opening-back of schools 
through back-to-school campaigns, catch-up classes, and accelerated learning and vi) To codify and 
disseminate best practice and innovation. 
1.2. Purpose of the Evaluation 
The purpose of the evaluation is two-fold: accountability and learning. With regards to accountability, 
this evaluation will provide both the donor (vertical accountability) and the expected beneficiaries 
(horizontal accountability) with solid evidence regarding the extent to which the Guinea-Bissau COVID-
19 Education Sector Response attained its envisaged objectives. As far as learning is concerned, it is 
expected that the findings will inform the design and execution of new initiatives within the new 
Country Programme. MEN, UNICEF, LEG partners, and the GPE will use the evidence-based findings to 
inform and improve the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of future development 
and humanitarian programming in the education sector. 
1.3. Objectives of the Evaluation 
The objectives of the evaluation are as follows: 
1. To determine the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and efficiency of the Guinea-Bissau 
COVID-19 Education Sector Response project. 
2. To identify lessons learning regarding what worked and did not work during the 
implementation of the project, including unexpected outcomes (positive and negative); 

6 
 
3. To critically analyse the theory of change and the extent to which its planned logical framework 
and assumptions compare with the actual implementation and the results achieved; 
4. To assess the extent to which the project integrated equity, human rights, and gender 
principles into its design, implementation, and monitoring; 
5. To formulate key recommendations regarding: (1) how to further strengthen the response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea-Bissau; (2) how to prepare for future education in 
emergency (EiE) situations and make the education sector more resilient; and (3) how to better 
implement future EiE interventions. 
1.4. Scope of the Evaluation  
Regarding the thematic scope, the evaluation all the intervention areas included in the Project. This 
included not only all the activities directly related to schools and learning, but also to the cross-sectoral 
interventions supported by the project (for example, cash transfers, nutrition, WASH, and child 
protection). The geographic scope was national , so the evaluation included national level secondary 
data, as well as information covering all regions of the country for the document review. The fieldwork 
included data collection in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá, considering rural and urban regions.  
Regarding the chronologic scope, the evaluation examined all the activities implemented from the 
launch of the project in July 2020 until the time of data collection in November 2022. 
1.5. Criteria and Evaluation Questions 
In order to fulfil the aim and objectives stated above, this evaluation was guided by five OECD 
evaluation criteria: (A) relevance; (B) coherence; (C) effectiveness; (D) efficiency; and (E) sustainability, 
as well as (F) an additional Gender, Equity and Human Rights criterion. In order to clarify how well the 
Project matched these criteria, a total of 20 questions were formulated, and an evaluation matrix 
developed accordingly (see Appendix 6). 
1.6. Methodology 
Within the overall framework of the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCC), a 
mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze information for the evaluation, consisting of 
a desk review, a review of learning and communication materials, secondary quantitative data analysis, 
and primary qualitative data (semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and focus groups). In 
total, 66 individuals (10 women, 31 men, 12 girls, and 13 boys) were interviewed in semi-structured 
interviews or focus groups. 
Regarding the sampling strategy evaluation opted for a purposeful sampling strategy based on the 
selected intervention sites in Bissau, Oio and Bafatá. 
After presenting and receiving feedback on the initial findings, the evaluation conducted a systematic 
review and analysis of all data, identifying key themes, patterns, relationships, and explanations 
relevant to the evaluation questions and indicators in the evaluation matrix. The analysis, which was 
performed manually, compared the project objectives with the actual findings, using the evaluation 
matrix as a framework to organize data and guide the analysis. The evaluation used different lines of 
evidence and triangulation of sources.

Data collection and processing were carried out in compliance with the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for 
Evaluation and its principles. 
1.7. Presentation of the Main Findings and Conclusions 
The Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was a “hybrid” project, with both 
emergency and development aspects. As such, the Project fits with current reforms inspired by the 
World Humanitarian Summit, which focus on the ongoing quest to find “new ways of working” that 
bridge humanitarian action, development, peace, and security in a “nexus” approach, amidst 
protracted global displacement.   
The evaluation arrived at the following conclusions regarding the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, 
efficiency, sustainability, as well as gender, equity and human rights: 
Relevance: The Project was well aligned with the Contingency Plan for the education sector, supporting 
its main objectives and contributing to all four specific objectives of the Contingency Plan. 
Furthermore, the Project’s Theory of Change (ToC) was indeed logical and mostly aligned with 
implementation realities, as all the elements of the ToC were translated into planned project outputs, 
the majority of which were also implemented. Using the COVID-19 emergency situation as an entry 
point, the Project looked beyond the short-term impact of the pandemic to address systemic 
challenges related to the resilience of the education sector through a multi-sectoral approach. 
However, the Project’s resilience aspect (although it is discussed in the Project document narrative) 
was not made explicit in the Project objectives However, a few aspects of the ToC were not fully aligned 
with implementation realities, namely distance learning, recovery classes, and accelerated learning. 
Given the multitude of supply- and demand-side factors hampering education in Guinea-Bissau, the 
multi-sectoral approach taken by the Project was highly relevant to tackle these multi-dimensional 
barriers.  
Coherence: The Project’s objectives were fully aligned with government priorities and national 
policies, in particular the national Education Sector Plan 2017-2025 and the Government’s National 
Contingency Plan, as well as the UNICEF Country Programme Document 2016-2020 and the UNCT’s 
Socio-economic Response Plan. The Project accelerated other reforms previously discussed by MEN 
and partners, particularly in relation to the development of a national strategy for distance learning to 
benefit out-of-school children and the implementation of catch-up programmes to minimize the loss 
of learning. 
Effectiveness: By extending emergency-related services to more than 1,500 schools, the Project made 
an important contribution to ensuring safe schools operations and the continuity of learning. The main 
objective and half of the specific objectives were nearly fully reached. Three specific objectives were 
partially reached. In particular, accelerated learning was not fully implemented, while the effectiveness 
of distance learning was doubtful, given the restricted access and lack of circular learning. Good 
practice and innovation were addressed only through a brief mid-term evaluation and the present final 
evaluation. Factors that promoted the effectiveness of the Project were the demonstration of MEN’s 
commitment (with UNICEF support) to assist schools to remain open, the alignment with the 
Contingency Plan, the multi-sectoral nature of interventions, and the use of the mWater database. 
Factors that hindered the effectiveness of the Project were the late recruitment of a full-time project 
manager, the low absorption and implementation capacity of MEN, leadership turnover in MEN, the 
lack of water at school level, transportation problems, and the non-availability of previously planned 
partnerships to conduct a learning assessment. Regarding unexpected outcomes, the Project 

8 
 
facilitated a trusted list of schools for MEN and its partners, fostered the accountability of governance 
in the education sector, and promoted awareness of the importance of WASH in schools. 
Efficiency: Considering the challenges to implementation (including low absorption capacity, frequent 
leadership changes, and customs clearance problems, among others), the timeliness of the Project’s 
implementation can be considered satisfactory. The largest shares of the budget went to Output 2 
(Sanitization of schools) and Output 4 (Multi-sectoral services), which is justifiable, given the close 
linkage between Output 2 and the overall objective of continuing education, and the complexity of a 
multi-sectoral approach. Due to the high costs involved with water infrastructure, fixed handwashing 
devices were only installed in 20 schools that already had access to water. This was efficient, even 
though it may have exacerbated existing inequalities. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Project was 
facilitated by the installation of the CTIP for coordination and monitoring, synergies with existing 
initiatives within UNICEF, and the use of mWater as a low-cost tool for the collection, storage, and 
analysis of cross-sectoral data. 
Sustainability: The project built logistical capacity for operating in an emergency situation, as well as 
overall capacity on education in emergencies, for example, through mWater which has alleviated 
known weaknesses in national education data systems and provided key information on the sector to 
guide and monitor action going forward. The main coordinating body established by the Project, the 
CTIP, was recently been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the Governing Council of the 
Ministry of Education and may function as the Education Sector Plan Coordination Committee in the 
future. Moreover, the agenda in favour of SRGBV, distance learning, and accelerated learning has been 
advanced as a result of the Project and have improved the capacity of the Education Sector to deal 
with other types of disruptions to fragile education system, notably teacher strikes, at central level. 
The sustainability of the Project was further enhanced by directly and indirectly engaging with the 
Teacher Study Groups (Comissões de Estudos, COMES), the School Management Committees (Comité 
de Gestão Escolar, COGES), and the parents’ associations (Associação de pais e encarregados de 
educação de alunos, APEEA), all of which are regulated under MEN norms and standards. However, 
doubts remain regarding local school administration’s capacity to deal with future emergencies. 
Equity, gender, and human rights: The Project applied equity considerations in the selection of 
geographical regions and in the targeting and implementation of the cash transfer initiative. The 
priority geographical areas selected for the Project included (i) the regions and areas most affected by 
the spread of COVID-19 and (ii) the regions with the highest number of children out of school. 
Conversely, efficiency gains may have come at the expense of equity, with regards to the exclusion of 
households of out-of-school children for the cash transfer, and the installation of fixed handwashing 
devices in schools that already disposed of access to water. The Project addressed an important set of 
barriers to girls’ and boys’ school attendance, which had been previously identified as a concern by 
MEN and its partners, by tackling SRGBV. Generally speaking, the Project promoted the right to 
education (CRC Art. 28), and the right to health and a safe environment (CRC Art. 24). 
1.8. Lessons Learned  
The evaluation identified the following lessons learned: 
LL1. It is possible to reach the majority of schools in Guinea Bissau with support during an emergency, 
with sufficient funding.  
LL2. Tackling multiple barriers to education through a multi-sectoral intervention is an appropriate and 
feasible approach.  

9 
 
LL3. A complex multi-sectoral project requires a dedicated project manager.  
LL4. The mWater database proved to be a useful tool for data collection and monitoring in education.  
LL5. Unconditional cash transfers are a relevant social protection initiative in Guinea-Bissau, but 
baseline and endline studies for such an initiative should always be carried out within the same school 
year.  
LL6. Accelerated learning and distance learning are complex initiatives, which require time to test, 
develop and assess new tools. 
LL7. Schools need access to water. Therefore, attention to this aspect of school infrastructure is vital.  
1.9. Recommendations 
The following strategic and operational recommendations are supported by findings and conclusions. 
Strategic recommendation 1: Ensure the integration of mWater with existing systems in MEN, for data 
collection, planning, and monitoring by designating a focal point in MEN, training MEN staff on mWater 
and advocating for usage among LEG partners (Users: MEN, UNICEF, LEG) 
Strategic recommendation 2: Promote regional contingency plans on education in emergencies by 
developping contingency plans in all 11 educational regions, contextualizing INEE Minimum Standards, 
working closely with COMES and COGES and promoting a policy to stipulate incentives for teachers to 
stay in their place of duty in case of school closure ( Users: MEN, UNICEF, LEG) 
Strategic recommendation 3: Continue efforts to develop and systematize accelerated learning.by 
considering in depth accelerated learning in the context of the forthcoming national strategy on out-
of-school children (Users: UNICEF, MEN, LEG) 
Strategic recommendation 4: Continue efforts to develop and systematize distance learning by 
conducting a feasibility study for a robust distance education system that includes digital technology, 
integrating circular learning into distance learning methodologies (i.e., students’ responses) and 
advocating for inclusion of Project tools in the current and future World Bank project (Users: UNICEF, 
MEN, LEG) 
Strategic recommendation 5: Promote water infrastructure in schools by engaging in resource 
mobilization in favour of schools’ water infrastructure, strengthening the issue of access to water in 
the Local Education Group and supporting the World Bank to map all school infrastructure. (Users: 
LEG, UNICEF, MEN ) 
Strategic recommendation 6: Carry out a study on child labour and school attendance, jointly between 
UNICEF Education and Child Protection Sections. (Users: UNICEF, MEN, LEG) 
Strategic recommendation 7: Analyse the reasons for the lack of girls’ enrolment in Oio region, and 
develop targeted interventions. (Users: UNICEF,MEN, LEG) 

10 
 
Strategic recommendation 8: Engage strategically with teachers’ unions, to create synergies and avoid 
duplication of efforts, for example, in the provision of materials during an emergency. (Users: UNICEF, 
LEG) 
Operational recommendation 1: Identify "champions" among COGES, and promote peer-to-peer 
education with other COGES, in order to promote good practice regarding school management, 
particularly during an emergency. (Users: UNICEF, MEN) 
Operational recommendation 2: Provide further support for community volunteers, particularly with 
regards to distance learning, and monitor and evaluate their engagement, in order to strengthen the 
link between schools and communities and to better prepare for an emergency. (Users: UNICEF, MEN)

2. Evaluation Context 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a 
public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations, and on 
March 11, 2020, as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted learning for over 89% of the 
world’s student population. For more than 1.5 billion children in 188 countries, education has been 
interrupted. The gains in expanding access to education and improving the quality of education were 
in risk in being permanently compromised. 
In Guinea-Bissau, the first cases of COVID-19 were recorded on 24 March 2020. Two years later, the 
country recorded 8,186 positive cases, including 171 deaths. The capital Bissau and the regions of 
Biombo and Bafatá remain the most affected. The most affected age group is 25-34 years old, followed 
by 35-44 years old and, the disease seems to affect men more than women. When the first cases of 
COVID-19 were detected in Guinea-Bissau, all educational institutions (from pre-school to higher 
education) closed, reducing the learning time of students already affected by long and frequent 
teacher strikes. 
COVID-19 has indeed exacerbated a deep learning crisis. In Guinea-Bissau, 1 in 4 children of primary 
school age (6-14 years) were out of school before the advent of COVID-19. When they are in school, 
the level of achievement in school content is generally very low. The MICS data showed that only 1 in 
10 children aged 7- 14 had mastery of basic literacy and numeracy skills. 
In Guinea-Bissau, the education system faces many challenges: the system lacks inclusive and safe 
school infrastructures, qualified human resources (a good proportion of the teaching staff have 
no/limited background in pedagogy) and didactic and pedagogical resources. In recent years, teachers’ 
strikes have occurred more frequently and for longer durations, increasing the number of out-of-
school children and the risk of permanent drop-out. 
For children, the lack of access to education can have lifelong impacts, creating a widening gap in 
learning and reducing their ability to acquire skills that increase their employability. The World Bank 
estimates that there will be a loss of income of US$10 trillion for the current cohort of children if this 
learning crisis is not addressed. 
To address these challenges in Guinea-Bissau, it was important to act on several levels and find 
educational alternatives that allow out-of-school children to acquire foundational skills for their 
personal and social development. With funding from the Global Partnership for Education, UNICEF 
Guinea-Bissau has therefore supported the scaling up of the education sector response to mitigate the 
impacts of the crisis on access and learning. 
3. Evaluation Object  
Guinea-Bissau received an emergency funding from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for a 
total amount of USD 3,5 million. Initially designed to run for 18 months (from July 2020 to December 
2021), the implementation cycle of the interventions covered by this funding was extended twice by a 
total of ten months, until the end of October 2022.  
The main objective of the Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Education Sector Response project was to support 
the government of Guinea-Bissau and the Local Education Group (LEG) to reduce the impact of the 
coronavirus on the education of children in the country by ensuring safe school operations and the
