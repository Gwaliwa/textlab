Executive summary 
Background  
The practice of child marriage has been a critical area of focus for Bangladesh. Currently, it is ranked 
at 134 out of 175 countries on the End of Childhood Index 20201 and has the fourth highest rate of 
child marriage in the world after African countries of Niger, the Central African Republic, and Chad2 
Statistics from the MICS 2019 show that 19.8 per cent of women before turning 15 years of age (aged 
15-49 years) and 60 per cent (aged 20-49 years) before turning 18 are married.3 Drivers of child 
marriage are complex, diverse, interlinked4 and at times, context specific. Gender and social norms 
interact with several socio-economic factors to form a complex web of interrelated facets to place a girl 
child at risk of marriage. 
The key drivers of this pervasive practice are rooted in gender-based violence and inequality, 
intergenerational cycles of poverty, lack of access to education, poor income generating 
capacities, vulnerability caused due to climate change and natural disasters, and limited access 
to resources for girls and women, especially a lack of their own income and financial planning skills.5 
Distinctions also exist for factors such as differences in the rates of employment among young women, 
economic conditions of those who facilitate child marriage and economic pressures related to dowry 
payments. Further area of concern is the linkage between an ageing population and the occurrence 
of child marriage. Moreover, the influence of religion in the context of Bangladeshi society has also 
been highlighted as a key driver of child marriage in the country.  
Programme description 
At a global level, in 2015, United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF launched their Global 
Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage (GPECM) across twelve programme 
countries.6 Bangladesh is one of the 12 countries in the world that is a part of the joint UNICEF and 
UNFPA GPECM that also implements its strategies with a goal to delay marriage, address associated 
conditions that are contributing factors to child marriage nationally and provide support to girls who have 
already been married off early.  
To work towards Ending Child Marriage (ECM), Government of Bangladesh, UNICEF BCO and its 
partners support various programmes that engage adolescents in increasing their awareness on the 
adverse consequences of child marriage while simultaneously providing them with adequate skills to 
help improve their lives and delay marriage. In 2015, the BCO received initial funding and the New 
Country Programme Document of 2016 acknowledged the opportunity to sharpen the approach 
on ECM across the country. The strategy note on ECM was used as a basis for the GPECM when 
Bangladesh became one of the three GPECM countries in UNICEF’s South Asian Region for Phase 1 
of the joint UNFPA-UNICEF GPECM programme. 
Objective and scope of the evaluation  
The overall objective of the evaluation was to assess the progress made by BCO towards achievements 
of results of its ECM programmes. The evaluation has analysed the relevance of BCO’s work on ECM, 
effectiveness and added value of the joint UNFPA UNICEF GPECM and BCO’s ECM interventions

outside the GPECM funded through OR of different sections. It has identified opportunities and barriers 
of the implementation of cross sectoral evidenced based intervention strategies. Additionally, it has also 
identified good practices of convergence among sectors and lessons especially from Phase I of the 
GPECM.  
The evaluation has included all activities under the CP 2017-2020 and the GPECM Phase 1 (2016-
2019). Additionally, aspects of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have also been covered. Further, 
the evaluation has covered work undertaken at the national level and aspects of the programme that 
were conducted at ECM districts, either through GPECM interventions or other ECM activities.  
Our approach and methodology 
 
The evaluation incorporated a theory-based evaluation framework, and the OECD DAC criteria of 
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability was applied in the evaluation of the 
programme. Further, a non-experimental evaluation design was adopted wherein qualitative data 
collection in all five divisions as stated in the ToR namely, Mymensingh, Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna 
and Rangpur were undertaken. The evaluation was approached through highly consultative and 
participatory lenses.  
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic our team adopted a “blended methodology” as the way 
forward to allow flexibility in design. To initiate the organisation of data collected, a workshop mode 
was adopted wherein the objective was to triangulate the data collected against the information 
provided by the various stakeholders in order to derive final conclusions/answers against each 
evaluation question. After analysing the information, the insights obtained was grouped as per various 
heads related to the evaluation questions. They were then summarised and critically analysed to find 
answers to the evaluation questions.  
An evaluation rubric was also developed to map BCOs performance against each evaluation question. 
The parameters of assessment include Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor. 
Limitations 
Overall limitations in undertaking the evaluation may be attributed to the extensive delays caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel and mobility restrictions. Despite rigorous sampling, 
due to the time lag and unavailability of key stakeholders, it is possible that some significant aspects of 
the programme were missed, and some biases crept in reaching out to the respondents in the 
community. The COVID-19 induced restrictions made it challenging to access data and information on 
how the pandemic has impacted the programme and its beneficiaries in sampled Upazillas and districts. 
Further, programmatic and financial, reporting undertaken by UNICEF during the implementation did 
not have clear compartmentalisation between the two. Therefore, maintaining clear separation or to 
avoid overlap in terms of findings related to the two programmes was not possible.  
Key findings  
Relevance 
Ending child marriage (ECM), is a relevant and required priority area for both the Government of 
Bangladesh (GoB) and its development partners. Additionally, through the adoption of an area-based 
approach, life cycle approach and multisectoral approach. the programme was excellently 
designed in a comprehensive manner, accounting for varied contexts of different groups in society. 
The programme has also incorporated a gender-transformative approach to address the drivers 
of child marriage and structural drivers of inequality in the context of Bangladesh. However, while there 
have been efforts to correctly implement the programme following a human rights, equity and culturally 
sensitive approach, inclusion of certain vulnerable groups can be further strengthened. Further, 

Page | 11 
Final Evaluation Report:

ECM work in BCO is found to be guided by two Theories of Change. One at the National level 
and the other proposed by GPECM. Bangladesh was one of the few GPECM countries that formally 
adapted the global ToC to the country level. Moreover, while the programme was found to be aligned 
to the objectives of the NAP to ECM to a good degree, there were challenges with respect to 
awareness, resources, collaboration and monitoring impede NAP’s seamless implementation. 
Effectiveness and Impact  
BCOs ECM efforts have made an adequate impact in terms of contributing to the process of 
reduction in number of child marriages. The evaluation finds that predominant focus of the 
interventions was on Adolescent empowerment through Adolescent Clubs, and Community 
Mobilisation. Additionally, partnerships at the highest levels developed through advocacy carried out 
by UNICEF and UNFPA will ensure that ECM remains a significant agenda of the Government. 
However, a stronger focus also needs to be placed on the promotion of income generation and 
livelihood opportunities for girls. Overall review of the progress of the strategies highlights that BCO 
will need to continue its concerted efforts at all levels (individual, community, institutional, state 
and policy) to effectively combat child marriages. Further, wider and more focused engagement 
is needed with different stakeholders for a longer period for achievement of gender transformation. 
Further, ECM efforts and its planned results for its five strategies needs to be seen 
corroboratively with the Outcome on Adolescents as well as GPECM reporting as the entire gamut 
of ECM efforts does not adequately report against a combined RBM. It is key to note that the evaluation 
team has also been limited in its ability to comment on the entire impact of the programme due 
to COVID-19 induced discontinuity in regular ECM efforts and challenges to accessing protection 
services that threatens the momentum gained for ECM as well as restrains spillover effects. 
Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness 
UNICEF and UNFPA, have worked jointly for the GPECM programme. However, both the 
organisations predominantly implemented GPECM interventions in Bangladesh without any 
combined planning, except at the national or policy advocacy level, limiting impact at the sub-
national and sub-district levels, further challenged by gaps in coordination at field level. Moreover, the 
GPECM helped streamline good efforts and aid the process of evidence generation which was 
critical for strengthening the overall ECM agenda. While funding priorities were aligned to 
organisational mandates as well as sectoral priorities within UNICEF BCO, GPECM funding, 
though limited, helped streamline various ongoing efforts under a comprehensive programme. 
With regards to cost-effectiveness, it was seen that most of the ECM funds were allocated to 
Education and Child Protection interventions aimed at reducing child marriages.  
Sustainability  
BCO’s ECM interventions promoted sustainability through various good practices and 
strategies, including advocacy, institutionalisation, strengthening systems, developing capacities and 
mobilising complementary funding. However, there is scope for enhanced advocacy and 
engagement to sustain gains in social norm change and redressal of harmful behaviours. For sustained 
efforts and scaling up interventions, adequate system strengthening needs to be embedded at all 
levels including national policies, programme planning and design and in implementation, especially at 
the sub-district levels.  
Conclusions and lessons learnt 
BCO’s ECM interventions and the GPECM have made some significant inroads in propelling collective 
efforts to meet the stated national targets. The evaluation notes that cross sectoral convergence and 
collaboration and the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA was a key strength of BCOs ECM 
efforts. Moreover, partnerships with stakeholders including women’s groups have been found to be

diverse and effectively leveraged to further the agenda for ECM. Advocacy at the highest levels has 
also contributed to the creation of government ownership and commitment to ECM through the 
development of the NAP. There is however scope for improvement with respect to monitoring and 
tracking results achieved against BCO ECM Strategy Note and the GRF as current systems are 
collecting data aligned to Outcome 3 of BCO CPD. While there is ownership at the highest levels of 
government, the same rigour is absent at the district and Upazilla level and requires focused and 
consistent capacity building. Significantly, while interventions have recorded success at different 
degrees, some strategies worked better than others and recorded better results. Key lessons learnt 
from the evaluation are as follows: 
• 
Joint programming by UNICEF and UNFPA has enhanced ECM efforts in Bangladesh. 
There is enough reason to believe that the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA has 
worked well to this programme. Both the organisations have their unique strengths which have 
complemented each other and strengthened the voice of the United Nations on this issue  
• 
Incentives and conditional cash transfers seem to have worked well in some parts. This 
needs to be examined more closely. In case it is found to make a positive impact, a solution 
to this may be found to provide incentives to girls, perhaps by helping the Government to design 
a suitable scheme  
• 
The existing monitoring system within UNICEF is not designed to collect relevant data 
for ECM. The mismatch in monitoring programmes makes collation of relevant data collection 
very challenging and there is likelihood of missing out of information that may provide evidence 
for planning 
Overarchingly, each question of the evaluation criterion has been given a ranking of 
Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor. General improvement may be required to enhance effectiveness of 
strategies with respect to mapping the results achieved, and over all sustainability of interventions rolled 
out. 
Recommendations  
• 
UNICEF should work towards providing social protection to vulnerable children and their 
families for overall poverty reduction. As per the definition of UNICEF “Social protection 
covers the range of policies and programmes needed to reduce the lifelong consequences of 
poverty and exclusion.” Therefore, the focus of interventions in future should be to ensure that 
essential services are provided to all vulnerable families to reduce inequality, poverty and 
vulnerability. This would require working together with other organisations with similar mandate 
of poverty alleviation  
• 
Vulnerability mapping needs to be more nuanced and evidence based where factors 
other than incidence of child marriage should also be considered. The scope of 
vulnerability mapping should be increased by including other factors such as low level of 
education (including drop outs and out of school children); economically disadvantaged 
population, incidence of gender-based violence, disaster prone areas and other 
vulnerable sections such as migrants. This will help in identifying other vulnerable pockets 
and interventions can be designed accordingly 
• 
UNICEF should limit the number of interventions it carries out to address the issue of 
ECM. Research has shown that programmes with fewer interventions reaches out to a larger 
population and shows better sustainability. Therefore, UNICEF may consider focusing on 
fewer interventions where it has achieved better results and aim at scaling up the pilots 
• 
There is a need for greater engagement and involvement with the Ministry of Law, Justice 
and Parliamentary Affairs, Ministry of Social Welfare and Ministry of Home Affairs to act 
on child marriage within their own sectors. UNICEF has been working primarily with 
MoWCA on the issue of ECM. It may consider working more closely with other Ministries too
