Executive summary 
This report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations of the evaluation 
of the UNICEF Moldova Country Programme (CP) for the period January 2018 to June 2021. The 
evaluation is part of the Multi-country Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF Europe and 
Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and 
Ukraine. It examines UNICEF’s activities across Moldova under its two core Outcomes – Equitable Child 
Services and Social Change for Children’s Rights – to assess the impact, relevance and coherence of the 
CP and the work of the Country Office (CO) with its partners. The evaluation aims to support the 
planning process for the next programming period. 
Overview of the Country Programme 2018–2022 
The planned impact of UNICEF Moldova CP is that all children in Moldova, especially the most 
vulnerable, enjoy their rights to education, health, adequate standard of living and participation within 
a child friendly legal environment, and are protected from abandonment, neglect, discrimination, 
exploitation and violence. The results structure of the CP consists of the two outcomes supported by 
nine outputs. The achievement of simultaneous results under both Outcomes is a prerequisite for 
substantial progress to address key child deprivations and uphold the realization of child rights.  
Outcome 1 focuses on achieving Equitable Child-Sensitive Systems and Services through five Outputs:  
• 
the prevention of family separation, discrimination and violence against children 
• 
instituting procedures and practices in the justice system that protect and reintegrate children 
in contact with the law 
• 
making schools and pre-schools ready to enrol the most vulnerable children, and building their 
capacity  
• 
quality mother, child and adolescent health services 
• 
an equitable social protection system.  
Outcome 2 focuses on Social Change for Child Rights through four Outputs: 
• 
improved capacities and skills of duty-bearers 
• 
caregivers’ engagement in the realization of child rights 
• 
improved adolescent awareness and participation 
• 
support for the social inclusion of the most vulnerable groups of children1 seeking concerted 
and sustainable action by all systems and duty bearers in addressing the realization of all rights 
of the child. 
In addition, the CP added several outputs and planned activities in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, ensuring a swift and sensitive answer to the emerging and urgent needs of children. 
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences 
The purpose of the evaluation is to strengthen the accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by 
evaluating UNICEF’s contribution to the results for children at scale, especially for the most vulnerable. 
The evaluation aims to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document 
(CPD) by understanding and evaluating the implementation of change strategies applied, and to draw 
lessons from activities and results to make the best use of UNICEF’s resources and comparative 
advantage in the future. This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral 
evaluations and specialized studies carried out over the past five years. 
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. 
Secondary users are the Government of the Republic of Moldova, UN agencies, development partners 
with programmes in Moldova, and civil society organizations (CSOs).  
Evaluation context 
The Republic of Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has faced a long-lasting political crisis 
involving several governments within the last three years as well as large public protests. According to 
assessments by the UNICEF CO in its annual reports, this political situation has affected the development 
 
1 Children with disabilities, Roma children, children left behind by migrating parents, children from poor families, and those 
living in the poorest areas of country.   

 
 
iv
and implementation of various policies and strategies, including the National Development Strategy 
‘Moldova 2030’. Political instability translates into the instability of key institutions for children’s well-
being. In addition, the country’s fragmented territorial-administrative structure and its incomplete 
decentralization process continue to result in the very low capacity of local governments to invest in 
social development and, consequently, to ensure the adequate provision of social services at local level.  
The breakaway region of Transnistria, with about 500,000 inhabitants, remains out of the control of 
Moldovan constitutional authorities.2 
A large number of vulnerable children remain at risk because of child poverty, the poor quality of 
education and healthcare services and the limited effectiveness or absence of cross-sectoral and inter-
institutional cooperation mechanisms.  
Evaluation methodology 
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC) 
developed by the UNICEF CO in Moldova. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD 
DAC3 criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. Relevance refers to the extent to which the 
programmes is responding to the needs of its beneficiaries, the coherence refers to the compatibility 
and complementarity of UNICEF work in Moldova with other programmes, and interventions of other 
institutions and organisations, and the impact refers to the high-level and long-term changes generated 
by the programme at local and national scale. An in-depth impact assessment was undertaken for three 
selected areas – inclusive education; justice for children; and youth engagement (including youth-
friendly health services) – to provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving 
impact for children at scale.  Other evaluation methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder 
analysis and a social network analysis.  
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, including a wide-ranging document review and 
consultations with 31 key informant interviewees in Chișinău and the districts (raioane). The key 
informants included interviewees from UNICEF, government entities at multiple levels, UN agencies and 
other development agencies, and CSOs. In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the 
social network analysis.  
The evaluation methodology fully considered ethical considerations and the obligations of evaluators. 
Interview respondents were assured confidentiality, with appropriate safeguards in place for all 
participants in focus groups including young people. Child rights, equity and gender were key issues 
throughout the evaluation. 
Key findings  
Relevance 
UNICEF builds its programme on extensive evidence and lessons learned both from the implementation 
of previous interventions, and from needs assessments and studies conducted within the scope of the 
current CP. Based on the CP priorities and the context analysis, UNICEF aimed to reach all children of all 
ages in Moldova in both the planning and implementation phases of the programme. The alignment of 
the CP to the needs of children needs and to national priorities continues to be ensured through the 
support of UNICEF Moldova for the government to improve national statistics and strategic planning for 
the rights and well-being of children. 
The CP and its related activities have addressed the needs of the most vulnerable groups of children. 
These are as follows: child victims of violence, neglect and exploitation (especially in Chișinău and its 
metropolitan area4), children with special educational needs and with disabilities, children in residential 
institutions, children in conflict with the law and in probation programmes, pregnant adolescents and 
young mothers, pregnant women and children living with HIV/AIDS, most-at-risk adolescents and 
especially vulnerable adolescents (MARA and EVA), and children from poor households.

v
UNICEF continued address the needs of children in Moldova during CP implementation in 2020 and 
2021, when the focus shifted in part to understanding and responding to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Answering the challenges of COVID-19 and its effects, UNICEF Moldova acted fast to support 
the Government to ensure basic safety for front-line workers. While the pandemic demanded a change 
in strategy from advocacy to services and equipment provision, UNICEF mobilized its advocacy and 
capacity building activities to ensure an effective and sustainable response from the key duty bearers. 
Specific technical assistance and capacity building activities have also been implemented, therefore, in 
the fields of child protection, education, health, immunization and early childhood development.  
Equity and gender equality are considered in the CPD, although it did not include specific outputs related 
to equity and gender equality. UNICEF Moldova undertook a gender analysis for each area of its work, 
and gender was mainstreamed into several areas, especially health and youth. Less integration of gender 
equality is identified in child protection, justice for children, inclusive education and social protection. 
Overall, however, gender equality has been well included in CP planning and implementation, but 
complex intersectionality or compounded discrimination and inequalities are still addressed in a limited 
manner.  
Coherence 
UNICEF Moldova has been successful in using its comparative advantages to, for example, work 
effectively with a range of different partners These relate to its expertise, its strategic focus and its 
ability to build and sustain effective partnerships with the Government of the Republic of Moldova, other 
key public institutions at central and at local level (such as the Ombudsperson for the Rights of the 
Child), other UN agencies and development partners and CSOs. UNICEF Moldova has built a strong 
network of support for advocacy, communication for development and system-strengthening activities. 
UNICEF Moldova sustains eight main types of partnerships:  
• 
with the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the line Ministries 
• 
with local public authorities for the modeling and piloting of projects (more so during the 
current CP than in the previous programming period) 
• 
with implementing partners to provide services and technical assistance for key institutions 
• 
a nationwide partnership for the rights of the children, through its support for the National 
Council for Child Rights Protection 
• 
with public institutions that have an important technical role in the effectiveness of the systems 
and services dedicated to children (National Bureau of Statistic, Republican Centre for Psycho-
pedagogical Assistance, National Probation Inspectorate) 
• 
with CSOs, for more effective advocacy 
• 
with UN agencies, and  
• 
with international and development organizations. 
Impact 
In most of the areas where UNICEF Moldova works, available evidence shows important progress in the 
realization of child rights in the country that has been supported by UNICEF.  
UNICEF has contributed to the following important results at scale for children:  
• 
the adoption of important legal provisions to strengthen the legal framework for child rights 
(Law 112/2020) 
• 
the improved impact of child benefits and Social Aid on child poverty 
• 
the improved gross enrolment ratio in pre-primary education 
• 
an increased proportion of vulnerable pregnant mothers using social protection mechanisms  
• 
the development of a cross-sectoral coordination mechanism in targeted districts for the 
provision of services to children with disabilities 
• 
an increased percentage of adolescents who indicate that their views are taken seriously in 
decisions made at home, school and in their community (according to U-Report) 
• 
increased access to youth-friendly health services, and 
• 
increased availability of better services for children in contact and in conflict with the law.  

 
 
vi
More limited, but nonetheless positive results, have been achieved on improvements in  legislation and 
legal practice concerning children in contact and in conflict with the law, and the percentage of 
caregivers who accept children with disabilities in regular pre-schools and schools. 
In many sectors, however, social norms are still not favourable to child rights. This can be seen in the 
case of the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education or the reintegration of young 
people in conflict with the law, where the attitudes of professionals and the wider public remain 
detrimental to systemic change. In addition, new risks to sustainability have been generated by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
The differences between children and the needs of the most marginalized children have been considered 
in all CP activities to a large extent and they have been the main beneficiaries of many of the results 
presented above. However, three groups of vulnerable and marginalized children are less covered: 
Roma children (especially girls), homeless children, and children with severe disabilities. 
The four most important ways in which UNICEF Moldova has contributed to the observed impact are:   
• 
advocacy for policy development and changes in national strategies and the legal framework, 
based on evidence generated, specifically in the area of education, WASH, social and child 
protection 
• 
technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services 
• 
support for capacity building through the training of duty bearers (in education, health, child 
protection and the judiciary), and  
• 
engagement on partnerships and advocacy with civil society, UN agencies, international and 
development organization partners.  
Evidence shows that UNICEF uses a combination of strategies in all cases to determine policy changes, 
institutional strengthening and improved services, and to generate results for children at scale.  
Conclusions 
The evaluation finds that UNICEF Moldova has successfully addressed the important and pressing needs 
of children in the country – particularly its vulnerable children – and has supported policy and 
institutional development for their benefit. This has been made possible by the use of data analysis and 
research on children’s needs and the perseverance of advocacy activities to ensure that these needs are 
included in governmental priorities, despite political and institutional changes in the country. 
Evidence-based advocacy is complemented by other strategies to improve policies and the realization 
of children’s rights in Moldova. The most important complementary strategy is the CO’s work with 
partners. Therefore, UNICEF’s ability to leverage different partners’ advantages and to play the role of 
convener is essential for the effectiveness of advocacy and for impact for children at scale through 
improved policies.  
In terms of overall attention to equity and gender, UNICEF Moldova exhibits several good practices and 
practices in the area of health and youth empowerment and engagement that could be transferred to 
other COs. Moving towards a fully gender transformative approach, there is a need for a stronger focus 
on approaches to address persistent intersectionality or compounded discrimination and inequalities. 
There is, for example, a need to better address the intersections of gender and ethnicity and of gender 
and disability as factors in discrimination, as well as the gender dimension of justice for children. 
As noted, UNICEF Moldova works well with a range of different partners to drive change for children 
and their families and use its comparative advantages to build and sustain effective partnership for 
children’s rights and well-being.  
UNICEF Moldova has made important contributions to positive changes in the life of children at scale in 
Moldova, implementing activities that have generated an impact through, as noted, advocacy for policy 
development and change, technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services, and 
support for the training of the duty bearers key areas.  
There is a general agreement among stakeholders that the results achieved by UNICEF’s CP are 
sustainable, but that some risks to their sustainability have been generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lessons learned 
The adoption of strategic and legal provisions is key for change and, in some areas, advocacy for 
improved legal frameworks is an indispensable step for further impact in the lives of children. However, 
evidence-based advocacy alone cannot generate change for children at scale directly, because most of 
the existing bottlenecks are not legal, but institutional and related to practice and social norms. Another 
important lesson learned is that sector-specific bottlenecks limit impact at national scale for all 
vulnerable children in the country. For example, UNICEF’s impact in the field of health has been 
hindered by systemic problems within the healthcare system itself, from the emigration of doctors to 
informal payments. 
Another lesson learned is the importance of ensuring budgeting mechanisms that are regulated at 
national level and financial allocations for all policies proposed or reformed. The usual approach is 
advocacy for a policy measure, which is often piloted or modelled at local level in selected communities 
before scaling-up nationally. The results from pilot or modelling activities are used to advocate for 
scaling up. However, the lack of a sufficient budget can be one cause of limited capacity at national and 
local level for policy implementation and is often related to political will and technical budgetary 
planning mechanisms. These latter mechanisms need to be addressed from the beginning, as happened 
successfully in the case of youth-friendly health services. 
In the context of multiple central government reforms, the sub-national decision-making arena is a 
critical point of change. In this context, local public authorities need additional information on the 
benefits of decentralization, as well as interventions to increase their capacity to provide inclusive and 
quality services for children.  
Recommendations 
Recommendation 1. To ensure impact, scaling-up and sustainability of pilot and modeling 
projects, for current and future projects implemented at local level (either pilot or modeling 
projects) a clear exit strategy needs to be developed. In the case of future projects, the exit 
strategy should be developed in the planning stage of the intervention in cooperation with 
relevant stakeholders. It is important to plan for scale up from the beginning. The exit strategy needs 
to be flexible and should be adapted if political and institutional changes require modifications of the 
plan for scaling-up. The strategies should include a thorough analysis of sector specific bottlenecks; a 
plan to address the bottlenecks related to institutional capacity and resources at national level and in 
all municipalities; a plan to address the budgeting issues from the beginning of each model to ensure 
long-term financing, ideally public financing; communication activities to gain support from partners on 
models, including other UN agencies, international organisations/development partners and civil 
society to enhance the impact of advocacy and to contribute to the larger task of supporting institutional 
strengthening at local level, but at national scale; documenting and evaluating the pilot or monitored 
projects, as well as advocacy strategies to use and present the collected evidence and conclusions to the 
government.  
Recommendation 2. Gender should be mainstreamed into all sectors of UNICEF’s work, ensuring 
that gender-transformative actions are planned and implemented. The Country Office should fully 
consider the recommendations from the Gender Programmatic Review conducted in 2021. Specific 
issues to be taken into account include: the participation in education (beyond primary education) of 
Roma girls; the risk of child marriage in traditional communities (especially Roma communities, but not 
exclusively); protecting and addressing the specific needs of girls and young women victims of crime, 
including girls and young women who are victims of violence, exploitation and trafficking. 
Recommendation 3. The future CP should balance its humanitarian work and policy 
development objectives addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on children. The 
CO’s emergency preparedness should be strengthened and embedded in the Country Programme. On 
the other hand, policies advocated in response to the new needs should take into account good practices 
and lessons learned in other countries or at local level. In addition, the engagement of partners and the 
development of strategies to leverage resources for children affected by the changes generated by the 
pandemic should be integrated into the next Country Programme Document and future strategies for its 
implementation.   

 
 
viii
Recommendation 4. Finalize and adopt the advocacy and partnership strategy, articulating the 
strategic value of partnership for each group of organizations (UN agencies, the EU, other 
international organizations, civil society). Partnerships have proved instrumental in ensuring the 
success of the other strategies employed, and lessons learned from previous challenges show that the 
activities that have the greatest impact are implemented in partnership. Planning partnerships in a long-
term and strategic way is, therefore, important to maintain UNICEF coherence and impact. 
Recommendation 5. To address the needs of children with multiple vulnerabilities, advocacy and 
technical assistance is needed to strengthen integrated social responses and services. Cross-
sectoral coordination would contribute to strengthened referrals and appropriate care for children and 
increase access to and the efficiency of social services. It would connect different sectors that need to 
work together to ensure children’s access to basic and specialized services.  
Recommendation 6. To address the limited impact of youth participation initiatives, as the level 
of youth participation in decision-making in Moldova is limited, the UNICEF CO should develop 
initiatives to support the wide participation of children and young people in decision-making 
processes. The initiatives regarding policies, programmes and services should, among other activities, 
include raising awareness among young people and the adults on the importance of youth participation 
in all spheres and sectors.  
Recommendation 7. Continue and strengthen the evidence-based innovative and diverse 
approaches in Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC). This 
recommendation considers the importance of social norms as hindering the promotion of child rights 
in all communities and families. UNICEF’s focus should include capacity building for partners to ensure 
a systematic approach that shifts from stand-alone donor-driven campaigns to evidence generation and 
social listening to inform C4D and C4BC strategies, interventions and messages.  
Recommendation 8. Introduce new monitoring tools to keep a better track of the activities, 
especially advocacy  and capacity building activities, and their outputs. This will help UNICEF to 
trace more clearly the change pathways from the activities to results for children and will 
support future impact evaluations. Conducting Process Tracing analysis for this evaluation proved 
challenging, given the need to analyse a large body of evidence about the way in which UNICEF activities 
led to results: changed legislation, increased institutional capacity etc. Documenting the path from 
research (its conclusions and recommendations), to government policy decisions, including by keeping 
records of advocacy meetings and events, commitments made and draft policy documents will 
contribute to more effective learning from experience in future evaluations, showing what activities and 
strategies are more effective in determining policy change. Improving the registration of institutional 
memory and tracing advocacy activities (events, meetings with decision and policy makers and 
partners, the implementation of communication campaigns) in connection with policy decisions, 
declarations on policies or institutional changes could also allow for a better understanding of how 
policy change is happening. Moreover, a consistent approach to trainings (for example using pre and 
post testing) and other capacity building activities targeting service providers, social workers or civil 
servants may help connecting the capacity building activities with observable institutional changes and 
will help UNICEF identify the pest strategies and methods for capacity building.
