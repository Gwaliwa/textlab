Executive summary
This report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations of the evaluation
of the UNICEF Moldova Country Programme (CP) for the period January 2018 to June 2021. The
evaluation is part of the Multi-country Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF Europe and
Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and
Ukraine. It examines UNICEF’s activities across Moldova under its two core Outcomes – Equitable Child
Services and Social Change for Children’s Rights – to assess the impact, relevance and coherence of the
CP and the work of the Country Office (CO) with its partners. The evaluation aims to support the
planning process for the next programming period.
Overview of the Country Programme 2018–2022
The planned impact of UNICEF Moldova CP is that all children in Moldova, especially the most
vulnerable, enjoy their rights to education, health, adequate standard of living and participation within
a child friendly legal environment, and are protected from abandonment, neglect, discrimination,
exploitation and violence. The results structure of the CP consists of the two outcomes supported by
nine outputs. The achievement of simultaneous results under both Outcomes is a prerequisite for
substantial progress to address key child deprivations and uphold the realization of child rights.
Outcome 1 focuses on achieving Equitable Child-Sensitive Systems and Services through five Outputs:
• the prevention of family separation, discrimination and violence against children
• instituting procedures and practices in the justice system that protect and reintegrate children
in contact with the law
• making schools and pre-schools ready to enrol the most vulnerable children, and building their
capacity
• quality mother, child and adolescent health services
• an equitable social protection system.
Outcome 2 focuses on Social Change for Child Rights through four Outputs:
• improved capacities and skills of duty-bearers
• caregivers’ engagement in the realization of child rights
• improved adolescent awareness and participation
• support for the social inclusion of the most vulnerable groups of children1 seeking concerted
and sustainable action by all systems and duty bearers in addressing the realization of all rights
of the child.
In addition, the CP added several outputs and planned activities in 2020 in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, ensuring a swift and sensitive answer to the emerging and urgent needs of children.
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences
The purpose of the evaluation is to strengthen the accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by
evaluating UNICEF’s contribution to the results for children at scale, especially for the most vulnerable.
The evaluation aims to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document
(CPD) by understanding and evaluating the implementation of change strategies applied, and to draw
lessons from activities and results to make the best use of UNICEF’s resources and comparative
advantage in the future. This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral
evaluations and specialized studies carried out over the past five years.
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices.
Secondary users are the Government of the Republic of Moldova, UN agencies, development partners
with programmes in Moldova, and civil society organizations (CSOs).
Evaluation context
The Republic of Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has faced a long-lasting political crisis
involving several governments within the last three years as well as large public protests. According to
assessments by the UNICEF CO in its annual reports, this political situation has affected the development
1 Children with disabilities, Roma children, children left behind by migrating parents, children from poor families, and those
living in the poorest areas of country.

and implementation of various policies and strategies, including the National Development Strategy
‘Moldova 2030’. Political instability translates into the instability of key institutions for children’s well-
being. In addition, the country’s fragmented territorial-administrative structure and its incomplete
decentralization process continue to result in the very low capacity of local governments to invest in
social development and, consequently, to ensure the adequate provision of social services at local level.
The breakaway region of Transnistria, with about 500,000 inhabitants, remains out of the control of
Moldovan constitutional authorities.2
A large number of vulnerable children remain at risk because of child poverty, the poor quality of
education and healthcare services and the limited effectiveness or absence of cross-sectoral and inter-
institutional cooperation mechanisms.
Evaluation methodology
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC)
developed by the UNICEF CO in Moldova. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD
DAC3 criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. Relevance refers to the extent to which the
programmes is responding to the needs of its beneficiaries, the coherence refers to the compatibility
and complementarity of UNICEF work in Moldova with other programmes, and interventions of other
institutions and organisations, and the impact refers to the high-level and long-term changes generated
by the programme at local and national scale. An in-depth impact assessment was undertaken for three
selected areas – inclusive education; justice for children; and youth engagement (including youth-
friendly health services) – to provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving
impact for children at scale. Other evaluation methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder
analysis and a social network analysis.
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, including a wide-ranging document review and
consultations with 31 key informant interviewees in Chișinău and the districts (raioane). The key
informants included interviewees from UNICEF, government entities at multiple levels, UN agencies and
other development agencies, and CSOs. In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the
social network analysis.
The evaluation methodology fully considered ethical considerations and the obligations of evaluators.
Interview respondents were assured confidentiality, with appropriate safeguards in place for all
participants in focus groups including young people. Child rights, equity and gender were key issues
throughout the evaluation.
Key findings
Relevance
UNICEF builds its programme on extensive evidence and lessons learned both from the implementation
of previous interventions, and from needs assessments and studies conducted within the scope of the
current CP. Based on the CP priorities and the context analysis, UNICEF aimed to reach all children of all
ages in Moldova in both the planning and implementation phases of the programme. The alignment of
the CP to the needs of children needs and to national priorities continues to be ensured through the
support of UNICEF Moldova for the government to improve national statistics and strategic planning for
the rights and well-being of children.
The CP and its related activities have addressed the needs of the most vulnerable groups of children.
These are as follows: child victims of violence, neglect and exploitation (especially in Chișinău and its
metropolitan area4), children with special educational needs and with disabilities, children in residential
institutions, children in conflict with the law and in probation programmes, pregnant adolescents and
young mothers, pregnant women and children living with HIV/AIDS, most-at-risk adolescents and
especially vulnerable adolescents (MARA and EVA), and children from poor households.

iv
UNICEF continued address the needs of children in Moldova during CP implementation in 2020 and
2021, when the focus shifted in part to understanding and responding to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. Answering the challenges of COVID-19 and its effects, UNICEF Moldova acted fast to support
the Government to ensure basic safety for front-line workers. While the pandemic demanded a change
in strategy from advocacy to services and equipment provision, UNICEF mobilized its advocacy and
capacity building activities to ensure an effective and sustainable response from the key duty bearers.
Specific technical assistance and capacity building activities have also been implemented, therefore, in
the fields of child protection, education, health, immunization and early childhood development.
Equity and gender equality are considered in the CPD, although it did not include specific outputs related
to equity and gender equality. UNICEF Moldova undertook a gender analysis for each area of its work,
and gender was mainstreamed into several areas, especially health and youth. Less integration of gender
equality is identified in child protection, justice for children, inclusive education and social protection.
Overall, however, gender equality has been well included in CP planning and implementation, but
complex intersectionality or compounded discrimination and inequalities are still addressed in a limited
manner.
Coherence
UNICEF Moldova has been successful in using its comparative advantages to, for example, work
effectively with a range of different partners These relate to its expertise, its strategic focus and its
ability to build and sustain effective partnerships with the Government of the Republic of Moldova, other
key public institutions at central and at local level (such as the Ombudsperson for the Rights of the
Child), other UN agencies and development partners and CSOs. UNICEF Moldova has built a strong
network of support for advocacy, communication for development and system-strengthening activities.
UNICEF Moldova sustains eight main types of partnerships:
• with the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the line Ministries
• with local public authorities for the modeling and piloting of projects (more so during the
current CP than in the previous programming period)
• with implementing partners to provide services and technical assistance for key institutions
• a nationwide partnership for the rights of the children, through its support for the National
Council for Child Rights Protection
• with public institutions that have an important technical role in the effectiveness of the systems
and services dedicated to children (National Bureau of Statistic, Republican Centre for Psycho-
pedagogical Assistance, National Probation Inspectorate)
• with CSOs, for more effective advocacy
• with UN agencies, and
• with international and development organizations.
Impact
In most of the areas where UNICEF Moldova works, available evidence shows important progress in the
realization of child rights in the country that has been supported by UNICEF.
UNICEF has contributed to the following important results at scale for children:
• the adoption of important legal provisions to strengthen the legal framework for child rights
(Law 112/2020)
• the improved impact of child benefits and Social Aid on child poverty
• the improved gross enrolment ratio in pre-primary education
• an increased proportion of vulnerable pregnant mothers using social protection mechanisms
• the development of a cross-sectoral coordination mechanism in targeted districts for the
provision of services to children with disabilities
• an increased percentage of adolescents who indicate that their views are taken seriously in
decisions made at home, school and in their community (according to U-Report)
• increased access to youth-friendly health services, and
• increased availability of better services for children in contact and in conflict with the law.
v
More limited, but nonetheless positive results, have been achieved on improvements in legislation and
legal practice concerning children in contact and in conflict with the law, and the percentage of
caregivers who accept children with disabilities in regular pre-schools and schools.
In many sectors, however, social norms are still not favourable to child rights. This can be seen in the
case of the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream education or the reintegration of young
people in conflict with the law, where the attitudes of professionals and the wider public remain
detrimental to systemic change. In addition, new risks to sustainability have been generated by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The differences between children and the needs of the most marginalized children have been considered
in all CP activities to a large extent and they have been the main beneficiaries of many of the results
presented above. However, three groups of vulnerable and marginalized children are less covered:
Roma children (especially girls), homeless children, and children with severe disabilities.
The four most important ways in which UNICEF Moldova has contributed to the observed impact are:
• advocacy for policy development and changes in national strategies and the legal framework,
based on evidence generated, specifically in the area of education, WASH, social and child
protection
• technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services
• support for capacity building through the training of duty bearers (in education, health, child
protection and the judiciary), and
• engagement on partnerships and advocacy with civil society, UN agencies, international and
development organization partners.
Evidence shows that UNICEF uses a combination of strategies in all cases to determine policy changes,
institutional strengthening and improved services, and to generate results for children at scale.
Conclusions
The evaluation finds that UNICEF Moldova has successfully addressed the important and pressing needs
of children in the country – particularly its vulnerable children – and has supported policy and
institutional development for their benefit. This has been made possible by the use of data analysis and
research on children’s needs and the perseverance of advocacy activities to ensure that these needs are
included in governmental priorities, despite political and institutional changes in the country.
Evidence-based advocacy is complemented by other strategies to improve policies and the realization
of children’s rights in Moldova. The most important complementary strategy is the CO’s work with
partners. Therefore, UNICEF’s ability to leverage different partners’ advantages and to play the role of
convener is essential for the effectiveness of advocacy and for impact for children at scale through
improved policies.
In terms of overall attention to equity and gender, UNICEF Moldova exhibits several good practices and
practices in the area of health and youth empowerment and engagement that could be transferred to
other COs. Moving towards a fully gender transformative approach, there is a need for a stronger focus
on approaches to address persistent intersectionality or compounded discrimination and inequalities.
There is, for example, a need to better address the intersections of gender and ethnicity and of gender
and disability as factors in discrimination, as well as the gender dimension of justice for children.
As noted, UNICEF Moldova works well with a range of different partners to drive change for children
and their families and use its comparative advantages to build and sustain effective partnership for
children’s rights and well-being.
UNICEF Moldova has made important contributions to positive changes in the life of children at scale in
Moldova, implementing activities that have generated an impact through, as noted, advocacy for policy
development and change, technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services, and
support for the training of the duty bearers key areas.
There is a general agreement among stakeholders that the results achieved by UNICEF’s CP are
sustainable, but that some risks to their sustainability have been generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lessons learned
The adoption of strategic and legal provisions is key for change and, in some areas, advocacy for
improved legal frameworks is an indispensable step for further impact in the lives of children. However,
evidence-based advocacy alone cannot generate change for children at scale directly, because most of
the existing bottlenecks are not legal, but institutional and related to practice and social norms. Another
important lesson learned is that sector-specific bottlenecks limit impact at national scale for all
vulnerable children in the country. For example, UNICEF’s impact in the field of health has been
hindered by systemic problems within the healthcare system itself, from the emigration of doctors to
informal payments.
Another lesson learned is the importance of ensuring budgeting mechanisms that are regulated at
national level and financial allocations for all policies proposed or reformed. The usual approach is
advocacy for a policy measure, which is often piloted or modelled at local level in selected communities
before scaling-up nationally. The results from pilot or modelling activities are used to advocate for
scaling up. However, the lack of a sufficient budget can be one cause of limited capacity at national and
local level for policy implementation and is often related to political will and technical budgetary
planning mechanisms. These latter mechanisms need to be addressed from the beginning, as happened
successfully in the case of youth-friendly health services.
In the context of multiple central government reforms, the sub-national decision-making arena is a
critical point of change. In this context, local public authorities need additional information on the
benefits of decentralization, as well as interventions to increase their capacity to provide inclusive and
quality services for children.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1. To ensure impact, scaling-up and sustainability of pilot and modeling
projects, for current and future projects implemented at local level (either pilot or modeling
projects) a clear exit strategy needs to be developed. In the case of future projects, the exit
strategy should be developed in the planning stage of the intervention in cooperation with
relevant stakeholders. It is important to plan for scale up from the beginning. The exit strategy needs
to be flexible and should be adapted if political and institutional changes require modifications of the
plan for scaling-up. The strategies should include a thorough analysis of sector specific bottlenecks; a
plan to address the bottlenecks related to institutional capacity and resources at national level and in
all municipalities; a plan to address the budgeting issues from the beginning of each model to ensure
long-term financing, ideally public financing; communication activities to gain support from partners on
models, including other UN agencies, international organisations/development partners and civil
society to enhance the impact of advocacy and to contribute to the larger task of supporting institutional
strengthening at local level, but at national scale; documenting and evaluating the pilot or monitored
projects, as well as advocacy strategies to use and present the collected evidence and conclusions to the
government.
Recommendation 2. Gender should be mainstreamed into all sectors of UNICEF’s work, ensuring
that gender-transformative actions are planned and implemented. The Country Office should fully
consider the recommendations from the Gender Programmatic Review conducted in 2021. Specific
issues to be taken into account include: the participation in education (beyond primary education) of
Roma girls; the risk of child marriage in traditional communities (especially Roma communities, but not
exclusively); protecting and addressing the specific needs of girls and young women victims of crime,
including girls and young women who are victims of violence, exploitation and trafficking.
Recommendation 3. The future CP should balance its humanitarian work and policy
development objectives addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on children. The
CO’s emergency preparedness should be strengthened and embedded in the Country Programme. On
the other hand, policies advocated in response to the new needs should take into account good practices
and lessons learned in other countries or at local level. In addition, the engagement of partners and the
development of strategies to leverage resources for children affected by the changes generated by the
pandemic should be integrated into the next Country Programme Document and future strategies for its
implementation.
vii
Recommendation 4. Finalize and adopt the advocacy and partnership strategy, articulating the
strategic value of partnership for each group of organizations (UN agencies, the EU, other
international organizations, civil society). Partnerships have proved instrumental in ensuring the
success of the other strategies employed, and lessons learned from previous challenges show that the
activities that have the greatest impact are implemented in partnership. Planning partnerships in a long-
term and strategic way is, therefore, important to maintain UNICEF coherence and impact.
Recommendation 5. To address the needs of children with multiple vulnerabilities, advocacy and
technical assistance is needed to strengthen integrated social responses and services. Cross-
sectoral coordination would contribute to strengthened referrals and appropriate care for children and
increase access to and the efficiency of social services. It would connect different sectors that need to
work together to ensure children’s access to basic and specialized services.
Recommendation 6. To address the limited impact of youth participation initiatives, as the level
of youth participation in decision-making in Moldova is limited, the UNICEF CO should develop
initiatives to support the wide participation of children and young people in decision-making
processes. The initiatives regarding policies, programmes and services should, among other activities,
include raising awareness among young people and the adults on the importance of youth participation
in all spheres and sectors.
Recommendation 7. Continue and strengthen the evidence-based innovative and diverse
approaches in Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC). This
recommendation considers the importance of social norms as hindering the promotion of child rights
in all communities and families. UNICEF’s focus should include capacity building for partners to ensure
a systematic approach that shifts from stand-alone donor-driven campaigns to evidence generation and
social listening to inform C4D and C4BC strategies, interventions and messages.
Recommendation 8. Introduce new monitoring tools to keep a better track of the activities,
especially advocacy and capacity building activities, and their outputs. This will help UNICEF to
trace more clearly the change pathways from the activities to results for children and will
support future impact evaluations. Conducting Process Tracing analysis for this evaluation proved
challenging, given the need to analyse a large body of evidence about the way in which UNICEF activities
led to results: changed legislation, increased institutional capacity etc. Documenting the path from
research (its conclusions and recommendations), to government policy decisions, including by keeping
records of advocacy meetings and events, commitments made and draft policy documents will
contribute to more effective learning from experience in future evaluations, showing what activities and
strategies are more effective in determining policy change. Improving the registration of institutional
memory and tracing advocacy activities (events, meetings with decision and policy makers and
partners, the implementation of communication campaigns) in connection with policy decisions,
declarations on policies or institutional changes could also allow for a better understanding of how
policy change is happening. Moreover, a consistent approach to trainings (for example using pre and
post testing) and other capacity building activities targeting service providers, social workers or civil
servants may help connecting the capacity building activities with observable institutional changes and
will help UNICEF identify the pest strategies and methods for capacity building.

1. Introduction
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Moldova Country Programme (CP)
2018-2022. The evaluation was commissioned by the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO)
of UNICEF and is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE), covering country
programmes evaluations in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine and including a synthesis report.
The evaluation was carried out between February and September 2021 and covers the entire UNICEF
portfolio during the first three and a half years of the five-year programme. In addition, the evaluation
considers previous activities that have been continued and contributed to UNICEF impact, taking into
account UNICEF’s global strategic plan 2018-2022.
The CP 2018–2022 had an initial budget of USD 4,57 million from regular resources and USD 12,93
million in other resources and aimed to reach all children and young people across the whole of Moldova
through national level policy change and service improvements at all levels (national, provincial and
district levels). The Country Programme is structured following two outcomes: (1) development of
child-sensitive policies, systems and services, including child protection, justice for children, education,
health and social protection and (2) promotion social change for child rights by working with duty
bearers, care givers and children and adolescents to improve their awareness and to empower them.
This is a strategic evaluation that complements the sectoral evaluations and specialized studies that
have been carried out by UNICEF and external experts during this period. The evaluation report is also
drafted in order to complement the Situational Analysis (SitAn) carried out in 2021 in Moldova and is
intended to inform, together with SitAn, the priorities for the next Country Programme of UNICEF
Moldova and the decisions on the most effective strategies to be used for an impactful Country
Programme. The evaluation assesses the relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout
implementation of the CP, contributing to accountability and drawing transferable lessons learned for
the future and other UNICEF CO.
Many of UNICEF’s partners were government ministries and agencies at national level, but a number of
projects and programmes of UNICEF Country Office (CO) in Moldova also aimed at institutional
strengthening at district level. The evaluation assesses the CP’s collaboration not just with government
structures but also with UN agencies and other development partners, as well as the civil society
organisations (CSO) participating to CP implementation as implementing partners or joining efforts
with UNICEFUNICEF for advocacy.
Chapter 1 (the introduction) of this report describes the aims, objectives and scope of the evaluation,
the context within which UNICEF has been operating, and the overall shape and content of the CP itself.
Chapter 2 explains the methodology of the evaluation including ethics issues. Its findings are presented
in Chapter 3, organized according to the main evaluation criteria of this specific evaluation (relevance,
coherence and impact) and the evaluation questions set by UNICEF. Based on the findings, Chapter 4
presents conclusions, lessons learned, and recommendations organized by the evaluation criteria and
with special focus on selected impact areas.
1.1. Brief description of the context and current situation
1.1.1. Geographic and demographic context
Moldova is a landlocked, low middle-income country in transition situated in Eastern Europe, bordered
to the west by Romania and to the north, east and south by Ukraine. Moldova has a population of 2.6
million people (in 2021 according to the National Bureau of Statistic) and about 20% are children.
According to the 2019 Light Situational Analysis (SitAn) the demography in the Republic of Moldova is
characterized by reduced fertility rate, rather low life expectancy and intense outmigration. The
population is rapidly decreasing, including a number of children. Migration from Moldova has been
progressively increasing, with an estimated one third of the working-age population currently abroad.
Due to this situation, many children are left behind by migrant parents and under the care of the
extended family (often grandparents).
1
1.1.2. Poverty
The 2019 SitAn concluded that poverty rates, although decreasing, remain high, particularly affecting
children and households with children, 24% of children living below the poverty line. Moreover, the
situation is especially serious in rural areas. The analysis shows “there is a lack of integration of laws
and policies comprehensively addressing poverty and social exclusion in the country, while the
financial mechanisms to reach ambitious goals and targets set in policy framework are weak and
insufficient. Budget allocations for social-assistance are mostly not child- or poverty-focused.”5 In
fact, the financial allocation for the social assistance programmes is insufficient, and social assistance
programmes are poorly targeted. As a result, social assistance programmes are less effective and a
portion of the poor households with children in excluded
Household consumption accounts for over 80% of GDP and depends strongly on remittances. The lack
of opportunity is the main push factor for migration, particularly for rural youth. The Government’s
fiscal revenue for social services is affected by an estimated one third of the work force being employed
informally. Children are the most affected by challenges faced by the social assistance system.
SitAn 2019 underlines that there is a lack of integration of laws and policies comprehensively addressing
the poverty and social exclusion in the country, while the financial mechanisms to reach ambitious goals
and targets set in policy framework are weak and insufficient. Budget allocations for social-assistance
are mostly not a child- or poverty-focused. Cash-based social benefits are low and fragmented and
largely ineffective in preventing, reducing and eliminating economic and social vulnerabilities and are
lacking direct link to specific children focused outcomes, while their equity is not ensured. Current offer
of social services at the local level significantly fails to meet the needs and to respond effectively to the
vulnerabilities among children, while also faced with challenges of the low availability of local specialists
and high turnover of staff.
Moldova faced important setbacks due to the COVID-19 crisis this year, and recent progress to reduce
poverty has been reversed. On average, Moldovan households with children have lost 15 per cent of
their income due to the pandemic, putting more pressure on an already high child poverty rate at 24 per
cent. 6 The government took several measures to offset the negative impact of COVID-19. Personal
protective equipment (PPE) was purchased to support front-line staff, especially in health centres. Social
protection legislation was amended to support people (including returning migrants) who had no work
record. To strengthen financial support to families with children, the income eligibility threshold was
increased, and the adult equivalency formula adjusted. This support, although necessary, appeared to
be largely insufficient.7
1.1.3. Political and administrative context
The Republic of Moldova has faced a long-lasting political crisis involving several governments within
the last three years as well as large public protests. According to UNICEF Country Office assessment in
its annual reports, this political situation affected the development and implementation of various
policies and strategies, including the National Development Strategy “Moldova 2030”. One of the effects
of political instability is the instability of the key institutions for children wellbeing. Ministries that have
been key stakeholders for UNICEF have undergone several reorganizations over the last three years.
Moreover, the fragmented territorial-administrative structure and the incomplete decentralization
process continue to result in the very low capacity of local governments to invest in social development
and, consequently, to ensure adequate provision of social services at the local level.
There is high deficiency and high turnaround of professionals in all social sectors, devaluing invested
resources. This is related with the intense outmigration and brain drain affecting all sectors of activity

and participation, 2019.

in Moldova. Moreover, the emigration generated over 18,000 children left behind by both or the only
migrant parent.
The breakaway region of Transnistria, with about half of million inhabitants, remains out of control of
Moldovan constitutional authorities.8 UN support is provided to people, including children in
Transnistria, within the framework of a programme agreed upon by de facto authorities in Tiraspol, and
UNICEF participate to the UN programme. However, data about the vulnerable children in the region
are not available or not trustworthy and UNICEF capacity to implement its entire programme is limited.
Increasingly ageing society, coupled with intense outmigration and brain drain associated with that, is
creating pressures on the public finance system, particularly pension and health, negatively affecting
the competitiveness of the country. There are wide rural-urban inequalities affecting all aspects of life
and access to services. 9
1.1.4. Children, youth and families
A large number of vulnerable children is at risk in Moldova because of child poverty, the poor quality of
education and healthcare services and limited effectiveness or absence of cross-sectoral and inter-
institutional cooperation mechanisms.
Some 20,000 children were separated from their family in 2018 alone. 90% of these children are
children left behind by both or the only migrant parent. While the number of institutionalized children
decreased six-fold over the past decade, a quarter of those still in institutions are children with
disabilities. 10
On the other hand, results of PISA tests in 2018 show that the formal education system in Moldova does
not fully provide the skills that young people need to transition to gainful adulthood. PISA tests show
that about 50% of students in (lower and upper) secondary school do not meet a minimum proficiency
level in literation and math. Moreover, youth unemployment (15-24 years old) and youth inactivity is
affecting about 60 per cent of young people, generating a very large number of young NEET, whereas
young women are the largest cohort in this category.11 In this context, Moldova lacks an effective and
operative coordination mechanism for youth legislation, policies and interventions across different
sectors and organizations, while the share of youth expenditures on all levels is largely insignificant.
However, inclusive education is considered the forefront of UNICEF Moldova Country Programme.
Several studies and evaluations showed considerable progresses in the inclusion of children with special
educational needs in the main education system and provided recommendations regarding system
strengthening and change of social norms towards enrolment of children with disabilities and those
with special educational needs in regular schools.12
In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, around 434,000 students in all academic institutions and
at all levels were asked to stay at home, and schools were mandated to provide distance learning. This
remote learning proved difficult for about 16,000 students (4.8 per cent of the total), and 3,000 teachers
(10.6 per cent of the total) did not have access to ICT technology (a laptop or tablet and access to the
internet). This made it impossible to organise lessons, deliver and receive instruction, monitor or assess
learning. The most affected families with school children have been those living in areas with lower
internet connectivity rates (74.5 per cent in rural areas versus 86.1 per cent in urban areas), families
with lower levels of education (a 64.7 per cent internet connection rate among people with incomplete
secondary education, compared with 94 per cent among those with higher education), and low-income
households (56.7 per cent internet connectivity among those with a monthly income under 3,000 lei,

versus 96.5 per cent in households with over 6,000 lei). School closures were especially harmful for
children with special educational needs. More than 7,000 of these children and 1,400 children with
disabilities were put at a higher risk of being excluded from the education process because they require
– in addition to trained teachers and support staff and adapted teaching methods – access to special
assistive technologies and devices, and continued access to rehabilitation programmes that have also
been in short supply during the pandemic.13
Violence against children and youth, including sexual abuse and severe physical violence, is a significant
issue that has been aggravated by the pandemic. The 2019 Violence Against Children and Youth Survey
indicates that children in the Republic of Moldova suffer substantial rates of sexual, physical and
emotional violence. Some 14 per cent of girls and 5 per cent of boys in the survey were subjected to
sexual violence before the age of 18 years, and 26 per cent of girls and 35 per cent of boys before the
same age were subjected to physical violence. Only 4 per cent of girls and 1 per cent of boys received
the necessary services as victims of sexual violence.14
Several legislative amendments have been adopted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 including a Decree on
Regional Services for Children Victims and Witnesses of Crimes, while also specific legislation on cyber
protection of children was enacted in order to improve children safety and the respect of child rights in
the judiciary.15
There were 1,304 child survivors of crimes in 2019, an increase of 16.4 per cent in comparison with
2014. Sexual crimes made victims of 363 children (27.8 per cent of the crimes), including 110 victims of
rape. The reported sexual offences involving children increased steadily, from 184 in 2014 to 309 in
2019 (a 67.9 per cent increase).16 This is rather good news, showing an increased awareness regarding
crimes against children, but the large number of children victims of crimes needs special attention at all
levels.
1.1.5. The youth sector
The youth sector and youth work are underappreciated and misunderstood by the influential actors
outside the sector and especially at local level. Local participatory structures (youth councils, pupils’
councils, youth CSOs or youth wings of political parties) are not present or accessible in all districts or
to most vulnerable adolescents and have limited resources. The framework for the provision of youth
services is underdeveloped, and capacities for provision of youth services are limited, while
accreditation and efficiency mechanisms are currently lacking. Adolescent’s parent’s parental abilities
are limited. There is low awareness of existing youth services and opportunities.17
1.2. Country Programme components and goals
The planned impact of UNICEF Moldova Country programme is that all children in Moldova, especially
the most vulnerable, enjoy their rights to education, health, adequate standard of living and
participation within a child friendly legal environment, and are protected from abandonment, neglect,
discrimination, exploitation and violence.
The programme result structure consists of two outcomes supported by nine outputs. The two outcomes
are linked and mutually reinforcing. They comprehensively address system strengthening and changes
in social norms and behaviours. Achieving simultaneous results under the two outcomes is a
prerequisite for substantially addressing key child deprivations and the realisation of child rights.
Outcome 1 focusses on achieving Equitable Child-Sensitive Systems and Services through five Outputs:
preventing family separation, discrimination and violence against children (Output 1); instituting
procedures and practices in the justice system that protect and reintegrate children in contact with the

law (Output 2); making schools and pre-schools ready to enrol most vulnerable children, and building
their capacity to apply and monitor quality teaching and learning, and address violence, drop-out and
absenteeism (Output 3); quality mother, child and adolescent health services, ensuring child survival,
growth and development (Output 4); and an equitable social protection system seeking to reach most
deprived families with children and alleviate child poverty (Output 5).
Outcome 2 focusses on Social Change for Child Rights through four outputs aiming at improved
capacities and skills of duty-bearers, enabling them to perform their obligations in the realisation of
child rights (Output 6); caregivers’ engagement in the realisation of child rights, seeking to improve their
capacity and skills to take responsibility for appropriate child care, health, development, education and
protection, including encouraging and practicing positive behaviour (Output 7); improved adolescent’
awareness and participation, including in supporting the realisation of child rights (Output 8); and
social inclusion of the most vulnerable groups of children18 seeking concerted sustainable action by all
systems and duty bearers in addressing the realisation of all rights of the child (Output 9).
Moreover, the Country Programme included in 2020 two outputs ((a) COVID-19 limit h2h transmission
and (b) protect individuals from exposure, COVID-19 prevent and address secondary impact of the
outbreak, under Outcome 1 – Equitable child sensitive systems and services) and implemented activities
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring a swift and sensitive answer to the emerging and
urgent needs of children.

1.3. The Objectives, Purpose and Scope of the evaluation
The objective of the Multi-Country programme Evaluation (MCPE) is to conduct a formative multi-
country evaluation serving both accountability and learning purposes. This MCPE aims to look back
and assess the relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout the implementation of the
country programmes (CPs) in the four countries to identify good practices, and draw lessons and
forward-looking recommendations that can inform the 2023-27 CP planning process, which has already
commenced or will commence soon in all four countries.
In line with the ToR, the purpose of the MCPE is threefold:
- To strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s
contribution to the results for children at scale especially for the most vulnerable in Bulgaria,
Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine.
- To support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by
understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies, through which the
Country Programme is delivered to better understand the added value of UNICEF in each
country context.
- To draw lessons from the previous CPD implementation in order to make the best use of
UNICEF’s change strategies in each country covered by the evaluation and in the region as a
whole, while considering current circumstances.
In the framework of the MCPE, the present report focuses on the CP of UNICEF in Moldova. The
evaluation is built on evidence collected from interventions implemented in the country, especially in
the last 3 years and a half (under the current CPD), but also, to a more limited extent, in the years before.
Specific activities carried out to set aside the negative consequences of the current pandemic crisis were
taken into account to the extent they are part of the results chains in areas selected.
Therefore, the scope of this Country Programme Evaluation is the following:19
- Temporal scope: 2018-June 2021, meaning it covers the current Country Programme (2018-
2022) to date. However, when relevant to the observed impact, the temporal scope of the
evaluation is extended to the previous years and the previous CPD.
- Geographical scope: All areas in Moldova where UNICEF works, even in cases where the
initiatives have started as pilots, because they are implemented with the intention to scale-
nationally
- Portfolio scope: All of the portfolio components, cross-cutting issues such as gender, and inter-
sectoral support involving gender and communication.
- Organizational scope: The CO and wider provision of technical support and oversight from
UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, when relevant, UNICEF’s headquarters.
- Excluded: The evaluation will not provide a detailed assessment of all CP components. However,
in order to provide lessons learned and UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for
children at scale, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken for three selected
areas: (a) inclusive education, (b) justice for children and (c) youth engagement, focusing on
youth friendly health services.
The primary users of this Country Programme evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF CO and ECARO.
Secondary users of the evaluation are the Government of the Republic of Moldova, UN agencies and
development partners present in Moldova. The evaluation report aims to build on the agreements made
between them and to assist prioritization and establishing strategies for the future, as the parties move
together into the next planning and programme cycle.

2. Methodology
2.1. Evaluation framework: criteria and questions
The evaluation focusses on the CPD and its Theory of Change (ToC). The Evaluation Matrix was
developed (Annex 4) during the Inception Phase, as the core analytical framework against which data
was gathered and analysed. All evaluation questions were assigned to a specific evaluation criterion:
relevance, coherence and impact. For each evaluation question, related indicators/descriptors,
sources of information and data collection methods were specified in the matrix. The indicators and
methods were based on the preliminary documentary review done at the Inception Phase of the
evaluation.
The evaluation questions in the evaluation matrix are provided in the ToR and indicated to be final and
not subject to change. Although ToR provided the opportunity to each CO to add up to two questions, no
additional evaluation questions were proposed by the COs during the Inception Phase.
The evaluation matrix is built on an overall approach linking evaluation criteria and level. In order to
provide conclusions and lessons learned on UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for
children at scale, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken for three selected areas:
inclusive education; justice for children; youth engagement, focusing on youth friendly health services.
The assessments at area level will contribute to findings and conclusions as examples (case studies) of
results-at-scale achieved (or not/less than expected). The selected areas have been selected based on
the initial analysis of the evaluation team and in consultation with the CO. From one perspective, the
evaluation questions related to how UNICEF contributed to change for children at scale can be best
answered using specific theory-based impact evaluation methods, as described below. But these
methods are best applied to selected case, rather than to very complex and heterogenous programmes.
On the other hand, the areas have been selected to represent different types of results achieved by
UNICEF, with different levels of change for children at scale generated by UNICEF to be analysed.
The evaluation utilized a formative approach to the evaluation to look back and assess the relevance,
coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the Country Programme in the country,
to identify good practices, and draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the
2023-20227 CP planning process, which will commence during the last quarter of 2021.
The CPE involved three phases: (1) inception; (2) data collection; and (3) analysis and reporting. The
methodology used mixed methodological approached involving qualitative data collection methods as
well as quantitative methods. To improve the reliability and to validate the findings, information from
different lines of inquiry was triangulated.
2.2. Data collection and analysis methods
The team engaged with UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF Moldova, government authorities, public institutions,
civil society partners and other development agencies to ensure that the evaluation responds to the
needs and priorities of the users.
The evaluation used the following methods of data collection: (a) document review (Annex 7); (b) key
stakeholder interviews, and a survey for the social network analysis for the assessment of the coherence
of the CP and UNICEF partnerships.
Semi-structured interviews were the main tool used with national partners, reflecting the upstream
nature of the programme and the status of the respondents. Primary data was collected from a variety
of stakeholders, including government officials, UNICEF staff, civil society organizations and
development partners (see the list of interviewed stakeholders in Annex 5). In total 31 individual
8
interviews were conducted remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions. The interviews have been conducted
by the international and national consultants, working in pairs or individually. The interviews were
guided by checklists to support consistency of data collection across the team and varied stakeholders.
But for each interview the questions have been tailored as appropriate to valorise best the position and
knowledge of the interviewee. In line with the ethical consideration presented below the evaluation
team ensures the confidentiality of the interviewees, without connecting the evidence and opinions
expressed during meetings with the identity of the stakeholder. The positive and open approach of
almost all the respondents was quite striking and much appreciated.
The list of key informants invited to interviews was agreed with the ECARO and CO at the end of the
inception stage to ensure that the most important stakeholders are involved in the evaluation process.
The aim of the sampling strategy was to cover the country programme in a general manner and the three
selected impact areas mentioned above and to include different types of key informants
(UNICEFUNICEF staff, representatives of the government, representatives of UNICEF agencies and other
development agencies, representatives of academia, services providers and implementing partners) in
the list of interviewees for each area. Following from the programme design and focus of its activities, it
was decided to spend the majority of the time with stakeholders at national level, and much less time in
the regions, because so many of the planned results are at policy level.
As per the Terms of References of the evaluation, children and adolescents have not been interviewed
or consulted directly in another way. The evaluation team decided instead to rely on sectoral evaluations
and studies that have presented the perspectives of these groups more thoroughly than would have
been possible during this evaluation. The evaluation team instead met representatives of intermediary
groups that work closely with vulnerable children.
Three participatory online workshops have been organised with CO staff. The workshops aimed at (1)
familiarizing the evaluation team with the CP and identifying and selecting the impact areas to be
assessed more in-depth, (2) presenting the inception report, discussing key issues to be addressed by
the evaluation and planning data collection in cooperation with the CO and (3) presenting and validating
findings and discussing preliminary recommendations.
The analysis method is presented in the evaluation matrix. A theory-based approach was applied for
the Country Programme Evaluation (CPE), based on the explicit sectoral theories of change (ToCs)
developed by the UNICEF Country Office in Moldova (and reconstructed by the evaluation team) for the
CP and selected impact areas.20 In Annex 2 we included a brief presentation of the methodology for
Process Tracing, the theory-based evaluation method used for the selected areas. Another essential
theory-based evaluation method was the Realist Evaluation. According to Westhorp (2014) realist
approaches “assume that nothing works everywhere or for everyone, and that context really does make a
difference to programme outcomes”. Therefore, the Realist Evaluation focuses on how, why and in what
contexts an intervention leads to particular outcome.
Finally, other important evaluation approaches utilized for the evaluation are stakeholders analysis
and social network analysis for evaluation of UNICEF Moldova CO coherence, added value and
cooperation with stakeholders in order to enhance the results pursued; systems-based evaluation
principles: holism, non-summativity, participation of stakeholders, equifinality and multifinality
approaches were used through the evaluation, as UNICEF’s interventions are not evaluated in a vacuum,
but in a complex context that have been taken into account.
20 Theory-based approaches to evaluation use an explicit theory of change to draw conclusions about whether and how an
intervention contributed to observed results. Theory-based approaches are a “logic of enquiry,” which complement and can
be used in combination with most of the evaluation designs and data collection techniques. A theory of change explains how
an intervention is expected to produce its results. The theory of change can be used to test, that is to evaluate – with evidence
– the assumed causal chain of results with what is observed to have happened, checking each link and assumption in the
process to verify the expected theory. For details see Better Evaluation and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat at:
https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/cee/tbae-aeat/tbae-aeat02-eng.asp
9
The recommendations were developed by the evaluation team, based on in-country consultations on
the early draft findings, and the later analysis of the data, findings and conclusions. The specific wording
of the recommendations was developed in consultation with the Country Office which provided
feedback, comments and questions through the report drafting process. One meeting has been
organised with the staff of the CO to validate and discuss recommendations in detail. A focus group for
findings, conclusions and recommendations validation was organised with the Country Office after the
first presentation of the evaluation report.
2.3. Limitations
The main challenge facing the evaluation arose from the spread and complexity of UNICEF’s objectives
and its strategies in Moldova during a period of socio-economic and political instability. Overall, the
changes that UNICEF seeks to make are mostly long-term and countrywide and, in many cases, three
and a half years (the period covered by the present CPE for the programme 2018-2022) is not a long
enough period to allow for impact for children at scale. Moreover, the evaluated period overlapped with
the COVID-19 pandemic (since March 2020) and a change of political regime (in 2020-2021). For this
reason, the impact assessments also analysis UNICEF interventions started before the current Country
Programme and continued within its framework.
However, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the sustainability of UNICEF results, as assessed in
this report, is at risk and the evaluation team is not able to confidently or clearly predict to what extent
the strategies of upstream policy work will ultimately benefit children in the country, or the benefits
already achieved will last given the social and economic crisis generated by the pandemic.
In almost all areas, UNICEF was promoting further alignment of government policies with international
best practices and standards. These kinds of changes are dependent on high-level decisions and it was
not always possible for the evaluation team to meet state officials at this level to determine how they
see UNICEF’s contribution. Those officials that the evaluation team were able to meet were open,
exceeding expectations.
Assessing UNICEF’s contribution to results for children, at scale, was another difficult area. The
programme has devoted considerable attention to the question of causality, in other words, who or what
is responsible for changes at different levels of policymaking or implementation of new policy. These
considerations were summarized in the ToC adopted for each main sector in the UNICEF programme;
they helped UNICEF staff assess the possible pathways to successful implementation of quality services
or child rights. However, in many cases not only UNICEF but also several other donors or development
agencies have played a significant role in supporting the Government. Apportioning the amount of
influence of each main player was not easy but the evaluation attempted to do this, as will be seen in
examples of UNICEF’s work provided in this report.
The evaluation team faced a few limitations at the design and evaluation phase of the Country
Programme.
- Non-systematic documentation of the theory of change for some programme areas which was
addressed by development, testing and validation of an indicative ToC to serve as framework
for evaluation. However, in the case of Process Tracing, not all desirable evidence was available.
For example, UNICEF claims contributing to increased capacity of teachers for inclusive
education and increased capacity of medical staff for youth friendly services and trainings have
been organised with UNICEF support both by public institutions and implementing partners
form the civil society. However, we miss the evidence on the level of competences developed by
participants due to these trainings.
- As the data collection phase was delivered in July and August 2021, during the holidays season,
not all key informants were available or reachable at the time of evaluation, however a
10
sufficiently high number of interviews have been conducted to allow evaluators to respond to
the question with enough confidence.
2.4. Ethical issues and consideration of child rights, equity and gender
The evaluation team adhered to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical guidelines and code
of conduct. This means that the evaluation team upheld the appropriate obligations of evaluators,
including maintaining the independence, impartiality, credibility and accountability of the individual
team members and the evaluation process as a whole. The evaluation team was not subject to any
conflicts of interest and confirmed that they were able to carry out the evaluation without any undue
interference. Along the data collection, analysis and reporting, in order to ensure the integrity of
evaluation, special attention was paid by evaluators towards respecting the ethical standards of UNICEF,
as presented in the “UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data
Collection and Analysis” (April 2015), particularly as concerns: the harms and benefits, informed
consent, privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, conflict of interests.
The main ethical issue that emerged during planning the evaluation was the need for anonymity and
confidentiality for government officials interviewed. The evaluation team ensured the consent of key
informants to be interviewed and give the experts conducting interviews gave formal assurance that
comments made during interviews would be anonymous. Hence none of the statements mentioned in
this report are attributable to individuals or particular government departments. On the other hand, as
no children have been directly involved in the evaluation, no formal letter of consent on the collected
data was needed.
2.5. Management of the evaluation
Alongside UNICEF evaluation managers at ECARO, the evaluation team maintained close contact with
the CO representatives and staff and UNICEF ECA Regional Advisors. The interviews with ECARO
advisors greatly helped the evaluation team develop its analysis.
The team presented its findings to an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting of the Government,
UN agency, donor, and public agency and COs representatives. The meeting was well attended and
provided an opportunity for all parties to comment on the current UNICEF programme and to raise
issues to be addressed in the future.

3. Main evaluation findings
3.1. Relevance
3.1.1. To what extent has UNICEF responded to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable throughout the programme implementation
UNICEF responded very well to the (changing) needs of the most vulnerable children, throughout
the programme implementation. The relevance of UNICEF Country Programme is supported by
extensive research and a good use of data. The updated information about all children in
Moldova gives UNICEF its capacity to take into account the most vulnerable ones, to plan and
implement activities for them. We have not identified groups of vulnerable children that are not
considered in the program implementation.
UNICEF builds its programme on extensive evidence and lessons learned both from
implementing previous interventions, as well as from needs assessments and studies conducted
within the scope of the current CP. All stakeholders consulted through interviews at the data
collection phase stated that: there is a high level of adequacy of the CP and its implementation
strategies to the changing needs of vulnerable children, adolescents, and their families.
The Situation Analysis of Children (SitAn) in Moldova was finalised in 201721 and it was supplemented
by a range of other studies and evaluations. They took stock of the evolving needs of the children, with
a special attention to the most vulnerable. These studies and evaluations informed specific activities
of the country office, especially its advocacy, during the implementation of the Country
Programme. The most important of these research documents are:
- Feasibility Study on the opportunities and concerns related to accession by the Republic of Moldova
to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications
Procedure, 2018;
- Cash-Based Social Protection for Children in the Republic of Moldova, 2018;
- The Review of assessment and evaluation in education in the Republic of Moldova, UNICEF

- Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on Remittances and Coping Mechanisms of Families with
Children in Moldova, 2020;
- Report on the Evaluation of National Indicators on Children in Contact with the Law, 2021.
The Country Programme document identified specific bottlenecks related to social norms that
are effectively hindering the results and impact of the programme implementation. As a result,

Analysis 2016”, UNICEF, Chisinau, 2017.

the programme dedicated Outcome 2 to changing attitudes and behaviours, not only the system
and allocated more resources (financial, human resources, energy overall) to communication for
development and changing behaviours, working with parents and with young people. Research
concerning social norms in different sectors has been also conducted, including:
- Knowledge, attitudes and practices in early childhood development and care, 2018;
- The Perceptions of General Population and Specialists on Children Offenders and Children Victims
and Witnesses of Crimes – Providing quantitative and qualitative information to serve as baseline
for the 2018-2022 Country Programme indicators, 2018;
- The Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in the Educational System – Sociological Study, 2018.
The documentary evidence and interviews show that the generated evidence used by UNICEF Moldova
to plan interventions and implementation strategies in order to addressed most of the important
pressing needs of the children in the country, especially of the vulnerable children. UNICEF, thus,
supported policy and institutional development and services provision for the benefit of these children.
The programme of UNICEF Moldova and the advocacy activities addressed the needs of children victims
of violence neglect and exploitation (especially in Chișinău and its metropolitan area, about one quarter
of the Moldovan population), children with special educational needs and with disabilities, children in
residential institutions, children in conflict with the law and in probation programmes, pregnant
adolescents and young mothers, pregnant women and children with HIV/AIDS, most at risk adolescents
and especially vulnerable adolescents (MARA and EVA), children from poor households.
UNICEF adapted its programme focus in implementation during 2020, when the focus was shifted
to understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As showed in section 3.1.4, dedicated to the
response to major changes and crisis, there is a large appreciation of how quickly and professionally
UNICEF reacted to newly identified needs and requests for support from the key governmental partners
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
3.1.2. To what extent has UNICEF consistently integrated the equity and gender
equality in all aspects of programming and implementation, including policy
and advocacy?
UNICEF integrated equity in all aspects of programming and implementation, including policy
and advocacy. As already mentioned, the needs of the most vulnerable children have been
addressed in order to narrow the equity gaps between children. Gender equality is integrated in
programme planning and implementation in most of its components. Dedicated gender sensitive
approaches are implemented in the fields of health and youth. However, complex
intersectionality or compounded discrimination/inequalities are addressed but in a limited
way. For example, the situation of Roma girls, with low rates of participation to secondary education
and often discriminated, is directly addressed only in one project in a small number of municipalities.
The CP has been strongly focusing on the principles of equity, gender and human rights. A human
rights-based approach has been applied to achieve sustainable progress in programme results with an
emphasis on participation and non-discrimination principles. The equity principle implies understating
and addressing the root causes of inequality, so that children have an opportunity to survive, develop
and reach their full potential without discrimination. The CP 2018-2022 focuses on realizing UNICEF’s
equity and gender equality agenda in the country complementing the efforts of the Government to
provide equitable access of disadvantaged children to healthcare, education, social services and to
justice.
Gender has been integrated into programming, and a number of good practices have been identified by
this evaluation and are, also, put forward by the Gender Programmatic Review carried out in 2021. The
SitAn 2017 and the light SitAn 2019 underline the persistence of gender inequalities in Moldova,
hindering the development of the country and restricting the ability of disadvantaged girls and women
to fully achieve their human capabilities. However, the Country Programme did not formulate
specific outputs related to equity and gender equality. UNICEF Moldova undertook a gender
analysis for each area of its work and some implementation activities are gender responsive.
14
UNICEF Moldova continued to strive for disaggregated data in its work with the National Bureau of
Statistic (NBS), in order to enable adatpted policies to for additional information on gender, age,
geographical and other differences. In an effort to further strengthen the availability of gender and age
disaggregated data on violence, exploitation and abuse of children, UNICEF advocated for amending the
MHLSP Annual Statistical Report with following disaggregation on victims of violence available in 2019:
place of residence, sex, age group and disability. The same type of advocacy has been conducted since
2021 with the Ministry of Justice in order to improve data (including gender disaggregated data) about
children in conflict with the law.
The evidence from UNICEF reports and sectoral evaluations, as well as interviews, shows that UNICEF
Moldova mainstreamed gender in areas such as:
- Health:
o capacity building activities have been implemented for medical staff (doctors and
nurses) in working with pregnant women and other patients remotely and during
COVID-19 pandemic.
o New Antenatal Care Standards and Neonatal Protocols were developed with UNICEF
support and also validated and endorsed in the Transnistrian region.
o UNICEF organized jointly with MHLSP and WHO the Breastfeeding Caravan.
- Youth:
o In the case of Youth Friendly Health Centres (YFHC) outreach activities have been
conducted to address and attract boys, as in 2018 70% of beneficiaries in YFHC were
girls.
o The campaign Youth of Moldova for #GlobalGoals supported by UNICEF included a focus
on girls, youth with disabilities, young people from rural areas and the Roma population.
However, integration of gender equality is not visible in other area:
- Child protection: programmatic activities on preventing institutionalization and
deinstitutionalization, and the support for official mechanisms for the protection of children
from violence, abuse and neglect have not been purposely organised to address gender
inequality.
- Justice for children: the development of the Barnahus-type centre for children victims and
witnesses of crime and the educational probation programme for children and young people
have not been purposely organised to address gender inequality.
- Inclusive education: activities have been focused on the integration of all children with Special
Educational Needs (SEN) and children with disabilities (CwD), and activities were not focused
gender dimension, although access of Roma girls to education remains problematic in Moldova,
according to the SitAn and other research data.
- Social protection: activities have been focused on increasing the protection for families with
children and on raising the capacity of Local Public Authorities (LPAs), irrespective of gender.
In these areas UNICEF activities addressed the main vulnerabilities: violence, institutionalisation, the
deviant behaviour and conflict with the law, the limited access to education or poverty and the
interstation of these vulnerabilities with the gender dimension and inequalities generated by gender
have been considered secondary. Interviews with UNICEF CO specialists in the mentioned areas and
with implementing partners show that, in most cases, the expectation is that addressing the main
vulnerabilities and sources of discrimination will direcly contribute also to gender equality.
Overall gender equality is well included in the programme planning and implementation, but
complex intersectionality or compounded discrimination/inequalities remain addressed to in a
limited way. For example, gender stereotypes are stronger in rural areas and the limitations in
accessing education and other services makes girls in rural areas particularly vulnerable22, there is no
specific programme component or project targeting girls in rural areas. Roma girls are also particularly
vulnerable according to studies, with limited clear data available on the gender-ethnicity intersection,
22 Light Situation Analysis addressing social inclusion of vulnerable groups, violence against children and youth
empowerment and participation, 2019.
15
but there are very few initiatives of UNICEF Moldova targeting Roma girls with tailored measures,
starting with better data collection.
3.1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to changes in national needs
and rights of the beneficiaries especially of the most vulnerable and in national
priorities during programme implementation?
The answer to the first two evaluation questions assessed UNICEF response to changing needs of children,
especially the most vulnerable children, in Moldova. The answer to this third question will focus on UNICEF
response to changing priorities in national polices, in connection to the above-mentioned changes in needs.
UNICEF country programme implementation contributed to the implementation of national
strategies addressing the needs of the vulnerable children in Moldova. Moreover, during the
programme implementation, UNICEF actively participated to the development of new policy
strategic documents aiming at improving the situation of all children in the country, including
the most vulnerable ones. Using the power of evidence about the most vulnerable children and
advocating for evidence-based policies, UNICEF contributed to relevant national priorities for
children rights and wellbeing. In this way, UNICEF ensured its relevance to both changes in
national needs and rights of the beneficiaries especially of the most vulnerable and in national
priorities.
UNICEF Moldova carefully aligned the Country Programme 2018-2022 with national strategic
documents and with the needs of the most vulnerable children. Therefore, the Country Programme is
consistent with the country priorities enshrined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) “Moldova
2020” and sector strategic documents in the area of education, health, social protection and justice as
well as cross-cutting national strategies and programmes on human rights, Roma inclusion, inclusive
education and HIV/AIDS. Relevant national policy documents are specified in the Results Matrix of the
CPC document.
All collected data show that during programme implementation UNICEF Moldova kept true to the
planning (and only added additional panned outputs to respond to COVID-19 crisis), therefore
the planned alignment with national priorities was followed by proper implementation.
Interviewed stakeholders were not able to identify any area in the activities of UNICEFUNICEF that have
not been aligned with national policies. The constant communication and the mechanism of
coordination between UNICEF and the Government of Republic of Moldova is considered an important
guarantee for this alignment.

As most national strategies have been planned until 2020, in the year 2020 the development of
new strategic documents (strategies and action plans) was initiated by the Government. Although
a new regulation on the development of public policy documents (Government Decision 386/2020)
delayed the process of developing and adopting these new strategic documents, UNICEF remained
close to the government supporting the drafting and consultation processes for:
- the National Child Protection Programme 2021–2025 and its Action Plan 2021–2025;
- the new Education Sector Strategy 2021–2030 and medium-term Implementation Programme
2021–2025;
- the National Health Strategy 2020-2030, the National Immunization Programme 2021-2025;
- the National Programme on HIV/STI Prevention and Control 2021-2025,
- the National Programme on Non-Communicable Diseases 2021-2025.
Moreover, UNICEF continued to support the National Bureau of Statistic (NBS) to develop its
capacity. As a result, the statistical publication “Children of Moldova” continued to be improved and
issued every year and new data and disaggregated information are available to inform decisions
of UNICEF, the Government and all other stakeholders about children needs and the best
approach to respond to these needs.
Interviews with Government officials, UNICEF representatives and other stakeholders show that,
with very few and limited exception, UNICEF Moldova aligned with country priorities and
addressed key development issues. The identified exceptions, where UNICEF work is not fully aligned
with national priorities and needs, in the areas where case studies have been conducted for this
evaluation:
- in the area of justice for children, UNICEF focused its work on (i) the Barnahus-type centre(s)
for children victims and witness of crimes, (ii) the educational probation programme and (iii)
children with deviant behaviour under the age of criminal liability. However, less attention in
UNICEF work has been given to children in penitentiaries (excepting the region of Transnistria)
and to children released from the penitentiary who need complex reintegration services in a
dedicated centre;
- in the area of youth empowerment and participation, UNICEF focused its work on participatory
bodies (as the youth councils) and youth friendly health services, but less on the development
of youth work and youth specific services in youth centres;
- in the area of child protection, UNICEF is less focused on homeless children.
Data collected from the cited studies and interviews show that cases when/where UNICEF Moldova
decided not to take action in response to the needs of children and adolescents and national
priorities are areas where other development organisations/agencies are active. For example:
- in the case of children released from the penitentiary, GIZ is supporting the National Probation
Inspectorate;
- in the case of youth centre, UNFPA is supporting the MECR and LPAs in the development of youth
work and specific services for youth people.
UNICEF Moldova also allocated resources (financial, human resources, information) to modelling and
pilot projects implemented in partnership with Local Public Authorities (LPAs), with a clear intent to
perfect its intervention and to work and advocate for rolling-out and scaling-up afterwards. This
approach was in line with the decentralisation process in the country (and also proved useful in the
context of the political instability, allowing for the continuation of projects despite multiple changes of
the government). However, although these projects had good results at local level, scaling-up is found
to be a slow and complex process. For example, there are a lot of strategic plans and local instruments
developed in Chișinău and in the district (raion) of Sîngerei promoting cross-sectoral cooperation for
inclusive education, social and child protection. These have been scaled-up to a limited extent until
2021, but UNICEF CO continues to advocate for them. Moreover, in 2020 a new project, supported by
the European Union, will contribute to the development of two regions (Cahul and Ungheni). The project
offers the possibility to further model the cross-sectoral cooperation for services dedicated to children
and to continue the advocacy for scaling-up the proposed instruments.
19
3.1.4. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to the shifts caused by crisis
or major socio-economic and political changes?
UNICEF Moldova implemented an integrated approach to prioritizing the well-being of children
during crisis and political change. UNICEF maintained, thus, its relevance in the context of the
rapid change in needs, as in the case of new needs determined by COVID-19, and continued to the
public policies aiming to generate impact for all children. UNICEF also adapted its
implementation strategies in order to maintain its relevance and ensure its impact during a
period of constant political change.
Two types of shits influenced the context of the Country Programme implementation in Moldova:
1) The political instability with frequent changes of government and several elections influenced
the dialogue with the most important central institutions and represented an important
bottleneck for advocacy activities and work for policy development, with a risk of abandonment
of the main priorities promoted/supported by UNICEF.
2) The COVID-19 pandemic generated a significant social and economic negative impact, especially
for the most vulnerable children and important challenges for the key respondent institutions.
Concerning the response to the political instability, analysed documents and interviews show two main
elements of this contextual factor for UNICEF work:
- Officially, the priorities of the Government of the Republic of Moldova, although the leadership
changed several times, were not changed in relation to the rights of the children and the dialogue
and cooperation between the Government and UNICEF remained opened.
- Changes in the leadership of the government and, in some case, the reorganisation of Ministries,
delayed the results of all advocacy efforts by UNICEF, as they naturally generate a period of
adjustment for the new decision makers, period when important policy decisions cannot be
made.
UNICEF responded to the political instability using four different and complementary approaches:
- Perseverance with the advocacy work, as new leadership in the Government and Ministries
generally meant countless meetings and other activities in order to inform new decision makers
about UNICEF approach and projects and to gain their support.
- The intensification of the work with Local public Authorities (LPAs), with two purposes: (a)
to generate results of modelling projects at local level to be easy to communicate, convincing
and readily used in the advocacy work with any new policy maker at central level and (b) to test
approaches to empower LPAs to play a more important and autonomous role in the realization
of child rights, as decentralisations continued to represent an objective for most of the
governments.
- The intensification of the communication activities, especially targeting young people,
promoting social mobilisation for child rights through strengthened engagement with
adolescents and youth in addressing harmful practices and beliefs and promoting key human
rights values. This is a set of activities that is considered helpful also in keeping governmental
priorities in lines with these values.
- Close work with important institutions less affected by political changes, because they play
mainly a technical role in the system. Although the leadership of these institutions may change
often in the context of political instability, their work is less affected by the changes and
supporting them has important results in reaching objectives related to capacity building within
the systems and services for children. Among the institutions that benefited of UNICEF support
and continued to contribute to system strengthening are: the National Bureau of Statistic (NBS),
the Republican Centre for Psycho-pedagogical Assistance (RCAP), the National Probation
Inspectorate.
Concerning the response to COVID-19, UNICEF Moldova mobilised fast to support the Government
to ensure basic safety to front-line workers. UNICEF utilised different opportunities to ensure the
largest possible coverage of its support:
20
- Using its global supply networks with the support of the UNICEF Supply Division,
supported the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers and
the capacity-building (training) of service providers in infection prevention and control and
communication and community engagement.
- Through local procurement, additional PPE (coveralls, gowns and thermal scanners) was
procured for border police staff.
- As part of the EU4Moldova programme, additional PPE, purchased from EU funds, were
provided to the primary healthcare centres in Ungheni and Cahul districts, as part of the
Solidarity for Health initiative.
- WASH supplies have been provided to 2,600 schools and kindergartens for the first 3 months of
the 2020-2021 school year, as well as to 41 youth-friendly health centres nationwide, providing
primary health-care services for at-risk adolescents and youth; 12 maternity hospitals providing
perinatal care services to mothers and new-borns; the Municipal Paediatric Hospital for
Contagious Diseases; 12 residential schools and institutions for children, including those with
disabilities; and 225 vulnerable families benefiting from early-intervention services for young
children with developmental delays and disabilities with USAID financial support.
Although the COVID-19 outbreak demanded a change in strategy from advocacy to services and
equipment provision, UNICEF continued its advocacy and capacity building activities. These
activities remained important in order to ensure an effective and sustainable response form the key
respondent institutions.
UNICEF Moldova mobilised fast to better understand the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on
children and several studies have been conducted in 2020, including a study on the impact of COVID-19
on Remittances and Coping Mechanisms of Families with Children in Moldova and a study on the profile
of out-of-school children and adolescents as the gross enrolment ratio decreased by one percentage
point in primary and three-quarters of a percentage point in lower secondary education.
Specific technical assistance and capacity building activities have been also implemented:
- In the field of child protection: UNICEF provided technical assistance to the MHLSP to develop a
technical manual for working with children during the pandemic, for use by local authorities,
service providers, individual specialists and caregivers and supported the online training for
10,474 managerial and didactical staff (81.4%) on positive parenting for early childhood
development (ECD) during the pandemic and recovery period. Moreover, the children helpline
was intensively promoted in order to address the risks of VAC in the pandemic.
- In the field of education: UNICEF supported MECR with a methodology for organizing education
during quarantine, special regulations for the 2020–2021 school year (returning to school
regulations), and students’ and parents’ guides on safe behaviour during COVID-19. This
methodological support was backed up with online training of 8,351 managerial and teaching
staff in general and boarding schools, and 12,945 preschool managerial and didactical staff plus
18,650 non-didactical staff.
- In the fields of health, immunization and ECD, after the lockdown, UNICEF supported MHLSP to:
o catch up with routine vaccination through a series of capacity-building activities for
family doctors and nurses on restarting routine vaccination and assuring safety in
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and through communication activities
targeting caregivers and the general population;
o continue to supervise child development and growth and make the early detection
of developmental delays in the context of COVID-19, ensuring the safety of families and
health providers through the training of 300 family doctors and nurses.
o based on the results of the COVID-19 vaccine introduction readiness assessment, a
national vaccination plan against COVID 19 was developed by national stakeholders with
the joint technical support of WHO and UNICEF. In this context, a live stream on the
21
importance of vaccination with the participation of a paediatrician and an
epidemiologist reached more than 14,500 people.
UNICEF also supported public awareness campaigns in the context of the pandemic. More specifically,
three campaigns were implemented jointly with the United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office, WHO
and the ministry of health: Stay Home, Be Safe and Take Care. Leaflets, posters, stickers, billboards,
public service announcements and guidelines for various target audiences were produced at every stage
of the pandemic’s evolution, as well as two songs for children and young people. One of the songs went
viral, reaching over 3.7 million people.
An unexpected contribution of UNICEF for the response to the social and economic challenges generated
by the pandemic came for the implementation of one of the recommendations from 2019 simulation
exercise – to increase the inclusion of children from 0.5 to 0.75 in the calculation of Social Aid (Ajutor
Social) payments to households with children. The recommendation was followed by the MHLSP as a
mitigation measure to COVID-19 and data show that households receiving this aid are coping slightly
better to the crisis compared to non-beneficiaries.23
Therefore, answering the challenges of COVID-19 and its effects, UNICEF Moldova mobilised fast
to support the Government to ensure basic safety to front-line workers. In line with the needs that
have been identified through the diagnostic activities24, UNICEF Moldova has adapted its interventions
in: a) education, by facilitating online learning through development of remote learning platforms and
their content, purchase and distribute IT equipment for families that did not have access to the online
learning system and for families with children with disabilities, b) in health, by conducting youth-
friendly activities within WASH area and providing support and hygiene supplies for families with
children with disabilities and for women victims of domestic violence25. Moreover, although the COVID-
19 outbreak demanded a change in strategy from advocacy to services and equipment provision,
UNICEF continued its advocacy and capacity building activities, in order to ensure an effective and
sustainable response form the key respondent institutions.
According to the Real-Time Assessment of UNICEF’s ongoing Response to COVID19 in Europe and
Central Asia, further work is needed in the following areas: support for Roma children and their families
in education and health areas, skill-building for the personal working in the sector of mental health and
dealing with post-Covid19 anxiety and stress and further logistic support for vulnerable children who
do not have access to the online learning system.
3.2. Coherence
3.2.1. To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme kept true to its mandate and
aligned with UNICEF’s global and regional strategies as well as UNSDCF and
SDGs in any given country?
UNICEF’s programme interventions in Moldova are in direct alignment with UNICEF’s regional
and global priorities, including the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018-2021), the Global SDG indicators
and the UNSDCF for Moldova.
UNICEF Moldova Country Programme has been prepared and implemented in line with the UNICEF’s
global and regional strategies, as well as SDGs and the partnership framework for SDGs for Moldova.
The country Programme pays special attention to the Goal Area 3 – Every Child Protected from Violence
and Exploitation and Goal Area 4 – Equity: Every Child Has a Fair Chance in Life, corresponding to the

regional priority on child protection. In relation to these goal areas, several outcomes are planned. On
the other hand, numerous activities have been implemented in line with Goal Area 1– Every Child
Survives and Thrives and Goal Area – Every Child Learns.
Strategically, the CP was designed based on the SDGs’ principle of “leaving no one behind” and has
remained coherent with evolving global priorities in relation to the rights of children and adolescents.
The CP contributes to eight out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals: 1 (No Poverty), 2 (End Hunger),
3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 10 (Reduced Inequalities),
16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).
Somehow less covered with planned activities, although with a corresponding Country Programme
Outcome and some intervention implemented, is the regional priority on adolescent participation.26

Moreover, supporting the country efforts to meet SDGs, in 2020, UNICEF, jointly with UNFPA and the
United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office, supported the National Youth Council of Moldova in
organizing a national campaign, Youth of Moldova for #GlobalGoals, to provide young people with
adequate skills and conditions to contribute to societal development, monitor the implementation of the
SDGs and make youth voices heard by decision-makers. The campaign reached out to more than 1,000
young people, resulted in the development of a robust youth report highlighting major problems for
them.
UNICEF also reports that, a successful game-based approach was introduced and piloted as an
instrument to raise awareness on the SDGs and child rights among youth and children. UNICEF, together
with local partners, developed a toolkit, Dialogica, which through ‘brain games’ enables local youth
organizations and youth workers to engage young people in SDG dialogue.
3.2.2. To what extent did UNICEF manage to build effective and sustainable
partnerships in working towards addressing the predefined bottlenecks,
advocating for evidence for equity and contributing to the results at scale?
UNICEF maintained a strong partnership with the Government of Moldova and other public
institutions and ensured that governmental authorities developed ownership over the work
where UNICEF support is provided. This partnership represents a precondition for UNICEF
relevance and impact. UNICEF works well with local authorities and civil society organisations
implementing projects and delivering services at community level. Results of local level projects
are used in advocacy, for scaling up nationally, in partnership with UN agencies, other
development partners, academia and the civil society. Overall, UNICEF partnership network
forms a strong community and the dialogue among different partners and stakeholders in
different sectors is facilitated by UNICEF. Thus, UNICEF supports a nationwide partnership for
the rights of the children: the National Council for Child Rights Protection (NCCRP).
All collected data, from documents and interviews, show that UNICEF CO kept its partnerships,
with public institutions and CSOs, during the constant political changes and was also successful
in building new and effective partnerships.
Stakeholder analysis shows there are eight main types of partnerships sustained by UNICEF Moldova:
1) The partnership with the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the line Ministries,
guided by the mechanism of agreed working programmes. This partnership is sustained by
intensive advocacy and technical assistance provided by UNICEF to the governmental
authorities. It is very important to underline that UNICEF is striving to generate systemic change
by encouraging the governmental authorities to develop ownership over the work where
UNICEF support is provided. This is directly ensured when strategies or legal provisions
advocated by UNICEF are adopted by the Government and/or the Parliament. UNICEF made
efforts for ownership development considering other systemic changes, like the evidence-based
decision-making processes and capacity building activities. For example, most of the studies,
methodologies and training curricula developed by UNICEF are published under the logo of the
Ministry in change, as well.
2) The partnership with Local Public Authorities (LPAs) for modelling and pilot projects. The
focus in this type of partnership has been on raising the capacity of these authorities, including
(but not limited to) (a) raising their capacity to organise cross-sectoral multi-disciplinary
cooperation of local institutions to address the needs of the most vulnerable children and (b)
raising their capacity for financing/budgeting the activities for children in a more efficient way.
In this case, creating LPAs ownership for the activities supported by UNICEF, but for which they
are responsible, seems to be less of a focus, but from collected data it is not yet clear whether
this very ownership and the sustainability of results is ensured.
26
3) The partnership with implementing partners from the civil society, implementing activities,
especially providing technical assistance, capacity building activities and services. In this case
UNICEF Moldova uses competitive calls for partners that generated a good combination of long-
term partnerships and new effective partnerships. Most of the long-term partners are kept and
their contribution is highly appreciated, but new partners also proved to be extremely valuable.
For example, a new partnership of UNICEF whit the Association for Participative Criminal Justice
(APCJ) led to piloting (2018-2019) and institutionalisation (since December 2019) of a new
educational probation programme for children and young people in conflict with the law.
4) The support for a nationwide partnership for the rights of the children, through the
support for the National Council for Child Rights Protection (NCCRP) chaired by the Prime
Minister and its Technical Working Groups. With UNICEF support the NCCRP’s Technical
Working Group reviewed 25 draft legal documents and UNICEF convened three regional
roundtables of the District Councils for Child Rights Protection. In anticipation of the next UN
CRC Periodic Review due in 2022, support was provided to NCCRP in scrutinizing CRC
implementation at country level. UNICEF has also compiled the CRC concise concluding
observations and distributed these to the NCCRP and other stakeholders to advocate
implementation and evaluation.
5) The partnership with public institutions with an important technical role in the effectiveness
of the systems and services dedicated to the children (i.e. NBS, the RCPA, the National Probation
Inspectorate). Similar to the LPAs focus in this type of partnership has been in raising their
capacity.
6) The partnership with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and academia, for more effective
advocacy. This group of partners include some of the implementing partners, but also other
organisations and the basis of the partnership relation is necessarily a formal partnership
agreement and does not refer to delivering services or technical assistance, but only to advocacy
activities. Although UNICEF organised national and local events to bring together stakeholders
interested by a specific subject (i.e. UNICEF participate to organizing the Annual National
Conference on Inclusive Education), most of the advocacy work is undertaken in
partnership with current and older implementing partners.
7) UN agencies are allies in advocacy and partners in implementation for several initiatives of
UNICEF Moldova. Among other things, UNCICEF activities in Transnistria are implemented
within the framework of a UN programme with the participation of several UN agencies.
8) Other international organisations are allies in advocacy, donors and partners in
implementation for several initiatives of UNICEF Moldova. For example, the development of the
Youth Friendly Health Centres network in Moldova was supported by several organisations,
including UN agencies (UNEFPA and WHO), the World Bank and the Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation (SDC).
According to the social network analysis based on the survey with the CO staff, the the main institutions
with whom the CO collaborates are: governmental bodies (represented mainly by ministries), UN
agencies, CSOs27 and national agencies and institutes. As the below figure shows, from the institutions
that have been chosen by respondents, the most connections are established between UNICEF CO and
ministries (36%).
27 Such as: CCF, CNTM, Health for Youth association, Nova Association, ODIMM, Probono, Republican Center for Pedagogical
Assistance, TEKEDU.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection from Moldova has been identified most often as an
important partner in the development of COs activities, followed by Ministry of Education and Research.
The importance of the partnership is also visible in the social media activity of the governmental
partners of UNICEF Moldova. The Ministry of Education and Research mentioned its cooperation with
UNICEF 20 times in posts on Facebook in the period October 2020-September 2021. In the field of
education, the Republican Centre for Psycho-pedagogical Assistance, also publishes information about
the partnership with UNICEF on social media. Other important partners that support UNICEF online via
social media are the Institute of Mother and Child, in the field of health, the Ministry of Justice and the
Ombudsman of the Republic of Moldova.
Municipalities are also important partners for UNICEF CO, most nominalized LPAs being Cahul and
Ungheni. The data shows that UN Agencies are key partners in the development of the CO’s work. The
links identified between the CO and UNDP are most frequent. Based on the number of respondents that
have nominated a particular partner institution, a similar type of collaboration, has been observed in
the case of Voinicel Early Intervention Center.
According to UNICEF staff members, the primary benefit of the partnerships is the access to decision
makers (27% of the analyzed case), followed by receiving information for solving problems (26%) and
access to target groups, others than decision makers (18%).

Figure 4. Social Network of UNICEF in Moldova
Source: Data collected through a survey conducted in the Republic of Moldova
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO in Moldova,
the data analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with various connections
between actors in different clusters formed around each department of the CO. The network is not
formed only by clusters of interactions, but that the identified clusters are interconnected through the
connections established between their members.
Data collected show that UNICEF has developed less the partnership with governmental institutions and
civil society organisations in the field of youth and partially in the field of justice for children (where
many partnerships are effective, but the one with the Ministry of Justice is less so).28
Although the partnership with media and the private sector has been planned and small steps have been
made, these types of partnerships are less effective and sustainable at this moment. This may be related
to the level of development of the CSR culture in the Moldovan business community, the gatekeeping
habits of media outlets in the country or to the limited capacity of the CO to manages additional
partnerships while already working with a large range and number of partners, but additional analyses
are needed to fully understand how these new partnerships could be further developed.

impact.

3.2.3. What are the comparative advantages of UNICEF in relation to other actors in
the country, including development partners, the private sector, the non-
government sector and to what extent were they necessary and sufficient for
contributing to the results at scale to be achieved?
UNICEF Moldova used its comparative advantages related to its well-recognised role to uphold
the rights of all children, its technical competences and capacity to provide all partners with
relevant data on the situation of children and children needs, its leadership in communication,
community engagement and advocacy for children rights. These advantages are necessary in
UNICEF work towards its envisaged short-, medium- and long-term results for children in the
country. However, as presented extensively in the section dedicated to impact, these advantages
are not always sufficient to generate impact.
Four perspectives on UNICEF comparative advantage have been identified.
1) From the perspective of the governmental authorities (Ministries), UNICEF is the most reliable
source of information and technical assistance/advice on the situation, needs and
solutions for children. The fact that UNICEF has a very clear mandate and target group, a
clear strategic approach and a proven record of successful technical assistance and
advocacy for key policies for children, makes UNICEF the ‘go-to’ organisation where
governmental authorities (Ministries) are looking for support, ideas or feedback in their work.
Achieved results based on this comparative advantage are related to the development of
national strategic documents (the National Child Protection Programme 2021–2025 and its
Action Plan 2021–2025; the new Education Sector Strategy 2021–2030 and medium-term
Implementation Programme 2021–2025; the National Health Strategy 2020-2030, the National
Immunization Programme 2021-2025; the National Programme on HIV/STI Prevention and
Control 2021-2025; the National Programme on Non-Communicable Diseases 2021-2025) and
the adoption of legal provisions (Law 112/2020, Law 299/2018)
2) From the perspective of the public institutions, other than the government, UNICEF has the
advantage of its strategic, yet focus approach for child rights. In practice this means that UNICEF
is trusted as the best, reliable and constant provider of capacity building, but also as a
facilitator of effective work with other institutions. This is a very important advantage to be
underlined, as the limited inter-institutional cooperation is considered an important bottleneck
for the realisation of child rights in Moldova and UNICEF contributes to the development of
effective cooperation mechanisms for inter-sectoral policies, as early childhood development.
Achieved results based on this comparative advantage are related to capacity building (a
large number of persons trained, the overall development of the institutional capacity for the
realization of child rights in Sîngerei district, etc.) and successful implemented projects that
have been scaled-up and/or institutionalised (i.e. the Association for Participative Criminal
Justice and the National Probation Inspectorate underlined that UNICEF expertise and activities
in the field of justice for children have been instrumental in the piloting and institutionalisation
of the education probation programme, because UNICEF was able to implement synergic
activities that supported the success of the pilot project.).
3) From the perspective of the CSOs and implementing partners, UNICEF is a unique type of
partner, because it also doubles as a donor for many CSOs that lack other type of funding. UNICEF
does not define itself as a donor and it is not perceived by CSOs just as a donor, providing
resources and transferring responsibilities, risk management and consequences to grantees.
UNICEF has comparative advantages in the eyes of CSOs because it is a resourceful,
knowledgeable/expert and adaptable partner. This advantage was very well visible in 2020,
when many activities needed to be adapted and short-term targets needed to be changed in
response to COVID-19 crisis. However, the comparative advantage is not only related to coping
30
with the crisis, but also to the development of pilot projects that have been institutionalised or
scalled-up (as in the case of the youth friendly health services or the educational probation
programme).
4) From the perspective of other development partners, including UN agencies UNCEF has a brand
advantage, is better recognized by the public than most of the other development partners and
has therefore a perceived advantage when conducting communication campaigns and
fundraising for UNICEF projects and the response to the crisis (COVID-19 pandemic).
Moreover, development partners, including UN agencies, identified UNICEF as a less
bureaucratic organisation compared to other UN bodies, which facilitate quick and efficient
response to emerging needs, an advantage that proved instrumental in the context of COVID-19
pandemic.
Overall, UNICEF comparative advantages – related to (a) its normative well recognised role to uphold
the rights of all children, (b) its technical competences and the capacity to provide all partners with
relevant data on the situation of children and children needs, (c) its leadership in communication,
community engagement and advocacy for children rights based on its brand recognition – are necessary
for results for children in Moldova. Interviews and previous evaluations of UNICEF activities show how
these comparative advantages have been used in different contexts to generate the expected results and
the previous paragraphs only present some examples. On the other hand, the evaluation of coherence
and impact show that these comparative advantages can be sufficient to generate impact, and, in some
areas, they have been very well used by the CO. In other areas, external factors, as well as the natural
need for long term interventions are limiting the impact, as presented in the section dedicated to impact.
3.2.4. How has UNICEF’s approach to strategic partnerships changed over time, if
any?
There is no evidence of substantial changes in the approach to strategic partnerships during the
implementation of the current Country Programme (2018-2021) and compared to the previous
programme, by UNICEF Moldova CO, with one exception: the strengthened relation with Local
Public Authorities (LPAs).
UNICEF Moldova started focusing more on the partnership with LPAs, modelling and implementing
pilot projects especially for better cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination, but also stressing on
capacity building of local institutions (subordinated to the Ministries or LPAs), providing direct services
to children. The intention is to perfect these interventions and afterwards to advocate for rolling-out
and scaling-up of the activities by local and national institutions. This approach was in line with the
decentralisation process in the country (and also proved useful in the context of the political instability).
On the other hand, out of the 39 CSOs that have been implementation partners of UNICEF Moldova since
2014, 12 organisations (about one third) are long term partners, with partnership agreements starting
in 2015, 2016 or 2017. 13 organisations (another third of the partners) are new partners for the CO
since 2018 and 2019 and seven organisations are new partners since 2020, most of them involved in
the response to COVID-19 crisis. In the case of the implementation partners the change is not strategic,
the type of partners and the relationship with partners is not changed, but the existing data show that
UNICEF Moldova is open to work with new partners.
31
3.3. Impact
3.3.1. Did UNICEF Moldova contribute to the results at-scale? If yes, how and why did
it make a difference and for whom? If no, why not?
3.3.1.1. Evaluation of UNICEF impact under each Outcome of the Country Programme
UNICEF Moldova contribute to the results at-scale for children, achieving many its expected
results under the two planned outcomes of the Country Programme. Evidence based advocacy,
supported by partners, technical assistances provided to ministries and other central
institutions, as well as the successful scaling-up of some initiatives initially implemented at
community level (for example, in the fields of youth health or inclusive education) are strategies
used to generate the impact. The mechanisms supporting UNICEF success confirm some of the
assumptions of the Theory of Change. However, a large number of bottlenecks and emerging
risks limited UNICEF impact. Most of them have been anticipated and activities to cope with them
have been implemented, but they have been only partly effective.
Positive changes regarding equitable child sensitive systems and services in Moldova (impact of
Programme Outcome 1)
Moldova Country Programme aims at supporting the building of equitable child sensitive systems for
the realisation of all child rights, including the rights to education, health, an adequate standard of living,
and participation. The CPD Theory of Change underlines that “improved intersectoral cooperation in
health, development, education and social protection will support a more comprehensive system of
priority family-focused and child-centred services”. The outcome formulated to reach the objective is:
“by 2022, Moldova National systems and services are more inclusive, able to protect the rights of
children, and respond to the needs of most vulnerable in an equitable way.”
Important progress has been made, especially in the field of inclusive education, access to health,
justice for children, deinstitutionalisation of children in state care and, more recently, social
protection and they are visible in the programme indicators reported by UNICEF Moldova. We
elaborate these progresses and UNICEF’s contribution to them in this section, below. However,
because of several bottlenecks, presented in the following section, the systems and services are
not yet fully able to protect the rights of children, and respond to their needs, as showed by the
data presented below. On the other hand, the situation of the most vulnerable children improved
and, despite the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the perspectives are good.
Impact on access to education
The gross enrolment ratio in pre-primary education increased at 94.2% in 2020, surpassing
UNICEF target, fixed at 88%. This makes Moldova one of the countries with the highest pre-school
enrolment rates among countries in the CEE-CIS region and represents a remarkable achievement
especially because it shows an impact for children despite the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pandemic affected access to school and school participation. Approximately 434,000 students
were affected by school closure, with 16,000 students (5% of total) and 3,000 teachers (11% of total)
without access to ICT technology. The most affected were children in rural areas, coming from poor
households, and having less educated parents. Moreover, over 7,000 children with special education
needs and 1,400 children with disabilities were at a higher risk of being excluded from education.29 This
determined UNICEF to support the initiation of the study on the profile of out-of-school children and
adolescents Statistical data published by the NSB show that the gross enrolment rate in education
continued to rise, despite the pandemic, due to efforts of the Government, UNICEF, partners and other
stakeholders.
29 Information provided by UNICEF ECARO.
32
The results can be associated both with (a) the long term commitment and advocacy of UNICEF for the
improved accessibility, inclusiveness and quality of early childhood education30, and with (b) UNICEF
support for the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research (MECR) and school institutions to cope with
and respond to COVID-1931. UNICEF presented MECR a methodology for organizing education during
quarantine, special regulations for the 2020–2021 school year, guidance on reopening kindergartens
after the peak of the outbreak, students’ and parents’ guides on safe behaviour during COVID-19. All
these supported the education system during the pandemic and contributed to the observed results.
However, Moldova continues to deal with out-of-school rates that are higher than the regional averages
across age groups.32 The lower secondary education completion rate was in 2020 at 84.1%, below the
target for 2020, fixed at 87%. Moreover, PISA tests show that about 50% of students in (lower and
upper) secondary school do not meet a minimum proficiency level. This can explain why the NEET rates
were 27.4% at the end of 2019, compared to the EU average33 of 10.1%. These data indicate that
education does not adequately prepare young people with the skills for professional and social
life fully.
The access to education of the most marginalised and vulnerable children is analysed as the case study on
UNICEF’s impact on inclusive education in Moldova, presented below and in Annex 2. The case study
shows that significant progresses have been made, with UNICEF support, in this specific area and the
share of children with disabilities who attend general educational institutions increased by 10% in the
last years and reached 93% in 2018. However, most of these children do not graduate from school, due
to several bottlenecks including: lack of infrastructure, lack of trained teachers, and the absence of
adapted teaching materials.34
Case study on UNICEF contribution to inclusive education
For the assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of inclusive education a detailed
Process Tracing analysis is presented in the Annex 2. The analysis shows that UNICEF undertook and
supported a large number of activities in the field of inclusive education, and we are highly confident
these activities have short term results for the directly targeted professionals and contributed to
raised capacity of schools and teachers to receive and to work with children with SNE and CwD.
Evidence also shows that UNICEF involvement – advocacy and the constant support for dialogue
among all stakeholders in the field, as well as extensive technical assistance – determined improved
legislation in the field of inclusive education. Existent evaluations assess the legal framework as
sufficient and as representing a good foundation for the integration of all children with SNE and CwD
in mainstream education35.
However, medium term and long -term results are still limited at the level of the legal framework, the
capacity of some of the teaching staff and the integration of children with mild disabilities. Although
UNICEF supported communication campaigns for attitudinal change, they proved to be insufficient
for a significant impact regarding the access to mainstream schools of children with severe disabilities
and a better acceptance of these children at the level of both the general public (especially parents)
and teachers.

33
Existing evidence also shows that children with severe disabilities and children with HIV/AIDS
remain highly discriminated and schools remain largely inaccessible to them.
The most important bottlenecks identified regarding the limited or missing impact are related to:
- difficulties in hiring qualified staff, especially in preschool education, resulting from: the small
number of specialized staff available; the large turnover, especially, of the support teaching
staff; the regulation of the number of support teaching staff depending on the number of
children with SEN, determining instability of employment for the support teaching staff and
lack of motivation to fill the position among the qualified young professionals, low salaries for
the specialized staff;
- lack of digital skills among teachers, but also among support teaching staff;
- insufficient or poor intersectoral cooperation in the education, health and social protection
sectors regarding non-educational support services for CwD, such as personal assistance, but
also the identification and early referral of cases of severe disability. There is a lack of clear
and effective case reporting mechanisms, that should facilitate early interventions in sensitive
periods for the recovery of children with disabilities.
- financial allocations for inclusive education are not calculated on the basis of the number of
children with SEN36 and their individual needs are not taken into account.
Impact on child protection
A significant package of amendments for the national legislation was adopted in 2020 (Law
112/2020) with UNICEF support in technical assistance. All available evidence, including the interviews
with representatives of Moldova Government, support the finding that UNICEF technical assistance was
instrumental in determining the adopted content of the law. The law improves regulation on custody of
children left behind by migrant parents, tutorship/guardianship for children without parental care,
adoption, abduction, legal representation, social services and protection of child victims of violence. The
new legislation will improve the protection of children left behind and without care, as well as the
efficiency of alternative care.
Moreover, Moldova registered important results concerning the deinstitutionalization of children. At
the end of 2019, there were 1100 children in residential institutions, which is 36.6% less compared to
201437. Moreover in 2020, the proportion of new children entering residential institutions was reported
by UNICEF at 2.9% (surpassing the target fixed at 6.4%) and representing an important impact of the
Government and UNICEF work on prevention of institutionalization of children. This work consisted
in the development of community level services, fully supported by UNICEF in selected (pilot)
communities and advocated by UNICEF for scaling-up.
The Mid-term Evaluation of the Implementation of the Child Protection Strategy 2014 – 2020 and Action
Plan, covering the period 2016 – mid of 201938 reports significant increase in the capacity to identify cases
of violence, neglect and abuse of children by developing and strengthening the cross-sectoral
mechanism of combating violence, along with conducting national information and awareness
campaigns for attitude change. This is also visible in UNICEF’s indicators on the number of cases of
violence reported by children through official mechanisms, including the children hotline supported by
UNICEF with technical assistance and administrated by the Moldovan authorities. There is also progress
in the percentage of children victims of violence, neglect and exploitation whose cases have been closed
and UNICEF supported the development of the Barnahus style centre for children victims and witnesses
of crime, contributing, thus, to the results in the area. Thus, UNICEF technical assistance provided to
several Government institutions and services provided by UNICEF and its implementing partner in the
Barnahus style centre for children victims and witnesses of crime are important elements contributing
to the observed changes, as presented in the case study below, dedicated to UNICEF contribution to
justice for children in Moldova.

However, the Light Situation Analysis conducted in 2019, shows that children in Moldova still suffer
from high rates of sexual, physical and emotional violence and limited progress has been achieved
in this field. The legislation if fairly comprehensive, but the institutional and methodological framework
in the field of child protection is “characterized by fragmentation, lack of preventive approach and lack
of overall vision to addressing the VAC across all sectors.”39 The SitAn also concluded that “gender
stereotypes, patriarchal attitudes and associated gender-based discrimination and violence are
prevalent throughout Moldova and gender gap persists.”40 UNICEF Moldova addresses these bottlenecks
in its advocacy, especially in front of the Ministry of Justice and in its communication for development
and behaviour change.
Impact on justice for children
There are undeniable improvements in the legislation and legal practice concerning children in
contact and in conflict with the law in Moldova, including
- changes of the Criminal Code,
- the adoption of a law on children with deviant behaviour providing for services, rather than
restrictive measures,
- the opening of a Barnahus-type centre for children victims and witness of crimes allowing for
their interviewing but also the provision of other needed services,
- the development of a governmental plan to open three regional Barnahus-type centres in the
country,
- the development and quick institutionalization of an educational probation programme for
children and young people. However, much more is needed for visible impact for children in
Moldova.
Data reported by UNICEF and provided by several studies in the field show that some legal amendments
are still needed, and, most importantly, that the attitude and behaviour of professionals in law-
enforcement and the judiciary throwers children need to be substantially improved. The case study
shows the bottlenecks still remaining for the development of a child friendly justice in Moldova are
related with sector specific issues (especially the systemic resistance to change) and to more general
issues, related to social norms, stigma against children affected by violence (either as victims, witnesses
or aggressors) and the social tolerance to violence against children.
For the assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of justice for children, a detailed Process
Tracing analysis is presented in Annex 2.
Case study on UNICEF contribution to justice for children
We find that UNICEF had impact in its initiatives to improve the legislation, but there is limited impact
on the capacity of the law enforcement and the judiciary system and the actual access of most of the
children to improved services in the judiciary.
The analysis shows that UNICEF undertook and supported a large number of activities in the field of
justice for children and these activities have good short term results for the directly targeted children.
Evidence also shows that UNICEF involvement determined improved legislation or prevented the
legal framework (i.e. the law regarding children with deviant behaviour – child offenders under the
legal age for criminal liability) to be adopted without respecting the fundamental rights and interests
of the child. The Ministry of Justice recognises the importance on UNICEF recommendations in
shaping the legislation for children in conflict with the law.
However, medium term and long-term results are still limited at the level of the legal framework, the
capacity of the law enforcement and the judiciary system and the actual access of most of the children
to improved services.

empowerment and participation, 2019

35
The most important bottleneck identified regarding the limited or missing impact are related to:
- the lack of strategic focus on making the judiciary better and friendlier for children. Although
the issue may be taken into account in the future Child Protection Programme, a special
attention of the Ministry of Justice on the issue should have been visible in the strategy for
ensuring independence and integrity in the justice sector;
- the low level of interest of the professionals in law-enforcement and judiciary to participate
in improving the situation of children in contact with the law and in conflict with the law;
- other bottleneck specific to the judiciary system, influencing the resistance to change in the
system.
There is a low interest of the law-enforcement and judiciary specialist for the improvement of services
for children on the findings of the 2018 study measuring the perceptions of judges, prosecutors,
lawyers, police officers and society members towards successful social reintegration of children in
conflict with law and children victims/witnesses of crimes41 The study also explores how respondents
see the factors needed for the social reintegration of children. The specialists mentioned that the
success of reintegration of children in conflict with the law depends on the severity of committed
offense, the psychological profile of the child and the involvement of the family in the child
rehabilitation. Referring to the services for the successful reintegration of child victims and witnesses,
judges have first of all mentioned family counselling, while prosecutors, lawyers and police officers
have stated that psychological counselling for children is required in the first place. How the law-
enforcement and the judiciary are approaching and working with the children seems to be less
important for the interviewed specialists and this opinion explains the low level of interest of the
judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers to participate in improving the situation of children in
contact with the law and in conflict with the law. This also can contribute to the lack of strategic focus
and the low capacity of the system to provide child friendly services.
Impact on maternal, child and adolescents’ health
The national statistics and the indicators reported by UNICEF show progress concerning access to
health services and the health of children in general until 2020, but the larger picture shows
healthcare remains problematic for children and pregnant women in Moldova:
- The number of health providers providing home-visiting services, having adequate skills related
to early detection and intervention for children with developmental risk, delay or disabilities
increased from 8 in 2017 to 26 in 2020 and the number of home visits increased, but only with
about 3% between 2014 and 201942
- The share of births among women aged 10-19 years in the total number of births has decreased
from 4.9% in 2016 to 4.5% in 2019. Also, the share of abortions has decreased from 7.4% in
2014 to 5 7% in 2019.43 Thus, although on a positive trend, the fertility rate among adolescents
remains very high.
- Despite a significant progress in reducing infant and under five mortality rates, both indicators
remain twice higher than in other countries in the region. Generally, the morbidity of children
in the first year of life reveals decreasing trends of incidence of diseases44, but it also remains
higher compared to the region.
- Although the vaccination rates in Moldova are high, the country continues to face a worrying
trend of mistrust in vaccines45.
41 The perception on the social reintegration varies according to the committed offence and the profession of the respondent,
but usually respondents rated high or very high the chances for the successful social reintegration of children victim or
witness of crimes and of children liable for misdemeanors. They rated as about average the chances for the successful social
reintegration of children liable for crimes against property and low or very low the chances for the successful social
reintegration of children liable for violent crimes, murder or sexual criminal assault.

UNICEF contributed to all the observed results for children in the health sector. UNICEF developed the
Child Care and Development Standards that include universal progressive home visiting for children
aged 0-3 and guidelines for nurses on applying universal-progressive home-visiting were developed
with UNICEF approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection. UNICEF also ensured the
procurement of around 1.5 million doses of vaccines per year through UNICEF Supply Division.
Moreover, UNICEF provided trainings to healthcare specialists, rising their capacity to provide quality
services that contributed to the improved results for children at scale, visible in the national statistics.
Unfortunately, 37% of households with children have a lesser access to health services since the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many hospitals were overwhelmed, and families were afraid of
sending children to the doctors/hospitals fearing that they would get infected by the coronavirus.46
The contribution of UNICEF Moldova to the progresses in maternal, child and adolescents’ health is
highly appreciated by stakeholders and includes capacity building activities, especially trainings,
seminars and workshops, technical assistance on standards and tools used by the medical staff and
studies, especially in the area of vaccination, to support improved policies.
Case study on UNICEF contribution in the area of adolescents and youth participation and health
For the assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of adolescents and youth
participation and health, a detailed Process Tracing analysis is presented in the Annex 2. Using
Process Tracing each claim was analysed and, based on the available evidence, the level of confidence
in the claim truthfulness was assessed.
The analysis allows us to be more confident about the addressability of the services and their positive
impact on youth empowerment, but a bit less so about the quality of the services and their coverage,
especially for young people from rural areas.
UNICEF promoted the legal framework and recommended the funding mechanism with the support
of a cost analysis used in the evidence-based advocacy. UNICEF also contributed to a large extent to
communication, designing and providing assistance for the implementation of communication and
outreach campaigns. This increased the addressability (the number of users) of Youth Frienly Health
Centres. UNICEF’s partners implemented activities for capacity building of YFHC to increase their
accessibility.
UNICEF support appears as being instrumental in the promotion of the YFHS and their part in the
‘youth sector ecosystem’ as UNICEF is among the few organisations with capacity and attention to
both (i) adolescents and youth health and (ii) youth empowerment and participation.
Although existing evidence allows a positive and optimistic assessment of youth friendly health
services impact and UNICEF contribution to thesis impact, the most important bottlenecks identified
still need to be taken into account in the future management of youth access to dedicated health
services:
- systemic bottlenecks of the healthcare system, including the traditional (non-transparent)
doctor-patient relationship represents another set of limitations to youth participation and
quality of youth friendly services;
- the large turnover of medical staff affects the sustainability of all capacity building activities;
- tokenism, the meaningless involvement of young people in order to formally check their
participation.
Two main risks, not yet addressed, have been also identified:
- COVID-19 pandemic affected mainly the addressability, but also the accessibility of YFHS in
2020. The risk disengagement of young people and health professionals for the future, caused
by the pandemic, is still present and should be managed with increased outreach, capacity and
quality development and trust building activities.

Moldova, 2020.
37
- The opportunity to improve the financing framework bears a risk of decreasing much needed
funding, in the context of changes at the level of the National Health Insurance Company, that
shows less support to YFHC compared to previous years. Effective advocacy activates can
mitigate this risk.
Impact on social protection
In Moldova, the share of households with children from poorest quintile(s) receiving social payments
(social assistance or child benefits) remains at 29.2%, below the 2020 target established by UNICEF at
40%, despite a slight increase of the proportion of expenditures dedicated to social support services and
benefits for children.47 In this context, UNICEF continued to advocate with Local Public Authorities
(LPAs) to establish community level support services involving day care, family support and family-
based placement services, including a minimum social services package.48
The assessment of COVID-19 impact in Moldova shows that on average, Moldovan households with
children have lost 15% of their income. However, households receiving remittances have experienced a
slightly higher decrease in household income than non-receiving households (-17% vs -13%), as
remittances have fallen by -25% on average. They are, however, more resilient than non-receiving
households49 and even from 2019 UNICEF recommended to increase the weighting of children from 0.5
to 0.75 in the calculation of Social Aid (Ajutor Social) payments to households with children50. The
38ecommendation was followed, according to interviews, by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social
protection (MHLSP) as a mitigation measure to COVID-19, contributing thus to better social protection
for children.
Positive social changes for child rights in Moldova (impact of Programme Outcome 2)
Moldova Country Programme also aims at supporting and advocating for social mobilisation that leads
to social change for the realisation of child rights. The outcome formulated to reach the objective is: “by
2022, Moldovan society has better knowledge about child rights and progressively fulfils its obligations,
effectively supporting social outcomes for children, and the empowerment of the most vulnerable
children and adolescents to claim their rights.” According to the theory of change, to reach the objective
and meet the outcome targets, progress must be made concerning:
- the capacity and skills of duty bearers and childcarers;
- the empowerment and participation of young people;
- institutional capacity, especially for multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary work needed by the
most vulnerable children.
Data show important progress in the realization of child rights in Moldova, including children
with disability (CwD) and young people, showing thus UNICEF impact. However, in most cases
the impact is limited to a small number of communities, where modelling / pilot projects have
been implemented by UNICEF in partnership with LPAs and CSOs or by other organisations. Most
of the analysis available concerning child rights realization in different sectors (health, education, social,
judiciary etc.) show that the lack of cross-sectoral cooperation represents an important bottleneck for
the realization of child right.

Impact on duty bearer’s engagement in child rights, including cross-sectoral cooperation for the
realization of child rights
Overall, we can observe progress concerning duty bearers’ capacities and skills to fulfil their obligations
for realization of child rights in all fields: child protection, education, health, social protection, law-
enforcement and judiciary, but this progress and UNICEF contribution to it is limited. Pilot activities at
local level, implemented by UNICEF in partnership with LPAs and CSOs had results for children in the
targeted communities, especially for CwD and children left behind by migrant parents. However, the
impact of these pilot activities is visible only in the targeted communities.
According to the Mid-term Evaluation of Implementation of the Child Protection Strategy 2014-2020
and its Action Plan for 2016-2020 in the Republic of Moldova, the key areas of intervention in which
progress is still lagging behind refer to:
- strengthening the institutional capacity at the local level to prevent the separation of child
from family;
- coordinating the deinstitutionalization process across the Government;
- developing the specialized services available at the local level (including services for the
aggressors);
- strengthening the monitoring and evaluation capacity both at central and district levels.51
Impact on caregivers’ childcare capacities and skills
The impact concerning caregivers’ capacities and skills was built on the results of the previous Country
Programme. The major provisions of the cross-sectoral Strategy on Positive Parenting, approved by the
Government in 2016 and the core findings of the 2018 Study on Early Childhood Development
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of Parents were used for developing the Program on Modelling of
Parental Educators implemented in five regions of the country, covering 70 preschools.52 As in the case
of duty bearers’ capacity, the capacity of caregivers increased in the targeted communities, where
UNICEF, LPAs and CSOs implemented activities, but the impact is not present at national level.
Although the Strategy on Positive Parenting was adopted – due to UNICEF advocacy and technical
assistance – and activities have been undertaken by the Government, UNICEF and CSOs for its
implementation, the cross-sectoral National Action Plan on Positive Parenting and institutionalization
of parenting interventions into existing systems was not approved due to political instability in Moldova.
This hindered the impact of the strategy at national level.
Impact on empowering adolescents
U-Report shows a considerable increase of the percentage of adolescents who indicate that their views
were taken seriously in decisions made at home, school and in their community: 63% of young people
say they are listened to and taken seriously at home (compared to 34% in 2012), 40% at school (15%
in 2012), 11% in their community (5% in 2012). Progress has been made in the creation of participatory
structures for young people (Students and Youth Councils) and their empowerment in some
communities. However, SitAn 2019 underlines that “Moldova lacks an effective and operative
coordination mechanism for youth legislation, policies and interventions across different sectors and
51 Mid-term Evaluation of Implementation of the Child Protection Strategy 2014-2020 and its Action Plan for 2016-2020 in
the Republic of Moldova, 2019
52 The Program was implemented by CNETIF CSO which carried out over 700 parental education activities. The facilitators of
these activities were 210 parental educators-preschool managers, methodologists, educators and nurses. 140 community
educators and nurses benefitted from on-the-job mentoring.
Moreover, in 2020, online training was organized for 10,474 managerial and didactical staff (81.4% of total) on positive
parenting for early childhood development (ECD) during the pandemic and recovery period.

organisations, while the share of youth expenditures on all levels is largely insignificant. The youth
sector is underappreciated and misunderstood by the influential actors outside the sector.”53
The Comprehensive Youth Sector Analysis conducted in 2020 shows there is an adequate legal and
strategic framework of the youth sector (Youth Strategy, Action Plan and Law). But the youth policy
continues to be approached as a sectoral policy, despite its inter-sectoral character and UNICEF
advocacy. In this context, the analysis highlights that “’youth’ is largely treated as a homogeneous group
without distinguishing specific groups according to age, sex, place of residence, ethnicity, gender
identity”54
This finding is supported by interviews conducted for this evaluation. Overall, available data and
information show that young people have limited access and opportunities to participate in the public
sphere and limited capacity to do so. This is related to:
- the low level of awareness on the importance of children, adolescents and young people
participation to decisions concerning their lives;
- limited and short-term funding from public and private sources available for CSO working with
young people, considering that project-based funding is not appropriate for organising long
term service provision for young people to rise their capacity
- the small number of youth workers trained and poor recognition of professional youth
work/limited attractiveness of the profession
- low involvement / lack of involvement of the education system / schools in activities
encouraging public participation of children, adolescents and young people
- absence of local or district level youth strategies and the overall poor implementation of the
national Youth Strategy
- tokenism and political use of youth activities that are diminishing young peoples’ trust in youth
centres and youth NGOs.
This situation leads to a large number of young people, who are not members of the formal participation
bodies, that are unaware of the possibilities for participation and the bodies existing at the local and
national levels. Moreover, existing data show that the level and quality of youth participation varies very
much between municipalities and districts.55UNICEF Moldova advocated successfully for improved
youth policies, implemented U-Report to allow for a better consultation of young people in policy
development and supported numerous youth engagement and participation activities, in partnership
with youth organisations, including UP-SHIFT. However, the above presented limitations and
bottlenecks persist, and they are not directly taken into account by UNICEF activities. Although activities
directly involving young people and the advocacy for youth policy have direct results, they are not able
to generate increased capacity of the youth sector (youth organisations, youth workers, young centers)
to further outreach and mobilize the participate of vulnerable young people. Moreover, activities
implemented at local level and activities for raising awareness about the importance of child and youth
participation are necessary, but this type of activities have not been implemented enough to generate
the needed systemic change.
3.3.1.2. Conditions and factors influencing the impact of UNICEF’s Country
Programme
Data collected show mostly bottlenecks hindering the impact of UNICEF’s Country Programme in
Moldova. However, the summary of the strategies used by UNICEF Moldova, presented in Annex 1 shows
that the CO also enjoyed some supporting factors:
- Authorities support for cooperation, based especially on external factors (specific to the
country/government):
o long term commitment of the country for human rights;
o the Agreement with EU emphasising the strategic policy development;
53 Light Situation Analysis addressing social inclusion of vulnerable groups, violence against children and youth
empowerment and participation, 2019.
54 Comprehensive Youth Sector Analysis, 2020
55 Ibid.
40
- The quality of cooperation and partnerships, based especially on internal factors (specific
to UNICEF CO):
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with central authorities and the
long term, consistent and perseverant intervention supported in each area of UNICEF
work;
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with LPAs in order to implement
modelling/pilot projects;
o The use of rigorous and competitive partnership selection processes in order to select
implementing partners;
- UNICEF brand recognition in the country, supporting both:
o Effective partnerships and the cooperation with public authorities;
o The effectiveness of communication campaigns.
Figure 5. Summary of mechanisms enabling UNICEF contribution to change for children at scale
The CP ToC is based on a few assumptions about the supporting factors for UNICEF’s impact:
41
- the Government allocates adequate resources
- the Government is able to scale up and institutionalise piloted models
- Stakeholders are interested and committed
- Low resistance to change in social norms
- Youth are confident and express their voices
Most of these assumptions proved to be correct. Despite the constant political change in the country
until 2021, UNICEF enjoyed the Government’s support and some of the piloted models have been
institutionalized. Fund allocation is not always provided, yet, but interviews, UNICEF’s reports and some
government documents show there is work in progress concerning the budgetary allocations.
As underlined, stakeholders’ interest, commitment and participation to UNICEF initiatives, as partners,
is a key supporting factor for UNICEF. Moreover, although not yet visible with concern to all UNICEF
initiative, children and young people are expressing their voices, supporting UNICEF and contributing
to its impact. This is apparent from all the interviews with UNICEF and civil society organisation
representatives and, to a lesser degree, from the interviews with government representatives.
On the other hand, the assumption related to the low resistance to change in social norms proved not to
be correct. The evaluation did not collect enough evidence to explain why this assumption was not well
assessed.
3.3.2. Did UNICEF identify and reassess bottlenecks throughout programme
implementation?
The impact of UNICEF Moldova is hindered by important bottlenecks related to the political and
institutional instability and continuous civil service turnover; the limited capacity for service
provision for the realisation of child rights by the at central and local level; the limited policy
coordination and cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation. Most of these bottlenecks
are systemic and related to the entire public administration, not only to child rights protection
and services, therefore most of UNICEF activities to countering them or coping with them are
only partially successful. Moreover, UNICEF mobilised resources and provided needed
information for decision making in the administration of the COVID-19 generated crisis,
supporting the Government to manage the risk and related bottlenecks.
Bottlenecks and risks are included in the Country Programme documents, with most attention
given in the Strategic Note from March 2017. Critical identified risks are:
- political and economic instability;
- escalation of the internal conflict in the Transnistrian region and/or spill over of the conflict in
Ukraine;
- economic stagnation and, in connection, deepening poverty;
- increased migration (brain drain and the lack of qualified civil servants in connection with the
emigration);
- lack of financing for services for children;
- stagnation of reforms;
- potential environmental emergencies affecting the agricultural sector (a key sector for Moldova
economy);
- lack of data for evidence-based planning and policy making for the realization of child rights.
Risk mitigation measures planned in the Country Programme documents are rather vague:
- flexibility of the programme to shift from policy advocacy to service delivery (incl. in
emergencies);
- effective financial management of resources;
- flexible allocation to most pressing needs;
- investment in innovations – materialized in modelling and pilot projects.
42
Interviews allowed the evaluation team to identify the most important bottlenecks and risks that
affected the Country Programme implementation, in practice. There are three salient bottlenecks: (1)
the political instability; (2) the limited cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation, in connection
with the stagnation of some reforms to improve the situation and (3) the limited capacity for service
provision for the realisation of child rights at central and local level; and two main categories of risks
that seem to have affected UNICEF’s work: (1) the risks related to losing the capacity already developed
because of the high turnover of civil servants and specialists involved in providing services for children
and (2) the risks related to COVID-19.
Therefore, the bottlenecks and risks have been well anticipated, although some of the risks (escalation
of the internal conflict in the Transnistrian region and/or spill over of the conflict in Ukraine and
deepening poverty) did not materialised.
Answering the evaluation question on how UNICEF has been able to respond to the shifts caused
by crisis or major socio-economic and political changes shows how UNICEF delt with the political
instability and the risks related to COVID-19, under section 3.1.4. The implemented strategies and
activities proved to be in line with the mitigation measures planned in the Country Programme
documents, although the initial planning was rather vague and unclear.
For the bottlenecks related to the limited cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation for
the realisation of child rights, there are three types of activities identified in UNICEF’s work:
1) The support for national policy coordination, materialised in:
o the support for the National Council for Child Rights Protection (NCCRP) chaired by the
Prime Minister.
o UNICEF support for a large number of strategic documents targeting children developed
in 2020 and 2021. Because UNICEF is involved in virtually all strategic planning
processes important for children in Moldova, UNICEF involvement itself, as a constant
present advocating for the rights of the most vulnerable children, helps to ensure
national policy coordination.
2) Specific advocacy for legal provisions strengthening cross-sectoral and inter-institutional
cooperation for the realisation of child rights, as in the case of Law 112/2020, Law 299/2018,
the Government Decision on the Framework Regulation on the organization and functioning of
the Regional Centre for Integrated Assistance to Child Victims / Witnesses of Crime and
Minimum Quality Standards etc.)
3) Modelling and pilot projects implemented in partnership with Local Public Authorities
aiming at testing new methods and tools to support better cooperation. In this case, the impact
of the strategy needs to be further documented, but results at local level are positive.
On the other hand, there is a strong connection between the bottlenecks related to limited
capacity for service provision and the risks related to the high turnover of human resources
beneficiaries of capacity building activities. Several stakeholders stated that any capacity building
activity ‘is doomed to be the work of Sisyphus’ because better competences generate increase
motivation for emigration of professionals working with children, as they increase their chances for
successful integration on another labour market.
In this case there was no clear strategy of UNICEF to deal with the respective bottlenecks and
risks. However, several partial strategies have been identified as successful:
- providing trainings of trainers and working with a pool of trainers at national level to be able to
roll-out and replicate trainings where needed (as in the case of the initiative promoting inclusive
education in kindergartens);
- providing first and foremost a well-designed curriculum and training materials that allow for
training replication when needed (as in the case of the curricula for Medical University, Medical
College and National Centre for Continuous Medical Education of Nurses that include home-
visiting modules);
- using online training tools and methods, ensuring that the training is available for new staff
whenever needed to the same level of quality as initially delivered (as in the case of the training
for probation officers).
43
3.3.3. Did different groups, including children and the most marginalised, benefit in
different ways from the Country Programme?
Data and information collected shows that UNICEF Country Programme in Moldova and the
implementation work of the CO took into account differences between children and the needs of
the most marginalised to a large extent. However, some groups of vulnerable children benefited
less from the work of UNICEF. The table below represents a summary of the vulnerable and
marginalised children benefiting from the Country Programme and those ‘left behind’.

3.3.4. Are the results likely to be maintained over time?
There is a general agreement among stakeholders that achieved results of UNICEF’s Country
Programme are sustainable. This is supported by the conclusions of most studies and
evaluations in specific areas (education, health, youth etc.).
However, the sustainability is affected by the significant risks generated by COVID-19 pandemic
and the related economic and social impact for the most vulnerable. We did not identify other important
risks for the sustainability of the Country Programme results. For all areas of impact identified the trend
was positive until 2020, allowing for high confidence that results will be sustained. Concerning the
impact of COVID-19, the extent of this risk for the future remains to be measured, but the
consistent work of UNICEF in close cooperation with the Government and LPA to respond to the
COVID-19 crisis allows for cautions optimism related to the sustainability of obtained results
beyond 2021.
3.3.5. Which strategies or group of strategies were effective in producing results at
scale?
The impact assessment and case studies show that the CO utilised a wide range of strategies, as
described in UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2022 and all of them proved to be effective, especially
when combined.
The summary of the strategies used by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan is presented in Annex 1 The change
strategies most often used are:
- Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children, especially by
influencing domestic planning, financing and the delivery of services for children, using, as a
rule, two main tools:
o technical assistance support provided to key institutions (and duty bearers), for
example the National Council for Child Rights Protection, the Republican Centre for
Psycho-pedagogical Assistance, healthcare providers.
o the help and cooperation of implementing partners.
- Using the power of evidence to drive change for children by providing evaluation and
research in policy making and/or by advocating for improvements in the state statistical system
so that more data about child well-being can be used for better adapted policy plans and
measures.
The development of the National Child Protection Programme 2021–2025 and its Action Plan
2021–2025, the new Education Sector Strategy 2021–2030 and medium-term Implementation

Programme 2021-2025, the National Programme on HIV/STI Prevention and Control 2021-
2025, the National Programme on Non-Communicable Diseases 2021-2025 are based on this
strategy, as well as the drafting and adoption of Law 299/2018 or Law 112/2020.
- Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children by promoting modelling
or pilot projects, most often in partnership with Local Public Authorities and local implementing
partners.
One of the most important models is the one of cross-sector engagement in children’s issues at
local level, further supported in the District of Sîngerei, initiated before 2018. Several other
piloting projects have been initiated at local level and started generating results for children in
the selected communities (e.i.: Strengthened Gender Action in Cahul and Ungheni districts, also
known as the EVA Project, the ECD centres piloted in Sîngerei and Călărași districts etc.)
Moreover, at national level, in the area of justice for children, pilot initiatives have been
supported for children victims and witnesses of crime (Barnahus-type centres) and for children
in conflict with the law (the educational probation programme) and both initiatives have been
successfully institutionalized within the judiciary.
48
- Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public
through communication for development and behaviour change, but also through advocacy
activities and trainings with a twofold objective: developing competences/capacities and
influencing attitudes and behaviours, among duty bearers, caregivers, but also among children
and adolescents.
The case studies conducted using process tracing allow for a limited analysis of the effectiveness of
strategies and combination of strategies used, as presented in the table below.

Four main lessons can be learned from the three cases:
- Innovative approach, based on modelling/piloting projects can be successfully scaled up
if/when followed by intensive support for institutional development.
- Adopting strategic and legal provisions is key for the change and, in some areas, the advocacy is
an indispensable step for further change. However, this evidence-based advocacy is not
generating change for children at scale directly, because most of the existing bottlenecks are not
legal, but institutional and related to practice.
49
- Therefore, developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for institutional change in the
interest of the child is a key strategy for effective contributions by UNICEF.
- The strategy of winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider
public needs to (almost) always be applied, using separate tools, targeting both the decision-
makers and specialist and the wider public. Generating the demand for quality services for
children, adolescents and young people, caregivers and the general public is a key step in
changing social norms and generating sustainable impact for children.

4. Conclusions, lessons learned and forward-looking
recommendations
4.1. Conclusions
The Country Programme 2018-2022 has been implemented, until 2021, under challenging conditions
determined by the complex needs of children in Moldova, the institutional and political instability that
affected the country since 2013, the restrictions and effects of COVID-19 pandemic. This context remains
sensitive and unpredictable, and UNICEF Moldova needs to take it into consideration when planning for
the future.
UNICEF capacity to address children long-lasting and changing needs
The evaluation shows that UNICEF Moldova has successfully addressed most of the important pressing
needs of the children in the country, especially the vulnerable children, and supported policy and
institutional development for the benefit of these children. The programme of UNICEF Moldova and the
advocacy activities addressed the needs of children victims of violence neglect and exploitation
(especially in Chișinău and its metropolitan area, about one quarter of the Moldavian population),
children with special educational needs and with disabilities, children in residential institutions,
children in conflict with the law and in probation programmes, pregnant adolescents and young
mothers, pregnant women and children with HIV/AIDS, most at risk adolescents and especially
vulnerable adolescents (MARA and EVA), children from poor households.
Data analysis and research role in UNICEF work is essential for two key reasons. On one hand, data
analysis and research inform UNICEF CO on the needs of the children and the effectiveness of existing
measures addressing these needs, as well as supports the CO in making decisions (during programme
planning and implementation) related to priorities and effective strategies. On the other hand, evidence
generation is the most important tool used for advocacy in the dialogue between UNICEF and the
Government of the Republic of Moldova. These reports are very effective in guiding UNICEF towards
designing and implementing interventions addressing the most vulnerable children, thus focusing their
work on most pressing needs.
However, the evidence-based advocacy needs to be complemented by other strategies in order to
improve policies and the realization of children rights in Moldova. The most important complementary
strategy to evidence-based advocacy is the work with partners. Therefore, the ability of UNICEF to
leverage different partners advantages is essential for advocacy and the impact for children at scale due
to improved policies.
On the other hand, despite good identification of needs, there is a small number of groups of vulnerable
and marginalised children less covered by UNICEF work: Roma children (especially girls), homeless
children, children with severe disabilities. In these cases, the lack of impact on these groups of
vulnerable and marginalised children is generated by the lack or limited number of UNICEF activities
targeting them directly. Groups of vulnerable children covered only within the limits of modelling
projects are: children from rural areas and municipalities with low capacity to implement prevention
mechanisms, children victims or witness to crime with no access to regional centres in Chișinău and
Bălți. This limited impact of UNICEF concerning these groups of children is directly linked with the
lessons learned concerning the impact of locally implemented pilot or modelling projects (presented
below).
UNICEF contribution to gender equality and addressing social norms contrary to gender equality and
other child rights
A special note needs to be made concerning UNICEF relevance and impact in addressing gender equality.
UNICEF Moldova exhibits many good practices for the integration of gender equality in its activities in
the area of health and youth empowerment and engagement could be transferred to other Country
Offices. Still, moving towards achieving the gender transformative approaches there is a need to focus
more on addressing persistent intersectionality or compounded discrimination/inequalities especially
gender-ethnicity, gender-place of residence, gender-disability and the gender dimension of justice for
51
children. For example, gender stereotypes are stronger in rural61 areas and the limitations in accessing
tertiary education and other services makes girls in rural areas particularly vulnerable, there is no
specific programme component or project targeting girls in rural areas. Roma girls are also particularly
vulnerable according to studies, with limited clear data available on the gender-ethnicity intersection,
but there are very few initiatives of UNICEF Moldova targeting Roma girls with tailored measures,
starting with better data collection.
UNICEF work with partners
UNICEF Moldova works effectively with a range of different partners to make change for children and
their families in the country and successfully used its comparative advantages related to its expertise,
strategic focus and adaptability to build and sustain effective partnership for children rights and well-
being with the Government of the Republic of Moldova, other key public institutions at central level (like
the Ombudsperson for the Rights of the Child) and at local level, international organisations and
partners and civil society organisations.
The Country Office kept its partnerships, with public institutions and CSOs, during the constant
political changes and was also successful in building new and effective partnerships and in
integrating them in a strong network of support for advocacy, communication for development and
system strengthening activities. In this context, the authorities’ commitment for human rights and
openness to cooperation with UNICEF, despite the frequent changes of government, was an important
factor supporting UNICEF results. Moreover, the quality of cooperation and partnerships built by
UNICEF CO, as we concluded when presenting the assessment under the coherence evaluation criterion,
was very important in supporting the impact of UNICEF Country Programme.
Thus, the evaluation shows that UNICEF work with partners is very important and valuable. However,
except for the partnership with the Government, the work with the other partners is not included in the
CPD as a strategic element. Taking into account the value of the partnership, an explicit integration of
the strategic approach to partnerships in the Country Programme Document and the theory of change
of the programme is advisable and a recommendation concerning it is included in this evaluation. In the
current programming period the partnerships with the EU, GPE Secretariat, USAID, ADA, UNDP, UNW,
UNFPA, international NGOs are mentioned in the Strategy Note and this supports UNICEF work with
and for a large number of children in the country, including the most vulnerable
UNICEF impact and limitations
In this context, in most of the areas where UNICEF Moldova works, available evidence shows important
progress in the realization of child rights in Moldova. The most important results for children of UNICEF
and of the Government of the Republic of Moldova with UNICEF support are: the adoption of important
legal provisions strengthening the legal framework ensuring child rights (Law 112/2020); improved
impact of child benefits and Social Aid on child poverty; improved gross enrolment ratio in pre-primary
education; increased proportion of vulnerable pregnant mothers using social protection mechanisms;
increased number of CwD supported through cross-sectoral coordination mechanism in targeted
districts; considerable increase of the percentage of adolescents who indicate that their views were
taken seriously in decisions made at home, school and in their community (from U-Report); increased
addressability to Youth Friendly Health Services; increased availability of better services for children in
contact and in conflict with the law. Limited, but positive results have been achieved concerning the
improvements in the legislation and legal practice concerning children in contact and in conflict with
the law in Moldova and the percentage of caregivers who accept children with disabilities in regular pre-
schools and schools.
UNICEF Moldova made important contributions to the progress observed and presented,
representing positive changes in the life of children at scale in Moldova. A comprehensive account

of UNICEF contribution to the reported impact is presented in Annex 1 and specific detailed examples
are analysed as part of the process tracing case studies for three areas: (1) inclusive education, (2)
justice for children and (3) adolescents and youth participation and health. The case studies are briefly
summarised below in this report section and presented in detail in Annex 2.
For all outputs envisaged by the Country Programme, UNICEF strategies that generated an impact for
institutional change are:
- advocacy for policy development and change regarding national strategies and the legal
framework
- technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services: the National Council for
Child Rights Protection, the Ombudsperson for Child Rights, the Ministry of Education, Culture
and Research, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection etc.
- support for training of the duty bearers in the fields of education, health, law-enforcement and
judiciary, child protection, including training for decision and local policy makers in the LPA.
At local level, in selected districts and municipalities, where modelling and pilot projects have been
implemented, namely in Sîngerei and Cișinău (and to a lesser extent Călărași, Criuleni and Rîșcani), a
more significant impact was generated in the fields of inclusive and quality education,
multidisciplinary/cross-sectoral work, especially for early childhood development and early
intervention for children with disabilities, but also in respect to general improvements in the LPA
approach to child and social protection and financing these areas. Recently, UNICEF started working in
Cahul and Ungheni (within the project EU4Moldova Focal Regions, financed by EU) and a similar impact
is expected in these regions as well.
To a certain extent, UNICEF also contributed to behavioural changes of duty bearers, caregivers
(parents) and the general public. In the case of duty bearers, this contribution to behavioural changes
was possible only due to the large number of trainings and events (seminars, workshops, round tables,
and conferences) organised by UNICEF, and in this respect advocacy and communication for behaviour
change had a synergic impact.
However, in many sectors social norms are still not favorable to child rights, like in the case of
integration of children with disabilities in mainstream education or the reintegration of young people
in conflict with the law, the attitude of professionals and the wider public remains detrimental to
systemic change.
UNICEF response to COVID-19
UNICEF continued to pay attention to the needs of children in Moldova during the Country Programme
implementation in 2020 and 2021, when the focus partly was shifted to understanding the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Answering the challenges of COVID-19 and its effects, UNICEF Moldova
mobilised fast to support the Government to ensure basic safety to front-line workers. Stakeholders
appreciated as instrumental and undoubtedly impactful UNICEF contribution to the response to COVID-
19.
Moreover, although the COVID-19 outbreak demanded a change in strategy from advocacy to services
and equipment provision, UNICEF continued its advocacy and capacity building activities, in order
to ensure an effective and sustainable response form the key respondent institutions. Therefore, specific
technical assistance and capacity building activities have been also implemented in the field of child
protection, education, health, immunization and ECD. In this context, UNICEF’s results under the
Country Programme are sustainable, but significant sustainability risks are still generated by
COVID-19 pandemic.
4.2. Lessons learned
The impact of UNICEF Moldova is hindered by important horizontal bottlenecks and risks,
identified by the CO and stakeholders: (a) the political and institutional instability, (b) the limited cross-
sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation, (c) the limited capacity for service provision for the
realisation of child rights at central and local level, (d) the continuous loss of institutional capacity
53
already developed because of the high turnover of civil servants and specialist involved in providing
services for children.
One of the key lessons learned is that adopting strategic and legal provisions is key for the change
and, in some areas, the advocacy is an indispensable step for further change. However, this
evidence-based advocacy is not directly generating change for children at scale, because most of
the existing bottlenecks are not legal, but institutional and related to practice. Moreover, an
important lesson learned is that sector specific bottlenecks are also important limitations for the impact
at national scale, for all vulnerable children in the country. Among these sectorial bottlenecks: the
systemic problems of the healthcare system (including general quality issues in healthcare institutions
and the corruption, limiting access to healthcare services for the vulnerable and marginalized children),
systemic problems of the judiciary (including effective limitation of judiciary independence and
resistance to change in the system).
Another lesson learned in connection with the institutional and practical bottlenecks, hindering UNICEF
impact, is the importance of ensuring budgeting mechanisms for all policies proposed or
reformed. Usually, a policy is advocated and it is often piloted or modelled before scaling-up. Results
from pilot or modelling activities are used in the advocacy for scaling up. This is the case in the work of
UNICEF Moldova concerning inclusive education or the Barnahus type centres for children in contact
with the judiciary. However, budget limitations can represent one of the causes for limited capacity at
local level for policy implementation and it is often both an issue related to the political will and the
technical budgetary planning mechanisms. These latter mechanisms need to be addressed form the
beginning, as in was successfully done in the case of youth friendly health services.
On the other hand, political instability and the multiple central government reforms made advocacy for
national policies a complicated and slow endeavour. In this context, UNICEF Moldova developed
partnerships with local public authorities. It focussed on addressing multiple bottlenecks identified at
local level, including the alienation of local governments from decision-making processes, various
misconceptions about the decentralization process and limited understanding by local public
authorities of public finance mechanisms. Several local initiatives have been implemented and their
results and lessons organised for advocacy with the key message that sub-national decision-
making arena is a critical point of change, and local governments need enhanced communication on
the benefits of decentralization, as well as increased attention to their capacity-building needs. Political
stabilization since the beginning of 2021 brings the opportunity to obtain results in national
reforms addressing the bottlenecks identified at local level and valorising UNICEF experience in
working with local public authorities since 2018.
Considering the political and institutional instability in Moldova between 2013 and 2019, a key
role in the success of UNICEF was cooperating with the government’s middle management
(Heads of Directorates positions in line Ministries) and of the institutions like the Republican
Centre for Psycho-pedagogical Assistance, the National Bureau of Statistics, the National Probation
Inspectorate. UNICEF CO learned that the government’s middle-management staff can substantially
mitigate the adverse impact of high political turmoil on country office programme implementation and
can generate a form of consensus, especially when it concerns activities which are less politically
sensitive, related to institutional and staff capacity building or new uncontroversial programmes.
4.3. Recommendations
The recommendations apply to the overall strategy, thematic focus and balance of the programme. The
aim is to propose an appropriate continuation and development based on the partnerships, teamwork
and results of the 2018–2022 Country Programme – taking into account the challenges encountered.
All recommendations are addressed to UNICEF CO in Moldova and have been discussed with the
CO team in October 2021.
54
Recommendation 1. To ensure impact and sustainability of pilot and modeling projects, for the
current and future projects implemented at local level a clear exit strategy needs to be
developed. In the case of future projects, the exit strategy should be developed in the planning
stage of the intervention and together with partners.
The evaluation shows that sector specific bottlenecks (e.g., in the health sector or in the judiciary) and
the limited capacity of institutions at local level represent the most important limitations to scaling-up
UNICEF models successfully, sustainably and with national impact. Therefore, UNICEF should use exit
strategies aiming at generating scaling-up nationally for the successful pilot or modelling projects. These
strategies should include:
- a more thorough analysis of sector specific bottlenecks (for example in healthcare, education,
judiciary, public administration);
- addressing bottlenecks related to institutional capacity and resources at national level and in all
municipalities (not only in selected municipalities and districts) advocating for building
activities, implemented by public institutions, targeting front-line professionals (educators,
teachers, social assistants, health professionals) and parents/caregivers;
- addressing budgeting from the beginning of each model, following the good practice in the case
of youth friendly health services and involving the Ministry of Finance as much as possible;
- gaining support from partners on models, including other UN agencies, international
organisations/development partners and civil society to enhance the impact of advocacy and to
contribute to the larger task of supporting institutional strengthening at local level, but at
national scale;
- documenting and evaluating the pilot or monitored projects, as well as advocacy strategies to
use and present the collected evidence and conclusions to the government.
The exit strategies need to be flexible and adapted if political and institutional changes require
modifications of the plan for scaling-up.
Recommendation 2. Gender should be mainstreamed in all sectors of UNICEF work, ensuring that
gender-transformative actions are planned and implemented, especially in the case of intersectoral
vulnerabilities.
The CO should fully consider the recommendations from the Gender Programmatic Review conducted
in 2021.
Specific gender needs and vulnerabilities of girls and women should be taken into account and, in this
context, gender responsive actions should be planned targeting groups that have not been in the
primary focus of UNICEF Moldova in the previous programme. Specific issues to be taken into account
include the intersection of gender with other vulnerabilities:
- The participation to education (beyond primary education) of Roma girls;
- The risk of child marriage in traditional communities (especially Roma communities, but not
exclusively);
- Protecting and addressing specific needs of girls and young women victims of crime, including
girls and young women victims of violence, exploitation and traffic;
- Pregnant women from poor families and rural areas, far from urban established youth friendly
healthcare services.
Recommendation 3. The future Country Programme should include both humanitarian and
policy development elements addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 pandemic on
children, given the risks to sustainability generated by the pandemic and its social and economic effects.
The capacity of the CO to mobilise in emergency situations should be strengthened and embedded in the
Country Programme.
The evaluation was not focused on the long-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children, but
available information show that COVID-19 pandemic can generate negative effects related to: increased
55
risk of poverty (generated by lost employment of care givers), quality of learning (generated by
improperly implemented on-line schooling), increased health risk among vulnerable children, suffering
from chronic illnesses and that had limited access to health care during the pandemic.
Policies advocated in response to the new needs should take into account good practices experienced in
other countries or at local level in ensuring improved quality of learning and access to education,
developing more equitable learning outcomes, and enhancing the access to social protection. Moreover,
engaging partners and developing strategies to leverage resources for children affected by the changes
generate by COVID-19 pandemic should be integrated in the future strategies, based on good results of
partnership engagement form the current country programme implementation.
Recommendation 4. Finalizing and adopting the advocacy and partnership strategy, articulating
the strategic value of partnership for each group of organizations (UN agencies, the EU, other
international organization, the civil society).
Partnerships proved instrumental in ensuring the success of the other strategies employed and lessons
learned from previous challenges show that partnerships support UNICEF impact on policies for
children and the most impactful activities are implemented in partnership. Planning partnerships in a
long-term strategic way is, therefore, important to maintain UNICEF coherence and impact.
Recommendation 5. To address the needs of children with multiple vulnerabilities, advocacy and
technical assistance is needed to strengthen integrated social responses and services, connecting
different sectors that need to work together to ensure children access to basic and specialised services.
The evaluation shows that UNICEF work was less impactful for children with multiple vulnerabilities,
and this is closely related to the persistent bottleneck related to limited cross-sectoral and inter-
institutional cooperation and the limited capacity for social service provision at local level.
The sectoral and cross-sectoral practice at local level can only be achieved if clear processes enable
effective collaboration between professionals and services, across social protection, health and
education sectors. Moreover, evidence confirmed capacity gaps in the provision of social services at the
local level. The sectoral and cross-sectoral practice at local level can only be achieved if social protection
and social work is playing its role and, at the moment, this role is not clear enough for the local public
authorities, other duty bearers and the caregivers (that should be able address their needs to social
workers). Moreover, evidence show there is not enough capacity for service provision at local level.
This recommendation should be taken into account together with recommendation no. 2.
Recommendation 6. To address the limited impact of youth participation initiatives, UNICEF
Country Office should develop initiatives supporting wide children and young people’s
participation to decision making.
The initiatives regarding policies, programmes and services should include raising awareness among
the young people and the adults on the importance of youth participation in all spheres and sectors;
education young people and adults (through parenting trainings) on the participation opportunities;
develop new participation platforms and opportunities; continue building capacities of youth workers;
strengthening the participatory mechanisms at all levels of decision-making and paying special
attention to feedback mechanisms and outreach to youth with diverse backgrounds; strengthening the
tools for participatory monitoring, revision and evaluation programmes and budgets for youth.
56
Recommendation 7. Continue and strengthen the evidence based innovative and diverse
approaches in Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC). This
recommendation is formulated considering the significant importance of social norms as hindering
factors for the promotion of child rights in all communities and families. UNICEF focus should include
capacity building for partners and state authorities to ensure systematic approach shifting from stand-
alone donor-driven campaigns; evidence generation and social listening to inform C4D and C4BC
strategies, interventions and messages; digital engagement, engagement of young people; as well as
social mobilization and community engagement to contribute to knowledge building, uptake and
demand of quality services, and changing harmful behaviours and social norms.
Recommendation 8. Introduce new internal monitoring tools to trace more clearly the change
pathways from UNICEF activities to results for children. This will help UNICEF to better
understand how results are generated and will support future impact evaluations.
Conducting Process Tracing analysis for this evaluation proved challenging, given the need to analyse a
large body of evidence about the way in which UNICEF activities led to results: changed legislation,
increased institutional capacity etc. Documenting the path from research and its conclusions and
recommendations, to government policy decisions, including by keeping records of advocacy meetings
and events, commitments made and draft policy documents will contribute to more effective learning
from experience in future evaluations, showing what activities and strategies are more effective in
determining policy change. Improving the registration of institutional memory and tracing advocacy
activities (events, meetings with decision and policy makers and partners, the implementation of
communication campaigns) in connection with policy decisions, declarations on policies or institutional
changes could also allow for a better understanding of how policy change is happening.
Moreover, a consistent approach to trainings (for example using pre and post testing) and other capacity
building activities targeting service providers, social workers or civil servants may help connecting the
capacity building activities with observable institutional changes and will help UNICEF identify the pest
strategies and methods for capacity building.

5. Annexes
Annex 1. Summary analysis of UNICEF Moldova impact
The table below is mainly based on the reports of UNICEF Moldova CO.62
Note on the assessment of UNICEF impact based on the outcome and output indicators in the Country Programme Document:
Although most of the indicators analysed are – according to UNICEF denomination – output indicators, they are not only measuring direct results of each activity conducted by UNICEF.
They also potentially show short term changes with direct relevance for children at scale, either referring to the situation of children, changes in public perception, attitude or behaviour
or systemic changes that enable institutions to fulfil better their role in providing services for children and protecting their rights.
Indicators in the table are marked on their relevance for the assessment of effectiveness or impact. And when impact can be measured, the type of impact is identified as: (1) better access
to services/direct improvement of the situation of children, (2) behavioural and attitudes change; (3) institutional change (including institutional capacity raised); (4) change in policy
(including strategies, plans, laws, legislation of other nature/level); (5) improvement of financing for children
Strategies identified in the table are a simplified presentation of UNICEF Strategies as in the schema below.

Annex 2. Process Tracing – Case Studies
Methodology
Process Tracing is a theory-based evaluation method. It questions why and how change happens by
tracking evidence of each link in the causal chain. Therefore, it is suitable for the evaluation of
effectiveness and impact and, partially, the relevance as part of causal chain in the Theory of Change.
This method as a qualitative approach through ex-post design where there is no control group available. It is
distinguishable from other more commonly used approaches of evaluation because it focuses on increasing
our level of confidence in a causal story rather than trying to measure impact and attribute it to a particular
event. It rests on the belief that all processes, if correctly identified and specified, would show empirical
manifestations that if observed would increase our confidence on its existence.
The method includes assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and
evidence of how and why an effect occurred.
Assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and evidence can be subjective,
within the limit of the existing evidence. On the other hand, the entire process tracing analysis is transparent:
the evidence determining the probabilities assigned are presented to all readers of the report and this allows
stakeholders to understand the impact and contribution of UNICEF beyond the numbers related to the
evaluators own (subjective) assessment.
The impact case studies about UNICEF contribution on three selected areas – (a) adolescents and youth
participation and health; (b) inclusive education; (c) justice for children – are based on Process Tracing.
The reports sections dedicated to the impact case studies is structured according to the steps that a PT
evaluation needs to follow, explaining briefly in each sub-section what the evaluation team did,
following the six steps of Bayesian Updating in Evaluation set out by Befani (2019): 1) formulating a
contribution claim; 2) establish a prior level of confidence in it; 3) focus on one specific piece of evidence
at a time; 4) estimate the sensitivity of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the
question: If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?); 5) estimate the type I error
of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the question: If the claim is false, how
likely would we expect to see the evidence?); 6) Update of the prior into the posterior using the Bayes
formula.
The contribution claims have been formulated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and updated
based on the feedback from UNICEF Moldova Country Office (CO), before data collection through
interviews. The prior level of confidence is established conventionally at 0.5.
The evidence used was collected from documents provided by UNICEF and the implementation partners
for each of the three selected areas mentioned above and from interviews. Prior to the interviews, the
evaluation team sent a list of the types of documents required to UNICEF CO and received the most
important documents. Interviews have been also used to collect evidences and documents. Interviews
are not considered independent evidence because the people interviewed know each other and have
been working together, sometimes for several years. This would make them more likely to have a
common discourse about the analysed subject. Even though complete independence is not assumed, the
interviews of public authorities and civil society organisations about UNICEF’s contribution, its relative
importance compared to other stakeholders, its reputation and their trust in the organization are
considered important evidences when documents are missing, also considering that evidences on
reputation and trust are traditionally based on stakeholders’ contributions to the evaluation.
More iterations between the data collection and the analysis of the evidence can increase the possibility
of obtaining more supporting evidence and minimize issues arising from absence of evidence. However,
in practice, this process may increase the time and cost of the evaluation. For this evaluation, only one
iteration of data collection and analysis was possible, due to time constraints.

Assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of adolescents and youth
participation and health
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Moldova contribution in a selected
area of impact, namely the participation and health of adolescents and youth. As underlined in the
section dedicated to the methodology, we will present the change claim chain, as elaborated in the
Inception Phase of the evaluation and immediately after. We will than present and analyse each claim in
the logical chain presented and assess the level of confidence for each claim and globally.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain (each
claim numbered separately):
(1) UNICEF provided initial support and a performance-based budgeting framework for the Youth Friendly
Health Centres (YFHC) in Moldova, based on the result of a modelling/pilot project and (2) contributed to
the raising the capacity of health professionals to use youth friendly approaches in their work. As a result,
(3) the funds allocated by the national health insurance fund to YFHC increased substantially in a
sustainable manner, (4) as well as the quality of their services and their coverage of adolescent boys and
girls with youth friendly health services (YFHS). (5) UNICEF also contributed to the awareness raising on
health issued among young people. The progresses in capacity of the YFHC and the health awareness of
young people are leading to (6) an increased number of young people accessing youth friendly services
deliver by Youth Centres (or Youth Klinics – YK) and (7) feeling that they are listened / their opinions matter
when they receive health services.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study is
presented below.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided initial support and a performance-based budgeting framework for the Youth
Friendly Health Centres (YFHC) in Moldova, based on the result of a modelling/pilot project
a) Evidence
The evidence based on programme documents and reports provided by UNICEF and Neovita Centre
shows that the establishment of the YFHS programme has been a gradual process, which began in 2002
with the creation of three pilot centres promoted in Moldova by UNICEF. This was followed by further
capacity building and the founding of the first ten YFHCs in 2005. In 2007, these centres were integrated
into the national healthcare system as part of primary health care (PHC). In 2008, a major success was
achieved when the National Health Insurance Company (NHIC) started to reimburse YFHS.
In 2002, UNICEF Moldova in collaboration with the Râșcani Territorial Medical Association and the
Chisinau LPA established the “Health for Youth” Association, which opened the Neovita Centre, one of
the first YFHC. Since 2007, the Neovita Centre has been integrated into the public health system and
functions as a resource centre for the network of youth-friendly health services.
In 2011, UNICEF initiated a process to scale-up YFHS to the national level in close partnership with
Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection (MHLSP), National Resource Centre Neovita, Institute
of Mother and Child Health / National Centre of Reproductive Health and Health for Youth NGO and
funding from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Currently, the youth-friendly
health services include 41 youth centres located in 35 districts. The Ministry of Health have been
supported by several international agencies, including UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank, SDC and WHO.
The project implementation was informed by studies conducted by National and International agencies
(UNICEF, WHO, Neovita YFHS Resource Centre, National Agency for Public Health etc), e.g. Healthy
Behaviours among School aged Children (HBSC 2014), Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE 2017),
Survey on Prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors in Republic of Moldova (STEPS survey
2013), UNICEF Multi-country Study on Parenting of Adolescents (2017), Study on caregivers and
adolescents’ perception and knowledge on parenting supported by UNICEF Moldova (2017) etc.
All these studies are publicly available and are heavily contributing to building the confidence that
UNICEF provided instrumental initial support for the development of the YFHC network.
In 2018 the Government initiated the piloting of performance-based financing (PBF) for youth-friendly
health services, developed with UNICEF Moldova support. UNICEF provided a handout documentation
planning the pilot and providing the general guidance for the improved financing formula. Quantitative
and qualitative indicators, comprising equity bonuses for underrepresented groups, and monitoring
tools for the health services were approved. Gender dimensions focused on attracting boys to youth-
friendly health services, as 70% of YFHC at that moment were girls. The pilot of the PBF mechanism was
tested by Neovita at four of the services. The lessons learnt from the pilot were designed to inform
decision-makers on further implementation of national level performance-based financing. Both the
pilot design and the results of the pilot have been provided by UNCICEF to support the claim.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.9. The evaluators can be highly confident that UNICEF played an important role in the
development of YGHCs and enabled the government to apply performance-based financing (PBF), at
least for the pilot in 2018 and 2018 of the performance indicators. Documents provided by UNICEF and
Neovita Centre and all interviews with stakeholders in the field of health in Moldova underlined the
critical importance of UNICEF contribution in the creation, scaling-up and capacity building of YFHC. For
the pilot on performance-based financing (PBF), the plans provided by UNICEF and a resulting
normative framework (Order no. 786/245-of MHLSP/NHIC from 22.06.2018) are available. Evidence
on how the pilot in 2018 was used for the improvement of the services was not provided and could not
be accessed by the evaluators, but reports from UNICEF and Neovita show that the performance
indicators have been piloted at national level in 2019 and all interviews provided information about
debates started in 2021 on reforming the financing systems.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
73
Type I error probability– 0.25. Overall, the evaluators are confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. If the claim is false, this means that all documents and analysist provided
by UNICEF, including the performance-based financing (PBF) framework have not been used by the
MHLSP and by other stakeholder in the process of developing YFHC and their network. The large
number of documents issued by third parties acknowledging UNICEF instrumental role and the
unanimous acknowledgement of interviewed stakeholders allows us to be reasonably certain that the
evidence on initial UNICEF support could not appear if the claim is false.
On the other hand, although UNICEF provided the performance-based budgeting framework for the
YFHC statistics in line with the proposed performance indicators are provided for the four pilot centres,
there is limited evidence to support that the pilot was implemented in complete accordance with the
plan provided by UNICEF and that lessons have been learned for future development, as debates are
organised in 2021 on the financing system and the future financing framework is still uncertain.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF providing
initial support and a performance-based budgeting framework for the Youth Friendly Health
Centres (YFHC) in Moldova, based on the result of a modelling/pilot project”, being true given the
evidence.
Claim 1 Evidence – Account and trail

evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.25
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7826
Claim 2: UNICEF contributed to the raising the capacity of health professionals to use youth friendly
approaches in their work
a) Evidence
Documents and interviews show that UNICEF has been much more involved in the development of YFHC
before 2018, when it benefited from funding from SDC and implemented complex activities. Since 2014,
UNICEF focus was on increasing of the demand of YFHS among target groups (adolescent boys and girls,
their families and caregivers, front line professionals) through strengthening of the quality of YFHS,
cross-sectoral cooperation with Local Public Authorities, educational and social protection sectors at
the district and local level and promotion of adolescent participation through volunteering and acting
as promoter of the healthy life style, healthy seeking behaviours and advocacy at local and national level.
After 2018 the activity was focusses even more on the communication for behaviour change (C4BC) in
order to further increase the demand. UNICEF supported the development and implementation of C4BC
Strategy for healthy behaviour among adolescent boys and girls. Capacity building of YFHC professionals
was implemented in 5 target localities for better communication and support for implementation local
Plan for promotion of healthy behaviours among boys and girls.
Before the current programme period, within the scaling-up and capacity building activities until 2017,
UNICEF and “Health for Youth” Association cooperated for the training of health professionals in the
YFHC and in 2012-2016 they also supported the State University of Medicine and Pharmacy to review
its curricula to include needed competences for YFHS.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.8. The evaluators can be confident that UNICEF contributed to the raising the capacity of
health professionals to use youth friendly approaches in their work, in the light of the evidence provided.
Both research reports and technical assistance offered by UNICEF has been used for capacity raising for
YFHS. However, this contribution from UNICEF was generated directly mainly until 2014. Capacity
building activities, especially for health professionals working with young people at risk and vulnerable
74
(MARA and EVA) have been continued by Neovita Centre every year. Neovita/“Health for Youth”
Association representatives underlined in the interview the continuous collaboration and counselling
from UNICEF.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.35. Overall, the evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could
not be observed if the claim is false. Although UNICEF involvement in the service development was, as
already shown, instrumental, the contribution of UNICEF CO to capacity of health professionals to use
youth friendly approaches in their work was diminished over time, therefore the confidence in the
interview information on constant support provided from UNICEF to Neovita, for this very field of
capacity for health professionals, needs to be considered with caution.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.35), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.6956) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
contributing to the raising the capacity of health professionals to use youth friendly approaches in
their work”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.8
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.35
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6956
Claim 3: The funds allocated by the national health insurance fund to YFHC increased substantially in a
sustainable manner
a) Evidence
The claim refers to a result of UNICEF and its partners work to rise the capacity for management
(including performance-based management), the quality and the reach of the YFHC and services.
Documents provided show that YFHC are funded as primary health services since 2008. Documents
provided show that UNICEF, in strong collaboration with “Health for Youth” Association advocated for
increasing funding of YFHS from National Health Insurance Company (NHIC), based on the results of the
Cost analysis and exploratory cost-effectiveness of youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health
services63 conducted in 2012.
As a result, according to UNICEF, Health for Youth” Association, but also other stakeholders (WHO,
MHLSP), allocation to YFHS increased constantly from 2012 until 2021, at the level recommended by
findings of the Cost analysis study from 2012. Therefore, in the last nine years the budget allocated for
YFHS increased more than four times, according to budgetary data, in proportion with the number of
beneficiaries. However, financing is not yet reflecting performance in providing services to the young
people at risk and vulnerable.
Several interviews mentioned that the budget increase is “an illusion” and only in direct proportionality
with the increased number of young beneficiaries. Comparing the increases in the number of
beneficiaries and in the budgetary allowance overall, we can observe, however, that the progression of
the budgetary allowance is slightly steeper (between 2012 and 2019 the budget allocations increased
4.5 times, while the number of young beneficiaries increased 4 times). Moreover, other interviews
pointed out to a scale issue related to fixed costs of YFHC, irrespective of the number of beneficiaries.
Therefore, according to UNICEF calculations, only in 2018 the budgetary allocation completely covered
the financing needs of the centres.

reproductive health services in the Republic of Moldova. BMC Health Services Research, 14(1).

75
The advocacy is continued in 2021, but according to all interviews conducted on this issue, the
leadership and strategy changes at the level of the National Health Insurance Company (NHIC) are
affecting the advocacy and generate a sustainability risk.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.9. The evaluators can be highly confident that funds allocated by the national health
insurance fund to YFHC increased in a sustainable way. The increased budget between 2012 and 2021
is certain, as visible in the budgetary data registered by Neovita Resource Centre. Although there are
sustainability risks presented, existing evidence, also based on previous experience, allows for high
confidence that funding will be at least preserved for YFHC.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.3. The evaluators are cautiously confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. Although the increased between 2012 and 2021 cannot be false, the
sustainability risk mentioned is difficult to assess and affects the confidence that the claim is not wrong
concerning the sustainable funding growth. At the moment of the evaluation, as the advocacy process is
ongoing, stakeholders presented the evaluators with very different views (and optimism/pessimism
levels) concerning changes to be implemented by the NHIC, and this differences determine the
evaluations to be cautions.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.75) the probability of the hypothesis of “funds allocated by the
national health insurance fund to YFHC increasing substantially in a sustainable manner”, being
true given the evidence.
Claim 3 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.3
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.75
Claim 4: The quality of their services and their coverage of adolescent boys and girls with youth friendly
health services (YFHS) increased substantially in a sustainable manner
a) Evidence
Although capacity building activities have been implemented and the general level of capacity is
improved, the quality and youth friendliness of health services provided by the YFHC varies from centre
to centre and among doctors and nurses in the same centre, as well. This finding is supported by reports
of Neovita Centre and UNICEF and all interviews conducted in the field of youth and usually motivated
by the systemic bottlenecks of the healthcare system in Moldova, including the large turnover of medical
staff and traditional doctor-patient relationship promoted by older doctors and managers in the system.
On the other hand, concerning the coverage of YFHC, evidence of activities implemented and results are
more easily available in reports of UNICEF and Neovita. To strengthen YFHS capacities and improve
planning and implementation of activities in communication and social mobilisation, guidelines on
communication for development, including Guidelines on social mobilizations were developed by
UNICEF and disseminated to YFHC. Therefore, in 2018-2020, UNICEF supported the strengthening
capacities of volunteers and outreach workers of four Youth Friendly Health Centres to reach most at
risk and especially vulnerable adolescent boys and girls with information related to health behavior and
available health services tailored to their needs.
UNICEF validated reports mention that over 10,000 young people have been reached by outreach
activities in 2018-2020, according to reports provided by UNICEF. Moreover, in 2020, UNICEF provided
WASH supplies in the context of COVID-19 pandemic to 41 YFHC, supporting their capacity to continue
services delivery during the pandemic.
76
As a result, by 2019, the YFHC coverage has increased progressively, reaching a coverage rate of 28.3%
for the young population aged 10-24 in 2019 and 24.4% in 2020 – the period affected by the COVID-19
pandemic (compared to 16% in 2014). Therefore, in May 2020, 59% of young people in Moldova
responding to U-Report say they would recommend the Youth Klinic online consultation. This is an
improvement compared to 2016, when over 70% of young people in Moldova – participating to OECD
survey – stated they don’t need the youth friendly health services.64
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.75. Although the increased coverage of services is certain, the heterogenous quality of
these services, mentioned by most of the sources consulted, only allows the evaluations to be confident
about the increased quality and coverage of services, as coverage can be rapidly decreased in case of
lack of services quality.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.3. As in the case of claim 3, the evaluators are cautiously confident that the
evidence could not be observed if the claim is false. Although the increased of services coverage cannot
be false, the sustainability risk mentioned above is affecting the confidence.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.75) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7142) the probability of the hypothesis of “quality of YFHC
services and their coverage of adolescent boys and girls increasing substantially in a sustainable
manner”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.75
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.3
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7142
Claim 5: UNICEF contributed to the awareness raising on health issued among young people
a) Evidence
The communication campaign “COOLtivam Sanatatea” (“We COOLtivate health”) to promote healthy
behaviors among adolescents was launched starting on April 2019 promoting videos related to seven
topics that are under YFHS standards. The promotion of videos was done through YFHC, SDC and
UNICEF and reached 404K population, acquired 6,3K likes and achieved 9,7K distributions. UNICEF
highlights the importance of partnerships that doubled the number of reached population due to the
fact that it was distributed in partnership with SDC and YFHCs. All evidence is available online and
supported by social media statistics.
Moreover, since 2018 UNICEF Moldova piloted the implementation of a national curriculum on
parenting of adolescents focusing on stimulating participation of adolescents in decision making
processes, career orientation, non-violent communication and healthy-lifestyle. Further on, UNICEF
reported that supported development and amendment of the parenting of adolescents’ curriculum. The
parenting curriculum and the guidelines were developed and consulted with MECR and academia. The
first phase of piloting of the parenting program started with a ToT of 26 professionals, which will be
engaging 15 parents and the piloting continuation is planned.
Based on HBSC study from late 2018 and UNICEF indicator system, positive changes in adolescents and
youth healthy behaviours (smoking, alcohol abuse, substance consumption and STI prevention) can be
observed between 2016 and 2020, although the progress is limited. Unfortunately, behavior (such as
smoking) persists among young people during the quarantine, while a slight worsening of the situation
is observed, especially among male users, according to U-Report.

77
On the other hand, Neovita Centre reports a very remarkable impact concerning youth health according
to NBS: halving the suicide rate among adolescents, significant decrease in fertility rates and the number
of abortions in adolescents; decrease of the number of new cases of sexually transmitted diseases in
adolescents.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0.95. The number and diversity of communication activities reported by UNICEF, with clear
online evidence present and remembered by interviewed stakeholders, allows the evaluation team to
be confident that the claim is true. A higher level of confidence is not possible, because data on healthy
behaviours among young people are not fully supporting findings related to the effectiveness of
communication activities, although many improvements are visible.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.2. Overall, the evaluators are confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. If the claim is false, this means that reported activities did not generated
any level of awareness raising on health issued among young people, which is hard to imagine
considering that the “COOLtivam Sanatatea” reached a number of person representing more than half
of Moldova youth population.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.8260) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
contributing to the awareness raising on health issued among young people”, being true given the
evidence.
Claim 5 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.95
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.2
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8260
Claim 6: An increased number of young people accessing youth friendly health services deliver by Youth
Centres (or Youth Klinics – YK)
a) Evidence
Neovita Resource Centre is reporting a constant increase of the number of young people accessing youth
friendly health services deliver by YFYC. Data from the monitoring system implemented by Neovita
show that 162,907 adolescent and youth aged 10-24 y.o. benefited from YFHS in 2017, 169,876 in 2018
and 181.800 in 2019 (compared to 96,240 in 2013).
Moreover, the access of most at risk and vulnerable young people (MARA and EVA) increased as well.
They represented 21.5% of consultations in centres in 2019 (compared to 10,1% in 2014)
In 2020, the number of young people in centres decreased, but U-Report showed that the pandemic has
important health effects on young people. Therefore, U-Report enabled the U-Partners feature. About
15 professionals from the National Network of Youth Clinics were trained on operating and providing
services on this platform and about 1,000 young people and their parents received professional support
and guidance from specialized experts.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evaluators can be highly confident that the number of young people accessing
youth friendly health services deliver by Youth Centres was increased overall. The high access to
services reported in 2020, allows evaluators to have high trust that the addressability will remain high
after the pandemic as well.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
78
Type I error probability: 0.3. Overall, the evaluators are confident that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. If the claim is false, this means that 2020 will generate a trend of limited
addressability to YFHC. Although data allows for certainty regarding the increased number of young
beneficiaries of YFHC until 2019 – based on the detailed statistical data provided by the Neovita
Resource Centre, the COVID-19 pandemic affected both accessibility and addressability, and the
possibility of a constant low addressability after the pandemic is not insignificant.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.8260) the probability of the hypothesis on the “increasing
number of young people accessing youth friendly health services”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 6 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.95
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.2
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8260
Claim 7: Young people feel that they are listened / their opinions matter when they receive health services
e) Evidence
According to U-Report reports from other sources, there is an increased number of young people that
their views were taken seriously in decisions made at home, school and in their community 63% young
people report they are listened at home (compared to 34% in 2012), 40% report they are listened at
school (compared to 15% in 2012) and 11% report they are listened in their community (compared to
5%) in 2012. However, one should take into account that U-Report is not based on a representative
sample and more active, empowered and involved young people are usually answering to the U-Report
polls.
MMost of the people interviewed in the field of youth underlined that tokenism, the meaningless
involvement of young people in order to formally check their participation, is an important bottleneck
for the real engagement of young people in decision making. Systemic bottlenecks of the healthcare
system, including the traditional (Sovietic) doctor-patient relationship represents another set of
limitations to youth participation identified by interviewees.
Moreover, key evaluation documents in the field of youth: the Comprehensive Youth Sector Analysis
(2020) and the Mid-Term Evaluation of the Youth Strategy (2018) don’t emphasize the role of YFHC in
promoting youth participation to key decisions concerning their life – respectively to decisions
concerning their health. Although increasing, the accessibility of these services is not considered enough
to support the participation of young people that are not yet empowered and involved in different
activates.
On the other hand, these centres are among the structures of and for young people that evolved over
time in the last ten year in Moldova and overall improved the ‘youth sector ecosystem’. The ‘ecosystem’
includes activities and services the centres provide and the group of young people they report to,
consolidating into more/less functional local/district, regional or national structures depending on the
resources and opportunities available to them. We highlight here the Youth Centers, Youth Friendly
Health Centers, Youth Resource Centers, Multifunctional Community Centers, Republican Center for
Children and Youth (ARTICO), Media Center for Youth, Reintegration Centers for Youth, and others.
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.75. The evaluators can be confident that young people feel that they are listened their
opinions matter when they receive health services. The fact that the U-Report is not representatives,
identified bottlenecks and the limited access to the ‘youth sector ecosystem’ for the most marginalized
and vulnerable young people is limiting the confidence level, although quantitative data support the
claim.
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
79
Type I evidence probability: 0.1. Overall, the evaluators are highly confident that the evidence could not
be observed if the claim is false. If the claim is false, this means that YFHC are not actually delivering
youth friendly services, but they are just a label without content. Although we already showed that
quality of youth friendly services is heterogeneous, the evidence collected shows impact in terms of
health improvement among young people and increased trust of young people in these services.
Moreover, although participation is still low, all evidence show a positive trend in participation overall
that could not be observed if the claim is false.
c) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.75) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.8823) the probability of the hypothesis of “young
people feeling that they are listened / their opinions matter when they receive health services”,
being true given the evidence.
Claim 7 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.75
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.1
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8823
Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest
link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 2 (UNICEF contributed to the
raising the capacity of health professionals to use youth friendly approaches in their work) with a posterior
of 0.6956. This means that we can be cautiously confident that UNICEF contributed in a substantial
manner to the establishment, development, quality, accessibility, addressability and
sustainability of youth friendly health services and, in this way, it also contributed to
empowering young people to participate to decision making concerning their live, including the
very private and serious aspects related to their health. The analysis allows us to be more confident
about the addressability of the services and their positive impact on youth empowerment, but a bit less
so about the quality of the services and their coverage, especially for young people from rural areas.

their addressability.
80
UNICEF support appears as being instrumental in the promotion of the YFHS and their part in the ‘youth
sector ecosystem’ as UNICEF is among the few organisations with capacity and attention to both (i)
adolescents and youth health and (ii) youth empowerment and participation.
Although existing evidence allow a positive and optimistic assessment of YFHS impact and UNICEF
contribution to thesis impact, the most important bottlenecks identified still need to be taken into
account in the future management of youth access to dedicated health services:
- systemic bottlenecks of the healthcare system, including the traditional (Sovietic) doctor-patient
relationship represents another set of limitations to youth participation and quality of youth
friendly services;
- the large turnover of medical staff affects the sustainability of all capacity building activities;
- tokenism, the meaningless involvement of young people in order to formally check their
participation.
Two main risks have been also identified:
- COVID-19 pandemic affected mainly the addressability, but also the accessibility of YFHS in
2020. The risk disengagement of young people and health professionals for the future, caused
by the pandemic, is still present and should be managed with increased outreach, capacity and
quality development and trust building activities.
- The opportunity to improve the financing framework bears a risk of decreasing much needed
funding, in the context of changes at the level of the National Health Insurance Company, that
shows less support to YFHC compared to previous years. Effective advocacy activates can
mitigate this risk.
Assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of justice for children
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Moldova contribution in a selected
area of impact, namely the justice for children. As underlined in the section dedicated to the
methodology, we will present the change claim chain, as elaborated in the Inception Phase of the
evaluation and immediately after. We will than present and analyse each claim in the logical chain
presented and assess the level of confidence for each claim and globally.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain (each
claim numbered separately): (1) UNICEF provided and supported the production of essential knowledge
on and implementation of children in contact with the law and international child friendly justice
standards in the Republic of Moldova, including in Transnistria region, (2) supported the implementation
of child friendly interviewing room policy and infrastructure and the (3) developed and piloted an
education probation program for children in conflict with law. With UNICEF involvement on policy
dialogue based on studies and pilot results, as mentioned, (4) the legal framework has been improved in
Moldova, in order to make the law enforcement and the judiciary friendlier with children. Moreover (5)
UNICEF have been involved in raising the capacity of law enforcement and judiciary professionals in the
judiciary (police, probation officers, magistrates) to work with children using child friendly approaches. As
a result of the legal and capacity improvements, (6) children victims, witnesses and perpetrators of crimes,
in contact with the judiciary (including: police response, legal investigations, probation), can now benefit
from improved services, better adapted to ensure the respect of child rights and to answer children needs.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study is
presented below.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided and supported the production of essential knowledge on and implementation of
children in contact with the law and international child friendly justice standards in the Republic of
Moldova, including in Transnistria region
a) Evidence
Data collection pointed out to several studies in the area of justice for children, drafted by researchers
or teams contracted by UNICEF. All studies have recommendations for improving legislation and
practice. The most important studies identified are:
- Assessment of regulatory framework and practice in criminal proceedings involving children in
the Republic of Moldova, 2014;
- Alternative Report Ombudsman for child’s rights of the Republic of Moldova for the Committee
on the Rights of the Child of UN on Situation in the field of Children’s Rights in Republic of
Moldova in the Period from January, 2009 to December, 2016
- Feasibility Study on the opportunities and concerns related to accession by the Republic of
Moldova to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a
Communications Procedure, 2018;
- The Perceptions of General Population and Specialists on Children Offenders and Children
Victims and Witnesses of Crimes, 2018;
- Moldova case study: Child victims and witnesses in criminal proceedings, 2019;
- The study on the treatment of children in conflict with the law in Transnistria region, with focus
on A.S. Makarenko” school for children in conflict with the law, 2020;
- Study on the Legal Framework and Special Hearing Practices of Children Victims or Witnesses
of Crimes in the Republic of Moldova, 2020;
- Report on the Evaluation of National Indicators on Children in Contact with the Law, 2021.
In line with the conclusions of each study, UNICEF supported the implementation of study
recommendations. The following activities are presented in UNICEF reports and have been mentioned
by interviwees:
- An information brochure:”How to recognize an abuse”, focusing on physical, sexual and
psychological abuse was developed by National Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse
(NCPCA) with UNICEF support and distributed to 10,000 children and adolescents.
- 262 professionals (social and medical workers, police officers, teachers) from nine districts were
trained with UNICEF support on how to properly document, refer, investigate and provide
quality services for child victims/ witnesses of crimes.
- UNICEF provided the Ministry of Justice with several curricula on the rights of the child and how
to work with children for the training of professionals in the judiciary system (judges,
prosecutors, lawyers etc.)
- In two districts with pilot projects implemented by UNICEF – in Singerei and Glodeni districts –
the capacity of some 100 members of local multi-disciplinary teams (mayors, social workers,
medical workers, teachers, police) were further strengthened to properly protect and assist
children victims of violence, thus meeting all four elements of a quality service (monitor,
identify, assist and report).
- In 2021, UNICEF has initiated provision of supporting the Ministry of Justice and the National
Bureau of Statistics in testing and reviewing Access to Justice for Children Indicators as
described in the Statistical Manual for a Core Set of Child Protection Indicators.
- UNICEF supports the Amicul Centre, the Barnahus type centre administrated by NCPCA, In
Chișinău and advocated for the establishment of regional centres in other municipalities as well.
- UNICEF is supporting the educational probational programme presented below.
- UNICEF and the Institute for Penal Reform provided technical support to the MHLSP in drafting
the intersectoral mechanism on measures and services for children with deviant behaviour as
per the Law 299/2018. The first draft was based on the UNICEF-supported analysis of the
piloted implementation of the inter-institutional mechanism which revealed invaluable lessons
learned and good practice applied at community level. The draft was submitted to the MHLSP
for further approval.
83
- UNICEF Moldova expanded the work of the cross-sectoral cooperation mechanism protecting
children offenders to four new districts (in addition to initial 5) where 12 cases of children were
identified and diverted out of the justice system
- UNICEF Moldova continues the work in Transnistria region, within the framework of the One
UN Project in Transnistria, in order to promote the package of relevant legislative amendments,
including to the Transnistrian Criminal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and Law on child rights.
- Within the framework of the UN project infrastructure interventions have been performed at
“A.S. Makarenko” school for children in conflict with the law from the Transnistrian region.
According to UNICEF reports and interviews, the renovation works have triggered several other
infrastructure interventions funded and carried out by the local administration, and this is a
indicator of the ownership developed by de facto authorities and the impact of the project on
improving justice standards for children in Transnistria. However, this evidence is only present
regarding infrastructure development, not the adoption of legal provisions for child friendly
justice.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.9. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF supported studies
and knowledge development and projects implemented in the field of justice for children. However, the
evidence is not sufficient to convince that interventions implemented generated overall the full
implementation of international child friendly justice standards in the Republic of Moldova, including in
Transnistria region.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.05. It is very unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
Although the existing evidence shows that standards are partly implemented and each step proposed
by UNICEF is advancing this situation, but these standards are not yet fully met and studies from 2020
and 2021 include important recommendations in this respect. Transnistria region is in a particular
situation, but there too, the work of UN agencies, including UNICEF, with de facto authorities support
the claim that some progress has been done with UNICEF contribution for the overall improvement of
the international child friendly justice standards.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.9473) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
providing and supporting the production of essential knowledge on and implementation of
children in contact with the law and international child friendly justice standards in the Republic
of Moldova, including in Transnistria region”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 1 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.05
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.9473
Claim 2: UNICEF supported the implementation of child friendly interviewing room policy and
infrastructure
a) Evidence
Interviews show that UNICEF has been involved in the promotion of child friendly interviewing rooms
in the justice institutions (courts, prosecutor's offices, police stations). However, UNICEF reports and
other studies and the Ombutsperson for children show that these child friendly interviewing rooms are
not functioning properly, with not enough facilities, endowment and without the necessary trained
personnel. Although there are hearing rooms, mostly in public institutions in the country, only a modest
limited number are properly arranged and equipped, in the spirit of child-friendly justice so that the
hearing of the child takes place in a friendly atmosphere to avoid as much as possible. revictimization of
84
children. At the same time, it was established that at the moment no norms are elaborated and approved
regarding the functioning of the hearing rooms in special conditions. The criminal investigation bodies
(with the exception of the Prosecutor's Office) have not developed and approved rules on how to
transport and insure the related expenses for the hearing of child victims or witnesses of crimes at the
place of the hearing rooms.
UNICEF is the partner of NCPCA in the implementation of Amicul Centre. It has been established in 2018,
in Chișinău, as the first Barnahus-type child friendly hearing room. The results reported by the
implementation partner, NCPCA, include:
- In 2018 - support provided to 70 children victims of crimes during hearing and qualified legal
assistance in court proceedings. In addition, 183 children victims and their families received
psychological assistance and 93 children had access to rehabilitation services.
- In 2019 - qualified legal and psychological assistance and support provided to 347 children,
including 58 child victims of crime, within court proceedings in 2020 and 518 children, including
66 children victims of crimes.
The Regulation for Barnahus-type services developed by MHLSP was approved by the Government on
December 2019 and the Ministry acknowledges the support and feedback from UNICEF in the drafting
of the regulation.
e) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.8. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF supported the
implementation of child friendly interviewing room policy and infrastructure. However, the impact of
UNICEF support on the long term, for the child friendly interviewing rooms, remains limited. Moreover,
the evidence on the UNICEF involvement in the promotion of child friendly interviewing rooms in the
justice institutions (courts, prosecutor's offices, police stations) is limited to interviews, and no
documents was available for the evaluation team.
For the Barnahus-type centres for children in contact with the law, UNICEF contribution to the Centre
„Amicul”, including for the development of the infrastructure and for procedures, is visible in the
existing evidence. UNICEF contribution to the new legislation on the development of Barnahus-type
services is also acknowledged in all interviews conducted in the field.
f) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.1. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false, as
UNICEF is a partner of NCPCA. However, the involvement of UNICEF in the provision of services for
children in contact with the law, in the Barnahus-type centre – „Amicul” is not supported by evidence.
g) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.8888) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
supporting the implementation of child friendly interviewing room policy and infrastructure”,
being true given the evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.8
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.3
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8888
Claim 3: UNICEF piloted an education probation program for children in conflict with law
a) Evidence
Documents and interviews show that UNICEF was concerned with the case of children in conflict with
the law since the previous Country Programme. On the other hand, in 2018, the Association of
85
Participative Criminal Justice (PCJ), proposed to UNICEF the development of an educational probation
programme in partnership with the National Probation Inspectorate.
The reports of the Association of Participative Criminal Justice include information on:
- the development of the methodology and curriculum for the educational probational
programme proposed by APCJ, in 2018;
- 13 children offenders included in the programme in 2019;
- 13 children offenders included in the programme in 2020, offering them a real chance of social
reintegration and not reoffending;
- a total of 70 probation counsellors (out of 170 nationally) trained in applying the mandatory
probation programme, using online training tools in 2020;
- 85 legal professionals (prosecutors, judges, lawyers) were informed about the need for and
overall positive effects of the probation programmes on children;
- more than 200 justice professionals received printed materials on the efficiency and
effectiveness of the initial probation programme for children in conflict with the law.
According to the interview with the National Probation Inspectorate, the programme has been
institutionalised in December 201965 and is implemented with full ownership from the Inspectorate, but
with continuous technical assistance of UNICEFUNICEF and APCJ.
According to the Council of Europe's evaluation of the existing probation programmes in the Republic
of Moldova, the “initial mandatory probation programme for children in conflict with the law”,
developed with UNICEF support, obtained a high rating of efficiency, quality and resocialization.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 1. The evidence allows for certainty on the piloting and impact of the education probation
programme, proposed in 2018 and already institutionalised by the National Probation Inspectorate in
December 2019.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0,05. It is possible to observe the evidence if the claim is false, only in the case
of no or a very limited involvement of UNICEF in the development, piloting and institutionalisation of
the educational probation programme. Although UNICEF was an important partner for APCJ and the
National Probation Inspectorate and this is backed up by all written evidence, the interviews show that
the involvement of UNICEF in the initiation and development of the programme was limited. The main
(go to) dialogue partner for the National Probation Inspectorate is APCJ and the two partners (APCJ and
UNICEF) are not seen as perfectly equals.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (1) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0,9090) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
piloting an education probation program for children in conflict with law”, being true given the
evidence.
Claim 3 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 1
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.05
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.9523
Claim 4: The legal framework has been improved in Moldova, in order to make the law enforcement and
the judiciary friendlier with children
a) Evidence
65 Order of the President of the National Probation Inspectorate
86
This claim represents a result of the previous claims on UNICEF activities and contributions to justice
for children and focuses on the legal framework. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient evidence is
represented by laws and other legal norms adopted. Through data collection there are several norms
identified:
- Law no. 299/2018 on measures and services for children with deviant behaviour;
- The Government Decision from December 2019 on the Framework Regulation on the
organization and functioning of the Regional Centre for Integrated Assistance to Child Victims /
Witnesses of Crime and Minimum Quality Standards;
- The Order of the President of the National Probation Inspectorate from December 2019, on the
educational probation programme for minors and young people.
For all the approved legal provisions, the evaluation team collected written evidence (studies with clear
recommendations) and interviews evidence about the integration of UNICEF recommendations in the
legislation. In the case of law no. 299/2018, the representatives of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)
underlined that initially, the Ministry proposed a draft law suggesting restrictive measures for child
offenders, children committing misdemeanours and those manifesting anti-social behaviours, which
was questioned by CSOs and the donor community. UNICEF Moldova used its convening role and
supported initiation of a dialogue with the MoJ to align the draft law with international standards on
child-friendly justice.
On the other hand, the framework regulation on the intersectoral mechanism on measures and services
for children with deviant behaviour as per the Law 299/2018 is not yet adopted, at the moment of the
evaluation, in August 2021, three years after the adoption of the law, despite UNICEF recommendations
and advocacy.
Several problematic provisions of the Criminal Cod regarding the interviewing of children have been
also identified in 2020 and improvements of the legal framework is still pending.
Moreover, according to UNICEF reports, despite the advocacy by UNICEF and CSOs, providing to the
Ministry of Justice detailed proposals to include a specific objective for child-friendly justice in the
strategy for ensuring independence and integrity in the justice sector (2021–2024) and the action plan
for its implementation, this has not been done in the approved version of the strategy.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity 0.75: The evidence allows the evaluators to be cautiously confident on the improvement of
the improvement of the legal framework in Moldova, in order to make the law enforcement and the
judiciary friendlier with children. The legal framework in Moldova has been already assessed as being
conducive to improved access to justice for children. However, the lack of some recommended
legislation and of the strategic focus advocated by UNICEF makes the existing evidence on the legal
improvements necessary, but not fully sufficient for the claim to be true.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0,4. The claim could be false if the presented legislation is not actually effective
in making the law enforcement and the judiciary friendlier with children. The likelihood of this situation
is limited by the research and good practice examples used for the development of the legislation.
However, because the adoption of these laws and normative acts is recent and considering the
limitations of the judiciary presented below (see claim 5), there is still possible for the claim to be false
– the new legislation to have very limited impact on making the law enforcement and the judiciary
friendlier with children.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.8) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.6521) the probability of the hypothesis of “the legal
framework being improved in Moldova, in order to make the law enforcement and the judiciary
friendlier with children”, being true given the evidence.
87
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.75
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.4
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6521
Claim 5: UNICEF have been involved in raising the capacity of law enforcement and judiciary professionals
in the judiciary (police, probation officers, magistrates) to work with children using child friendly
approaches
a) Evidence
UNICEF reports and provided documents, as well as the documents provided by implementing partners
in the field on justice for children, include evidence about trainings organised for law enforcement and
judiciary professionals:
- In 2018
o 40 specialists (prosecutors, police, probation, social work, education) were trained on
addressing children’s cases
o 34 police officers on investigating cases involving child offenders have been trained, in
partnership with the National Police Inspectorate
- In 2019 262 professionals (social and medical workers, police officers, teachers) from nine
districts were trained with UNICEF support on how to properly document, refer, investigate and
provide quality services for child victims/ witnesses of crimes
- In 2020,
o 28 police investigators were trained to investigate criminal cases involving children
offenders and 32 police officers were trained to apply the juvenile delinquency
prevention programme developed earlier with UNICEF support and formally approved
by the National Police Inspectorate (NPI) in partnership with "Stefan cel Mare” Police
Academy
o A total of 70 probation counsellors (out of 170 nationally) trained in applying the
mandatory probation programme, using online training tools in 2020;
o 85 legal professionals (prosecutors, judges, lawyers) were informed about the need for
and overall positive effects of the probation programmes on children;
o more than 200 justice professionals received printed materials on the efficiency and
effectiveness of the initial probation programme for children in conflict with the law.
- UNICEF provided quality standards for the training of lawyers involved in cases with children.
However, there is no evidence regarding the effectiveness and impact of the trainings and other capacity
building activities. According to interviewees, UNICEF reports and the reports of the Ombudsperson for
Child Rights, the rate of applicability of alternatives to detention remains low, especially because of the
insufficient understanding among lawyers, prosecutors and judges of the core values underpinning the
probation programmes and the potential impact of diversion on the national criminal justice system.
Diversion programmes need further enhanced promotion and implementation.
The report issued by UNICEF in 2020 sows that the professionals involved in the special hearing of child
victims or witnesses of crimes are not always qualified specifically for the given task or do not show
adequate training on the needs of child victims, their performance being as in the case of adult victims
in criminal proceedings; they do not regularly participate in training and evaluations.
Less than 30% of professionals in law enforcement and judiciary are ready to work with children
according to the Ombudsperson for Child Rights. Moreover, the support of specialised psychologists able
to work with children victims and witness of crime, but also with children in conflict with the law, is
usually missing.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.55. The evidence only allows the evaluators to be more confident than not about UNICEF
contribution to the increased capacity of law enforcement and judiciary professionals in the judiciary
(police, probation officers, magistrates) to work with children using child friendly approaches. Without
88
denying the work done by UNICEF, evidence is not enough to show a significant capacity improvement
of the capacity of the judiciary to work with children. We would expect to see evidence of actual capacity
improvements to assess the senstitivity higher.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0,25. In order for the claim to be false in the presence of the presented evidence,
the activities implemented by UNICEF should have been totally ineffective. Although, as presented, their
effectiveness is limited, it is very unlikely that they did not contributed at all to capacity improvements,
although these are yet insufficient.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.5) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.6875) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
being involved in raising the capacity of law enforcement and judiciary professionals in the
judiciary (police, probation officers, magistrates) to work with children using child friendly
approaches”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 5 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.5
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.25
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6875
Claim 6: Children victims, witnesses and perpetrators of crimes, in contact with the judiciary (including
police response, legal investigations, probation), can now benefit from improved services, better adapted
to ensure the respect of child rights and to answer children needs
a) Evidence
The national legal and policy framework in Moldova is considered conducive to improved access to
justice for children. Solitary confinement of children was discontinued, alternatives to detention
improved, and all children in contact with the law are entitled to free legal aid. The evidence on the
improvement of services presented above, when other claims have been analysed, should be taken int
account in this case.
However, the report issued by UNICEF in 2020 shows that children face limitations on the protection of
their rights, as children are not eligible to receive direct legal assistance guaranteed by the state (this is
provided at the request of the legal representative). Children can benefit from free legal assistance by
the state, if they are eligible, through the legal representative, but there are cases when the best interests
of the child do not coincide with the interests of legal representatives. On the other hand, the
Ombudsperson for Child Rights appreciate that the quality of legal assistance is in general low.
The Criminal Code of Moldova regulates the special hearing of children up to 14 years of age, although
according to the international legal framework a child is considered any human being under the age of
18 and a child should not be prevented from being heard under special conditions only from age-related
reasons (see Güveç v. Turkey).
The Criminal Code of also provides for only three categories of crimes for which professionals apply the
hearing of child victims or witnesses in special conditions (sexual offenses, trafficking in children or
domestic violence), despite the fact that the international legal framework treaties on human rights of
children shall require the protection of the child against any form of violence, harm or abuse, physical
or mental, abandonment or neglect, ill-treatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, for example:
economic exploitation, any form of sexual exploitation and sexual violence , torture, punishment or
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; it is also necessary to prevent the abduction, sale
and trafficking of children for any purpose and in any form.
The Criminal Code stipulates that, in order to avoid secondary victimization of child victims or witnesses
of crimes, their special hearing should be carried out within a limited time, repeated hearing of the minor
89
should be avoided, as far as possible, and avoidance. confronting the child with the suspect or defendant.
The phrase " limited time " is approached differently in criminal prosecution and court proceedings, or
CoE standards stipulate that, in all proceedings involving children, the principle of urgency should be
applied in order to provide a rapid response and to protect the best interests of the child, while
respecting the rule of law, and the ECHR case-law has ruled that the procedure has been they do not
comply with the procedural requirement of promptness.
Although there are hearing rooms, mostly in public institutions in the country, only a modest limited
number are properly arranged and equipped, in the spirit of child-friendly justice so that the hearing of
the child takes place in a friendly atmosphere to avoid as much as possible. revictimization of children.
Only one Barnahus-type assistance centre is functional, one other regional centre is redy to being
opened in 2021 (in Bălți) and another one is under development (in Cahul). However, these regional
centre can limit the access of children from more distant municipalities to the services. Moreover, the
capacity of professionals to conduct interviews and provide the needed services is limited. Professionals
involved in the special hearing of child victims or witnesses of crimes are not always qualified
specifically for the given task or do not show adequate training on the needs of child victims, their
performance being as in the case of adult victims in criminal proceedings; they do not regularly
participate in training and evaluations.
The 2019 Thematic Report on ”Assessing respect for the rights of children in state custody in connection
with the prosecution or execution of the sentence” of the Ombudsperson Child Rights in 2019 identifies
several problematic issues: the poor state of repair and the poor conditions within all prisons in which
children are held; underdevelopment of psychological assistance and assistance services to mitigate
conflict situations; housing units do not meet standards for protection of the health and development of
children; sanitary blocks pose a risk of potential infection outbreaks; the education system does not
meet the needs of children; The prison system is unable to ensure the effective separation of children in
pretrial detention (detention on remand) and of adults in detention; prisons and the probation system
do not enable the re-socialization of minors released from detention.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.55. The evidence shows that improvement in the legal services for children took place and
the availability of improved services in the Barnahus-type centre Amicul in Chișinău and in the
educational probation programme cannot be denied. However, these improvements, although
necessary, are far from being sufficient to allow for a high confidence that the claim is true. The large
number of problems identified at the level of the legal framework, law-enforcement and judiciary
system should not be present if the claim is true.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.5. Improvements of services for children in contact and in conflict with the
law have been presented when the other claims have been analysed and the existence of some
improvements cannot be denied. However, the Ombudsperson for Child Rights, as well as other
stakeholders, identify several limitations in the quality of services for children in the judiciary system
and this can mean that most of the children cannot benefit from improved services when in contact with
the judiciary.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.55) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.5), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews allows us only to be more confident then not (probability 0.5238) that the children
victims, witnesses and perpetrators of crimes, in contact with the judiciary (including: police
response, legal investigations, probation), can now benefit from improved services, better
adapted to ensure the respect of child rights and to answer children needs.
Claim 6 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.6
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.5

Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest
link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 6 (referring to the overall impact
of UNICEF’s contribution in the field of justice for children) with a posterior of 0.5238. This means that
we can only be more confident than not that UNICEF contributed to the overall improvement of
the situation of children victims, witnesses and perpetrators of crimes, in contact with the
judiciary (including police response, legal investigations, probation). The analysis shows that
UNIEF undertook and supported a large number of activities in the field justice for children and we are
highly confident or even reasonably certain these activities have short term results for the directly
targeted children. Evidence also shows that UNICEF involvement determined improved legislation or
prevented the legal framework (i.e. the law regarding children with deviant behaviour - child offenders
under the legal age for criminal liability) to be adopted without respecting the fundamental rights and
interests of the child.

However, medium term and long term results are still limited at the level of the legal framework, the
capacity of the law enforcement and the judiciary system and the actual access of most of the children
to improved services.
The most important bottleneck identified regarding the limited or missing impact are related to:
- the lack of strategic focus on making the judiciary better and friendlier for children. Although
the issue may be taken into account in the future Child Protection Programme, a special attention
of the Ministry of Justice on the issue should have been visible in the strategy for ensuring
independence and integrity in the justice sector;
- the low level of interest of the professionals in law-enforcement and judiciary to participate to
improving the situation of children in contact with the law and in conflict with the law;
- other bottleneck specific to the judiciary system, influencing the resistance to change in the
system.
We base our conclusion on the low interest of the law-enforcement and judiciary specialist for the
improvement of services for children on the findings of the 2018 study measuring the perceptions of
judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police officers and society members towards successful social
91
reintegration of children in conflict with law and children victims/witnesses of crimes66 The study also
explores how respondents see the factors needed for the social reintegration of children. The specialists
mentioned that the success of reintegration of children in conflict with the law depends on the severity
of committed offense, the psychological profile of the child and the involvement of the family in the child
rehabilitation. Referring to the services for the successful reintegration of child victims and witnesses,
judges have first of all mentioned family counselling, while prosecutors, lawyers and police officers have
stated that psychological counselling for children is required in the first place. How the law-enforcement
and the judiciary are approaching and working with the children seems to be less important for the
interviewed specialists and this opinion explains the low level of interest of the judges, prosecutors,
lawyers, police officers to participate to improving the situation of children in contact with the law and
in conflict with the law. This also can contribute the lack of strategic focus and the low capacity of the
system to provide child friendly services.
Assessment of UNICEF Moldova contribution in the area of inclusive education
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Moldova contribution in a selected
area of impact, namely the inclusive education. As underlined in the section dedicated to the
methodology, we will present the change claim chain, as elaborated in the Inception Phase of the
evaluation and immediately after. We will than present and analyse each claim in the logical chain
presented and assess the level of confidence for each claim and globally.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain (each
claim numbered separately): (1) UNICEF provided and supported the production of essential knowledge
for the development of inclusive education and child friendly schools, including inclusive pre-school
education (early childhood education) in Moldova and (2) determined and encouraged a permanent
dialogue between a large group of stakeholders at all levels (ministry, district and municipal authorities,
schools, CSO, international organizations etc.) interested in the development of the inclusive education in
Moldova. (3) UNICEF also supported the development of trainings and other capacity building activities
for professionals working in education (especially with children with SEN) and (4) supported the
development and implementation of communication activities for attitudinal change regarding the
inclusive education. As a result (5) the existing legislation in the field of inclusive education in Moldova is
largely comprehensive and (6) the existing methodological framework for the inclusion of all children is
largely known by teachers, support staff and pre-primary teachers. These results, as well as the
communications campaigns, have an impact on (7) the (slight) increased acceptance of children with SEN
and CwD in the mainstream institutions (at school and pre-school level), especially among parents and
children/students.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study is
presented below.
66 The perception on the social reintegration varies according to the committed offence and the profession of the respondent,
but usually respondents rated high or very high the chances for the successful social reintegration of children victim or
witness of crimes and of children liable for misdemeanors. They rated as about average the chances for the successful social
reintegration of children liable for crimes against property and low or very low the chances for the successful social
reintegration of children liable for violent crimes, murder or sexual criminal assault.

93
The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided and supported the production of essential knowledge for the development of
inclusive education and child friendly schools, including inclusive pre-school education (early childhood
education) in Moldova
a) Evidence
A large number of research, evaluation and analysis documents has been commissioned and supported
by UNICEF in the field of inclusive education. Among the large number of documents mentioned by
UNICEF and stakeholders interviewed, the evaluation team had access to:
- The Inclusion of Children with Disabilities in the Educational System - Sociological Study, 2018.
- The Review of assessment and evaluation in education in the Republic of Moldova, UNICEF
Moldova, 2018
- The mid-term evaluation of the Education Development Strategy for 2014-2020 ‘Education 2020’,
2018
- The Comprehensive Assessment of the Education Sector in the Republic of Moldova, 2019.
- The Joint evaluation of implementation of the Programme for Development of Inclusive Education
2011–2020, including application of child-friendly school’s standards – Evaluation Report, 2019
- The study on the profile of out-of-school children and adolescents, 2020
Except for the review of assessment and evaluation in education, all the other reports cover both pre-
school and school level education.
An important issue, underlined by each of the studies with the exception of the sociological study, is that
they have been developed with UNICEF support, but under the co-ownership of the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Research.
24 other reports, methodologies or tools are mentioned by the Joint evaluation of implementation of the
Programme for Development of Inclusive Education 2011–2020 as a result of UNICEF support for RCPA.
UNICEF provided also evidence on the followed with evaluation management response (EMR)
produced, in accordance with timelines set out in Evaluation Office guidance for the Joint evaluation of
implementation of the Programme for Development of Inclusive Education 2011–2020. Key activities
are focused on strengthening government capacities and technical assistance in new policies and
strategies in the domains of child protection and inclusive education. The EMRs were uploaded into the
EISI tool with proper tracking of the implementation status of activities reflected in the system.
Interviews conducted show the importance of UNICEF contribution to the development of the inclusive
education, not only the policy recommendations of the mentioned reports, but also standards,
methodologies and tools developed with UNICEF support are considered instrumental by stakeholders
in the field. During 2020, UNICEF supported MECR with a methodology for organizing education during
quarantine, special regulations for the 2020–2021 school year, and students’ and parents’ guides on safe
behaviour during COVID-19, according to reports provided by UNICEF.
More recently, interviews and UNICEF reports show that UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Research (MECR) to develop the new Education Sector Plan including long-term Education
Strategy 2022–2030, medium-term IProgramme/Action Plan 2022–2025 and Simulation Models to
them. These are based on the evidence generated by the comprehensive education sector analysis
conducted with the support of UNICEF and GPE in 2019. It also builds on the lessons learned from
COVID-19 to create a more resilient education system, ready to ensure the continuity of learning in a
changing environment.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.9. The evidence identified is necessary and largely sufficient to support the claim.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.05. There is a very low probability that the evidence provided, including a
large number of reports under the logo of the MECR and a large number of technical assistance
deliverables (methodologies, guidelines etc.) were not used by public authorities and institutions in the
94
development and implementation of the national policy, the Programme for Development of Inclusive
Education 2011–2020. This possibility, of the knowledge provided by UNICEF not being used is actually
contradicted by all interviewed stakeholders.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.9473) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
providing and supporting the production of essential knowledge for the development of inclusive
education and child friendly schools, including inclusive pre-school education (early childhood
education) in Moldova”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 1 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.05
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.9473
Claim 2: UNICEF determined and encouraged a permanent dialogue between a large group of stakeholders
at all levels (ministry, district and municipal authorities, schools, CSO, international organizations etc.)
interested in the development of the inclusive education in Moldova
a) Evidence
UNICEF is a partner of the MECR in the organisation of the Annual National Conference on Inclusive
Education. Representatives of schools (headmasters, teachers), representatives of district education
departments, NGOs, direct beneficiaries (parents, children) and representatives of the Government
were all brought together to the conferences, hosting regularly hundreds of participants from across the
country each year. In 2020 the conference was organised online, reaching 3,000 teachers, according to
information provided by UNICEF and confirmed by the interviewed stakeholders.
The importance of the conference for the development of the inclusive education is underlined by all
stakeholders interviewed.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.7. The evidence about the Annual National Conference, although convincing, is not
sufficient to allow for a high level of trust that the claim is true.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.4. There is a fairly high possibility that the Conference, although an important
event allowing the dialogue between the main stakeholders in the field, is not by itself a generator of a
long-term effective dialogue in the field.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.7) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.6875) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
determining and encouraging a permanent dialogue between a large group of stakeholders at all
levels interested in the development of the inclusive education in Moldova”, being true given the
evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and trail

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6363

Claim 3: UNICEF supported the development of trainings and other capacity building activities for
professionals working in education (especially with children with SEN)
a) Evidence
As mentioned, interviewees underlined the importance of UNICEF contribution to the development of
the inclusive education, not only the policy recommendations of the mentioned reports, but also
standards, methodologies and tools developed with UNICEF support are considered instrumental by
stakeholders in the field.
During 2020, UNICEF supported MECR with a methodology for organizing education during quarantine,
special regulations for the 2020–2021 school year, and students’ and parents’ guides on safe behaviour
during COVID-19, according to reports provided by UNICEF. In addition, a guide for parents of pre-
school children titled "Organisation of learning and care process in pre-schools during COVID-19
pandemic"67 was also developed.
Moreover, UNICEF and the implementing partner provided the online training of 12.945 managerial and
didactic staff and 18.650 non-didactic staff on how to use the tools for the prevention and control of
COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. A number of 1.486 managerial staff of kindergartens and 386
representatives of local public administration benefitted from capacity building training on applying the
regulations for re-opening the pre-schools in practice.
Before 2020, targeted support was provided also to two school communities to ensure Roma children
enrol and stay in education. UNICEF Moldova continued its partnership with CSO DACIA during 2018,
piloting inclusive education for Roma children. According to project documents and reports provided
by UNICEF, local leaders, parents and teacher-parent associations in pilot schools were mobilized and
their understanding improved, and 37 teachers were trained to support the inclusion of Roma children
in education. By the end of the year an additional 171 Roma children had been enrolled in pre-schools
and schools in two predominantly Roma communities.
During the current Country Programme period, UNICEF continued supporting the capacity-building of
a limited number of schools in the north of the country that provide advice to other local schools on how
to conduct school assessments in line with the Child Friendly School (CFS) standards and draft
respective school improvement plans. Reports provided by UNICEF and implementing partners show
that 161 staff of the self-evaluated schools were trained on democratic school culture, cross-level
cooperation, prevention and addressing violence against children cases. Moreover, about 45 primary
school teachers were trained and supported by mentors to adopt child-centred teaching practices.
In Sîngerei District a protocol for inclusion of children with severe intellectual disabilities in education,
focusing on intersectoral collaboration at local level was developed to be piloted. In 2018,
representatives of LPA and 43 professionals were trained in supporting 40 children with severe
disabilities and their parents to learn in regular school and pre-school classes. In 2019, about 155
education, social and health professionals and authorities from 27 localities in Sîngerei were guided to
apply the instruction for inclusion of children with severe disabilities in education and 21 professionals
got supervision and support. The project also included the training and preparation of 12 national
trainers to further transfer the learned skills to other educators and to provide ongoing mentoring.
Before the current Country Programme period, between 2014 and 2015, UNICEF assisted RCPA to train
all Psycho-pedagogical Assistance Services’ (PAS) specialists. About 238 PAS specialists received a 10-
day training.
Existent evidence on the assessment of various training programmes show that they are well
appreciated by participants and considered useful or very useful. The Multi-country evaluation of the
UNICEF ECD response to covid-19 in the ECA region confirms the same type of response concerning the
training in 2020 to prepare schools for re-opening.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?

96
Sensitivity: 0.9. The evidence is convincing and largely sufficient to support the claim. More assessments
based on pre and post tests and representative surveys among teachers and supporting teaching staff
could further increase the level of confidence.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.2. Although the number of training and trained professionals is high, most of
the activities are localised and therefore a large number of professionals working in education
(especially with children with SEN) may remain without the support supposed by the claim.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.8181) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF supporting
the development of trainings and other capacity building activities for professionals working in
education”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 3 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5

Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.2
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8181
Claim 4: UNICEF supported the development and implementation of communication activities for
attitudinal change regarding the inclusive education
a) Evidence
UNICEF helped in the efforts of having the same message promoted by all those involved in inclusive
education. In this regard, in 2013 a Communication Plan on inclusive education was developed and a
media campaign was organized with the slogan: “Come with me! The school is also for you!”. The
campaign included commercials on TV and radio.
More recently, in 2018, in partnership with the National Football Federation, MECR and MHLSP, UNICEF
Moldova implemented throughout the year the ‘tiny healthy player’ project supporting social and
educational inclusion through sports at 11 preschools from nine districts and Chisinau Municipality.
Around 1,000 young children, including those with special needs and children from Gagauzia Region,
participated in sports events and benefitted from sports equipment donated to selected preschools. A
compendium with therapeutic fairy tales was developed by the Football Federation and the Republican
Centre for Psycho-Pedagogical Assistance and distributed at targeted preschools.
Nevertheless, the need for more communication campaigns addressing the stereotypes of parents and
teaching staff is acknowledged. Thus, the Joint evaluation of the implementation of the Programme for
development of inclusive education 2011-2020 recommended developing and implementing a new
Communication Plan for the promotion of Inclusive Education and developing new media campaigns,
based on the pattern provided by similar actions carried out in 2013 with the support of UNICEF (under
the slogan "Come with me, the school is also for you!"), for raising awareness on the importance of
inclusive education among parents and the general public
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.7. There is limited evidence about recent large (countrywide) campaigns for attitudinal
change regarding the inclusive education.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.25. All campaigns have been implemented in partnership, by UNICEF and
governmental authorities. There is a small probability that UNICEF contribution has been insignificant,
depside the acknowledgement of stakeholders.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
97
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7368) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF supporting
the development and implementation of communication activities for attitudinal change regarding
the inclusive education”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.7
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.25
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7368
Claim 5: The existing legislation in the field of inclusive education in Moldova is largely comprehensive
a) Evidence
The claim refers to the result of UNICEF contribution as assessed regarding to claims 1 and 2 in the
contribution chain concerning inclusive education, presented above.
The Joint evaluation of the implementation of the Programme for development of inclusive education 2011-
2020 actually concludes that “the existing legislation in the field of inclusive education in the Republic
of Moldova is largely comprehensive and basically represents one of the main results achieved through
the implementation of the Programme, a success factor that has decisively contributed to the progress
made on the inclusion of children with SEN in mass-education”. More specifically, the evaluation
describes the following legal framework:
- The Constitution of the Republic of Moldova guarantees the right to education of all persons and,
in particular, the right to education of persons with special needs or who are in vulnerable
situations.
- In 2003, the Government of the Republic of Moldova adopted the national strategy "Education
for all" in order to expand access to education and ensure its quality, to promote policies for the
inclusion of children with special educational needs in mass education and support measures to
this end. In 2010, the Strategy on the social inclusion of persons with disabilities, 2010-2013, was
adopted by Law no. 169, providing the adjustment of educational programmes to the special
needs of children with disabilities, the diversification of inclusive education services and the
improvement of quality of educational services for children and young people with disabilities.
- The Programme for development of inclusive education in the Republic of Moldova 2011-2020,
approved by Government Decision no. 523/2011, describes the conceptual framework of
inclusive education, analyses the situation in that period and sets forth structures, models of
cooperation, types of services, stakeholders' roles, as well as the regulatory acts necessary for
implementation.
- Law no. 60/2012 on the social inclusion of persons with disabilities aiming to guarantee the
possibility of participation in all areas of life without discrimination, on equal terms with the
other members of society, based on observing the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
individual (art. 1). To this end, the Ministry of Education and the authorities of the local public
administration shall ensure favourable conditions for the access of children with disabilities to
early education and rehabilitation services (art. 28). The law provides support measures for
students with disabilities - support teachers, personal assistants, other support services and/or
with reasonable adjustments, social scholarships, in line with the legislation in force.
- In this context, the Education Code (2014) defines inclusive education as an "educational process
that responds to children's diversity and individual developmental needs and offers
opportunities and equal chances to benefit from the fundamental human rights to quality
development and education in common environments of learning” (art. 3). The Code guarantees,
among the principles governing the educational system, equity, non-discrimination and social
inclusion (art. 5). The law regulates inclusive education and provides that it shall be organized
in general educational institutions, including special educational institutions, or home-
schooling, the form of inclusion being determined according to the particularities of each
individual, following periodic evaluations.
98
- The educational policy document entitled the Strategy on Education development for 2014-2020
"Education 2020" describes the vision of a quality educational system that is accessible for all
and relevant both for society and economy. To this end, one of the targets is to increase the
access of children with special educational needs to mass education by at least 10% every year.
The strategy identifies the following barriers to inclusive education: the lack of the necessary
conditions for the integration of these children (well trained teachers, infrastructure and
adapted teaching aids) and the resistance to change shown by some school managers, teachers
and parents (p. 17). The document reiterates the role of information campaigns at the level of
parents, educational institutions and other stakeholders, including the general public, for raising
awareness on the need to ensure equal opportunities for quality education to all children. It also
provides the ensurance of adequate and sufficient material conditions and the reorganization of
support measures for appropriate psycho-pedagogical assistance, accessible to all children with
special educational needs (centres, support teachers, psychologist, social worker, etc.).
- Directly related to the development of inclusive education, the Strategy on Child Protection for
2014-2020 proposes measures for the continuous reduction of the number of children in
residential care, some of them aimed at developing inclusive education and improving the
support services.
- Several MECR Orders: e.i. Order no. 1430 as of September 25, 2018, on the approval of the
Methodological standards on inclusive education in technical vocational education; Order no.
1780 as of 03.12.2018 on the approval of the Standard Structure and Methodological Notes on
the elaboration and implementation of the individualized Educational Plan in the early
education institutions.
However, the evaluation identified a number of changes and additions needed at this time in the
legislative framework related to inclusive education in the Republic of Moldova. The additional legal
framework needed refers to the regulation of inclusive education financing at the level of early
education, although, a number of steps have been taken to develop inclusive at the level of early
education.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evidence on the largely comprehensive legislation in the field of inclusive
education in Moldova is very convincing, although some improvements are still needed and observed,
especially in order to address the most important bottlenecks.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.15. A large number of strategies have been identified, but less legal provisions
are identified as improved. Moreover, evidence is not enough on the effectiveness of the implementation
of all legal provisions to assess its full comprehensiveness.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.15), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.8636) the probability of the hypothesis of “the
legislation in the field of inclusive education in Moldova being largely comprehensive”, being true
given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8636
Claim 6: The existing methodological framework for the inclusion of all children is largely known by
teachers, support staff and pre-primary teachers
a) Evidence
The claim refers to the result of UNICEF contribution as assessed regarding to claims 2 and 3 in the
contribution chain concerning inclusive education, presented above.
99
The Joint evaluation of the implementation of the Programme for development of inclusive education 2011-
2020 actually concludes, based on case studies, that “the existing methodological framework for the
inclusion of all children is largely known by teachers, support staff and pre-primary teachers (at least in
inclusive schools, but not only)”, and UNICEF, PAS and numerous CSOs involved have made a decisive
contribution in this regard. Moreover, “both at the level of educational units (especially in general
education) and at the level of PAS, a sufficient level of knowledge has been reached that will allow,
progressively, the consolidation of inclusive education.”
As confirmed by the sociological study "Implementation of inclusive education in the Republic of
Moldova", since 2018, most teachers already knew the procedures for enrolment, referral,
establishment and work according to the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP)68 as well as the
methodology of working with children with SEN, including in kindergartens (or at least in inclusive
kindergartens).
On the other hand, although competent to use the methodologies, the staff is not enough to support
quality inclusive education in all schools. According to the Joint evaluation of the implementation of the
Programme for development of inclusive education 2011-2020: “that the number of support teaching staff
is insufficient to achieve inclusive education in an effective manner. In addition, the low salary and the
fact that a support teacher does not represent a separate professional category causes their rather high
fluctuation.” In this context, additional basic training is required for staff that enters the system to
replace the leaving trained teachers and supporting teachers. Moreover, in order to counteract the
fluctuation of staff, it was suggested to to train a second teacher who can take over the duties of an
support teaching staff.
The Joint evaluation also finds that: “in addition, support teaching staff need much more applied,
practical training, but also specific and in-depth training to work with children with severe disabilities,
hearing and sight impairment, ASD (autism spectrum disorders, behavioural disorders). Currently, STS
are not prepared to satisfy these challenges. There is a need for a proactive approach of the training
process of support teachers, depending on the profile of the children with SEN who attend the school
and those who will attend general education, by monitoring their course in the educational process.”
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evidence on the methodological framework for the inclusion of all children and its
use in school is documented and presented by different evaluations, therefore very convincing. Some
additional needs in the development of competences of specialist in the field are, however, still
identified.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.4. More assessments based on pre and post tests and representative surveys
among teachers and supporting teaching staff could further increase the level of confidence that a ‘false
positive’ is not resulting from the cited evaluations.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7037) the probability of the hypothesis of “the existing
methodological framework for the inclusion of all children being largely known by teachers,
support staff and pre-primary teachers”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 7: One can observe an increased acceptance of children with SEN and CwD in the mainstream
institutions
a) Evidence
In 2018, the knowledge, attitudes and practice study (KAP) showed that two-thirds of respondents
believed that children with disability should be cared for at home or in residential institutions, while
24.5 per cent supported inclusive education (increase, compared to 5.2 per cent in 2009 and 5.6 per
cent in 2003).69
However, the SitAn in 2019 underlined that 60% of children with disabilities are not in pre-school
education. Although there has been substantial progress on inclusion of vulnerable children in
educational system between 2014 and 2019 (the share of children with disabilities who attend general
educational institutions increased by 10% in the last five years and reached 93% in 2018), most of the
education institutions are not adapted to meet inclusive education standards. This leads to only one-
third of children with SEN and CwD graduating from school.
Evidence from the 2018 sociological study and the KAP study (Knowledge, attitudes and practices in early
childhood development and care, 2018) shows that
- The attitude of the public regarding the inclusion of children with special needs in general
education institutions remains unfavourable to inclusion. Still, most of the carers and teachers
choose to care for these children in the family or in residential institutions.
- At the same time, comparatively with the previous studies, slight improvements were registered
in the case of carers, in the 2018 study 23% chose to include these children in mainstream
institutions, compared to 17% in 2012 and 20% in 2009.
- Teachers were more open to the integration of children with special needs in mainstream
institutions, but there is a decrease in their weight compared to the previous study (41% in 2018
compared to 47% in 2012). On the other hand, in 2018, 24% of the interviewed teachers (31,4%
in 2012) believed that these children should be cared for in the family and 24% (13% in 2012)
opted for their placement in residential institutions.
- Opinions of students on the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream educational
institutions remained scattered, and there is an increase in the degree of tolerance towards
students with SEN.
- there is a considerable increase in the population that supports inclusive education (24,5% in
2018, compared to 5.2% in 2009 and 5.6% in 2003).
- discrimination of the children with HIV/AIDS remain high – 62% of the carers would not accept
that their child to play with a person infected with HIV.”
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.6. Existing data, although confirming the claim, are only based on opinions and newer data
(2021) would have been needed to increase the level of confidence concerning the observed progress.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.45. Given that data are based on opinion survey, they can be affected by
desirable answers.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.6) and the probability of
seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.45), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews allow us only to be more confident than not (0.5714) about the probability of the
hypothesis of “increased acceptance of children with SEN and CwD in the mainstream institutions”,
being true given the evidence.

Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest
link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 7 (referring to the overall impact
of UNICEF’s contribution in the field of inclusive education) with a posterior of 0.5714. This means that
we can only be more confident than not that UNICEF contributed to the overall improvement of
the inclusion of children with SNE and CwD in the mainstream education institutions. The analysis
shows that UNIEF undertook and supported a large number of activities in the field inclusive education
and we are highly confident these activities have short term results for the directly targeted
professionals and contributed to raised capacity of schools and teachers to receive and to work with
children with SNE and CwD. Evidence also shows that UNICEF involvement determined improved
legislation in the field.

However, medium term and long term results are still limited at the level of the legal framework, the
capacity of the part of the teaching staff. Moreover, although UNICEF supported communication
campaigns for attitudinal change, they proved to be insufficient for a significant impact at the level of
both the general public (especially parents) and teachers.
Existing evidence also show that children with severe disabilities and children with HIV/AIDS remain
high remain highly discriminated and schools remain largely inaccessible to them.
The most important bottleneck identified regarding the limited or missing impact are related to:
- difficulties in hiring qualified staff, especially in preschool education, resulting from: the small
number of specialized staff available; the large turneover, especially, of the support teaching
staff; the regulation of the number of support teaching staff depending on the number of children
with SEN, determining instability of employment for the support teaching staff and lack of
motivation to fill the position among the qualified young professionals, low salaries for the
specialized staff;
- lack of digital skills among teachers among teachers, but also among support teaching staff;
102
- insufficient or poor intersectoral cooperation in the education, health and social protection
sectors regarding non-educational support services for CwD, such as personal assistance, but
also the identification and early referral of cases of severe disability. There is a lack of clear and
effective case reporting mechanisms, that should facilitate early interventions in sensitive
periods for the recovery of children with disabilities.
- financial allocations for inclusive education are not calculated on the basis of the number of
children with SEN70 and their individual needs are not taken into account.
70 The allocation is a fix percentage from the total budget allocation for education in each district.

Annex 3. Results of the Social Network Analysis
The specialists/country officers that have provided us answers to the questionnaire work in following
areas: child protection, education, health, COVID 19 response, adolescents’ development and
participation and monitoring and evaluation.
According to the collected data, the main institutions with whom the CO collaborates are: governmental
bodies (represented mainly by ministries), UN agencies (excluding different departments of UNICEF CO
Moldova that have been indicated by respondents as important collaborators, but they are not
addressed in this particular analysis) CSOs71 and national agencies and institutes. As the below table
shows, from the institutions that have been chosen by respondents, the most connections are
established between UNICEF CO and ministries (36%).

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection from Moldova has been identified most often as an
important partner in the development of COs activities (8 times), followed by Ministry of Education and
Research (5 times). Municipalities are also important partners for UNICEF CO, most nominalized LPAs
being Cahul and Ungheni. 7 respondents identified them as important collaborations in the development
of the activities under CP Moldova. The data shows that UN Agencies are key partners in the
development of the CO’s work. The links identified between the CO and UNDP are most frequent. Based
on the number of respondents that have nominated a particular partner institution, a similar type of
collaboration, has been observed in the case of Voinicel Early Intervention Center.
Moreover, regarding the frequency of communication, as observed from the data collected, most
frequent contacts have been established with the municipalities, the Ministry of Economy, the National
Council of Youth from Moldova, National Bureau of Statistics, NGOs (CNTM, Probono and TEKEDU) and
UN agencies (UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF Headquarters, UNCT, UNFPA, UNAIDS, UNDP).
According to the opinion of respondents, the primary benefit of the collaboration developed with the
indicated institutions or organization, most frequent support was rated to access to decision makers
(27% of the analyzed case), followed by receiving information for solving problems (26%) and access
to target groups, others than decision makers (18%).

When speaking about the benefits identified in the collaboration with governmental bodies and the
parliament, most important types of support identified were: access to decision makers (43%) and
support in accessing and convincing decision makers (29%). When addressing the benefits received
from the collaboration with UN agencies, the most important aspect, as perceived by respondents, is
that they receive information for solving problems (29% of the cases), followed by access to decision
makers and information that helps identifying problems (each 21%). In the case of collaboration with
LPAs, the benefits are equally distributed among the following: access to decision makers, information
for solving problems and access to target groups. And, finally, in the case of partnerships developed with
NGOs and associations, the main benefit refers to receiving information for solving problems (44,5% of
cases), followed by facilitated access to target groups, other than decision-makers (33,3%).
Another important criterion of the analysis is the level of value that the CO’s staff or contracted experts
give to certain collaborations. On a scale form 1(no value) to 10, the average value of the collaboration
established with governmental bodies is 6,53. In the case of LPAs, the information and supported
received by the respondents is valued at 7,83 points. The value of the collaboration established with
NGOs and associations is 8,91. According to the data provided by respondents, the most valued
collaboration are the partnerships developed with the Health for Youth Association and Institute of
Mother and Child Health and UN Agencies (UNICEF Headquarters, UNAIDS and UNFPA).

In the Republic of Moldova, the social network of UNICEF CO has an average degree of 2.5 edges per
node and an average weight degree of 2.731. Thus, in UNICEF’s network in the Republic of Moldova,
UNICEF’s experts and external partner organization have 2 or 3 connections on average between each
other. The size of UNICEF’s network in the Republic of Moldova is 52 nodes and the network diameter,
which represents the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes in the network, is only 6
nodes. The network diameter coefficient implies an efficient flow of information in UNICEF’s network
in the Republic of Moldova, as 6 interactions are needed to connect the two most distanced nodes in the
network.
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO in the
Republic of Moldova, the data analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with
various connections between actors in different clusters formed around each department of the CO or
106
each specialist/expert of the CO. This conclusion is based not only on the network diameter coefficient,
but on the modularity coefficient (0.541) as well. Both show that network is not formed only by clusters
of interactions, but that the identified clusters are interconnected through the connections established
between their members. The modularity coefficient for the UNICEF CO in the Republic of Moldova is
lower than the coefficient for the regional level, which indicates that the network is more partitioned.
One explanation for this partition could be explained through the focus on fields, as UNICEF’s experts
are connected with external partner organizations that activate in the same field (health, education,
social protection, etc.)
The average path length has a coefficient of 3,356, which indicates strong flow of information in the
network of UNICEF CO in the Republic of Moldova. The average number of steps along the shortest paths
for all possible pairs of network nodes is only 3 UNICEF experts and/or external partner organization.
In other words, to reach a certain node in the network it only requires a path through 3 UNICEF’s experts
and/or external partner organizations. When comparing the average path length (3,356) with the
network diameter (6), we observe that there are not many actors being in the periphery of the network.
This statement is also based on the analysis of the connected component indicators (1) that shows the
number of nodes that are connected with each other but isolated from the rest of the network.
Nevertheless, we need to emphasize that in the case of Moldova the number of survey respondents is
rather low (but representative for the size of the CO).

The graph from above highlights the nodes that have more than 5 edges in UNICEF’s network in the
Republic of Moldova, representing the partners that have the largest number of connections with
UNICEF CO in Moldova. The nodes that have the highest number of degrees are all from the CO of UNICEF
in the Republic of Moldova, as follow: the Health Officers with 15 degrees, the ADAP Officer with 11
degrees, the Education Specialist with 9 degrees, the Consultant on COVID-19 with 7 degrees and the
107
Education Officer with 7 degrees. Concerning the external partners organizations that have the most
edges with UNICEF’s experts in the Republic of Moldova are the following: the Ministry of Health, Labor
and Social Protection with 6 degrees, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research with 5 degrees,
UNDP with 3 degrees, USAID with 2 degrees and UNICEF ECARO with 2 degrees.

As the tables shows, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection has the highest betweenness
centrality coefficient (0.44), which indicates that this organization had the most influence in the flow of
information in UNICEF’s network in the Republic of Moldova. Besides the Ministry of Health, Labor and
Social Protection, other nodes from UNICEF’s network in the Republic of Moldova that have high
between centrality coefficients are the Health Officers of UNICEF, the ADAP Officer of UNICEF, the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Research and the Education Specialist of UNICEF.

The nodes that have the highest betweenness centrality coefficient have the highest closeness centrality
coefficients. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection has the highest closeness centrality
coefficient as well (0.46), followed by the Health Officers of UNICEF (0.44), the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Research (0.43), the ADAP Officer of UNICEF (0.41) and the Education Specialist of UNICEF
(0.40).
Although it has a much lower number of degrees than other nodes from the network (such as the Health
Officers or the ADAP Officer), the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection has connections with
nodes in the Republic of Moldova that have high betweenness and closeness centrality coefficients, such
as the Health Officer of UNICEF (betweenness centrality: 0.38, closeness centrality: 0.44), the ADAP
Officer (betweenness centrality: 0.32, closeness centrality: 0.41), the Education Specialist (betweenness
centrality: 0.20, closeness centrality: 0.40), the M&E Specialist (betweenness centrality: 0.19, closeness
centrality: 0.33) and the CP Specialist of UNICEF (betweenness centrality: 0.09, closeness centrality:
0.41).
In the case of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Research, the other external partner of UNICEF that
have high coefficients in both betweenness and closeness centrality, it is also connected with other
nodes that high coefficients in both metrics. Thus, Ministry of Education, Culture and Research is
connected with Health Officer of UNICEF (betweenness centrality: 0.38, closeness centrality: 0.44), the
ADAP Officer (betweenness centrality: 0.32, closeness centrality: 0.41), the Education Specialist
(betweenness centrality: 0.20, closeness centrality: 0.40), and the Consultant on COVID-19 MD of
UNICEF (betweenness centrality: 0.12, closeness centrality: 0.34).
