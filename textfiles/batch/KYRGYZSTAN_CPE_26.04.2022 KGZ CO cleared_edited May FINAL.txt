Executive summary
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Programme (CP) for
the period 2018 to June 2021, focusing on UNICEF’s activities across its three core Outcomes. The evaluation
examines the relevance and coherence of the CP, the work of the UNICEF Country Office (CO) with partners,
and the impact generated for children. The evaluation is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation
commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, covering UNICEF programmes in
Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine. The evaluation aims to support the planning process for the
next programming period and to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability. Its objectives are to identify good
practices, draw lessons, and inform forward-looking recommendations. The evaluation assesses the
linkages between international, regional, national and institutional strategies to bring about overall
improvement in the status of children. It also evaluates the extent to which interventions focus on and
deliver results for the most vulnerable categories of children in Kyrgyzstan. Finally, it evaluates the
performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF levels.
Overview of the Country Programme, 2018–2022
The CP has three mutually reinforcing core Outcomes: 1) Child Rights Based Mechanisms for Decision
Making; 2) Equitable Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning and Development; 3) Child Protection
and Access to Justice.
Outcome 1: Child Rights Based Mechanisms for Decision Making.
State institutions have capacity to generate and utilize evidence for child rights monitoring, advocacy and
policy formulation. Social sector ministries and parliament have improved capacity to manage and
oversight public finance for children
Outcome 2: Equitable Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning, and Development.
Healthcare professionals can provide quality perinatal, modern home-visiting services. The Government
can produce multisectoral policies and standards to guide and monitor nutrition services for the most
disadvantaged women and children. Service providers can provide adolescent friendly services, including
HIV prevention for especially vulnerable adolescents (EVA) and most-at-risk adolescents (MARA)ECD/ECE
institutional capacities strengthened to deliver quality early development, learning and school readiness
for all, especially the most disadvantaged girls and boys. The education system can provide quality and
inclusive learning and development to the most disadvantaged children and adolescents
Outcome 3: Child Protection and Access to Justice.
The education system can provide quality and inclusive learning and development to the most
disadvantaged children and adolescents. Justice and administrative bodies can facilitate children’s access
to justice services and redress mechanisms Adolescents have and use opportunities to contribute to
decision-making processes
The CP integrated activities and strategies across all three outcomes to change social norms that are not
favourable to child rights. In addition, the CP used multiple strategies to encourage child and youth
participation across all outcomes. Specific activities on this area included in Outcome 3.
The CP was revised in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with several new outputs and activities
added to ensure a swift and appropriate response to children’s emerging and urgent needs.
Purpose of the evaluation and its audiences
This strategic evaluation covers the whole CP and complements sectoral evaluations and specialized studies
conducted in the past five years. The evaluation’s purpose is to strengthen UNICEF’s accountability to
national stakeholders by evaluating its contribution to results for children at scale, particularly for the most
vulnerable children in specific areas. The evaluation also aims to inform the development of the next
UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by collating the lessons learned from activities and results.
This allows the best use of UNICEF’s change strategies in the future.
iii
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices. Secondary
users are the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, UN agencies and development partners with a presence
in Kyrgyzstan. The evaluation builds on the agreements made among these partners and assists the
establishment of strategies for their ongoing collaboration in the next planning and programme cycle.
Evaluation context
The evaluation was conducted in a context marked by instability and uncertainty. The global COVID-19
pandemic changed lives in Kyrgyzstan, as it did worldwide. The pandemic meant irregular school
attendance, and school closures were particularly harmful for the most vulnerable children. This was
mitigated by the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) developing a remote learning platform for pre-
school and school-aged students, with UNICEF support. The pandemic also hampered access to health
services, including mental health services for caregivers, children and youth. The pandemic affected their
mental well-being, with more than 60 per cent of adolescents reporting elevated levels of pandemic-related
anxiety1, and one fifth of households reported challenges in accessing healthcare services.
Beyond these immediate effects, the pandemic has had severe socio-economic consequences. Kyrgyzstan's
real gross domestic product (GDP) declining by 8.6 per cent. In 2020, 50 per cent of households reported a
reduction in income. By 2021, falling remittances and incomes, rising unemployment, and rising prices and
health expenditures had caused the poverty rate to climb to 25 per cent.2
In addition to the dramatic changes spurred by the pandemic, Kyrgyzstan experienced political changes in
2020-2021. These resulted in a new regime and a new Constitution that have been in place since January
2021.
Evaluation methodology
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC)
developed by the UNICEF CO. The evaluation questions were structured around the OECD DAC3 criteria of
relevance, coherence and impact. The evaluation criteria of effectiveness and sustainability were also
covered to a certain extent by the evaluation, being reflected in subsequent evaluation questions under the
larger impact criterion. An Evaluation Matrix was developed during the inception phase to map out
evaluation questions and sub-questions, judgement criteria, data collection methods and data sources.
An in-depth impact assessment included three selected areas: early childhood development, adolescents’
engagement and participation, and social protection to provide lessons learned on UNICEF practices and
strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. These areas were selected during the inception phase of
the evaluation, based on previously set criteria and consultations with the UNICEF CO in Kyrgyzstan. Other
evaluation methods used for the evaluation included stakeholder and social network analysis using
systems-based evaluation principles.
The evaluation employed qualitative data collection methods, including a wide-ranging document review
and 30 key interviews in Bishkek and the regions. The CO supported the identification of respondents who
were consulted using semi-structured interviews. They included interviewees from UNICEF, government
entities, UN agencies and other development agencies, and civil society organizations (CSOs). In addition,
UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social network analysis.
The evaluation methodology fully considered the ethical obligations of evaluators. Child rights, equity and
gender were highlighted throughout the evaluation.

The UNICEF CP 2018-2022 in Kyrgyzstan was based on evidence and lessons learned from the
implementation of previous interventions, from needs assessments, and from studies conducted before and
during the implementation of the Programme. According to the CP priorities and the context analysis,
UNICEF aimed to affect all children in Kyrgyzstan in both the planning and implementation phases of the
CP. Periodic, planned interventions identified and addressed the needs of vulnerable children including
girls, children with disabilities, and children affected by poverty and social exclusion. Additional
interventions addressed the emerging needs that arose when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.
The CP expanded its focus on adolescents and youth. It especially examined the proactive engagement in
community dialogue, skills and competence building, employability, and peacebuilding potential of youth
from large minority groups and youth living in in Kyrgyzstan’s border regions.
The proposed solutions for the development of services for children included services for early childhood
development and education (ECD and ECE) respective of the limited resources available at local level in
small towns and villages. Proposed solutions also encouraged the use of community resources to address
the needs of children in rural areas.
The alignment of the CP to children’s needs and the national priorities was based on national statistics and
strategic planning for children’s rights and well-being. Children’s needs were further identified as UNICEF
Kyrgyzstan responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. These initiatives included the provision of essential
supplies to medical personnel working at the frontlines when these supplies were scarce. UNICEF
supported the procurement of supplies to front-line medical workers, COVID-19 medication for health
facilities, and technical assistance for healthcare providers. UNICEF also supported the MoES’s effort to
provide remote learning to the more than 1.4 million preschool and school-aged children in 2020, and then
re-open schools safely. UNICEF assisted the provision of a Humanitarian Cash Transfer (HCT) for families
affected economically. Throughout the pandemic, UNICEF coordinated its activities with development
partners and other UN agencies. in the country for the overall response to the pandemic.
Coherence
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan used its comparative advantages related to its expertise, strategic focus and
adaptability enabled it to build and sustain effective partnerships with the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic, UN agencies and development partners, and CSOs.
UNICEF used its comparative advantages effectively in collaborating with a range of different partners to
drive change for children and their families in Kyrgyzstan. Partnerships contributing to the assessed impact
of UNICEF included bilateral cooperation with UN agencies and other international organizations,
implementing partners (as in the case of programmes for adolescents’ engagement and participation), and
partnerships in the framework of the United Nations Development Framework (UNDAF) and the
Development Partners Coordination Council (DPCC). Partnership was an important implementing strategy
for UNICEF in Kyrgyzstan, enabling the CO to create synergies with other organizations and institutions,
partnership with stakeholders but it was not highlighted as a strategic element in the Country Programme
Document. An exception to this limited visibility of the strategic approach to partnership was UNICEF’s
partnership with the Government, that shapes and leads the Country Programme implementation.
Keeping true to the priorities and objectives of UNICEF and the wider UN, the CO developed strategic
partnerships with a range of partners to enhance the delivery of the CP. Social network analysis shows
UNICEF was a key and active partner in a strong and large network of stakeholders working for the
realization of children’s rights in Kyrgyzstan. UNICEF’s most strategic partners were public institutions at
the central level, including sectoral ministries, public service providers, institutes. UNICEF focused
resources and provided information for these partners, and their agendas, in turn, influenced UNICEF
activities. Local partners were also instrumental for UNICEF’s impact, especially for model projects to
evaluate innovative approaches to improve national policies. Partnership with UN agencies and
development partners on common points of interest allowed UNICEF to enhance its advocacy capacity
v
when promoting recommendations to the Government. Finally, CSOs were key partners for advocacy and
implementation, enabling UNICEF to mobilize and engage local communities.
Impact
Evidence showed UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s progress in the realization of child rights in most areas where it
works. UNICEF contributed to the following areas:
• the adoption of the revised Child Code in July 2021 by Kyrgyzstan’s Parliament
• the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
in 2019
• healthcare and nutrition for children, visible in the reduction of infant and child mortality rates
• clinical standards, protocols and the capacity of medical staff in maternal, child and adolescent
health in several healthcare facilities
• vaccination capacity
• the adoption of the Food Security and Nutrition Programme 2019-2023
• access to early childhood education and government commitment to accelerate progress in this area
• the ‘Education Development Programme for 2021-2040’ (EDS) and the Action Plan for 2021-2023,
adopted on 4 May 2021
• an education management information system (EMIS)
legal aid for children
• adolescent participation in targeted communities.
UNICEF used five key strategies to obtain these impacts:
• advocacy for policy development and change regarding national strategies and legal frameworks
• technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services
• support for capacity building through the training of duty bearers (in the fields of education, health,
law-enforcement, judiciary)
• engagement on advocacy with civil society partners at national and local level
• engagement with development partners, especially, but not only, through the Development
Partners Coordination Council (DPCC).
There are, however, other areas where the CP has enhanced the lives of the children and young people who
have taken part in specific activities but has been unable to achieve impact at scale. This usually resulted
from limited strategic and legal provisions for initiatives that required institutional strengthening for full
implementation. Lack of impact at scale in some areas was also linked to the limited number of communities
participating in key interventions. There was less change in trends related to gender-based violence (GBV),
however, and more activities must address the presence of specific social norms and values that conflict
with the human rights approach. For example, the 2021 Situation Analysis identified the continued
practices of child marriage, kidnapping for forced marriage, and public tolerance of GBV and violence
against children. However, UNICEF implemented model projects successfully in partnership with local
government structures and/or CSOs. These projects included the development of home-visiting standards,
the development of services for children with disabilities, and support for child- and youth-friendly cities.
In these cases, development and scale-up were essential for impact at national level.
In addition to these limitations, political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic generated significant
sustainability risks in 2020. These challenges to the impact and sustainability of UNICEF’s work include…
• institutional instability
• continuous civil service turnover
• limited capacity for service provision for the realization of child rights at central and local level
• limited policy coordination and cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation
• limited availability of disaggregated data
• limited use of available data for decision making concerning children
vi
• limited fiscal space and financial resources, especially a limited public budget dedicated to services
for children
• social norms that are not in line with human rights values concerning the position of children in
society and family
• a widespread acceptance of violence against children and women, including the acceptance of child
marriage and kidnapping for forced marriage.
Conclusions
The assessment on relevance and impact shows that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan responded to the needs of children
in the country, especially those who are the most vulnerable and has supported policy and institutional
development. This success was based, in large part, on advocacy and technical assistance to strengthen data
analysis and research on children’s needs and to promote evidence-based decision making. This ensured
that the needs of vulnerable children inform governmental priorities, regardless of political and
institutional changes. The elaboration of strategic documents and of specific instruments, including the
planned scale-up of the Child Development Centres (CDCs), were evidence of effectiveness.
In addition to its evidence-based advocacy strategy, UNICEF developed and engaged strategic partnerships
that moved its agenda forward. This was evidenced by the CP design and adaptation in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and other contextual changes over the past two years.
UNICEF supported the government’s initiatives to strengthen its capacity to collect, analyse and use data
through capacity building programmes, including trainings for key stakeholders. UNICEF also worked with
state officials on budgeting for social services. UNICEF’s impact on improving the lives of children was most
apparent on a national scale when UNICEF implemented its strategic focus alongside institutional
strengthening activities. For instance, these strategic partnerships resulted in improvements in maternal
and child health in maternity hospitals and in ECE (as part of the larger area of ECD). This approach
represents good practice that can be used to promote results at national scale in other sub-areas of ECD,
including early interventions for children with disabilities and home visiting services.
UNICEF identified and reassessed bottlenecks throughout the implementation of the CP and implemented
strategies to cope with them in a changing context. This included advocacy interventions and capacity
building programmes, strengthening cross-sectoral cooperation to compensate for political and civil service
instability and the associated risks to sustainability.
Stakeholders appreciated UNICEF’s contribution to behavioural changes among duty bearers and
caregivers, but this impact was limited by deeply embedded social norms and values. It may take longer
than the timeframe of a single CP to see substantial results impact in areas such as UNICEF’s work to end
violence against children and child marriage or improve the situation for children with disabilities.
In addition, it takes time to generate observable impact in areas that require cross-sectoral cooperation.
There is, for example, the need to strengthen coordination between different government institutions
resulted in slow progress on the development of an early identification system for and provision of services
for children with disabilities.
UNICEF improved its approach to gender equality during the CP, with substantial efforts to apply a strategic
and systemic approach in all outcome areas. This evaluation concludes that the strategic approach to gender
equality increased UNICEF’s effectiveness and chances of impact, as evidenced by girls’ increased access to
services.
UNICEF’s case study on the impact on social protection, interviews, and workshops with the CO
representatives and staff showed that social work is insufficiently effective in the country. The lack of social
workers’ numbers, training, prestige, and influence left them unable to fulfil the role of central actors for
social inclusion and child protection despite stakeholder interviewers indicating support for social workers
in this role.
vii
Lessons learned
Comparing UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s experience in ECD and ECE offers lessons for generating change for
children at scale. UNICEF worked with the Government and development partners to integrate ECE with
the strategic priorities for the country, with the MoES creating a dedicated ECE department. UNICEF
supported capacity building, and trainings to improve ECE budgeting at national and local levels. UNICEF
also promoted building the Child Development Centres. This combination of strategic, institutional and local
activities contributed to increased access to ECE for children across the country. In contrast, the strategic
approach and institutional strengthening activities were not as strong in the promotion of home visits,
another component of ECD policy, resulting in fewer visible results in this area.
Experience in ECD and ECE shows the need to develop a vision for strategically strengthening duty bearing
institutions for the benefit of staff and rights holders. A systematic approach would also facilitate the
monitoring and addressing problems that arise during the programme.
Innovative approaches based on model/piloting projects and the use of innovative technologies have
generated impact for children at local levels, as seen in UNICEF’s work on adolescent and youth
participation. However, these approaches require strategic development on institutional and technical
levels if they are to be scaled up by the government. Successful upscale requires full government ownership.
This involves planning and budgeting at governmental scale from the outset. and continuous monitoring
and evaluation of a programme before and after upscale to inform the institutionalization of programmes
at government level.
The impact assessment conducted for this report confirms the importance of evidence-driven decisions for
the sake of children, but that is not enough for results at scale. This assessment shows that evidence driven
policies can produce results at scale when implemented with strategic partnerships and resourcing for
children.
Partnerships with other UN Agencies, local developmental partners and CSOs produced the greatest results
when they strategically meet the advocacy goals. UNICEF Kyrgyzstan was successful in leveraging its
partnership strategy in some areas, such as social protection, child protection, and ECD, and this could be a
model for UNICEF’s work in other countries.
The years 2020 and 2021 demonstrated the value of youth engagement in a young society. Young volunteers
helped respond to COVID-19, participated in many UNICEF activities, and showed political activism. The
youth of Kyrgyzstan have demanded a voice and shown their importance in shaping Kyrgyzstan’s future.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1. Continue to strengthen evidence-based, innovative and diverse approaches in
Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC). This recommendation
considers the social norms that hinder the promotion of child rights. UNICEF should focus on capacity
building for partners. This will allow a systematic approach that shifts away from stand-alone and donor-
driven campaigns. C4D and C4BC strategies and interventions should be informed by data and evidence
driven policy making, as well as social listening. Digital engagement, social mobilization, the engagement of
young people and communities, and the use of mobile games and social media can contribute to knowledge
building, uptake of and demand for services, and changing harmful behaviours and social norms.
Recommendation 2. Develop clear advocacy strategies and sustainability strategies for each
modelling/pilot project, and gain support from development partners and other UN agencies to
enhance the impact of advocacy in promoting new policy measures. Evidence collected and lessons
learned reveal conditions that need to be met from the moment of planning local pilot and model projects.
Projects were most effective when they included realistic strategies for upscale, a recognition of budget
limitations and budget uptake by the government, plans for strengthening institutional capacity at local and
national level, and means for ongoing monitoring and evaluation. New measures institutionalized by the
viii
government increased the linkage between data analysis and service delivery, increasing the capacity for
evidence-based decision making.
Recommendation 3. The leveraging of partnerships should be continued and extended, particularly
in child protection and social protection, including social cash benefits as well as the development
of social services and social work. This supports access for the most vulnerable children to other key
services such as child protection, health, education, justice. Placing social work at the centre of a support
ecosystem would increase access for the most vulnerable children to other key services. Implementing this
recommendation requires a comprehensive evaluation of the existing social protection system to establish
a strategy for reform. It also requires the development of social service workers’ competencies and public
image.
Recommendation 4. Support the development of cross-sectoral cooperation in areas where it is
essential for the realization of child rights and most prominently for the realization of the rights of
children with disabilities. This includes ECE, adolescent empowerment and engagement, fighting violence
against children, and mitigating the impact of climate change on children. Planning cross-sectoral
approaches at the national level contributes to developing cross-sectoral practices at the local level.
Recommendation 5. Continue and extend support for the participation of children and adolescents
in decision making in relation to public institutions at national and local level. UNICEF should
advocate, with the government and development partners/donors, for consistent support for youth
organizations and youth consultative bodies. It should especially promote the participation of children and
adolescents in schools, as an entry point for developing their wider public participation.
Recommendation 6. Develop a strategic approach for partnership and cooperation with
development partners, other UN agencies and civil society. Strategic partnerships should extend the
scope of partnership and cooperation to enhance the impact of advocacy and enlarge the circle of
partners. A stakeholder analysis at outcome or output levels during CPD planning should identify the most
influential potential partners and establish partnerships in the initial phases of the advocacy processes.
Strategic partners should assist in planning specific advocacy activities.
Recommendation 7. Introduce monitoring tools to trace more clearly the change pathways from
UNICEF activities to results for children. Documenting the path from monitoring and research to
government policy decisions, to implementation at national and local levels, to the assessment of the results
for children should inform future evaluations and decisions. Improving the registration of institutional
memory and tracing the connections between advocacy, policy, and declarations on policies or institutional
changes would yield a better understanding of how policy change happens.

1. Introduction
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Programme
(CP) 2018-2022. The evaluation was commissioned by the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office
(ECARO) of UNICEF. It is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE), covering country
programme evaluations in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine and includes a synthesis
report.
The evaluation was conducted between February and September 2021 and covers the entire UNICEF
portfolio during the first three and a half years of the five-year programme. In addition, the evaluation
considers previous activities that continued during that time and that contributed to UNICEF impact,
considering UNICEF’s global strategic plan 2018-2022.
The Kyrgyzstan CP 2018–2022 had an initial budget of US$6.73 million from regular resources and US$25
million in other resources. It aimed to reach every child and young person across the whole country through
national level policy change and service improvements at every level (national, provincial and district). The
CP had three strategic pillars: (1) Child Rights-based Monitoring System and Decision Making; (2) Equitable
Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning and Development; (3) Child Protection and Access to
Justice.
This is a strategic evaluation that complements the sectoral evaluations and specialized studies that have
been conducted by UNICEF and external experts during this period. The evaluation report complements the
Situational Analysis (SitAn) conducted in 2021 in Kyrgyzstan and, together with the SitAn is intended to
inform the priorities for the next UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CP and (b) the decisions on the most effective
strategies to be used for a CP that has real impact. The evaluation assesses the relevance, coherence and
impact achieved throughout the implementation of the CP. It is a contribution to accountability and draws
transferable lessons learned for the future and for other UNICEF Country Offices.
UNICEF’s partners were usually government ministries, agencies and departments at national level, but a
substantial number of the projects and programmes of UNICEF Country Office (CO) in Kyrgyzstan have also
aimed to strengthen institutions at regional or local level. Therefore, the evaluation assesses the
collaboration of the CP not just with government structures, but also with United Nations (UN) agencies and
other development partners, as well as the civil society organizations (CSOs) that participated in the CP as
implementing partners or in joint advocacy efforts alongside UNICEF.
This introductory chapter describes the aims, objectives and scope of the evaluation, the context within
which UNICEF has been operating, and the overall shape and content of the CP itself. Chapter 2 explains the
methodology of the evaluation, including ethical considerations. Its findings are presented in Chapter 3,
organized according to the main evaluation criteria of this specific evaluation (relevance, coherence and
impact) and the evaluation questions set by UNICEF. Based on the findings, Chapter 4 presents conclusions,
lessons learned, and recommendations emerging from the evaluation criteria and with special focus on
selected impact areas.
1.1. The context and current situation
Kyrgyzstan is a land-locked, lower-middle-income country of 6.5 million people. Almost half (48.8
per cent) of the population in Kyrgyzstan is under the age of 25, and almost one-third of its people
are between 15 and 25 years old.
The country has rich endowments, and there is significant potential for the expansion of its agriculture
sector, hydroelectricity production, and tourism industry. Although demographic trends reflect growing
urbanization, this remains a strongly rural country, with 65.8 per cent of the population still lives in rural
1
areas, compared to only an OECD average of 22 per cent.4 There are more than 100 minority ethnic
communities in Kyrgyzstan, constituting over a quarter (27 per cent) of its inhabitants. Ethnic Uzbeks, who
make up the largest minority, and Tajiks live primarily in the southern regions of Osh, Batken and Jalalabad.
While ethnic relations have been stable in recent years, they “remain fragile” and issues such as the
“underrepresentation of minorities” and “unfair treatment by law enforcement” could “bring the level of
inter-ethnic tension to a breaking point”, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues.5 In
addition, there are still child marriages and the practice of bride kidnaping is tolerated in some communities
in Kyrgyzstan6. In general, there is a sense that human rights values are not yet embedded across society.
Labour migration has a significant impact on national economic and social development, but there seem to
be varying formats for its measurement. The State Migration Service7 estimates that over 800,000 Kyrgyz
citizens work abroad, mostly in Russia and Kazakhstan, with most migrants coming from the country’s
southern regions. Although remittances contribute about 28 per cent of the country’s gross domestic
product (GDP), the migration of adolescents and young adults impacts negatively on its social care
mechanisms and family patterns and, in the long-term, impedes economic growth and development by
eroding its social capital.
In 2019, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Committee developed a Child Poverty and
Deprivation Index, with support from UNICEF. This assessed child wellbeing based on 28 indicators,
grouped under six categories – material child poverty; health status; mortality rates; education and ECE;
living conditions and quality of life; and childhood risks. This allows for a more nuanced assessment of
children’s lives in the Kyrgyz Republic.

According to the Voluntary National Review on the Implementation of SDGs in the Kyrgyz Republic, the
country is “committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The
Sustainable Development Goals have been included in public policies and are reflected in the National
Development Strategy (2018–2040) of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the “Unity, Trust, Creation” (2018–2022)
Program of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, based on people-centered approach.”8 According to the
report, in the implementation of the Agenda for Sustainable Development, country has virtually eliminated
extreme poverty. General education is free, accessible and compulsory. The Kyrgyz Republic has also
become one of the first countries in the world to fully resolve the issue of statelessness. However, under
Goal 3, the review notes that “not enough attention is paid to the reproductive health of men, related
oncological diseases and public awareness raising on these topics”9
However, poverty and child poverty are still serious issues in Kyrgyzstan and data show that the impact of
the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a social and economic crisis, starting in 2021. Poverty
continues to be a large problem, with 20.1 per cent of the population living in poverty in 2019, and children
overrepresented in poverty statistics.10 This situation is resulting in poor access to quality services and
protection, and it is heightening vulnerability to natural and human-made disasters.11 Children living in
poverty miss pre-school and school education and healthcare, and face malnutrition. The poorest children
live in rural areas in the southern regions of the country and belong to families with three and more children
and families with unemployed adults. Malnutrition rates in Kyrgyzstan decreased for stunting and wasting
within biological norms between 2006-2018, but there needs to be further progress to achieve the SDG
targets.
Beyond the immediate health impacts, the pandemic has had serious socio-economic consequences.
Kyrgyzstan's real GDP declined by 8.6 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019. The World Bank estimates that
the poverty rate could increase markedly because of falling remittances and incomes, and rising
unemployment, prices, and health expenditures. According to preliminary results of the phone-based follow

up Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 50 per cent of households reported a reduction in income, and
one fifth reported challenges in accessing healthcare services in 2020 compared to 2019.12
The pandemic and ensuing lockdown highlighted the limited ability of Kyrgyzstan’s authorities to mobilize
an effective response to such a crisis. Changes of key officials during the pandemic - including the Prime
Minister, the Vice Prime Minister for Social Affairs, and the Minister of Health - further inhibited the crisis
response. There was, however, an impressive mobilization of volunteers – especially young people who
offered invaluable support – to fill the gaps in access to healthcare and services. They assisted patients
directly at home, as well as supporting medical staff in hospitals.13
Education is another area disrupted by the pandemic. Despite the development of a remote learning
platform for all students and preschool children, conducted by the Ministry of Education and Science with
UNICEF support. School closures were especially harmful for children with special educational needs who
lost all access to psycho-pedagogical professionals. This was a particular challenge, given that Kyrgyzstan
only ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in May 2019 and
where services where only just starting to develop in line with its provisions.
The pandemic also affected the well-being of children and young people in terms of their mental health.
More than 60 per cent of adolescents are now experiencing elevated levels of pandemic-related anxiety.14
The parliamentary elections of 2020 generated protests related to election fraud. The political upheaval
that followed, the election of the new President15 and the country’s constitutional changes16 raised concerns
over the sustainability of reforms and the observance of rule of law in Kyrgyzstan.
In the light of the latest reforms in the country, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic signed the Decree ‘On
the inventory of the Legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic’ (dated 8 February 2021, No. 26) to optimize and
improve the entire legislative framework. The country’s inter-departmental Expert Group17 has been
conducting a complete inventory of the adopted concepts, strategies, programmes and laws of the Kyrgyz
Republic for compliance with the current Constitution and principles of social justice and partnership to
eliminate internal juridical contradictions, collisions and gaps. UNICEF have been present in the Expert
Group to provide support its works.
In this context, the country remains committed to all major international human rights treaties, as
successive governments have supported reform initiatives to transition towards an open, democratic and
pluralist society. Article 06 of the 2021 Constitution18 provides that the norms of international law shall be

15 After the referendum on 10 January 2021 (alongside presidential elections when the new President Sadyr Japarov was elected),
Kyrgyzstan voted to change the system of government from parliamentary to presidential (with a turnout of around 40 per cent
of voters). The new President declared far-reaching constitutional reforms in the country.
16 The joint opinion of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the Venice Commission of the
Council of Europe notes positive changes in the draft Constitution, such as giving human rights and freedoms a prominent place in
the overall framework and re-establishing the Constitutional Court in line with earlier recommendations. But it also finds
concerns that many provisions regulating the institutional framework and separation of powers as well as the foreseen timeline
and procedures leading to the adoption of the constitutional amendments In addition to demonstrating a lack of respect for the
principles of rule of law and legality, they also took place with little or no public consultation or parliamentary debate
(www.osce.org/odihr/481864).
17 The members of the interdepartmental expert group are representatives of the Parliament (Jogorku Kenesh) of the Kyrgyz
Republic, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic, the General Prosecutor's Office of the Kyrgyz Republic, executive authorities
and local self-government bodies, business structures, non-governmental organizations and independent experts.

the constituent part of the legal system of the Kyrgyz Republic and that ratified international agreements,
including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, shall have direct action.19
On health, the MICS 2018 indicates that antenatal care overwhelmingly (99.8 per cent) takes place in a
health facility, and in most cases (84 per cent) a doctor provides it, with only 15 per cent supplied by nurses,
midwives and feldshers. Kyrgyzstan has made progress in halving its child mortality rate from 39 deaths
for every 1,000 live births in 2006 to 19 per 1,000 in 2018, and in reducing its neonatal mortality rate, from
19 deaths per 1,000 in 2006 to 13 per 1,000 in 2017). This progress allows the achievement of the
achievement of SDG targets.20
In the field of education, the country reported elevated levels of access to education, with almost universal
attendance in primary education (98.7 per cent). Data show that students complete compulsory education
and that over 86 per cent continue beyond lower secondary education, but less than half of those move on
to tertiary education.21 However, the quality of education remains a problem, with 59.8 per cent of primary
school students not attaining the minimal acceptable reading and comprehension skills in 2017.22 This was
an improvement in comparison with 2014, when 65 per cent of children in grade four were not reading at
their grade level.23 Nevertheless, the issue of quality education remains largely unaddressed. There is still a
13-percentage-point gap in reading skills between children in rural and urban areas, with urban children
doing better. There are also significant regional differences, with 74 per cent of children demonstrating
foundational reading skills in the capital, Bishkek, falling to only 39 per cent in Naryn.24
Kyrgyzstan faces child protection challenges. For example, violence against children and women remains
widespread. MICS 2018 found that 47.5 per cent of children in Kyrgyzstan are exposed to physical
punishment, and 5.4 per cent of children are exposed to severe physical punishment. In all, 70 per cent of
children have experienced psychological aggression. A quarter of adolescents (25 per cent) believe that a
husband may beat his wife sometimes.25
There has, however, been progress on statelessness, with Kyrgyzstan becoming the first country to end
statelessness in 2019. This followed a nationwide campaign by UNICEF, other United Nations agencies and
civil society that identified and resolved the status of 13,700 people without a nationality, including 2,000
children – all of whom had the right to protection from public authorities.26
Meanwhile, fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) in Kyrgyzstan, and particularly in Bishkek, has reached
hazardous levels during winter, primarily the result of coal burning. This trend threatens to compound the
impact of respiratory issues induced by COVID-19 and carries long-term health implications for the
population, especially children.27
According to the 2021 SitAn, the civil society sector in the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the strongest in Central
Asia.28 However, management and communication lines within and across the various levels of government
and between government and civil society actors seem complex and sometimes opaque.
Despite criticism by civil society and the international community, Kyrgyzstan’s President Sadyr Japarov
endorsed amendments to the country’s Law on Non-Commercial Organizations and the Law on State

Registration of Legal Entities (26 June 2021), which introduce new and burdensome financial reporting
obligations for Kyrgyzstan’s non-governmental organizations (NGOs).29 Some pre-existing legislation
already requires NGOs to provide detailed information on a regular basis about their activities and finances
to the tax service, statistical authorities and other state bodies. Civil society and interventional international
organizations raised concerns that the implementation of the new legislation might result in growing
pressure on NGOs that challenge public policies and seek accountability for corruption and human rights
violations, including violations of the rights of women, ethnic minorities, detainees and other vulnerable
groups.30
1.2. Country Programme components and goals
The overall goal of the UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 is to contribute to national efforts
on behalf of all children and adolescents in Kyrgyzstan, especially the most disadvantaged, to have
their rights progressively fulfilled and be able to develop to their full potential in an inclusive and
protective society.
Its Theory of Change (ToC) states that all children and adolescents in Kyrgyzstan, and particularly the most
disadvantaged, will live in a family environment, free from violence, exclusion and poverty. UNICEF and
other organizations and institutions will contribute to this ToC by raising the capacity of Kyrgyz authorities
to assist the most vulnerable children, to take evidence-based decisions and to provide services and access
to justice for all children. Adolescent participation and stronger social support for child rights are
instrumental for the long-term expected impact.
The CP has aimed for three core Outcomes: 1) Child Rights-based Monitoring System and Decision Making;
2) Equitable Access to Services for Child’s Survival, Learning and Development; and 3) Child Protection and
Access to Justice. An additional operation Outcome, Country Programme Effectiveness and Efficiency, is
relevant to this evaluation to the extent that actions undertaken by the CO to ensure programme
effectiveness and efficiency and to determine the relevance, coherence and impact of the other outcome
areas. The CP aims to contribute to the achievement of 10 of the 17 Sustainment Development Goals (SDGs)
in Kyrgyzstan: SDGs 1 (Poverty), 3 (Health), 4 (Education), 5 (Gender equality), 6 (Water and sanitation),
10 (Inequalities), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 13 (Climate action), 16 (Peace, justice and
strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the goals)
The three Programme Outcomes are mutually reinforcing. Outcome 1 focuses on the capacity of the Kyrgyz
Government and civil society to collect, analyse, disseminate and utilize data to develop policy and monitor
the barriers faced by the most disadvantaged children, and to base their decisions on credible evidence. For
example, the identification of ‘hidden populations’ in terms of their marginalization and social vulnerability,
is vital for the solutions to the challenges they face. Another key component under Outcome 1 is the use of
data for budgetary planning that answers the needs of identified vulnerable children.
Outcome 2 supports the improvement of health and education services for the survival and development of
vulnerable children. It also includes activities and advocacy for local and national actions and investments
to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on children.
Outcome 3 focuses on child rights and includes the strengthening of the child protection system for the most
vulnerable children to ensure that it aligns with international standards. This outcome includes
interventions on social work, ensuring provisions for children’s basic needs, and ensuring child access to
justice.
29 The new reporting requirements apply specifically to NGOs – organizations registered as public associations, foundations and
institutions, but not to other non-profit organizations, such as religious associations or political parties, or to commercial
organizations. The amendments also specifically state that the new reporting requirements do not apply to non-commercial
organizations affiliated with state or municipal institutions. For these reasons, the new requirements are discriminatory in
nature.
30 (www.iphronline.org/kyrgyzstan-ensure-that-new-legislation-does-not-impede-ngo-activity.html)
6
While Outcomes 1 and 2 include activities that target social norms, Outcome 3 includes specific
interventions to overcome the negative social norms and practices that affect development and protection
of children and their access to justice. It includes support for adolescents’ participation in society and their
dialogue with decision makers as one approach promoted to identify and address children’s needs and
vulnerabilities.
Figure 1 illustrates the key elements of the CP Theory of Change. Annex 3 includes a presentation of UNICEF
Kyrgyzstan CO stakeholders, main partners and donors in the implementation of the CP.
The ToC refers to disadvantaged children following the text of the CP. The questions for this evaluation
refer to vulnerable children. For this evaluation the two terms are interchangeable.

1.3. Objective, purpose, and scope of the evaluation
The objective of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE) is to conduct a formative
multi-country evaluation that serves two purposes: accountability and learning. The MCPE
assesses the relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the
Country Programmes in the four countries (Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine) to
identify good practices, and draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations that can
inform the 2023-2027 CP planning processes that have either commenced or will commence
shortly in all four countries.
In line with its Terms of Reference, the purpose of the MCPE is threefold:
- to strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s
contribution to the results for children at scale, especially for the most vulnerable in Bulgaria,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine
- to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) in each
country by understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies through
which the CP delivery has bettered understand the added value of UNICEF in each country
context
- to draw lessons from the previous CPD implementation to make the best use of UNICEF’s change
strategies in each country covered by the evaluation and in the region, while considering current
circumstances.
To produce the information and data that enable the assessment of progress on these three purposes,
the evaluation assesses:
- the linkages between international, regional, national and institutional strategies to bring about
overall improvement in the status of children, with a view to clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of national stakeholders and how UNICEF interventions can add value and
contribute to policy development for systemic improvements
- the extent to which interventions focus on and deliver results for the most vulnerable categories
of children in each of the four countries;
- the performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF level, the quality of
indicators, and the capacity of those indicators to measure and communicate results, including
the measurement of horizontal issues (gender, participation, equity, most vulnerable).
In the framework of the MCPE, this report focuses on the UNICEF’s CP in Kyrgyzstan. Evidence collected
from interventions implemented in the country between 2018 and June 2021 (under the current CPD)
and, to a more limited extent, earlier years, led to this strategy. Specific activities to ease the negative
consequences of the current pandemic crisis on children are considered to the extent that they are part
of the results chains in the areas selected.
The scope of this Country Programme Evaluation is, therefore, as follows.31
- Temporal scope: 2018 to June 2021, covering the current CP (2018-2022) to date. However,
when relevant to the observed impact, the temporal scope of the evaluation extended to the
previous years and previous CPD.
- Geographic scope: All areas in Kyrgyzstan where UNICEF works, including initiatives that have
started as pilots and that are being implemented with the intention of expanding to national
scale.
- Portfolio scope: All portfolio components, including cross-cutting issues such as gender, and
inter-sectoral support involving gender and communication.
31 According to the Terms of Reference (ToR).
10
- Organizational scope: The CO and wider provision of technical support and oversight from
UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO) and, when relevant, UNICEF
headquarters.
- Excluded from the scope of the evaluation: The evaluation does not provide a detailed
assessment of all CP components. However, a more in-depth impact assessment will provide
lessons learned and UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for children at scale.
This evaluation report includes an evaluation brief that summarizes the most important findings,
conclusions and recommendations.
The primary users of this Country Programme Evaluation are the UNICEF CO and ECARO. Secondary
users of the evaluation are the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, other UN agencies and development
partners present in Kyrgyzstan. Annex 3 includes a presentation of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CO stakeholders,
main partners and donors in the implementation of the CP. The evaluation report aims to build on the
agreements made between all these parties and to assist the prioritization and establishment of
strategies for the future as they move together into the next planning and programme cycle.
2. Methodology
2.1. Evaluation framework: criteria and questions
The MCPE focuses on the CPD and its ToC. The Evaluation Matrix was developed during the
Inception Phase, as the core analytical framework against which data would be gathered and
analysed (Annex 5). All evaluation questions were assigned to a specific evaluation criterion:
relevance, coherence and impact. For each evaluation question, related indicators/descriptors,
sources of information and data collection methods were specified in the matrix. The indicators
and methods were based on the preliminary documentary review conducted during the
Inception Phase of the evaluation.
The evaluation questions in the evaluation matrix are provided in the ToR and indicated to be final and
not subject to change. Although the ToR provided each CO with the opportunity to add up to two more
questions, no additional evaluation questions were proposed by the COs during the Inception Phase.
The evaluation matrix is built on an overall approach that links evaluation criteria and level. On the one
hand, analyses and findings on ‘Relevance’ and ‘Coherence’ (realized for the entire CP) are to be
considered under ‘Impact’ as UNICEF’s interventions cannot have an impact if they are not relevant. On
the other, UNICEF’s impact (its contribution to an observed change) might also be determined by other
interventions that are implemented by, e.g., other donors, with UNICEF adding value in this context.
The evaluation of impact influences the entire CP. However, a more in-depth impact assessment three
selected areas: early childhood development (ECD) and early childhood education (ECE); adolescents’
engagement and participation; and social protection to provide conclusions; and lessons learned on
UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. The assessment of these three
areas will contribute to findings and conclusions as examples (case studies) of the achievement of
results at scale (or falling short). The three areas have relate to the initial analysis of the evaluation team
and in consultation with the CO. From one perspective, the evaluation questions relate to how UNICEF
contributed to change for children at scale can be answered using specific theory-based impact
evaluation methods, as described below. But these methods best apply to selected cases, rather than to
complex and heterogenous programmes. However, the areas selected represent results achieved by
UNICEF, with various levels of change for children at scale generated by UNICEF that are worthy of
analysis.
The evaluation utilized a formative approach to the evaluation to look back and assess the relevance,
coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the CP, to identify good practices, and
draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations to inform the 2023-2027 CP planning process,
11
which commenced in the last quarter of 2021. The evaluation team adopted a utilization-focused
approach, as the evaluation is meant to inform the next UNICEF Kyrgyzstan programmatic cycle.32
The evaluation involved three phases: (1) inception; (2) data collection; and (3) analysis and reporting.
The methodology used a mixed methods approach involving qualitative as well as quantitative data
collection methods. Information from different lines of inquiry was triangulated to improve the
reliability of and to validate the findings.
2.2. Data collection and analysis methods
The team engaged with UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan, government authorities, public
institutions, civil society partners and other development agencies to ensure that the evaluation
responds to the needs and priorities of the users.
The evaluation used the following methods of data collection: (a) document review (Annex 8); (b) key
stakeholder interviews; and (c) a survey of UNICEF CO staff for the social network analysis for the
assessment of the coherence of the CP and UNICEF partnerships.
Semi-structured interviews were the main tool used with national partners, reflecting the upstream
nature of the programme and the status of the respondents. A variety of stakeholders provided the
primary data, including government officials, UNICEF staff, civil society organizations and development
partners (see the list of interviewed stakeholders in Annex 6). In total, 30 individual interviews occurred
remotely because of COVID-19 restrictions. International interviewers and national consultants,
working in pairs or individually, conducted the interviews. Checklists guided the interviews, to support
the consistency of data collection across the team and varied stakeholders. However, questions for each
interview were tailored as appropriate to make the best use of the position and knowledge of the
interviewee. In line with the ethical considerations presented below, the evaluation team ensured the
confidentiality of the interviewees, without connecting the evidence and opinions expressed during
meetings to the identity of the stakeholder The positive and open approach of most respondents was
quite striking and much appreciated.
The selection of the key informants followed a dedicated sampling strategy that was agreed with the
ECARO and CO at the end of the Inception Phase. The aim of the sampling strategy was to cover the
Country Programme in general and the three selected impact areas mentioned above in particular, and
to include several types of key informants (UNICEF staff, representatives of the government,
representatives of other UN agencies and development agencies, representatives of academia, services
providers and implementing partners) in the list of interviewees for each area. Following the design of
the CP and the focus of its activities, the priority of planned results at national level emerged, so the
project was designed to spend more time with stakeholders at the national level.
In line with the Terms of References (ToR) of the evaluation, children and adolescents have not been
interviewed or consulted directly in another way. The evaluation team decided instead to rely on
sectoral evaluations and studies (the list of evaluations and studies used for this report is included in
Annex 8) that have presented the perspectives of these groups more thoroughly than would have been
possible during this evaluation. The evaluation team instead met representatives of intermediary
groups that work closely with vulnerable children.
Three participatory online workshops were organized with CO staff. These aimed to: (1) familiarize the
evaluation team with the CP and identify and select the impact areas to be assessed more in-depth; (2)
present the inception report, discuss key issues to be addressed by the evaluation and plan data
collection in cooperation with the CO; and (3) present and validate the findings and discuss preliminary
recommendations.
The analysis methods are mentioned in the evaluation matrix. A theory-based approach was applied
for the evaluation, based on the explicit sectoral ToCs developed by the UNICEF CO (and reconstructed
by the evaluation team) for the CP and the three selected impact areas. A brief presentation of the

methodology for Process Tracing and Contribution Analysis methodologies used for the selected areas
can be found in Annex 2. Another essential analysis method was the Realist Evaluation. According to
Westhorp (2014) realist approaches “assume that nothing works everywhere or for everyone, and that
context really does make a difference to programme outcomes”.33 A Realist Evaluation focuses, therefore, on
how, why and in what contexts an intervention leads to a particular outcome.
Finally, stakeholder analysis34 and social network analysis were other important evaluation
methods utilized to inform the evaluation of the coherence, added value and cooperation with
stakeholders of the UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CO to enhance the results pursued. The stakeholders analysis
was undertaken in the inception phase of the evaluation and before data collection and allowed the
identification of the most important stakeholders for UNICEF CO. The Social Network Analysis was used
to for visualizing and evaluating the strength of the partnership network of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CO,
measuring the frequency of communication, stability of collaboration and influence of partners on
UNICEF work.
In addition, systems-based evaluation principles were used throughout the evaluation, as UNICEF’s
interventions are not evaluated in a vacuum, but within a complex context that must be considered.
Among the used principles are: holism and non-summativity – considering that the stakeholders
network of UNICEF and the group of activities and strategies implemented at the same time as capable
to generate synergic results that represent more than the sum of parts (of results generated by each
stakeholder and/or activity); participation of stakeholders; equifinality and multifinality approaches –
considering that the same results can be obtained with multiple strategies and the fact that one strategy
can generate different results in different contexts.35
Conclusions have been formulated that consider the findings under different evaluation criteria and
their interdependence. Lessons learned are formulated based on the experience of the UNICEF
Kyrgyzstan CO, considering the most important challenges and the experiences of responding to these
challenges that could be transferred to other situations and countries. The recommendations were
developed by the evaluation team, based on in-country consultations on the early draft findings, and the
later analysis of the data, findings and conclusions. The specific wording of the recommendations was
developed in consultation with the CO, which provided feedback, comments and questions throughout
the report drafting process. Two meetings were organized with the staff of the CO to validate and discuss
recommendations in detail. A focus group for findings, conclusions and recommendations validation
was organized after the first presentation of the Country Programme Evaluation report, with the
participation of the CO team.
2.3. Limitations
The main challenge facing the evaluation arose from the spread of UNICEF’s objectives and its
strategies in Kyrgyzstan during a period of socio-economic and political instability. Overall, the
changes that UNICEF seeks to make are mostly long-term and countrywide and the 3.5-year
timeframe (the period covered by the evaluation for the Country Programme 2018-2022) is not
long enough to allow for impact for children at scale.
In addition, the evaluated period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic (since March 2020) and a
change of political regime (in 2020-2021). In this context, the sustainability of UNICEF impact, as
assessed in this report, may be uncertain as the evaluation team is not able to confidently or clearly
predict the extent to which the strategies of upstream policy work will benefit children in the country.

34 Social network analysis (SNA) is a field of data analytics that uses networks and graph theory to understand social
structures. To build SNA graphs, two key components are required: actors and relationships. In network analysis, actors are
referred to as nodes (the dots on the graph) and relationships as edges (the lines on the graph).

Systems-based Approach”.
13
It is also difficult to assess whether the benefits already achieved will last, given the social and economic
crisis generated by the pandemic, which adds another layer of complexity.
In most areas, UNICEF promoted the further alignment of government policies with international best
practices and standards. This alignment – and indeed the policies themselves – depends on high-level
decisions and it was not always possible for the evaluation team to meet state officials at this level to
determine their perceptions of UNICEF’s contribution.
Assessing UNICEF’s contribution to results at outcome or output level was another difficult area. The
programme has devoted considerable attention to the question of causality, and the evaluation included
the identification of who or what is responsible for changes at various levels of policymaking or for the
implementation of new policies. These considerations were summarized in the ToC adopted for each
main sector in the UNICEF programme; they also helped UNICEF staff assess the possible pathways to
successful implementation of quality services or child rights. However, as UNICEF is not the only
stakeholder influencing the government, it is difficult to identify UNICEF’s precise contribution. The
analysis, therefore, focuses on UNICEF contribution. Apportioning the amount of influence of each main
player was not easy, but the evaluation attempted to do this, as will be seen in the examples of UNICEF’s
work provided in this report.
The evaluation team faced limitations during the design and evaluation phase of the CP.
- The documentation of the ToC was not systematic – an issue that was addressed by the
development, testing and validation of an indicative ToC to serve as framework for evaluation.
However, in the case of Process Tracing and Contribution Analysis, not all the desired evidence
was available. For example, UNICEF claims to contribute to the institutionalization of ECE
through the creation of a separate department for early education within the Ministry of
Education. However, there is no evidence available to connect UNICEF advocacy with the
creation of this department. Another example relates to decisions that improved the social
protection system of cash benefits in 2020. Although there is a clear similarity between UNICEF
recommendations and the decisions made by the Government, there is no unambiguous
evidence on how the recommendations influenced the official decisions.
- As the data collection phase took place in July and August 2021, during the summer holiday
season, five of the key informants were not available or reachable at the time of evaluation.
However, a sufficiently high number of interviews were conducted to allow evaluators to
respond to the evaluation questions with enough confidence.
2.4. Ethical issues and consideration of child rights, equity and gender
The evaluation team adhered to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical guidelines and
code of conduct. This means that the evaluation team upheld the appropriate obligations of
evaluators, including maintaining the independence, impartiality, credibility and accountability
of the individual team members and the evaluation process.
The evaluation team was not subject to any conflicts of interest and confirmed that they were able to
conduct the evaluation without any undue interference. Throughout data collection, analysis and
reporting, evaluators aimed to ensure the integrity of the evaluation by respecting the ethical standards
of UNICEF, as presented in the ‘UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and
Data Collection and Analysis’ (April 2015). Special attention was paid to the issues of harms and benefits,
informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, and conflicts of interest.
The main ethical issue that emerged during evaluation planning was the need for anonymity and
confidentiality for the government officials interviewed. The evaluation team ensured the consent of all
key informants to be interviewed and team members who conducted interviews gave assurances that
the comments made during the interviews would be anonymous. As a result, none of the statements
mentioned in this report are attributable to individuals or government departments. However, no
formal letter of consent on the collected data was needed as no children were involved directly in the
evaluation.
14
As mentioned, the selection of key informants was based on the stakeholders analysis and
recommendations for the CO, but special attention was given to ensuring a balance of interviewed key
informants by gender. Out of the 30 interviewees, 17 were females and 13 males.
2.5. Management of the evaluation
The evaluation team maintained close contact with the CO representatives and staff, as well as
UNICEF evaluation managers and UNICEF regional advisors in ECARO. The interviews with
ECARO advisors were a major help in enabling the evaluation team to develop its analysis.
The team presented its findings to an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) consisting of representatives
from the Government, UN agencies, donors, public agencies and CSOs. The meeting was well attended
and provided an opportunity for all parties to comment on the current UNICEF programme and to raise
issues to be addressed in the future.

3. Main evaluation findings
3.1. Relevance
3.1.1. To what extent has UNICEF responded to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable throughout the programme implementation?
UNICEF responded very well to the changing needs of the most vulnerable children, throughout
the programme implementation. The relevance of the UNICEF CP is supported by extensive
research and the effective use of data. The updated information about the situation of all children
in Kyrgyzstan gives UNICEF the capacity to consider and address the challenges facing those who
are the most vulnerable, and to plan and implement activities for them. UNICEF contributed to
the development of State statistics to generate annual data, aiming to ensure continued
relevance of its programme and of policies for children. While most programme indicators are
not focused on vulnerable children and systematic monitoring did not happen, during evaluation
we have not identified groups of vulnerable children that are not considered in the programme
implementation.
UNICEF builds its programme on extensive evidence and lessons learned from the implementation of
previous interventions, as well as from needs assessments and studies conducted within the scope of
the current CP. All stakeholders consulted through interviews during the data collection phase stated
that the CP and its implementation strategies are adequate in terms of the changing needs of vulnerable
children, adolescents, and their families.
The 2016 SitAn also informed the evaluation, alongside a range of other evidence.36 The 2016 SitAn was
the main document that informed the current CPD and reviewed the remaining challenges for fulfilling
the rights of all children in the Kyrgyz Republic.37 The recommendations of the previous CP (2012-2017)
evaluation were also integrated into the 2018-2022 CPD.38
Based on the CP priorities and the context analysis, UNICEF aimed to reach all children of all ages in
Kyrgyzstan, both in the planning and the implementation phases of the programme. However, UNICEF’s
focus on vulnerable children means that it prioritizes closing the equity gaps among children under
every Outcome, but especially under Outcomes 2 and 3. These vulnerable children include children with
disabilities, girls, children at risk of violence (including child marriage) and the children of migrant
parents.39 In addition, the CP focused on adolescents and youth and their proactive engagement in
community dialogue, skills and competence building and their employability, as well as their
peacebuilding potential in the border areas with large minority groups. These interventions have been
aligned with the needs identified by SitAn 2016 and remain aligned with the needs of its target groups
as identified by SitAn 2021.
UNICEF has also been supporting the authorities at the national and local levels to meet the needs of
children and families by developing models and best practices that could be scaled up in the future.
These model projects (including the programme for early identification and services for children with
disabilities and developmental delays) target the most vulnerable children and are adapted to their
specific needs. It is important that proposed solutions for the development of services for children, such

Positioning 2016; Evaluation of the Multilingual Education Component of the Unity in Diversity Project in Kyrgyzstan 2016;
Evaluation of the School without Violence Programme 2015, Gender Programme Review 2016
37 The remaining challenges were reduction of poverty, reduction of maternal mortality and undernutrition, prevention of
violence against children and school dropouts, deinstitutionalization of children, prevention of HIV in most vulnerable
groups, poor quality of social services and empowerment of adolescents. These areas need renewed attention to achieve
further progress for children.
38 e.g., peacebuilding in multi-ethnic communities, border areas, prevention of violent extremism, and linking municipal-level
work to national-level change.
39 The programme priorities identified in the CPD: childcare and children of migrants; children’s access to justice; violence
against children including child marriage; Out of School Children and ECD; adolescent health and HIV/AIDS; child poverty;
children with disabilities; child mortality; malnutrition/stunting; DRR/climate change and lack of drinking water and
sanitation; and child participation and empowerment.

as services for early childhood development and education, consider the limited resources available at
local level in small towns and villages and are designed to encourage the use of community resources to
address the needs of children in rural areas.
There was an overall shift in the CP (2018-2022) from the service delivery that was more present in the
previous CP to technical assistance, with UNICEF acting as an advisory body to the Government in the
areas of healthcare, child protection, social protection, education, and justice for children. This shift was
possible because of the impact of the previous CP in such areas and the commitment of the Government
of the Kyrgyz Republic to develop services for children, within the context of the national
implementation of the United Nation Child Rights Convention (CRC), despite political instability.
Most indicators within the CP do not focus on the most vulnerable children. For example, activities are
designed to support the development of quality inclusive education at school and preschool level, but
the indicators reflect the general coverage of schools and pre-school facilities (kindergartens and
community based early education centres). Reports on inclusivity are not disaggregated to capture the
differences between boys and girls, or children from urban and rural areas. This is a deficiency of the CP
monitoring system, but the evaluation did not find that this was an impediment to address the identified
needs of the most vulnerable children40.
UNICEF has, however, developed and promoted tools for the multidimensional measurement of poverty
for the better identification of the needs of vulnerable children in annual statistics and to enable the
measurement of the impact of both national policies and its own activities.
As noted, UNICEF reports and other studies, as well as the interviews with UNICEF, UN agencies
representatives in Kyrgyzstan and other partners, suggests that the CP design and implementation
informed by analysis of the needs of vulnerable boys, girls and youth, including the geographical
distribution of vulnerabilities, with the CO commissioning studies showing regional differences and the
differences between urban and rural areas. These studies and contextual analyses were used during the
design and the implementation phase of the CP.41 One study, for example, generated evidence about
young people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and was conducted by UNICEF in partnership with
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in 2020. The study revealed the negative impact of the
pandemic on income, employment, social protection, education and health, as well as on the
psychological well-being of urban and rural youth and adolescents. The study found that 60 per cent of
young people felt anxiety about the pandemic but were more concerned about the well-being of their
relatives and friends, rather than for themselves. The study also identified the most vulnerable groups
affected by the pandemic: young people living with HIV/AIDS, with limited health opportunities, and the
children of migrants.42 The findings informed the UN’s COVID-19 response initiatives and UNICEF
activities in 2021.
The CP, therefore, also remained relevant to the newly identified needs of children, such as the negative
impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their well-being. UNICEF conducted a study on “COVID-19 impact
assessment on poverty and Potential implications of the COVID-19 crisis on social assistance for
children” ), which assessed the socio-economic impact of the pandemic on children and families and
contributed to the broader assessment led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), “COVID-19 in the Kyrgyz Republic: Socioeconomic and
Vulnerability Impact Assessment and Policy Response August” (2020).43 contributed to UNICEF also

Analysis on Children and Adolescents with Disabilities” (2021) to support the implementation of policy
measures in line with the newly ratified UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan also released its Humanitarian Situation Report (January-June 2021) on 13 August
2021 on the current situation and needs of children in the country and its regions, which was updated
to reflect UNICEF’s response and funding requirements in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its
efforts to provide humanitarian support wherever needed, both in 2020 and 2021.44
The implementation of the CP (2018-2022) also considered the needs of Kyrgyzstani children affected
by the conflicts in the Middle East and living in vulnerable conditions in Iraq and Syria. The CO provided
technical and financial support for repatriation and contributed, assuming a leading role among
international organizations, to the re-integration of 79 Kyrgyzstani children in Kyrgyz society. ensuring
adherence to child right principles. According to interviews for the evaluation, UNICEF was instrumental
in identifying and responding to their needs, mobilizing support from other UN Agencies and the
European Union (EU), providing children with support and advocating to the Government to ensure an
approached based on child rights to the situation of children affected by the conflicts in the Middle East.
3.1.2. To what extent has UNICEF consistently integrated equity and gender equality
in all aspects of programming and implementation, including policy and
advocacy?
UNICEF integrated equity and gender equality into all aspects of programming and
implementation, including policy and advocacy. As noted, the focus has been on the needs of the
most vulnerable children, aiming to narrow equity gaps between children. Gender equality is
integrated into programme planning and implementation in every component. Dedicated
gender sensitive approaches are implemented in the fields of health, education, adolescent
development and participation. Addressing gender-based violence (GBV), including child
marriage, is a priority for UNICEF in Kyrgyzstan. However, specific monitoring indicators for the
core objective of adolescent girls’ empowerment, engagement and participation are missing in
programme design.
The CP (2018-2022) has focused strongly on the principles of equity, gender and human rights. A human
rights-based approach has been applied to achieve sustainable progress across all programme results,
with an emphasis on participation and non-discrimination. The equity principle implies understanding
and addressing the root causes of inequality, so that every child has an opportunity to survive, develop
and reach their full potential without discrimination. The CP has focused on realizing UNICEF’s equity
and gender equality agenda across the country, complementing the efforts of the Government to provide
equitable access to healthcare, education, social services and justice for disadvantaged children. This is
visible in the increased capacity of service providers to meet the needs of children because of UNICEF
support. For example, hard-to-reach regions have received UNCEF support for the storage of vaccines
and the organization of immunization campaigns. In the field of justice, lawyers have been trained to
work with children and to consider child rights and are now better prepared to address the needs of
children in contact or in conflict with the law.
The UNICEF CO is strongly committed to the integration of gender equality into its programmes and
institutionally, including communication and data collection, planning and the implementation of
gender-responsive activities, in line with the needs revealed by the research and data available. The СО
conducted a gender review of the current CP with support from ECARO and HQ during the evaluation
period. As outlined in this gender review report, UNICEF integrated the gender dimension under
Outcomes 2 and 3. Under Outcome 2, the key areas were: the delivery of quality maternal, adolescent
health and child health services, including HIV services, neonatal and postnatal care, maternal and child
nutrition and gender-responsive home visiting services. Under Outcomes 2 and 3, the aim was to
strengthen the gender and equity dimension of access to education through gender-responsive teaching
systems, including gender-responsive curriculum, teacher training, gender-responsive EMIS, the Girls
and Science project (STEM4Girls) and life skills for girls. Under outcome 3, the key areas for the
44(https://reliefweb.int/report/kyrgyzstan/kyrgyzstan-humanitarian-situation-report-no-1)
19
integration of the gender dimension were Peacebuilding and Social Cohesion and Youth- and Child-
Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG) and corresponding communications and C4D; addressing GBV
including child marriage and bride kidnaping prevention; training of frontline workers: access to justice
and amendments to legislation; and positive parenting programme. There was also corresponding
communication for development (C4D) attention to gender equality,45 with the gender dimension
present in all communication messages and materials and communication campaigns to address gender
and vulnerability issues such as child marriage and the rights of children with disabilities.
UNICEF supported the development of the national action plan to prevent child marriage, which was
endorsed in September 2020 to consolidate and strengthen joint efforts in this area, actively working
with UN Women. As part of the Spotlight Initiative, UNICEF is monitoring judicial practice on child
marriage cases and developing a C4D roadmap to work in six pilot communities aiming to change social
norms in relation to this practice.46 UNICEF also supported the development of the National Gender
Equality Strategy 2021-2030 and National Plan of Action 2021-2023 (approval for both documents is
pending as of January 2022) and contributed to an alternative report submitted to the CEDAW
Committee47 on violations of women’s rights in 2019, working closely with the Organization for Security
and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and other UN agencies.48
The CO mainstreamed gender into its COVID-19 response programming. The elements included capacity
building for Ministry of Labour and Social Development staff on addressing GBV in emergencies, support
for the adoption of breastfeeding and complementary feeding recommendations in the context of
COVID-19, rapid assessment to measure the impact of COVID-19 on women.49 In addition, the
STEM4Girls project was swift to adapt all capacity building events to an online format during COVID-19
lockdown, with peer-trainers (around 290 girls) conducting online learning sessions on gender equality,
gender stereotypes, GBV, child and forced marriages and sexual harassment, and the opportunities for
a career in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), as well as communication and leadership
skills.50
As pointed out in the Gender Review Report (2020), however, the current CPD lacks clear direction and
specific monitoring indicators for the core objective of adolescent girls’ empowerment, engagement and
participation. There is, therefore, scope to elevate and prioritize this aspect through the better use of
monitoring data, and the consolidation of ongoing programmes.51
3.1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to changes in national needs
and the rights of the beneficiaries (especially the most vulnerable), as well as
changes in national priorities during programme implementation?
The implementation of UNICEF’s CP contributed to the national strategies that aim to address the
needs of vulnerable children in Kyrgyzstan. During programme implementation, UNICEF was an
active participant in the development of new strategic policy documents to improve the situation
of all children in the country, including those who are the most vulnerable. Using the power of
evidence about their situation and advocating for evidence-based policies, UNICEF contributed
to relevant national priorities for children rights and well-being. In this way, UNICEF ensured its
relevance to changes in both the needs and rights of beneficiaries (especially the most
vulnerable) and changes in national priorities. 52

50 UNICEF COAR 2020.
51 Gender Review Report: Kyrgyzstan, UNICEF ECARO 2020.
52 The answer to the first two evaluation questions assessed UNICEF response to changing needs of children, especially the most
vulnerable children, in Kyrgyzstan. The answer to this third question focuses on UNICEF’s response to changing priorities in
national polices, in connection to the above-mentioned changes in needs.
20
The systematic and comparative assessment of the CP and national strategies show coherence between
UNICEF’s country strategies and Kyrgyzstan’s national priorities in the areas addressed in the CP (child
rights, equity in access to services, quality education, early childhood development and education, social
inclusion, protection of rights, conflict prevention, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and access to justice).
Building on the previous cycle of the CP implementation of support to the Government, UNICEF aims to
improve existing systems for the promotion and protection of child rights. UNICEF is contributing to the
strengthening of institutions, supporting the capacities of national stakeholders and mechanisms for the
implementation of adopted policies and legislation, and providing further technical support to the
drafting of new laws and amendments of existing legislation.
The fact that UNICEF CP responded to Kyrgyzstan’s priorities at the national level was confirmed by the
authorities interviewed during the evaluation. The interventions of the UNICEF CP are highly valued by
national stakeholders as significant contributions to progress on the national priorities reflected in the
key national policies and strategies, in particular:
- the National Strategy on Gender (2015–2020)
- the Education Development Strategy (2012–2020)
- the Youth Development Policy (2017–2020)
- the Food Security and Nutrition Strategy (2018–2022)
- the State Programme on Family Support and Child Protection (2017–2027)
- the State Programme on Justice for Children (2014–2018)
- the National Strategy for Comprehensive Safety and Security (2016–2030)53
- the National Programme of Reforming Healthcare ‘Den Sooluk’ (2012–2018).54
The list is not exhaustive55 as there are other laws and policies related to healthcare, juvenile justice,
education, and social protection that laid the foundation for UNICEF's activities.
UNICEF developed the CP in close consultation with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic,
development partners and CSOs. This enhanced the ownership of the results that were generated, which
was confirmed by the key informants consulted during the evaluation for each CP outcome. The
government representatives are positive about UNICEF's support and presence and appreciate
UNICEF's potential to attract and share international best practices, knowledge and innovation, and to
deliver technical support.
The UNICEF CO takes an active role in supporting the amendment of existing strategic plans and
legislation (based on generated evidence from UNICEF reports, studies commissioned by the
Government with UNICEF support and the interviews with Government and ministry representatives)
to enhance their response to the emerging and changing needs of vulnerable children. In recent years,
for example, UNICEF has advocated for and provided technical assistance on the development of the
updated version of the Child Code of the Kyrgyz Republic which was adopted by the Parliament on 29
July 202156). The revised version of the Code aims to strengthen the child protection system, ensure the
rights of children to social protection, reinforce the role of parents and families in caring for children,
and secure more effective guarantees of state protection for migrant children through a stronger legal
framework for all children who are vulnerable. Welcoming the adoption of the updated version of the
Code, UNICEF’s Kyrgyzstan CO noted that: “the new Child Code is the first legal document to ban corporal
punishment of children in all settings; strengthens case management for vulnerable children and
53 As indicated in the UNICEF (2017) Country Programme Document for Kyrgyzstan.
54 The successor of this programme is the Public Healthcare Programme ‘A healthy person - prosperous country’ (2019-
2030).
55 Other national strategies to which the CP is aligned are: the State Programme on Rural Development; the Strategy of Complex
Security for Population and Territory of the Kyrgyz Republic in Emergency and Crisis Situations (2016-2030); the Government
Programme on Transition to Sustainable Development (2013-2017); State Programme on improving the Рerinatal Programme
of the Kyrgyz Republic (2008-2017); the State Programme on Safe Schools and Preschool (2015-2024); State Programme on
Overcoming of HIV infection (2017-2021); National programme on the state language and language policy (2014-2020), 2020);
National Plan on the SDGs Adaptation; and National Report on the Human Rights Situation within the Universal Periodic Review
(2015).

families and puts in place social services at the local level as key provisions for a solid child protection
system”.
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan has used every opportunity to embed sustainable and strategic changes in the
relevant legislation for the benefit of all children and families in the country. It provided direct support
for the development of the National Development Strategy 2018–2040, which is closely aligned with the
SDGs. Specific chapters of the strategy are dedicated to human capital development, health, nutrition,
education, poverty reduction and child protection, with a specific focus on the most deprived and those
left behind. An interdepartmental expert group was established in 2021 to develop a programme of
medium-term priorities for the country's development up to 2026.57
3.1.4. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to the shifts caused by crises
or major socio-economic and political changes?
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan implemented an integrated approach to prioritizing the well-being of
children. As a result, UNICEF maintained its relevance in the context of rapid changes in needs
and continued to work to generate impact for all children.
COVID-19 has spread across Central Asia since March 2020 and Kyrgyzstan confirmed its first cases on
18 March that year. 58 A state of emergency was declared for the entire country on 22 March 2020, with
strict lockdown in Bishkek, Osh and other parts of the country that faced the highest infection rates.
Non-essential services, mass gatherings, and entertainment were prohibited, schools delivered classes
online.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 cases began to increase sharply in June 2020. The healthcare system was unable
to respond efficiently: the country faced a severe lack of hospital beds, healthcare workers, personal
protective equipment (PPE), medicines, oxygen concentrators, and ventilators. As a result of the lack of
PPE, health workers were severely affected, accounting for 26 per cent of all COVID-19 cases.59
The scope and diversity of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s COVID-19 response activities reflect an integrated
approach to prioritizing the well-being of children during the pandemic with the delivery of
interventions in healthcare, education and social protection. UNICEF has mobilized over US$7 million to
date and has contributed to the Government’s COVID-19 response by providing essential supplies to
medical personnel working on the frontlines and supporting the overall socio-economic response
measures for children and their families.
The UNICEF CO has demonstrated a robust ability to provide analysis and discussion of the risks in
relation to COVID-19 in a coherent manner to ensure a range of appropriate actions. Given the lack of
government data, the CO emphasized data collection. A number of studies and assessments were
conducted and shared in 2020 and 2021: “Assessment of COVID-19 Experience and Perception by
Population of Kyrgyzstan’ (baseline research drawing on a phone survey)60; “Report on the Result of a
Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on Youth in Kyrgyzstan”61; an assessment of the socio-economic
impact of COVID-19 on children and families through a rapid follow-up MICS survey (2020);“Potential
implications of the COVID-19 crisis on social assistance for children in the Kyrgyz Republic”.62. There
were also assessments of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in both schools and health facilities
(over 5,000 schools and preschools and 152 healthcare facilities), an assessment of the impact of COVID
infection prevention and control in family health centres and their ability to respond to COVID-19 and

19) after returning from an Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

continue with routine healthcare services, and a rapid assessment of the capacity of the health system
for the continuity of maternal and child health services.63
UNICEF supported the procurement of COVID-19 medication for healthcare facilities, reaching
approximately 10,000 people (January-June 2021 report). In 2020, COVID-19 supplies worth over
US$1.85 million were procured for the health sector.64 In addition, as part of the overall response plan
to COVID-19, UNICEF contributed to government efforts by supporting the national communication
campaign ‘Sakta’ (Protect) to raise awareness about COVID-19 and prevent its further spread. UNICEF
provided technical support to the Ministry of Health and Social Development to develop a
Communication Plan on Vaccination against COVID-19 (Demand Plan) which was endorsed in February
2021.
UNICEF also provided technical assistance to develop clinical guidelines for the management of COVID-
19 among new-borns, children and adolescents. The pandemic accelerated telemedicine reform and
implementation, and UNICEF supported home-visiting services for new-borns by using smartphone-
based technologies (WhatsApp). Related regulations were adopted to allow the inclusion of
telemedicine in primary health care.
In education, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) to reach more than 1.4
million preschool and school-aged children with remote learning in 2020. UNICEF supported the
development of an online platform to enable educational support workers to identify and support
vulnerable children during lockdown to address their psychosocial needs and an online portal doe all
video lessons prepared by development partners. As reported by UNICEF, 376 educational support
workers were trained, along with 18 specialists, who guided educational support workers from district
education departments to support children at risk. Approximately 11,616 children aged 7-14 (6,963
girls and 4,653 boys) were provided with phone counselling by these trained educational support
workers.
In social protection, the Humanitarian Cash Transfer (HCT) initiative was piloted with the Red Crescent
Society of Kyrgyzstan in disadvantaged remote rural villages in Jalal-Abad, Batken and Naryn provinces,
prone to natural disasters and affected by COVID-19, to demonstrate how the Government of Kyrgyzstan
can expand the ability of the social protection system to respond to shocks. In total, 160 families with
children received 4,000 KGS (approx. US$47) per child, in line with the minimum subsistence level for
one child set by the National Statistics Committee.
The UNICEF CO implemented cross-sectoral cooperation approaches in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
However, the relevance and effectiveness of all cooperation initiatives have been limited by ineffective
response coordination by the government, as well as limited government coordination of international
partners’ response efforts to the COVID-19 crisis.65
In this context, UNICEF played a vital role in coordination with development partners and UN agencies
in the country. UNICEF chaired the education and social protection working groups within the
Development Partners’ Coordination Council in Kyrgyzstan and remained an active partner in the health
working group. UNICEF also played a leading role in Education, Protection, Water, Hygiene and
Sanitation (WASH) sectors within the Disaster Response Coordination Unit66 (DRCU working between
2008-2020), the humanitarian platform chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator. In addition, UNICEF
led the supply and procurement sub-group of the Health Sector Group and chaired the UN Crisis
Communication Group, coordinating work on Risk Communication and Community Engagement with a
larger group of partners. 67

As indicated in the Country Office Annual Report (COAR) 2020, 86 per cent of children living in
residential institutions returned to their families during lockdown. This could be seen as a unique
opportunity for UNICEF to advance de-institutionalization reform Kyrgyzstan. UNICEF assessed the
situation of children who had returned home, which demonstrated that families are willing to care for
their children at home if adequate community-based family support is provided. The findings informed
ongoing advocacy efforts for childcare system reform and family support to prevent re-
institutionalization.68
3.2. Coherence
3.2.1. To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme kept true to its mandate and
aligned with UNICEF’s global and regional strategies as well as the United
Nations Sustainable Development Framework (UNSDCF) and the SDGs in any
given country?
UNICEF’s programme interventions in Kyrgyzstan are in direct alignment with UNICEF’s regional
and global priorities, including the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018-2021), the Global SDG
indicators, UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
All stakeholders interviewed identify a direct link between UNICEF work and global priorities and goals,
according to their interest fields. Strategically, the CP was designed to align with the SDGs’ principle of
“leaving no one behind” and has remained coherent with evolving global priorities in relation to the
rights of children and adolescents. The CP contributes to 10 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals:
SDG 1 (No Poverty); 3 (Good Health and Well-being); 4 (Quality Education); 5 (Gender Equality); 6
(Clean Water and Sanitation); 10 (Reduced Inequalities); 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities); 13
(Climate Action); 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions); and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).
The CP contributes to all four outcomes of the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the
Kyrgyz Republic 2018–2022:
- Outcome I: Sustainable and inclusive economic growth, industrial, rural and agricultural
development, food security and nutrition
- Outcome II: Good Governance, rule of law, human rights and gender equality
- Outcome III: Environment, climate change, and disaster risk management
- Outcome IV: Social sector development (social protection, health and education).
The CP 2018-2022 has also been aligned to, and has contributed to, the achievement of UNICEF’s global
and regional agenda, i.e., to all five goal areas of the Strategic Plan (SP) 2018-2021.69 The CP also
implemented sector-specific initiatives that contributed to priority plans, including the Peace Building
Priority Plan 2017-2020 through cross-border and civil engagement projects.
UNICEF is also supporting the Government in the monitoring and implementation of global priorities
and goals included in the national policies. UNICEF supported the MICS, providing data for 31 of the 80
global indicators currently available in the country. UNICEF also enhanced the availability of data on
SDG indicators through its support for the statistical compendium “Monitoring of the Sustainable
Development Goal Indicators in the Kyrgyz Republic” which presents progress for all the available SDG
indicators.70
The Voluntary National Review report to the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development
was developed in 2019-2020. This was a good opportunity to “relate to children and further advocate

for advancing the child rights agenda”71 and emphasized the need for improved data, particularly on
vulnerable children.
3.2.2. To what extent did UNICEF manage to build effective and sustainable
partnerships in working towards addressing the predefined bottlenecks,
advocating for evidence for equity and contributing to the results at scale?
UNICEF maintained a strong partnership with the Government of Kyrgyzstan throughout a
period of significant political, constitutional, and institutional changes – a partnership that
represents a precondition for UNICEF relevance and impact. UNICEF collaborates with local
authorities and CSOs on the implementation of projects and the delivery of services at
community level. The results of local-level projects are used in advocacy to promote national
scale-up, in partnership with UN agencies, other development partners, academia and the civil
society. Overall, UNICEF’s partnership network forms a strong community, with UNICEF
facilitating dialogue among different partners and stakeholders across different sectors. UNICEF
has been described by stakeholders who were part of the evaluation process as always being
open to cooperation, always responsive to emerging needs, and as proactive in seeking
opportunities for collaboration.
The UNICEF CO works with a range of different partners to drive change for children and their families
in Kyrgyzstan. The primary benefits of collaboration with partners are two-fold: to reach target groups
and decision-makers and to share and receive key information. This cooperation is well organized and
appreciated by all partners and, as presented in the sections of this evaluation dedicated to the impact,
partnership with many stakeholders represents a strategy that has allowed UNICEF to produce
satisfactory results and impact for children in the country. The UNICEF CO has implemented the CP in
close partnerships with the relevant ministries, State agencies and other State bodies at national and
sub-national levels, in collaboration with other UN agencies, independent bodies, CSOs and the private
sector (e.g., in relation to procurement, media).
The strong partnership of the CO with the Government of Kyrgyzstan has been maintained throughout
the implementation of the current CP, despite significant political and institutional changes in the
country. UNICEF works at central level with the Cabinet of Ministers72 (the successor to the Government
of the Kyrgyz Republic since 2021) and at the lower level with the local self-government bodies through
implemented projects and initiatives. The reviewed documentation and interviews conducted with
ministry representatives provide compelling evidence of this cooperation.
According to the data gathered through a survey of UNICEF CO staff, the main institutions with whom
the CO collaborates are governmental bodies, NGOs and national public agencies/institutes/centres. As
Figure 3 shows, the respondents noted that the partnerships between UNICEF and governmental bodies
account for the largest single share of such connections (40 per cent), followed by collaborations with
national public agencies/institutes/centres (29 per cent). Institutions of higher education are also
important partners for the CO (10 per cent), as well as UN agencies and other international
organizations (8 per cent).73
This broad range of partners covers all CP outcomes, as well as all UNDAF outcomes. While partnerships
with local authorities appear to account for a small share, according to UNICEF CO staff (with only two
respondents mentioning that they collaborate with local authorities), the interviews augmented this
picture and emphasized the importance of cooperation at local level, especially under Outcomes 2 and
3 of the CP.

The collected data find that the UNICEF CO staff had established the most connections with the Ministry
of Education and Science and the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Further, the respondents
also mentioned their cooperation with the Republican Centre for Health Promotion and the Centre of
Immuno-prophylaxis and the Kyrgyz Academy of Education. Regarding the frequency of
communication, the data show that the most frequent contacts have been established with academic
institutions. In the case of the few CO staff members who work on activities with local authorities, there
are frequent and important meetings and exchanges of information.
The stakeholder analysis shows, therefore, that the most important stakeholders for the UNICEF CO in
Kyrgyzstan are the public institutions: either those close to the centre of government (Ministries) or
oriented through service provisions (e.g., agencies). They have a significant influence on the work of
UNICEF, as shown by the Social Network Analysis, and a high interest in benefiting from UNICEF’s input.
Among these public institutions, the stakeholders with the greatest influence and interest are found in
the areas of health and education.
There is a good balance in the partnerships with public institutions. For example, UNICEF advocates to
the ministries and adapts its messages to changes in both the national needs of children and national
policy priorities. It also can shape these priorities by providing data, research results and technical
assistance. Technical and material assistance is also provided to public service providers (agencies, etc.)
and UNICEF’s contribution to institutional strengthening is consolidating the relationship between the
CO and each institution. In most cases, UNICEF works with other UN Agencies and development partners
to promote institutional development and policies for human and child rights and children’s access to
services.
Stakeholders in the areas of child protection, justice and finance have less influence on or interest in
UNICEF activities. UNICEF is, however, highly interested in developing partnerships with these
stakeholders and cooperation has sometimes generated superior results. For example, cooperation in
the field of justice generated increased capacity to address the needs of children in contact and in conflict
with the law through the training of lawyers. Similarly, cooperation around finance has contributed to
increased competences for budgeting related to early education.
The Ministry of Health and Social Development has had the greatest influence on UNICEF activities in
Kyrgyzstan. This influence relates to its relevance for UNICEF’s mission and its coverage of two areas
that represent essential elements of UNICEF’s CP.74 The Ministry of Education and Science also has a
considerable influence on UNICEF’s activities in Kyrgyzstan. Cooperation with these Ministries ensures
the alignment of UNICEF’s work to national policy priorities, as observed in the section on relevance.
74 The institution has the highest betweenness centrality coefficient (0.37). Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of
times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. In this case the institutions prove to be
important in generating UNCIEF and other stakeholders capacity to communicate and work together, acting as a connection
point.
26
The strengthening of key government agencies is the UNICEF CO’s main and ongoing approach to
partnership across all three CP Outcomes. For example, UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Education
and Science on the provision of technical assistance in drafting the Program for the Development of
Education in the Kyrgyz Republic for 2021-2040 and the Plan of Actions 2021 – 2023 (approved by the
Decree of the Government of KR on 4 May 2021, No 200); on the development of new National ECD
Standards, approved by the Prime Minister in June 202075; the development of electronic management
systems; the piloting of multilingual and multicultural education in the regions, community-based
kindergartens and municipal library-based Child Development Centres; the development of a school-
based disaster risk reduction methodology; the development of the Anti-Crisis Plan for the Education
Sector in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and so on.
Cooperation with the responsible authorities in the health sector generated results. For example, the
Food Security and Nutrition Programme for 2019-202376 was approved with technical support from
UNICEF that involved authorities from both the health and agriculture sectors, and UNICEF also
contributed to the draft Law on Telemedicine Services (pending approval). In addition, the UNICEF CO
has enhanced the quality of maternal and child health services and the capacity of health care workers
in various areas, including the response to COVID-19 through the review and update of mass
procurement of protective equipment (PPE), clinical management equipment, diagnostics, infection
prevention and control supplies and essential medicines.
Support from UNICEF and other development partners for the Ministry of Justice has delivered the
following results: the institutionalization of child-friendly and free legal aid; the development of the new
State Programme on Justice for Children 2020-2030 with UNICEF's technical assistance; and the drafting
of a comprehensive set of amendments to the Children’s Code, the Criminal Procedure Code and other
legislative documents.
UNICEF works extensively with the Ministry of Emergency Situations to ease the impact of natural and
human-made disasters and crisis situations on children and enhance the impact of humanitarian
assistance. Kyrgyzstan’s Disaster Risk Analysis methodology was developed with technical assistance
from UNICEF, a nationwide safety assessment of schools and preschool education facilities was
conducted, and humanitarian supplies were provided during emergencies, including the COVID-19
pandemic.
UN agencies and other international organizations and development partners, as well as CSOs are also
important, interested and influential partners, but their contribution to the programme implementation
is smaller than that of the partnership with Kyrgyzstan’s public institutions. However, development
partners, including country development programmes (particularly the programmes of the
Governments of Japan, UK, US and of the European Union) are important donors for UNICEF in
Kyrgyzstan.
UNICEF collaborates very well with other UN agencies and institutional partners in the country to
implement projects in various areas (e.g., child protection, youth participation and civic engagement,
adolescent health and child marriage, peacebuilding and conflict prevention) and to conduct advocacy
and communication campaigns. Examples of close alignment within the UN include cooperation with
UNDP, UN Women and UNFPA on the implementation of peacebuilding, youth empowerment and
gender initiatives in the remote border regions and/or areas prone to conflicts.77 The CO collaborates
with international partners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank and OSCE to
conduct research and to advocate with the Government. This includes, for example collaboration with
the World Bank on evidence generation (including evidence related to the COVID-19 pandemic), supply
procurement, the development of strategic documents78 and strengthening the capacity of the National
Statistics Committee (NSC). UNICEF has also cooperated closely with World Bank on strategic

Republic "Preschool education and childcare", the previous standard was approved in 2012 (no longer valid).

documents in the field of education and with OSCE and other UN agencies on the girls’ and women’s
rights through strategic planning and monitoring of the implementation of these strategic plans.
Kyrgyzstan has a vibrant civil society, with CSOs that are eligible for partnership with UNICEF. As a
result, UNICEF collaborates with a variety of local CSOs on a range of topics. This collaboration has been
seen as critically important by these stakeholders at the grassroots level. In total, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan
has worked with at least 29 CSOs as implementing partners during the CP 2018-2022 period (including
collaborations during the pandemic).79 All work with NGO partners is aligned with the key guiding
principles for UNICEF partnerships with CSOs and other actors.80 UNICEF implements advocacy
activities in cooperation with a number of CSOs, but the number and diversity of approaches could be
improved, according to some of the collected opinions. The interviews and consulted documents show,
for example, that UNICEF is rarely supporting advocacy by other players to multiply their efforts and
child protection. Support for advocacy of CSOs could be beneficial for UNICEF and for vulnerable
children in Kyrgyzstan, as it can support the multiplication of effects of the work of each organisation.
In all, UNICEF has worked with 38 partners during its 2018-2022 CP, with 35 of these being local
organizations and only three of them international organizations. These implementing partners have
contributed to all outputs of the CP, supported by a budget of US$6 million – a reflection of UNICEF’s
focus on its civil society partnerships. However, extending the collaboration with CSOs beyond the
current circle of implementing partners could strengthen UNICEF’s capacity to reach vulnerable
children and achieve results for them, especially in the context of the country’s changing political,
institutional and social context.
The evaluation notes that more could have been done to create systems to address the multidimensional
needs of children by connecting social protection, healthcare, education, justice/law enforcement, civil
society and other sectors in strengthening the response to the emerging needs of children. Although the
UNDAF should provide the framework for the strategic and systemic cooperation of UN agencies, in
practice we found that UNDAF implementation is subject to work divisions and that cooperation and
partnerships are project-based rather than programme-based. Therefore, a more strategic approach to
partnerships is needed, particularly with other UN agencies.
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by the UNICEF CO, the data
analysis shows the existence of a strong community, with various connections between actors in
different clusters formed around the CO’s departments or its specialists and experts. In other words,
experts in one area can easily access partners in another area and the partnership network of UNICEF
Kyrgyzstan facilitates cross-sectoral work.

3.2.3. What are the comparative advantages of UNICEF in relation to other actors in
the country, including development partners, the private sector and the non-
government sector, and to what extent were they necessary and sufficient for
contributing to the results at scale to be achieved?
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan used its comparative advantages related to (a) its normative and well-
recognized role to uphold the rights of all children, (b) its technical competencies and capacity
to provide all partners with relevant data, (c) its capacity to convene partners, (d) its leadership
in communication, community engagement and advocacy for children rights, and (e) its
dedication and adaptability to changing needs. These advantages are vital for UNICEF’s work to
achieve its envisaged short-, medium- and long-term results for children in the country.
However, as described in the section of this report dedicated to impact, these advantages are not
always sufficient to generate impact.
Many comparative advantages of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan have been identified during the field work. The
stakeholders could clearly distinguish the added value and advantages of UNICEF compared to other
actors in the sphere of child rights. Stakeholders recognize the reputation, mandate and normative role
of UNICEF in upholding the rights of all children. The government, CSO and development partners that
were consulted recognize UNICEF’s distinct strengths, including its convening power, advocacy
capability, and its presence at the local level through implemented initiatives and pilots. UNICEF is seen
as a reputable partner with solid technical expertise that provides leadership and coordination, with
interventions undertaken jointly with government officials and partners at diverse levels.
Government representatives perceived UNICEF to be the most dependable partner in terms of technical
capacity and delivering assistance, evidence generation, and ability to adapt to the unexpected needs of
29
its partners. As a result of its clear mandate and its precise target group, UNICEF is the first source to
appeal on behalf of children when there is a need for this.
One comparative advantage of UNICEF is the technical assistance provided extensively by the CO across
all spheres of the CP to the relevant ministries and working groups at various levels. Whenever possible,
UNICEF mobilizes local experts, benefiting the Government and expanding its pool of expertise.
However, international experts are contracted when needed. National-level strategic documents have
been developed because of this approach to cooperation with the technical support of UNICEF. These
include: the updated version of the Child’s Code; the Food Security and Nutrition Programme for 2019-
2023; the new Education Sector Strategy 2021-2040; and the new State Programme on Justice for
Children 2020-2030.
CSOs and implementing partners consider UNICEF to be a strategic partner. As noted, UNICEF works
with CSOs at the local and national level, adopting a strategy based on the modelling and testing of
innovative solutions (e.g., the model of Child Development Centres within existing municipal libraries,
youth and child-friendly local governance, and the UPSHIFT approach in peacebuilding and civic
engagement). Relevant Ministries have capitalised on these model initiatives, which support progress
on policy implementation in the areas such as healthcare, child protection, ECD, and youth
empowerment. Models were scaled to national policy in 2020 and in 2021 in new adopted legislation
and strategies (e.g., in the case of early childhood education).
As confirmed by the partners interviewed for this evaluation, UNICEF has a clear comparative advantage
over other key players in terms of its expertise, technical resourcefulness, and its ability to adapt to
changing environments (e.g., the implementation of measures in response to COVID-19). Partners
stressed that UNICEF is less bureaucratic than other UN bodies or institutions/donors or tries to ease
the burden of administrative and financial procedures to interact effectively with its partners.
Other UN agencies and institutional partners also recognize the comparative advantage of UNICEF’s
mandate to uphold the rights of children. They also emphasize the importance of UNICEF’s reputation
in the country, supporting its communication and its community engagement capacity. In practice these
comparative advantages are visible in the initiatives implemented by UNICEF in partnership with other
UN agencies, where UNICEF leads communication and community engagement activities.
Interviewees, including partners at national level and CSO representatives, have complimented the CO
for its technical competence, dedication, flexibility and responsiveness to the emerging needs of
partners.81
Given the complex national situation in Kyrgyzstan, UNICEF’s comparative advantages are seen as
essential for results for children in this country. Interviews and previous evaluations of UNICEF
activities show how its comparative advantages have been used in different contexts to generate the
expected results and this evaluation report presents only a selection of examples. The evaluation of
coherence and impact shows that these comparative advantages can be sufficient to generate impact,
and the CO has often used them well. In other areas, however, external factors, as well as the need for
long-term interventions are limiting their impact, as shown in the section on impact.
3.2.4. How has UNICEF’s approach to strategic partnerships changed over time?
There have been no significant changes to strategic partnerships during the implementation of
the CP 2018-2022. While the number of UNICEF’s implementing partners in Kyrgyzstan has
increased since 2018, the type of partners and UNICEF’s relationships with them have not
changed. We find that UNICEF is highly effective in mobilizing diverse partners for its advocacy.
However, UNICEF does not seem to use every opportunity to support and amplify the advocacy
of other players that have the same goals.
The evaluation did not gather any documented evidence about major changes or amendments to the
partnership approach during the implementation of the CP 2018-2022. UNICEF strengthened its work
81 As an example of its responsiveness, UNICEF supported the Government of Kyrgyzstan in a humanitarian mission to
repatriate 79 Kyrgyzstani children from Iraq in 2021.
30
with local authorities, especially in the framework of the Youth and Child Friendly Local Government
Initiative, but this approach to partnership was planned since 2017. While UNICEF’s institutional
partners changed because of changes within those institutions, UNICEF’s partnership approach
remained relevant because it was already working with a broad range of partners that also adapted their
approaches to the changing needs of children and the COVID-19 crisis.
As noted in the previous section, UNICEF works closely with a broad range of stakeholders, there is
ongoing quality communication, and the UNICEF CO is seen as being open to the discussion of
partnership challenges and responsive to any concerns raised. However, there have been changes in
terms of the continuity of the UNICEF CO’s work with implementing partners from civil society. Out of
63 implementing partners in the period 2014-2021, 17 implementing partners had contractual
relationships with UNICEF in both the previous and current CP, while 20 implementing partners did not
have contracts with UNICEF prior to the CP 2018-2020. Almost half of these (nine in all) were first
contracted as implementing partners in 2020 and 2021. These diverse organizations contribute to five
outputs of the CP: two related to the COVID-19 response, and the others related to the strengthening of
the health system, communication for development, and peacebuilding and social cohesion. However,
as noted in the previous section, extending the collaboration with CSOs beyond the immediate circle of
implementing partners could further strengthen UNICEF’s capacity to reach vulnerable children and
achieve results for them.
The evaluation team also observed that UNICEF appears to have concentrated its advocacy on the de-
institutionalization process, focusing on advocacy for the new Child Code. There have been other players
in this area in recent years, including EU-funded projects82, that have piloted the transformation of long-
term childcare institutions and developed cross-sectoral and community-based family support services.
UNICEF has focused primarily on service development for the prevention of institutionalization. There
is still a shortage of qualified social service workforce at community level – a challenge that may be
addressed by the new Child Code, which aims to develop this workforce. Meanwhile, it is the opinion of
the evaluators that UNICEF could, in general, make more use of opportunities to support advocacy by
other players to multiply their efforts and child protection is just one example of an area where this
could be beneficial for UNICEF and for vulnerable children in Kyrgyzstan.
3.3. Impact
3.3.1. Did UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribute to the results at-scale? If yes, how and why
did it make a difference and for whom? If no, why not?
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan has contributed to results at-scale for children, achieving many of its
expected results under all planned Outcomes of the CP. The key strategies to generate impact
have been evidence-based advocacy supported by partners, technical assistance provided to
ministries and other central institutions, and the successful scale-up of some initiatives
implemented initially at community level (for example, in the field of early childhood education).
The mechanisms that have contributed to UNICEF’s success confirm some assumptions of the
ToC. However, bottlenecks and emerging risks have imposed limits on UNICEF’s impact. Most of
these have been anticipated and activities to cope with them have been implemented, but these
activities have been only partly effective.
The Situational Analysis (SitAn) to support the development of the future Country Programme was
conducted in 2021. This impact assessment is informed by the findings and conclusions of the SitAn and
other available data and information.
82 Two projects have been implemented with the support of EU funds: technical support to the government and the support
for reintegration of children returning from Middle East conflict areas.

3.3.1.1. Evaluation of UNICEF impact under each Outcome of the Country Programme
Positive changes regarding the development of Child Rights Based Mechanisms for Decision-
Making (Outcome 1)
Satisfactory results have been achieved in the way public institutions in Kyrgyzstan collect and
access data about children, particularly those who are the most vulnerable, affected by
multidimensional poverty. As a result of joint advocacy with development partners and technical
assistance efforts from UN agencies, SDG indicators are included in the monitoring of the National
Development Program 2018-2022, "Unity, Trust, Creation", and the monitoring plans of key state
programmes and strategies. The monitoring of SDG indicators is conducted by the Government, with
technical assistance from UNICEF, which has supported the NSC on the compilation of a statistical
compendium on “Monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals Indicators in the Kyrgyz Republic.83
The Kyrgyzstan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) was carried out in 2018 and published in 2019
by the National Statistical Committee of Kyrgyz Republic as part of the Global MICS Programme.
Technical support was provided by UNICEF with government funding and financial support of UNICEF,
USAID and UNFPA.84 MICS is a major national households survey that helps measure many of the SDG
targets and gives up-dated and comparable data on children’s situation and well-being. Due to its
methodology the study allows comparisons between countries and policy planning based on
international standards. As reported by UNICEF, the introduction of the National Multidimensional
Poverty Measurement in 2019, because of UNICEF technical assistance and advocacy, has made it
possible to gather better data and evidence on children to support the development of specific policies.
The routine measurement of monetary child poverty is now complemented by an assessment of
deprivations in health, education, living conditions, social inclusion, and protection.85 UNICEF has
supported key government officials in the equity-based analysis of several data sources on maternal and
child health, nutrition, and immunization, using the Equitable Impact Sensitive Tool (EQUIST).86
As mentioned above, since 2020 UNICEF supported the Government and other stakeholders in the
country in their response to COVID-19 pandemic by providing data on the immediate effects of the
pandemic on children and their families. A number of studies and assessments were conducted and
shared in 2020 and 2021: “Assessment of COVID-19 Experience and Perception by Population of
Kyrgyzstan’ (baseline research drawing on a phone survey)87; “Report on the Result of a Survey on the
Impact of COVID-19 on Youth in Kyrgyzstan”88; an assessment of the socio-economic impact of COVID-
19 on children and families through a rapid follow-up MICS survey (2020);“Potential implications of the
COVID-19 crisis on social assistance for children in the Kyrgyz Republic”.89
In response to the country’s challenging track record on gender, a new National Gender Equality
Strategy 2021-2030 was developed. UNICEF supported the Government in the strategic planning
process, together with agencies and development partners.
A programme to train national and local relevant staff on better budgeting for children (especially for
ECD/ECE) is being implemented. There is a large body of evidence from UNICEF, UNDP, World Bank
(presented in their reports) and other development partners on the need to improve public financing,
yet the response from the government is not yet sufficient to kick-off the reforms that are required.90
On the other hand, the collected evidence, including, the case study conducted on UNICEF’s impact on
social protection, as well as interviews and the workshops with the CO representatives and staff show
that social work is not effective enough in the country, social workers are not present enough, trained

and recognised as a central actor for social inclusion and child protection, although all stakeholders
interviewed supported them in this role. Moreover, they have a limited role in providing social
protection when needed.
In the area of social protection, UNICEF advocated for the improvement of the system, considering the
needs of children living in poverty. The case study below shows limited progress in 2019-2021, despite
the advocacy efforts of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan since 2017 to improve both the coverage and amount of
poverty-targeted social benefits for children, and to promote universal (or close to universal) social
assistance/social aid support for all children.
It seems that the country’s concentration on constant economic development and growth in the country
(prior to the COVID-19 pandemic), as underlined by the World Bank91, distracted decision-makers and
international financial institutions from the needs of the most vulnerable families and children. Even
before the pandemic, poor children and their families did not receive the same attention from the
government as people with disabilities, pensioners and merit-based recipients of subsidies, all of whom
were well represented by interest and lobby groups in the government, Parliament and civil society. Our
general finding is, however, that strategic engagement with the World Bank on social benefits during
the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the impact observed in 2020 and could lead to future progress.
Case study on extended social benefits for children in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
The assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s contribution to social protection is based on the theory of
change (ToC) re-constructed by the evaluation team in consultation with the UNICEF CO. A theory-
based impact evaluation requires the evaluator to identify the impact to be studied and to assess the
processes and/or contributions and/or mechanisms that generate the impact. In the case of social
protection, we identified a 7 per cent increase in the coverage of the Social Assistance Programme
(SAP) for children in 2020, with an additional 25,329 children enrolled in the programme.
The evidence collected for this evaluation shows that a minor reform of social benefits in Kyrgyzstan
was implemented in 2020. This finding is based on UNICEF reports, the World Bank reports and on
interviews with World Bank representatives and other stakeholders, including representatives of the
Government. The same sources show that the social benefits reform has been difficult because of two
main challenges.
- Institutional and leadership instability and a lack of consistent political will, which means that
decisions have been made that are not evidence-based or that are now obsolete because of
the change of decision makers
- Disagreement among development partners and international financial institutions. UNICEF
has advocated for (near to) universal social protection benefits for children and families. The
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, however, have warned about the lack of
fiscal sustainability of the social policy proposals, while UN Women has advocated for
different social protection measures that will also promote women’s employment to advance
gender equality.
The National Development Strategy (NDS) 2018-2040, aligned with the Sustainable Development
Goals, acknowledges the need for a more inclusive social protection system. In 2019, the country’s
development partners agreed that “the current demographic window [in Kyrgyzstan] can be seen as
an opportunity to invest in the youngest generation’s human capital development and boost their
long-term productivity. In such a context, social protection is a key strategic tool in further decreasing
poverty and securing the Kyrgyz Republic on a path of inclusive socio-economic development.”92

Evidence shows that the Government of Kyrgyzstan agreed to reform the social benefit coverage in
2020, to a limited extent,93 as a result of joint advocacy efforts by these development partners,
together with the influence of other countries in the region.94 When formulating options for the
reform of social benefits, decision-makers could have been informed by the institutionalization of a
multidimensional measurement of poverty, taking into account monetary and material deprivation
and the lack of (or limited access to) services.95
In 2021, all existing data showed that the COVID-19 pandemic could double Kyrgyzstan’s poverty rate
and generate a profound social and economic crisis. According to the World Bank-UNICEF study
conducted in May 2020, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic could affect children
disproportionately, increasing the number of children living in poverty by between 160,000 and
570,000. This study informed advocacy for improved social protection coverage for children. The
paper commissioned by UNICEF on the implications of this increase in poverty on social assistance
for children showed that the means-test used at present is not appropriate for the response to poverty
generated by the COVID-19 crisis, because the “asset filters do not respond to transient poverty:
households who have lost their source of income may still have assets they purchased before the
crisis.”96 Four policy options have been presented to the Ministry of Labour and Social Development:
Option 1, which maintains the status quo; Option 2, which eliminates the means-test; and two options
that promote different thresholds for eligibility for the social protection benefit – with the means-test
(Option 3) and without the means-test (Option 4).
93 The planned reform initially included: introducing a universal birth grant and adjusting the means-test that determines
eligibility to strengthen the performance of the social assistance system according to the Position paper on targeting options
for social assistance programme for poor families with children, 2020 (paper produced with UNICEF support).
94 One key informant interviewed mentioned that the example of the Russian Federation represented a key factor in
determining the decision of some decision-makers.
95 As reported by UNICEF, better data and evidence on children have been achieved in two steps: (a) the institutionalization of
National Multidimensional Poverty Measurement in 2019, because of UNICEF technical assistance and advocacy and (b) the
introduction by the National Statistics Committee (NSC), with UNICEF’s support, of the Multidimensional Child Poverty Index
(child well-being index). Routine measurement of monetary child poverty is now complemented by an assessment of
deprivations in health, education, living conditions, social inclusion, and protection.

IMPACT Activities and outputs Assumptions / positive Risks
factors
The study represents circumstantial yet convincing evidence that the change of approach of
international financial institutions (the World Bank and International Monetary Fund) on social
protection and their partial alignment with UNICEF’s advocacy agenda allowed for good advocacy
results in the complex context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Labour and Social
Development, for example, eliminated one of the eligibility filters for child benefits, which contributed
to the 7 per cent increase in coverage in 2020. UNICEF can be cautiously confident that the
recommendations it provided, and the advocacy conducted with the World Bank around child poverty
issue, determined this change in the approach.
There is no direct evidence on the precise impact of the contribution made by UNICEF and the World
Bank. One alternative explanation would be that the decision to change the eligibility filters for child
benefits was made by the Ministry, independently of any influence from development partners.
However, there is a marked coalescence across the recommendations made by UNICEF, the decision
taken and the visible impact that was generated – a 7 per cent increase in the extended coverage of
the Social Assistance Programme for children in 2020.
This was a good first step and demonstrates that cooperation between development partners can
increase the chances of impact. However, the magnitude of the problem of child poverty in Kyrgyzstan
still demands a much bolder approach to the expansion of social protection
Positive changes regarding access to services for child’s survival, learning and development
(Outcome 2)
UNICEF reported considerable impact related to improved access to services for children
because of UNICEF’s work under Outcome 2. UNICEF reports are supported by the national studies,
including the Voluntary report on SDG and the Multidimensional Poverty Index. One of the most
important results for children at scale has been increased commitment children with disabilities due to
the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in
2019. This was a remarkable achievement: the result of joint advocacy efforts by civil society and UN
35
agencies.97 For the implementation of the convention, UNICEF works actively with the Government to
transform the current medical model of disability to a social model that aims to integrate children with
disabilities into society by means of adapted community care.
The country is now obliged to provide people with disabilities with an accessible environment and
infrastructure to involve them in daily life and grant them all rights and freedoms. UNICEF has been
working closely with the Government to support the implementation of an immediate action plan as
part of the interdisciplinary working group. The group is now developing a draft Plan of Priority
Measures for the Implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for
2021-2023 for approval. In addition, the “Accessible Country” Program 2021-2040 has been developed
to create an accessible living environment for persons with disabilities (pending approval).98
Maternal, child and adolescents' health and nutrition (Outputs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)
Kyrgyzstan has halved child mortality, which fell from 39 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006 to
19 deaths per 1,000 in 2018). It has also reduced the neonatal mortality rate, from 19 deaths per
1,000 in 2006 to 13 per 1,000 in 2018. However, more rapid progress is needed as these rates are
among the highest in the Europe and Central Asia region and this progress can only be achieved by
increasing both the quality of and equitable access to services. In this regard, UNICEF reports
improvement in clinical standards and protocols around maternal health, focusing on perinatal care
(neonatal care and post-natal visits through home visit revised protocol, child and adolescent health, as
well as major capacity building activities for medical staff in hospitals covering several thousand doctors
and nurses.99
Although vaccination rates are high in Kyrgyzstan overall, they fell in 2020 compared to previous years
as a result the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on mobility.100 In this context, UNICEF
supported the Republican Centre for Immunization (RCI) to complete the second phase of the Cold Chain
Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP): the installation of specialized refrigerators. These
installations increased the percentage of vaccination points with the necessary specialized equipment
from 49 per cent to 85 per cent, ensuring safe vaccination services, especially in remote areas. The
government, development partners and CSOs converge in supporting immunization to maintain a
satisfactory level of vaccination rates in Kyrgyzstan, to counteract fake news and to ensure access to
vaccination for all children.101
The Government in 2019 approved The Food Security and Nutrition Programme 2019-2023, developed
with UNICEF support. The Programme outlines policies and measures to improve the nutritional status
of the population (including anaemia reduction) in a way that is consistent with international trends.
Many medical staff and parents have been trained and/or informed about Infant and Young Child
Feeding (IYCF) and breastfeeding (with UNICEF support), with several hundred doctors and over
300,000 mothers reached. Malnutrition rates in Kyrgyzstan decreased for stunting and wasting within
biological norms between 2006 and 2018, but further progress is needed to achieve the SDG targets.102
97 On 14 March 2019, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Sooronbai Zheenbekov, ratified the UN Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities. The document became effective on 24 March 2019. (http://cbd.minjust.gov.kg/act/view/ru-
ru/111885?cl=ru-ru).
98 Based on information in open sources (2019), Kyrgyzstan has allocated US$95.5 million for implementation of the
Convention (https://cabar.asia/ru/kak-kyrgyzstan-budet-realizovyvat-konventsiyu-oon-o-pravah-invalidov).
99 In 2020, UNICEF also supported the transfer of in-person home-visiting services to a smartphone application (WhatsApp)
helping to maintain and increase postnatal care visits for new-borns. The introduction of telemedicine elements into routine
health services at the level of primary health care further contributed to cost-effective and innovative solutions that
maintained essential service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

101 In 2020, UNICEF reports the expansion of social mobilization on immunization. Within the campaigns conducted by
UNICEF and the Republican Centre for Immunization (RCI): 7,937 under-vaccinated children under six years old were
identified and volunteers conducted sessions with their parents. As a result, 852 children were vaccinated, representing 39
per cent of the children whose parents were reached and 11 per cent of all under-vaccinated children; the online platform for
Village Health Committees (VHC) was scaled up and reached 139,000 people with messages on immunization and COVID-19;
knowledge about the National Immunization Calendar increased from 58 per cent to 68per cent among internet users due to
social media activities on Instagram that reached more than 100,000 viewers; The RCI web-portal, including a hotline
application, continues to provide timely immunization information, reaching approximately 4,500 visitors every month.

Access to ECD/ECE quality and equitable services and to quality and inclusive education (Outputs 2.4
and 2.5)
The "Education Development Programme for 2021-2040" (EDS) and its first Action Plan for
2021-2023 were adopted on 4 May 2021. According to all documents and interviews, the MoES
received support from the World Bank, UNICEF and CSOs in the development of the programme.
Overall, the country reports remarkably elevated levels of access to education, with almost universal
attendance in primary education (98.7 per cent). Data show that students complete compulsory
education and that over 86 per cent continue beyond lower secondary education, but less than half of
those move on to tertiary education.103 Kyrgyzstan also reports high rates of literacy.104
In addition, ECE remains one of the government priorities according to the strategic documents and
there is satisfactory progress on the development of Child Development Centres (CDCs) within existing
municipal libraries to provide ECD services, as well as education. UNICEF is contributing to capacity
building at national and local level for the implementation of CDCs and promoting other ECD policies,
mostly targeting children health to allow them to develop (and participate to education): the early
identification of and interventions for of children with disabilities, and home-visiting for families with
young children.
There are, however, continued concerns about equitable and inclusive access to education and the
quality of education. Multilingual and multicultural education, as well as inclusive education for children
with special educational needs (SEN) and children with disabilities continue to be limited to pilot-level
initiatives in several schools and pre-schools, based on the partnership between the MoES and
development partners (UNICEF, USAID105 and World Bank). While the education strategic documents
adopted in 2021 include the development of inclusive and quality education, their implementation
depends on institutional capacity at local level and there has been negligible impact for individual
children yet.
According to MICS, 59.8 per cent of primary school students did not gain the minimal acceptable reading
and comprehension skills in 2018.106 While this represents an improvement in comparison with 2014,
when 65 per cent of children in grade four were not reading at their grade level107, the issue of quality
education remains unaddressed. There is still a 13 percentage points difference between the children in
rural and urban areas and there are significant regional differences: while 74 per cent of children
demonstrate foundational reading skills in Bishkek, this falls to only 39 per cent in Naryn. Data is,
however, available at age and school level and for children with learning difficulties and could be utilized
to guide future policy developments.108
Th MoES, with UNICEF support, has collaborated to improve the education management system (EMIS)
since 2020 to support better access to education and quality of education and is under continuous
development. All schools and pre-school have entered data for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 academic
years (with help from UNICEF volunteers who supported school and pre-school managers and EMIS
focal points to validate existing data and complete any missing data). The new EMIS is now able to track
inclusion and participation in quality education for all children (including those with disabilities and
living in difficult circumstances). In addition, each individual record in the EMIS has a unique
identification number (PIN) from the Civil Registry Office central database. This makes it possible to link
the EMIS to other health and social development databases to monitor, refer and seek cross-sectoral
solutions to the barriers that some children may face. In cooperation with the NSC, all statistical

Efforts in 2020, with support from development partners, ensured continued access to education during
the COVID-19 pandemic so that many children could continue their learning at home. However, the lack
of access to IT and lack of digital skills have deepened existing inequities.
The following case study underlines UNICEF’s contribution to the development of ECD/ECE, as well as
the limitations of its impact.
Case study on UNICEF’s contribution to impact in early childhood development (ECD) and education
(ECE)
The contribution of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan to early childhood development (ECD) and education (ECE)
is an area selected for in-depth assessment in a case study. The aim is to determine the extent of
UNICEF’s contribution and outline the results of that contribution in a straightforward way. For the
methodology and a detailed Process Tracing analysis, see Annex 2.
The analysis includes the evaluation of UNICEF’s contribution to ECD/ECE approaches and tools:
community-based kindergartens and Child Development Centres (CDCs) within existing municipal
libraries; the development of a trans-sectoral intervention methodology, including the parenting
package and the piloting of early identification of and interventions for children with disabilities, to
the modelling of home visiting. The Process Tracing analysis also examined UNICEF’s contribution to
remote pre-school lessons and preparations for the safe reopening of kindergartens; the revision of
the ECD/ECE standards, the development of ECD/ECE capacity (including technical assistance and
trainings to mainstream ECD into education sector plans and budgets) and improved financing. The
medium- and long-term changes expected by UNICEF and assessed are linked to (a) a better
understanding of the importance of ECD among decision-makers, (b) the continued prioritization of
ECE to achieve the Government's target of 80 per cent coverage by 2022 (given that the present
coverage of ECE is 40 per cent), (c) the improved coverage of ECD/ECE services in 2021 compared to
2014 and improved child well-being, reflected in the steady decline of infant and under-five mortality
rates.
The analysis allows us to be confident about UNICEF’s contribution to impact for children at scale
regarding improved access to ECD/ECE services. UNICEF provided national authorities with:
- guidelines and methodologies for inclusive ECD and ECE in community-based kindergartens
and CDCs within existing municipal libraries
- ECE standards that have been approved by the Government
- remote pre-school lessons and the preparation for the safe reopening of kindergartens
- assessments and documentation of the model projects for the early identification of children
with disabilities and the development of a trans-sectoral intervention methodology, including
the scale up the model projects on the parenting package.
The standards and guidelines are implemented in pre-school facilities across the country
(community-based kindergartens and CDCs) and are beneficial for all children in terms of the daily
work of pre-school teachers. The remote pre-school lessons and the procedures for the safe reopening
of kindergartens have been provided to all children in 2020. Data on the model projects are discussed
at Ministry level with a view to their scale up. This evidence of UNICEF’s impact for children at scale
and its contribution to better ECE is recognized by stakeholders.
There is also sufficient evidence to be confident that access to ECE remains a priority for the
Government, aiming to reach the 80 per cent coverage target by 2022. Specific actions and
institutional responsibilities are planned in several official documents and assumed by the relevant
institutions, but ECD/ECE funding needs to be improved.
In addition, while coverage of ECD/ECE services improved in 2019 compared to 2014, the coverage
for the most vulnerable children is still limited. Community-based kindergartens and CDCs are

planned as essential tools to integrate children from rural areas, those from poor households and
children with disabilities into early education, but their opening in the most vulnerable areas is still
ongoing, and no impact was yet visible at the time of this evaluation.
The evaluation team did not have enough evidence to confirm that UNICEF’s contributions directly
improved policies of the Government of Kyrgyzstan on cross-sectoral planning for ECD. However, we
can be cautiously confident that public officials increased their capacity for ECD/ECE financing and
budgeting planning, but this does not translate into confidence about the practical improvement in
financing that will ensure achievement of the 80 per cent ECE attendance target in 2022.
The systemic results of UNICEF contribution to financing the ECD and ECE are good and plans for the
development of better budgeting have been established in cooperation with the Ministry of Education
and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. However, these plans could be negatively impacted by a
lack of institutional and human resource capacity, conflicting government priorities and shrinking
fiscal space in the context of the socio-economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The statistics on the infant and under-five mortality rates shows improved access and quality to
health services for new-borns and young children. There is convincing evidence in Government
reports and stakeholders’ declaration that UNICEF contributed to the improved healthcare standards
that spurred this progress. However, there is still no convincing evidence of governmental
commitment to develop cross-sectoral early childhood services as a strategy to maintain and
accelerate the trend of declining infant and child mortality rates.
This relates to the fact that ECD is not a policy sector and remains scattered across other sectors, with
little progress at policy/government level in ensuring coordination and trans-disciplinary work. The
institutionalization of ECE within the MoES – which has organized a separate department for ECE (the
Preschool Department) – is an important indicator of governmental support for this area but does not
indicate the cross-sectoral policy approach needed for ECD.
Although existing evidence mentioned allow a cautiously optimistic assessment of ECD/ECE policy
development and UNICEF’s contribution to this policy progress, the most important bottlenecks
identified still need to be addressed:
- lack of training and overall capacity of local staff in educational institutions (and of local social
workers) to address the needs of young children in a comprehensive/holistic way
- lack of motivation (including wages) and other capacity elements (communication and team-
work competences) for transdisciplinary teams that need to work together
- lack of strong and clear cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms at government and local
level, including the lack of joint sector reviews that could represent a good co-management
tool.
In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on reduced access to services and increased
poverty affects the development of ECD / ECE because it affects the available budgets for service
developments and increases the major risk factor associated with lack of access to ECD/ECE: namely
poverty.
Climate-resilient development and disaster risk reduction (Output 2.6)
The Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) and the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES)
jointly developed a roadmap on the national scale-up of disaster risk reduction (DRR) in
educational institutions. The initial model was proposed by UNICEF in partnership with the Red
Crescent Society.
UNICEF supported the development of two guidelines by MoES and MES were supported in 2017 – the
school-based DRR guideline for school administrations and the disaster risk assessment and analysis
(DRA) guideline for municipalities. These guidelines were transformed into 11 video lessons in 2020.
This helped to raise awareness and knowledge on climate and environment risk and support
communication at national level. DRR in schools programme has been scaled up nationwide with
UNICEF’s support and generous funding from the Government of Japan.

Positive changes regarding child protection and child access to justice (Outcome 3)
Although slow, progress can be observed on combating violence against children and the
prevention of child marriage. The adoption of the revised Child Code in July 2021 by Parliament
represents a major step forward. This differs from the previous version in banning the corporal
punishment of children in all settings –the first legal document in Kyrgyzstan to do so – and will
be enacted once signed by the President.
The revised Code is essential, given that data from 2020 show that violence against children and women
remains widespread. According to the 2021 SitAn, “domestic violence rates have been increasing
steadily. In 2012-2015 the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported 2,500-3,500 cases annually, while in
2020, over 9,000 cases were registered”.110 MICS 2018 found that 47.5 per cent of children in Kyrgyzstan
are exposed to physical punishment and 5.4 per cent of children are exposed to severe physical
punishment. In addition, 70 per cent of children have experienced psychological aggression. Another
alarming finding is that a quarter of adolescents (25 per cent) in Kyrgyzstan believe that a husband is
justified in beating his wife under some circumstances.111
Child marriage remains a major challenge and continues to be tolerated by a relatively substantial
proportion of the population.112 In this context, there is an ongoing commitment by both government
and civil society to the prevention of child marriage and a national action plan to prevent child marriage
was endorsed in September 2020 to consolidate and strengthen joint efforts in this area. UNICEF is also
monitoring judicial practice on child marriage cases and supports the work of CSOs on this issue in pilot
communities. A mobile application for the prevention of violence against girls and child marriage was
developed (with UNICEF support) to generate social change, as well as a better response from
authorities. This application reached over 150,000 downloads by the end of 2020.
During the 2020 lockdown, 86 per cent of children living in residential institutions returned to their
families – an opportunity to assess their situation. Data collected by UNICEF show that most parents and
caregivers wanted to keep their children in their families.113 The data was compiled by interviews that
show that institutional resistance to change may be the most important bottleneck to be addressed in
advocacy to advance reforms on childcare and de-institutionalization.
In 2021, the revised Child Code introduced special provisions on the rights to child protection for
children left without parental care, with stronger guardianship provisions in the legal framework to
protect children of migrants and other vulnerable children. The new legal framework also aims to
strengthen case management for vulnerable children and families and establish units of social workers
to offer social services at the local level. UNICEF’s advocacy strategies have contributed to this important
progress. There is also a window of opportunity to enhance the quality and effectiveness of preventive
and response services.
Two normative acts were issued and approved in the field of justice for children: the “Procedure for
interaction between state bodies on juvenile probation” and the “Procedure for the application of
juvenile probation and registration of juvenile clients.” UNICEF has advocated for this new legal
framework and supports it through the training of lawyers to work on children’s cases and the creation
of a roster of lawyers who specialize in child-friendly justice at the Ministry of Justice. Over 60 per cent
of lawyers offering public free legal aid have now been trained on child-friendly legal justice. Legally and
theoretically, legal aid is now accessible to all children in contact with the justice system, but there is
insufficient evidence to assess whether all children have access, in practice, to specialized and child-
friendly legal aid.

UNICEF is one of few organizations active in Kyrgyzstan that prioritizes the development and
participation of young people. The STEM4Girls initiative, for example, targets young girls to
enhance their competencies and enable them to participate more actively in social and economic
life. The Adolescents Development and Participation programme (ADAP), including UPSHIFT,
and a range of initiatives such as the promotion of child- and youth-friendly cities, is being
implemented to empower and engage young people, and to facilitate their participation in
decision-making.
Particularly superior results are observed in the municipalities where UNICEF has implemented its
ADAP programme. However, national statistics are not yet available to show impact at country level for
most young people.114 The following case study explores UNICEF’s contribution to youth participation
at local level though the implementation of the Youth and Child Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG)
initiative.
Case study on UNICEF contribution to adolescents and youth engagement and participation
UNICEF has been implementing the Youth and Child Friendly Local Governance (YCFLG)
initiative in Kyrgyzstan as part of its peacebuilding programming. The initiative has also been
promoted at national level in partnership with the government youth agency (State Agency for
Youth, Physical Culture and Sports under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic). In total, 47
municipalities have participated in YCFLG activities to date. In 2019-2020, 18 cities
participated in a national competition of youth- and child-friendly cities.
This case study uses Contribution Analysis as its main methodological framework to assess how
UNICEF contributed to one important medium-term result: government promotion of youth
engagement initiatives at local level; and to short-term results related to enhanced youth
participation at local level.
The analysis of the collected evidence115 shows that UNICEF piloted YCFLG successfully, with two
main objectives:
1) To encourage young people to participate in local governance (including young people
empowerment and engagement) and
2) To raise the awareness and skills of duty bearers and (to a lesser extent) caregivers (parents)
and their capacity to listen to child and adolescents’ voices and to include them in their
decision-making processes.
Additional objectives related to peacebuilding and social cohesion have been added to the
implementation of the initiative in Kyrgyzstan’s border regions as part of the peacebuilding
programming.
The intervention included two types of activities.
1) Participatory activities included participatory research by adolescents and young people to
identify their needs and priorities and consultations with them. Other participatory activities
included the organization of youth councils that provided ideas and feedback for local
planning, based on consultation with their peers
2) Activities for duty bearers, together and separate from the activities with young people,
included hearings of young people to inform decision-making at local level in line with their
needs and expectations.
In some areas, youth engagement activities have been implemented jointly by UNICEF, UNFPA and
UNDP, with the dedicated evaluation observing a very good quality of cooperation.116
114 UNICEF’s work that targets young people is complex and covers different areas, as presented in Annex 2.
115 Evidence in this case includes evaluations and reviews of projects implemented within the framework of Adolescents
Participation adn Empowerment Programme, UNICEF annual reports and interviews conducted with UNCIEF specialists,
implementing partners and representatives of the Government.

Uzbekistan’ (2019-2020)”, 2021.
41
As most outreach to young people to encourage their participation in activities was organized in
schools, support from teachers proved to be a key factor in the results achieved, as well as the support
and openness from local authorities and community leaders throughout the activities and the absence
of direct opposition from parents. Equally, however, results were hindered in some areas by a lack of
support from teachers, local authorities and community leaders or the direct opposition of parents.
These activities generated, according to the reviews and evaluation conducted by UNICEF:
1) a satisfactory level of engagement and satisfaction from young people and
2) youth and child responsive plans in several municipalities.
At local level, activities have been implemented to empower young people and encourage their
engagement. These include the Leadership and Innovation Academy, Janyration Chakyrygy Creative
contest, cross-border events among youth. These have been considered effective, although they have
not always been very well coordinated and connected.
Data collected from participants in these initiatives confirm that boys and young men felt empowered.
However, the data on the impact of girls’ participation is not consistent, with some evidence showing
that they too felt empowered and had more opportunities to participate, while other evidence shows
lack of empowerment.117
The percentage of Kyrgyz girls who participated in the programme: ‘Increasing Resilience of Youth
for Peaceful and Inclusive Communities in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan’ that felt excluded and powerless
increased by 6 per cent after programme implementation compared to the baseline at the start of the
programme.118 However, this finding is not consistent with any other piece of evidence and it is not
possible, therefore, to identify any factor that could account for this result or whether there is an error
in the measurement of the quoted statistics.
Although interventions for youth engagement and participation at local level aimed to include
vulnerable adolescents and young people, the evidence form existing reports on projects
implemented by UNICEF is not consistent in this regard. More have been involved in project activities
in municipalities included in peacebuilding programmes, as per the programme design (placed
purposefully in marginalized areas). They have included those from ethnic minorities who face
language barriers, are otherwise from the community, or have been in conflict with the law. Reports
indicate that adolescents and young people with disabilities have also been involved.
The youth who participated in the project ‘Promoting Kyrgyzstan’s youth cohesion and interaction
towards Uzbekistan’ described it as a revealing experience of initiation into adulthood and self-
leadership. The most spectacular transformations were witnessed among those who were the most
withdrawn at the outset, the most geographically isolated, and among young girls who discovered the
roles they could take on.119 In contrast, however, there is no similar evidence on the involvement of
children in vulnerable situations in all cities considered as ‘growth points’ that are included in the
Child Friendly Cities initiative.
According to interviewed stakeholders, UNICEF representatives and anecdotal evidence, where the
involvement of vulnerable adolescent and young people took place, this was supported by the
involvement of mentors in peer-to-peer activities. There is, however, a need for further research on
the contribution of such mentors to overall impact.
The impact at the level of local authorities is limited to plans adopted with the participation of young
people. There is no consistent evidence about the implementation of the activities planned or,
therefore, on the long-term commitment of the local authorities – which suggests a need to strengthen
monitoring in this area.
In contrast, the interventions for youth engagement and participation at local level were appreciated
at national level and there was government buy-in, including participation in the organization of the
national ‘Child and Youth Friendly Cities’ competition. This competition concluded in April 2021 with
117 End of Programme Review Report for the programme: Increasing Resilience of Youth for Peaceful and Inclusive
Communities in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (2016-2020), 2021.

IMPACT Activities and outputs Assumptions / positive Risks
factors
UNICEF is directing advocacy efforts and technical support to drive the institutionalization of youth-
and child-friendly planning and budgeting at local level. The objective is to ensure the mandatory
collection of age and sex-disaggregated data on the needs and demands of children and young people.
The national endorsement of the ‘Child and Youth Friendly Cities’ initiative may be a crucial step for
the collection of data about child and youth needs.
There is, however, no guaranteed sustainability for local activities to address these needs or for the
continuation of empowerment and engagement activities that will allow young people to participate.
43
But the fact that the experts identified 26 indicators for youth and child friendly cities to support the
‘Child and Youth Friendly Cities’ competition is a sign that sustainability can be ensured if monitoring
is continued.
One specific area of UNICEF’s work during the CP (2019-2022) was the repatriation and integration of
children from conflict zones, affected by the conflict in the Middle East and who had previously been in
areas controlled by the so-called ‘Islamic State’. UNICEF advocated to the Government for procedures to
realize their rights in relation to their repatriation to Kyrgyzstan and supported a comprehensive cross-
sectoral action plan for their integration into families and local communities. Development partners
interviewed acknowledged UNICEF’s instrumental contribution and its success in mainstreaming child
and human rights to the integration process.
No unexpected impact of UNICEF was identified by the evaluation based on interviews and
documents analysed.
3.3.1.2. Summary findings on UNICEF’s contributions to the observed changes
As shown in the assessment of the impact above, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan made important
contributions to the results observed and presented, which represent positive changes in
policies and institutional capacity and for the lives of children in Kyrgyzstan.
A comprehensive account of UNICEF contribution to the reported impact is presented in Annex 1 and
specific detailed examples are analysed as part of the Process Tracing and Contribution Analysis case
studies for three areas (as summarized in the previous sections and presented in more detail in Annex
2): (1) early childhood development and education, (2) adolescents’ development and participation and
(3) social protection.
For all outputs envisaged by the Country Programme, UNICEF implemented activities that generated an
impact for institutional change through five approaches (strategies):
- advocacy for policy development and change regarding national strategies and the legal
framework, providing evidence and research results120 to support advocacy messages and
linking model projects to policy development
- technical assistance to key institutions for child rights and services: the National Statistics
Committee, the Ministry of Education and Science, healthcare providers, the Ministry of Justice,
etc.
- support for the training of duty bearers in the fields of education, health, law-enforcement and
the judiciary, including training for decision-makers and policymakers in local government and
training for better public funding (in early childhood development and education)
- engagement with civil society partners, active at both national and local level, for advocacy
- engagement with development partners, particularly (but not exclusively), through the
Development Partners Coordination Council (DPCC).
A more visible impact of UNICEF is in its country response to COVID-19. At local level, in selected
municipalities where model and pilot projects have been implemented, interviewed stakeholders expect
to see a more significant impact in the fields of early childhood development and education, youth
development and participation and interventions for children with disabilities. They also expect to see
impact in terms of general improvements in the local government approach to early childhood
development and youth and finance for these areas as a result of the Better Early Learning and
120 For example, in 2020 only: UNICEF continued to support the Government to build a solid evidence base for policy making
to improve the situation of children and women and fulfil its international commitments. Two situation analyses of children
with disabilities and the well-being of adolescents and youth were undertaken to inform advocacy with national
counterparts, as well as UNICEF’s future programme. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scope of evidence
generation was expanded to include an assessment of its socio-economic impact to inform advocacy and a timely policy
response. This was done through both a child poverty assessment based on economic data and projections and a household
survey.
44
Development at Scale Initiative (BELDS) training for better education financing at local level, and the
Youth and Child Friendly Local Government Initiative, implemented in synergy with UPSHIFT, as tools
to ensure both the involvement and empowerment of authorities and other duty bearers, as well as
adolescents and young people.
UNICEF’s contribution to behavioural changes among duty bearers and caregivers (parents) is
appreciated by the interviewed stakeholders. In the case of duty bearers, UNICEF’s contribution to
behavioural changes was the result of its organization of trainings and events (seminars, workshops,
round tables, and conferences). Advocacy and communication for behaviour change had a synergic
impact with the capacity building activities, already mentioned. However, interviews also show that
changes in attitudes and behaviour are not yet sustainable, given the political instability in Kyrgyzstan
and the sometimes-conflicting messages shared across the country by its leadership and mass media.
Continued communication activities are, therefore, essential.
Stakeholders appreciated UNICEF’s contribution to the response to COVID-19 as instrumental and
undoubtedly impactful, including: the endowment of key institutions responding to the pandemic with
essential products and technical assistance (Ministry of Education, healthcare providers, schools, etc.),
as well as support to the Government on communication about how to keep safe during and after the
lockdown.
3.3.1.3. Conditions and factors supporting the impact of UNICEF’s Country
Programme
A summary of the strategies used by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan (presented in Annex 1) shows that the
CO enjoyed mulitiple conditions and factors that supported the impact of its CP (2018-2022):
support from authorities for cooperation; the quality of that cooperation; UNICEF’s brand and its
fundraising capacity; and its use of complementary approaches. However, the data collected for
this evaluation show mostly bottlenecks that hindered the programme’s effectiveness and
impact, as explored in more detail in the next section of this report.

The most important mechanisms supporting UNICEF impact are as follows.
- Support from Kyrgyzstan’s authorities for cooperation, based on external factors that are
specific to the country and its Government:
o the country’s long-term commitment to human rights and the SDGs
o its agreement with the UN and the constant advocacy from different development
partners for the monitoring all commitments.
- The quality of cooperation and partnerships, based on internal factors (specific to the UNICEF
CO):
o UNICEF’s leadership role in the Development Partners Coordination Council (DPCC) as
co-chair of the education and social protection partners’ groups, which has enabled
particularly good advocacy results in the field of education
46
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with central authorities and on
support for long term, consistent and persistent interventions in each area of its work,
despite changes in the structure and composition of the government
o UNICEF’s emphasis on building effective partnerships with local governments to
implement model/pilot projects
o UNICEF’s emphasis on ensuring sustainable partnerships with implementing partners
with a good knowledge of the local environment and good expertise in their field.
- UNICEF’s brand, which supports cooperation with local authorities and organizations.
- UNICEF’s fundraising capacity, which proved to be important in the response to COVID-19 and
in other instances when direct service delivery has been needed to support the most
marginalized and vulnerable children and/or to build effective model/pilot projects that are
subsequently used in advocacy.
- The use of complementary approaches, with successful results that build on UNICEF’s brand and
its existing partnerships, particularly:
o the support from local and religious community leaders
o the use of information and communication technology (ICT) and gamification, which
proved effective in urban settings and in UNICEF’s work with young people, but also with
parents and other duty bearers in 2020
o grounding the C4D strategies and roadmaps in scientific research data about social
norms and how they change.
The following assumptions, presented in the ToC support mechanisms for UNICEF impact:
- political will and skills support SDG localisation
- local authorities are willing to listen to the voices of young people
- stakeholders are interested and committed.
The case study on UNICEF’s impact on youth development and participation also shows that young
people are confident and express their views, confirming another assumption.
We also see, however, that some assumptions identified in the ToC have not materialized, according to
the assessment of UNICEF’s impact in Kyrgyzstan:
- the Government takes evidence-based decisions
- the Government allocates adequate financial and administrative resources
- the Government prioritizes the child rights agenda
- the Government can scale up and institutionalize developed models.
Although the Government received UNICEF’s support for evidence-based decisions and the better
allocation of financial and administrative resources, as well as recommendations to prioritize the child
rights agenda and scale up and institutionalize developed models, there is no consistent evidence that
these assumptions are valid across all areas of UNICEF’s work. There is evidence that these assumptions
are present in of early childhood education. But we lack evidence on the presence of the necessary
political will for evidence-based decision making, child-centred resource allocation, the prioritization of
the child rights agenda and the scaling-up of UNICEF modeling initiatives in relation to services for
children with disabilities or social protection for all children through universal coverage.
There is no evidence on the confidence of parents/caregivers in practicing positive parenting norms.
Equally, there is no evidence to confirm the assumption of low resistance to change in social norms in
Kyrgyz society. As shown in the next section of this report, existing social norms and their resistance to
change are among the most important bottlenecks that hinder UNICEF’s impact.
3.3.2. Did UNICEF identify and reassess bottlenecks throughout programme
implementation?
The impact of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan is hindered by important bottlenecks related to the country’s
political and institutional instability and continuous turnover within the authorities with which
UNICEF works; limited capacity for service provision for the realization of child rights at central
and local level; limited policy coordination and cross-sectoral and inter-institutional
47
cooperation; limited disaggregated data and use of data to inform decisions about children;
limited fiscal space and financial resources; and social norms that are not in line with human-
rights values. Most bottlenecks are systemic and relate to the entire public administration or
society (not only to child rights protection and services). As a result, UNICEF activities to counter
them or cope with them can be only partially successful.
The CP documents include bottlenecks and risks, with special reference to the Strategic Note from 2017.
The risk mitigation measures planned in the CP documents are vague:
- anchoring programme results in the multiyear national development framework
- investing in building the capabilities of officials in public administration, particularly in results-
based management
- generating public demand for results by disseminating evidence of successful models through
traditional and social media to prove their potential benefits for children
- donor engagement and participation in joint resource mobilization within the UN system.
Interviews allowed the evaluation team to identify the six most important bottlenecks and risks that
affected CP implementation, in practice:
(1) political and institutional instability, including changes in the structure and the main
responsibilities of ministries
(2) limited capacity for service provision for the realization of child rights at central and local level
(3) limited policy coordination and cross-sectoral or inter-institutional cooperation
(4) limited (disaggregated) data and limited use of data for decision making concerning children
(5) limited fiscal space and financial resources, a limited public budget dedicated to services for
children
(6) social norms that conflict with human-rights values (concerning the position of children in
society and family, violence against children, and the age of marriage).
There are also two associated risks that have affected UNICEF’s work. First, the risks related to losing
the achievements already made (including the capacity developed) because of the high turnover of
political leadership and civil servants and specialists involved in providing services for children. Second:
the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdown. Taken together, these eight risks
are outlined in Table 1, below, which positions them alongside those anticipated in the CP ToC.

children
- Risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the The overall social and economic impact of COVID-19 (risk added

CPD)
The bottlenecks identified during programme implementation are in line with those anticipated in the
ToC, although the magnitude of political changes taking place in 2020-2021 could not be foreseen.
However, response mechanisms that were used by the CO when dealing with political turnover have
been put in place to ensure the continuation of cooperation with the new regime.
UNICEF responded to (1) political instability and the transition to the new Constitution using three
complementary approaches:
- persevering with its advocacy work, as new leadership in the government and ministries
entailed countless meetings and other activities to inform new decision-makers about UNICEF’s
approach and projects and to gain their support
- leveraging cooperation with other UN agencies and development partners
- using data and success stories (including UNICEF’s track record of success) to ensure the
continuation of support.
These strategies proved to be successful, as the President of the Kyrgyz Republic supported the
nationwide competition ‘Child and Youth Friendly Cities,’ UNICEF is participating in the working group
on the inventory of the Legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Child Code (with provisions
supported by UNICEF) was adopted by Parliament in July 2021.
However, all development partners and some UNICEF staff interviewed underlined difficulties in
continuing the advocacy in 2021, reporting a period accommodation necessary with the new regime
under the 2021 Constitution. Together with the need to reassess priorities in response to the needs
generated by the COVID-19 crisis, the political transition may be a factor that slows the pace of reforms.
There is also a strong connection between the bottlenecks related to the limited capacity for service
provision and the risks related to the high turnover of human resources, particularly in terms of the
beneficiaries of capacity building activities. Several stakeholders stated that any capacity building
activity ‘is doomed to be the work of Sisyphus’ because better competences increase the motivation for
the emigration of professionals working with children, as they increase their chances of successful
integration into another labour market.
In this case there was no clear UNICEF strategy to deal with the respective bottlenecks and risks.
However, the following activities have been partly successful:
- providing trainings of trainers and working with a pool of trainers at national level to roll-out
and replicate trainings where needed (as in the case of the initiative promoting better financing
for early childhood education)
- providing a well-designed curriculum and training materials that allow for the replication of
training when needed (as in the case of the curricula for lawyers to improve legal aid for children
in contact with the law)
- using online training tools and methods to ensure that training is available for unfamiliar staff
whenever needed to the same level of quality as initially delivered (e.g., the trainings
implemented in the framework of the projects for adolescents’ development and participation,
and in the field of justice for children).
For the bottlenecks related to (3) the limited cross-sectoral and inter-institutional cooperation, (4) the
limited existence and use of data and (5) the limited fiscal space and financial resources for the
realisation of child rights, there are three types of activities identified implemented by UNICEF in close
49
coordination with government authorities (the ministries) and the National Statistics Committee.
Among these activities there are dedicated projects and remarkable achievements (as noted earlier in
this report) concerning improvements to the national statistical system, recommendations from model
projects on coordination, and budgetary analyses and recommendations on financing and better
allocations of the existing budgets, together with significant efforts to engage international donors and
mobilize resources.
To address (6) social norms, C4D continues to be a priority for UNICEF Kyrgyzstan. The CO implements
activities for community engagement and media campaigns, uses peer-to-peer communication and
social media to promote its message to people across to diverse groups. Three approaches have been
appreciated by stakeholders and represent good practices identified by the evaluation team in
addressing the bottlenecks related to social norms:
- In the case of duty bearer, C4D is undertaken in cooperation with a large number of trainings
and events (seminars, workshops, round tables, and conferences) organized by UNICEF. In this
respect advocacy and communication for behaviour change have had a synergic impact.
- In the case of adolescents and young people, communication using social media and gamification
is used (based on the number of engaged adolescents and young people).
- In the case of rural communities, UNICEF and implementing partners collaborate with
community and religious leaders, particularly on the promotion of messages against child
marriage and bride kidnaping.
Interviewed stakeholders pointed out that C4D activities need to continue to generate sustainable
results. The SitAn 2021 findings emphasise that social norms remain an important bottleneck that needs
to be addressed in Kyrgyzstan.
UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is limited to a short-term response to date. However, the
activities implemented by UNICEF have been consistent with a strategy to support the country (the
society and its government) to cope with the crisis in a very harsh socio-economic context, with
anticipated rises in poverty, unemployment and school drop-out.
The strategies and activities that have been implemented regarding bottlenecks and risk management
proved to be in line with the mitigation measures planned in the CP documents, although the initial
planning was vague and unclear.
3.3.3. Did different groups, including children and the most marginalized, benefit in
different ways from the Country Programme?
Data and information collected for this evaluation show that the UNICEF CP in Kyrgyzstan and its
implementation accounted for differences between children and the needs of the most
marginalized to a large extent. However, some vulnerable children benefited less from the work
of UNICEF. Table 2 below presents a summary of the vulnerable and marginalized children who
benefit from the CP and those who do not.
It is also important to underline that vulnerable and marginalized children have only been covered by
projects that have limited geographical coverage. These projects are important as pilots to support
advocacy at national level on the introduction of solutions and to gauge whether the tested measures
prove effective and impactful. However, they are not directly generating change at national scale.

3.3.4. Are UNICEF results likely to be maintained over time?
There is a general agreement among stakeholders that the results achieved by UNICEF’s CP
regarding the legal and strategic framework for children are sustainable. However, the
realization of children’s rights in practice and their access to services may be affected, in the next
years, by the socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, although there are not
enough data to assess the precise impact of the crisis in the future.
The sustainability of UNICEF’s impact in terms of improved policies for children is assessed as high. The
Decree “on the inventory of the Legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic” (from 8 February 2021, No. 26),
which was issued to optimize and improve the country’s entire legislative framework, is not expected
to undermine the sustainability of UNICEF’s impact on legislation for children rights and services.
UNICEF is present in the Expert Group124 and the 2021 Constitution continues to underline the
commitment of the Kyrgyz Republic to human rights and international conventions ratified.
However, there is a shared perception among some stakeholders interviewed that the shrinking space
for civil society, coupled with the support of the country’s leadership support for traditional values
(even when these are not in line with human-rights values) presents is a risk for sustainability.
Significant risks to sustainability are also generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related
economic and social impact for the most vulnerable. The extent of this risk for the future remains to be
measured, but the consistent work of UNICEF in close cooperation with the national and local
governments to respond to the COVID-19 crisis allows for cautious optimism related to the
sustainability of the results achieved beyond 2021.
As noted elsewhere in this report, another sustainability risk relates to the high turnover and migration
of civil service staff, which has been analysed as a factor that hinders programme results.
3.3.5. Which strategies or group of strategies were effective in producing results at
scale?
The impact assessment and case studies show that the UNICEF CO utilized a wide range of
strategies, as described in UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2022, and that all of them proved to be
effective, especially when they were combined.
A summary of the strategies used by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan is presented in Annex 1. The change strategies
used most frequently are as follows.
- The power of evidence is used to drive change for children by providing evaluation and research
in policymaking and/or by advocating for improvements in the state statistical system so that
more data about child well-being can be used for better adapted policy plans and measures. For
example, a report by the World Bank and UNICEF on the predicted increase in child poverty
informed advocacy and there is a credible claim that it contributed to influencing the
Government to expand coverage of social protection scheme for children by 7 per cent in 2020.
- Innovation in programming and advocacy for children is fostered by promoting modelling or
pilot projects, most often in partnership with local authorities, and local implementing partners.
One important example is the intervention in the field of adolescents’ development,
empowerment, engagement and participation, which combines at least two innovative tools: the
child-friendly city initiative and UPSHIFT for social innovation. Other examples can be seen in
ECD/ECE, where UNICEF piloted multiple interventions for inclusive kindergartens, the
development of Child Development Centres, the development of home visiting practice, and the
development of transdisciplinary work for ECD/ECE.
- UNICEF has helped to win support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider
public through C4D and communication for behaviour change, but also through advocacy
activities and trainings with a two-fold objective: developing competences/capacities; and
124 The members of the interdepartmental expert group are representatives of the Parliament (Jogorku Kenesh) of the Kyrgyz
Republic, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic, the General Prosecutor's Office of the Kyrgyz Republic, executive
authorities and local self-government bodies, business structures, non-governmental organizations and independent experts.
55
influencing attitudes and behaviours among duty bearers, caregivers, but also among children
and adolescents. C4D uses two strategic approaches to address different target groups:
o Gaining support from local and religious community leaders
o Using ICTs and gamification – effective in urban settings and when working with young
people, but also with parents and other duty bearers in 2020.
- The combined efforts of UN agencies, working together, proved to be successful in the
implementation in the field of adolescents’ development, empowerment, engagement and
participation.
- The development and leveraging of resources and partnerships for children proved to be an
effective strategy, especially by influencing domestic planning, financing and the delivery of
services for children, using, as a rule, three main tools:
o building alliances with development partners/agencies, particularly within the DPCC
o technical assistance to key institutions (and duty bearers), for example the NSC, the
MoES and healthcare providers
o the help of, and cooperation with, implementing partners.
The case studies on the impact areas conducted using Process Tracing and Contribution Analysis allow
for a limited analysis of the effectiveness of strategies and combination of strategies used, as presented
in the table below.

There is also sufficient evidence to be confident that, because of the
advocacy and technical assistance of UNICEF and other stakeholders,
access to ECE remains a priority for the Government, which aims to reach
the target of 80% coverage by 2022.
There is not enough evidence at the disposal of the evaluation team to
assess with confidence that UNICEF contributions directly improved the
cross-sectoral policies needed in the field of ECD. However, we can be
cautiously confident that public officials increased their capacity for
financing and budgeting planning regarding ECD/ECE, but this is not
enough to be confident about the practical improvement in financing that
will ensure implementation of the governmental commitment concerning
the ECE attendance target of 80% in 2022.
There is no evidence on the institutionalization of the cross-sectoral policy

the World Bank, and one alternative explanation would be that the
Ministry’s decision on changing the eligibility filters for child benefits was
taken independently of development partners because of the additional
social pressure generated by COVID-19. There is, however, a striking
similarity between the decision taken, its visible impact, and the
recommendations made by UNICEF.
The analysis is limited by the fact that the strategies and combination of strategies found in the case
studies have similar level of effectiveness. However, two main lessons can be learned from the three
cases, as follows.
- Innovative approaches, based on model/piloting projects, generate impact for children at local
level, but will not be scaled-up without the implementation of additional strategies, and they
have a limited impact until the moment they are taken up by the government. Evidence collected,
for example, on programmes for children with disabilities or the home-vising model show that
there is open dialogue with the Government, but that scaling up after a project has had success
in a limited geographical area is not immediate. Institutional and political instability and the
bottlenecks related to institutional capacity at local level in all regions are important when
planning the scaling-up of innovative approaches.
- Using the power of evidence to drive change for children does not seem to be enough but does
have some impact on policy change when combined with a strategy to leverage resources and
partnerships for children, including the mobilization of UN agencies for children. This is
consistent with theories on policy change and advocacy.125

4. Conclusions, lessons learned and forward-looking
recommendations
4.1. Conclusions
The UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Programme (CP), 2018-2022, has been implemented, until
2021, under challenging conditions. These conditions have been shaped by the complex needs of
children in Kyrgyzstan, the institutional and political instability that has affected the country,
and the restrictions and socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This context remains
both sensitive and unpredictable and UNICEF Kyrgyzstan needs to take that into consideration
when planning.
UNICEF has the capacity to address the long-lasting and changing needs of children
The evaluation shows that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan has successfully addressed a range of important
and pressing needs for children in the country, particularly those who are the most vulnerable.
It has supported policy and institutional developments for the benefit of these children through
a combination of advocacy and technical assistance.
Data analysis and research on the role in UNICEF work is essential for two key reasons. First, data
analysis and research inform the UNICEF Country Office (CO) on the needs of children and the
effectiveness of existing measures to address these needs, enabling the CO to make decisions (during
programme planning and implementation) related to priorities and effective strategies. And second,
evidence generation is the most valuable tool for advocacy in the dialogue between UNICEF and the
Government of Kyrgyzstan. Evaluation reports are highly effective in guiding UNICEF towards the
design and implementation of interventions that address the most vulnerable children, thereby focusing
its work on their most pressing needs.
Evidence-based advocacy is complemented by other strategies to improve policy implementation and
the realization of children’s rights in Kyrgyzstan. The most important complementary strategy is the
work with partners. The ability of UNICEF to leverage the advantages of different partners and to act as
a convenor and consensus builder is essential for the impact for children at scale (at institutional level
and at individual level). In addition, the impact of UNICEF’s advocacy in Kyrgyzstan is linked not only to
its own direct efforts, but also to the opening of windows of opportunities by governmental partners
and/or others development partners.
Despite good identification of needs, however, there are groups of vulnerable and marginalized children
that are less covered by UNICEF work: young people who are not in education, employment or training
(NEETs), homeless children, most-at-risk and especially vulnerable adolescents. The lack of impact for
these groups is linked to the lack or limited number of UNICEF activities that target them directly.
UNICEF contributes to gender equality and acts to change social norms that conflict with this and other
child rights
A special note needs to be made concerning UNICEF relevance, effectiveness, and impact in
addressing gender equality. Following the Global Gender Action Plan (GAP) Evaluation in 201
and other assessments, the current UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CP is taking a strategic approach to
gender equality, integrating it into every aspect of the CP and its implementation.
The CO’s Gender Strategy was developed and endorsed to contextualize the GAP within the CPD and
identifies key gender inequality issues and strategic entry points for programming. Accountability
mechanisms to advance gender programming have been integrated into performance plans and the
Country Programme Document (CPD) also focuses on ensuring cross-sectoral work to improve gender
integration. Better statistics that reflect gender across all aspects of interest for children rights and well-
being have been promoted. This differs from the more sectoral perspective to gender equality that was
previously in place.
Although systemic progress and the change in social norms is a long-term process, the findings of this
evaluation allow us to conclude that the strategic approach to gender equality is increasing UNICEF’s
effectiveness and chances of impact.
58
Nevertheless, social norms and values contradictory to the human rights remain a key bottleneck
identified by the evaluation. The continued practice of child marriage and kidnapping for forced
marriage are important indicator of the significance of the bottlenecks related to social norms and
values. Therefore, UNICEF’s strategic and systemic approach to gender equality remains important and
needs to be continued with perseverance over time.
UNICEF’s comprehensive work with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has impact
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan has responded to the needs of the most vulnerable children and supported
the Government of Kyrgyzstan in meeting these needs in two main ways. First, UNICEF has
advocated for a strategic approach to all identified needs. Second, UNICEF has supported the
government to strengthen the responsible institutions to implement effective strategies.
This support has included enhancing national capacity to collect, analyse and use data, providing
training to key responsible stakeholders and working with state officials on budgeting for new services
or the development of services provided by the strategic documents. UNICEF has also encouraged the
institutionalization of key policy areas through the creation of dedicated departments within ministries,
including the creation of the Early Childhood Education department within the Ministry of Education
and Science (MoES).
The impact of UNICEF’s work is particularly visible in the significant improvements for children at
national scale, as seen in the national statistics, in areas where the strategic focus was implemented by
UNICEF together with institutional strengthening activities, as in the case of mother and child health
and early childhood education.
UNICEF work with partners is essential
UNICEF works effectively with a range of different partners to drive change for children and their
families in Kyrgyzstan. It has made effective use of its comparative advantages related to its
expertise, strategic focus and adaptability to build and sustain effective partnership for children
rights and well-being.
Four main types of partnerships are sustained by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan: (a) its partnership with the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, State agencies and other State bodies at national level; (b) its
partnership with local government, especially for model projects; (c) its partnership with development
partners and UN agencies on different common interest points; and (d) its partnership with civil society
organizations (CSOs) for advocacy and as implementing partners. The Social Network Analysis shows
the existence of a strong community, with various connections between actors in different clusters
formed around the CO departments, and that the partners are supporting each other to generate results
at scale.
The analysis at the level of each CP Outcome shows that the work with partners is instrumental in
supporting the success of UNICEF activities. Impactful partnerships include bilateral cooperation with
UN agencies and other international organizations and with implementation partners in Osh (in the case
of programmes for adolescents’ engagement and participation), as well as partnerships in the
framework of the United Nations Development Framework (UNDAF) and the Development Partners
Coordination Council (DPCC).
The evaluation, therefore, shows that UNICEF’s work with partners is both important and valuable.
However, except for the partnership with the Government, the work of the CO with partners is not
included in the CPD as a strategic element. Considering the value of the partnership, this evaluation
recommends that a strategic approach to partnerships is included in the next CPD, as an explicit element.
UNICEF has impact, but there are limitations and sustainability risks
In most areas where UNICEF Kyrgyzstan works, available evidence shows important progress in
the realization of child rights in the country, despite the unfavourable contextual factors,
including political and institutional instability, the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavourable social
norms and the rise of a conservative approach to gender roles.
Most of the results included in the ToC have been achieved and have determined UNICEF impact,
although not all the initial assumptions proved to be correct and additional bottlenecks and risks
59
appeared during CP implementation. Examples of impact at scale for children in the country, generated
by national policies with UNICEF support, include:
- the adoption of the revised Child Code by Parliament in July 2021
- the institutionalization of national multidimensional poverty measurement
- the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(CRPD) in 2019 and the development of clear plans for its implementation in the country
- improvements in healthcare and nutrition for children, visible in the reduction of child, infant
and neonatal mortality rates
- improvements in clinical standards, protocols and the capacity of medical staff in maternal, child
and adolescent health in several healthcare facilities in the country
- improved vaccination capacity in the country, visible in the good situation of immunization of
children
- the adoption of the Food Security and Nutrition Programme 2019-2023
- improved access to early childhood education and government commitment to accelerate
progress
- the adoption of the ‘Education Development Programme for 2021-2040’ (EDS) and its first
implementation Action Plan for 2021-2023, as well as an improved education management
information system (EMIS), all of which contribute to improved education quality
- strengthened free legal aid for children
- improved adolescent participation and greater social cohesion among them in selected areas.
The impact is, however, limited by several bottlenecks and risks that remain salient and that hinder the
results of UNICEF work, some of them sector specific. These include the limited capacity of healthcare
services, conservative practice in the educational system (such as the promotion of traditional gender
roles and learning methods that do not encourage students to express their opinions), and the complex
system of residential institutions for children without parental care (organized under several
Ministries).
UNICEF identified and reassessed bottlenecks throughout programme implementation and
implemented strategies to cope with them. However, these strategies have been only partly effective,
given the scale of the bottlenecks. The most important tactics in the implementation of these strategies
are: continuous advocacy activities, adapted to respond to changes in decision-makers or institutional
settings, and the design of capacity building activities, such as trainings, considering the bottlenecks
related to political and institutional instability and the associated risks to sustainability. Dedicated CP
outputs and activities allowed UNICEF to address bottlenecks related to the limited capacity for service
provision for the realization of child rights and insufficient policy coordination.
Less impact is visible in areas where two significant bottlenecks have hindered the results of UNICEF’s
work: the continued presence of social norms and values that are contrary to human rights and limited
inter-sectoral cooperation. There is, for example, only slow progress on the development of an early
identification system for children with disabilities and of services for these children, because they are
affected by these bottlenecks.
Significant risks to the sustainability of activities have been generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and
the resulting social and economic crises. In this context, reforms in the school system could be inefficient
to counteract the impact of limited access to remote lessons in 2020 and learning losses. The pressure
on the healthcare system showed systemic weaknesses and generated additional risks to maintaining
the impact already achieved on neonatal, infant and under-5 mortality rates. In addition, estimates on
rising poverty are alarming and generate a huge pressure on social and child protection systems that
remain weak.
UNICEF responded well to the COVID-19 pandemic
To meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, UNICEF Kyrgyzstan
implemented an integrated approach to prioritize the well-being of children. As a result, UNICEF
maintained its relevance in a context of rapidly changing needs and continued to work to
generate impact for all children.
60
The response to COVID-19 included: the provision of essential supplies to medical personnel working
at the frontlines; support for the procurement of COVID-19 medication for healthcare facilities and
technical assistance for healthcare providers to ensure continued access to healthcare; support for the
Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) to reach all pre-school and school-aged children (more than
1.4 million) with remote learning in 2020 and to prepare for the safe reopening of schools; the provision
of the Humanitarian Cash Transfer (HCT); and support for coordination with development partners and
UN agencies in the country in the response to COVID-19.
As mentioned, however, the pandemic generated significant risks to sustainability, with an economic
and social impact on the most vulnerable. The extent of this risk for the future remains to be measured,
but the evidence and findings of the evaluation demonstrate the need for continuous and close
cooperation between UNICEF and Kyrgyzstan national and local government authorities to respond to
the COVID-19 crisis and address the needs of children in poverty and those affected by social exclusion.
Children may be more exposed to the economic and social risks generated by the pandemic when they
have disabilities, lack parental care due to institutionalisation or parental migration, or live in remote
rural areas.
4.2. Lessons learned
The Country Programme (2018-2022) shows how, in times of rapid political, policy and
institutional change, a balance needs to be found between proposing or responding to ambitious
new agendas and giving stakeholders time to understand and commit to the agenda. In some
cases, it is necessary to act quickly, as UNICEF did in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In other cases, it may be advisable to slow down to allow more time for stakeholder buy-in, as
seen during the process of adopting the revised Child Code.
The experience of the CP demonstrates that it is essential to strengthen the capacity of both national
and local government staff to ensure the implementation of reforms. Institutional change and capacity
building is, however, known to be a long and challenging process.
Many lessons emerge from the current reforms that UNICEF Kyrgyzstan could share with other middle-
income countries, particularly those in the region that are going through a period of transition. For
example, in the areas of early childhood development and education (ECD and ECE), the experience of
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan has been mixed. It illustrates the way in which change for children at scale can be
generated through a comparison of the results in the sub-area of ECE with the other sub-areas. UNICEF
worked with government and development partners to integrate ECE into the strategic priorities of the
country and promote its institutionalization, and the MoES created a dedicated ECE department.
Capacity building was based on work carried out with this specialized department, but also on trainings
to improve budgeting at national and local level. Together with the strategic and institutional changes
to strengthen the area overall, UNICEF successfully promoted the scaling up of the country’s child
development centres (CDCs). All these activities are contributions to the increased access to ECE for
children across the country. In contrast, the strategic approach and institutional strengthening activities
have not been as strong in the promotion of home visiting (another component of the early childhood
development policy) and results are less visible in this area now. However, the legal framework was
updated and, according to UNICEF representative, the country is now preparing to scale-up.
This experience confirms that it is essential to create a sharp vision of the way in which
organizations or functions will be strengthened and how this will benefit staff, duty and rights
holders alike, and to lay out the main stages in institutional strengthening. This will aid the
monitoring of organizational change and the response to any problems that arise.
Innovative approaches, based on model/piloting projects and the use of innovative technologies,
generated impact for children at local level. They will not, however, be scaled-up unless they are
supported by additional implementation strategies. While these innovative approaches benefit
those participating, their wider impact is limited until the moment they are taken up by the government.
The CO’s annual report for 2018, for example, notes some challenges for the programme providing
micronutrient sprinkles (Gulazyk) in Kyrgyzstan during the previous CP. The programme was piloted
and scaled up by UNICEF between 2012 and 2018, using three main channels: primary healthcare
61
providers, village health committee volunteers and the mass media. However, several challenges
emerged in 2018, ranging from procurement issues to mistrust on the part of the Ministry of Health in
the effectiveness of the micronutrient intake.126
The key elements for the success for a programme that can be taken over by the government are:
- the development of government ownership
- planning at scale from the outset
- planning the scaling-up within the limits of government budgets, without significant reliance on
external resources, from the outset
- continuous monitoring and evaluation of a programme before and after its scaling up to
contribute to the continuous strengthening of evidence-informed platforms for the
institutionalization of programmes at government level
- recognition of the importance of the partnership with government and of positioning UNICEF as
a consensus builder in dialogue with government, development partners, expert communities
and CSOs.
These lessons informed the approach of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan in the promotion of the policy package on
early childhood education, and particularly the promotion of CDCs within existing municipal libraries.
The strategy used by UNICEF Kyrgyzstan included the modelling of the centres, but also advocacy
activities to promote the institutionalization of ECE at the level of the MoES and its integration into the
strategic documents of the education system.
As noted, this integrated approach is not yet visible in the plans for the development of home visiting
and the early identification of children with disabilities, but the CO team is aware of both the risks and
the lessons learned in the experience of scaling-up initiatives.
The impact assessment conducted for this report shows that it is essential to use the power of
evidence to drive change for children. This is, however, more likely to generate policy change
when implemented alongside other strategies, particularly the strategy of leveraging
partnerships for children, including the mobilization of UN agencies and international financial
institutions. This is one of the most important lessons learned in the promotion of both the revised
Child Code (eventually a success for UNICEF) and reforms for social protection. The development and
maintenance of partnerships with UN agencies, developmental partners and CSOs requires a strategic
approach, tailored for each advocacy target. Such approaches have been implemented successfully by
the UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CO in some of the areas analysed in this evaluation and could provide inspiration
for other areas and other countries.
The years 2020 and 2021 provided valuable lessons on the value of youth engagement in a young
society. Young volunteers were invaluable in saving lives during the COVID-19 crisis by directly
supporting medical teams in hospitals and bringing medical equipment and drugs to patients’ homes.
Young people have also been essential actors in the political events in Kyrgyzstan in 2020, eventually
determining the change of regime. UNICEF programmes for youth engagement and participation
generated interest from public authorities as well as young people, including the endorsement of the
President of the Kyrgyz Republic. All these developments demonstrated a strong demand from the
country’s youth to have a voice and a role in shaping the present and future of the country. To respond
to this demand and to valorise the momentum, UNICEF should support young people in building
their own platforms to express their views and engage in decision making at local and national
level.
126 The Ministry of Health asserted that Gulazyk was registered as a biologically active supplement and was not, therefore,
considered to be part of the essential medicines list. The Ministry also noted its concerns regarding the conclusions of recent
Cochrane reviews and WHO guidelines. This literature pointed to the low quality of existing research methodology on the
effectiveness of micronutrients, with an elevated risk of deviation for various target groups during pregnancy and for the
treatment of anaemia among mothers and children (a lesson learned, according to the UNICEF COAR 2018).
62
4.3. Recommendations
The recommendations apply to the overall strategy, thematic focus and balance of the
programme and are designed to complement the recommendations of the 2021 Situation
Analysis. The aim is to propose appropriate continuation and development based on the
partnerships, teamwork and results of the 2018–2022 Country Programme – considering the
challenges encountered. All recommendations are addressed to UNICEF CO in Kyrgyzstan and
have been discussed with the CO team in two meetings in October and November 2021. The
meetings also addressed the priority level of recommendations and details on implementation
strategies to be included in the management response.
High priority recommendation
Recommendation 1. Continue to strengthen evidence-based, innovative and diverse approaches
in Communication for Development and Behaviour Change (C4D and C4BC).
This recommendation considers and aims to address the harmful or negative social norms that hinder
the promotion of child rights in all communities and families. Its implementation should include capacity
building for partners to ensure a systematic approach that shifts away from stand-alone, donor-driven
campaigns; evidence generation and social listening to inform C4D and C4BC strategies, interventions
and messages; digital engagement, including the engagement of young people through social media and
gamification; social mobilization and community engagement to contribute to knowledge building, as
well as uptake of and demand for services; and changing harmful behaviours and social norms. Diverse
communication approaches need use of social psychology on social norms to design effective messages
and work in parallel with local community leaders to roll-out the messages in more traditional
communities – particularly in relation to work on violence against children, child marriage, and services
for children with disabilities. It is also essential to measure the impact of communication activities and
adapt campaigns in response to data about their reception to ensure the implementation of this
recommendation.
Recommendation 2. Develop clear advocacy strategies and sustainability/exit strategies for each
model/pilot project and gain support from development partners and other UN agencies to
enhance the impact of advocacy in promoting new policy measures.
The creation of local modelling and pilot projects remains an indispensable implementation strategy
and UNICEF needs to undertake all steps within its power to achieve results planned in projects of this
kind and ensure that they are used by government. Now, the evaluation shows that without clear
advocacy and exit strategies, the good results achieved at local level cannot generate impact for children
at scale. Evidence collected and lessons learned show conditions that need to be met from the moment
of planning local pilot and model projects. These conditions include:
- planning at scale, including realist scale-up strategies as the core of each project implemented
at local level
- considering budget limitations
- supporting the strengthening of institutional capacity at national level and governmental
implementation of plans to strengthen institutional capacity at local level
- planning the monitoring and evaluation of new measures institutionalized by the government
to support better linkages between service delivery and statistical information and, therefore,
to support evidence-based decision making.
Recommendation 3. The leveraging of partnerships should be continued and extended,
especially in the areas of child protection and social protection, where it should include social
cash benefits, as well as the development of social services and social work. This recommendation
aims to support access for the most vulnerable children to other key services (child protection, health,
education, justice), considering that social work should be at the centre of a reformed social protection
system more broadly. The progress made is not impressive but is contrasting with the stagnation of the
social protection policy in the last years.
Experience in the field of social protection shows that alliances with development partners are
instrumental for UNICEF impact. Social protection is often viewed as being based on cash transfers and
as placing a strain on the national budget, and the limited impact in this area over time in this area could
63
be the result of a lack of agreement between UNICEF and international financial institutions (namely the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank). However, UNICEF’s partnership with the World Bank
on the improvement of Kyrgyzstan’s social protection system during the COVID-19 pandemic generated
rapid results.
A comprehensive evaluation of the existing social protection system is needed to implement this
recommendation. A useful first step would be to establish the needs for reform from the perspective of
the role of social work and social services. There is also a need to better professionalize and expand the
social worker cadre and develop an upgraded competency framework to align with global practice and
national standards on emerging child needs. It is also essential to improve the public image and valorise
social work for progress in this area.
Recommendation 4. Support the strengthening of cross-sectoral cooperation across different
government institutions in areas where this is essential for the realization of child rights,
including early childhood education, adolescent empowerment and engagement, addressing
violence against children, services for children with disabilities, and action to mitigate the
adverse effects of climate change on children.
In the field of early childhood education and development, for example, more achievements have been
made on aspects of education, while less success is observable in the areas of early childhood
development that require cross-sectoral cooperation, such as home visiting and the early identification
of and services for children with disabilities and developmental delays. In this context, it is
recommended that UNICEF use the lessons learned and good practices from the development of early
childhood education for the promotion of other components of the early childhood development policy.
The planning of cross-sectoral approaches at national level contributes to cross-sectoral practice at local
level, but the need to develop cross-sectoral practices at local level should also be considered. Although
cooperation at local level can be easier, as it can build on personal connections, cooperation tools are
needed to ensure cooperation irrespective of these connections to ensure a clear division of
responsibilities, as well as the acceptance of any responsibilities that are shared.
Low priority recommendation
Recommendation 5. Continue and extend support for the participation of children and
adolescents in decision making in relation to public institutions at national and local level.
The success of activities that support the participation of adolescents and young people in local-level
decision making can influence public support for policy change and determine momentum for reforms
for children.
To implement this recommendation UNICEF should continue its support for the Youth and Child
Friendly Local Government (YCFLG) approach and advocate to government and development
partners/donors for consistent support for youth organizations and youth consultative bodies. In other
words, UNICEF should continue to support different avenues for the participation of adolescents and
young people in the decisions that affect their lives. Special attention should be given to the participation
of children and adolescents in schools as an avenue to strengthen the transferable skills they need for
their future by practising participation in school-based platforms. Schools are great starting points
because they reach most children, and the organization of participatory bodies and consultations within
schools will offer this experience to many children.
Recommendation 6. Develop a strategic approach for partnership and cooperation with
development partners, other UN agencies and CSOs. This should extend the scope of this
partnership and cooperation to enhance the impact of advocacy and enlarge the circle of
partners beyond traditional partners when conducting advocacy at national and local level.
Partnerships proved instrumental in ensuring the success of the other strategies employed. Indeed, the
lessons learned from previous challenges show that partnerships can make or break UNICEF impact on
policies for children. UNICEF can benefit even more from good cooperation with different partners if
partnership is included as a strategic element in the new CPD.
64
A stakeholder analysis at outcome (or even output level) for all outcomes/outputs during planning for
the future CPD needs to identify the most influential potential partners. The establishment of
partnerships in the initial phases of advocacy processes is key for the timely success of these activities.
Specific advocacy activities should be planned with like-minded partners following a strategic approach
to the partnership itself.
In the case of output areas where a lack of partners or organizational opposition have been identified as
hindering factors, special attention should be paid to building partnerships and finding common ground
with organizations that share human-rights values. The aim is to find a compromise that allows the
promotion of at least part of UNICEF’s agenda.
Recommendation 7. Introduce new internal monitoring tools to trace more clearly the change
pathways from UNICEF activities to results for children.
Documenting the path from research (via its conclusions and recommendations) through to government
policy decisions, the implementation of actions at national and local level, and the assessment of the
results for children will inform future evaluations and support better learning from experience. A better
understanding of how policy change happens could be supported by improving the registration of
institutional memory and the tracking of advocacy activities (events, meetings with decision and policy
makers and partners, and the implementation of communication campaigns) in connection with policy
decisions, declarations on policies or institutional changes. In addition, a consistent approach is needed
to monitor the impact of trainings and other capacity building activities (mentorship, couching), using
pre and post testing and making the connections between these activities and observable institutional
changes.

5. Annexes
Annex 1. Summary analysis of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan effectiveness and impact
The table below is based on the reports of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan CO.127
Output indicators are registered according to the 2020 Country Office Annual Report – the latest available report, although there are changes of output indicators operated
in March 2021. However, for newly formulated or introduced indicators there are no data and thy are not appropriate for impact evaluation.
Outputs related to COVID-19 response are not included in the table, because all indicators in the monitoring framework are reflecting effectiveness, not impact – therefore
are not under the scope of the evaluation. UNICEF Kyrgyzstan response to COVID-19 pandemic is analyse primarily under relevance.
Note on the assessment of UNICEF impact based on the outcome and output indicators in the Country Programme Document:
Although most indicators analysed are – according to UNICEF denomination – output indicators, they are not only measuring direct results of each activity conducted by UNICEF. They
also potentially show short term changes with direct relevance for children at scale, either referring to the situation of children, changes in public perception, attitude or behaviour or
systemic changes that enable institutions to fulfil better their role in providing services for children and protecting their rights.
Indicators in the table are marked on their relevance for the assessment of effectiveness or impact. And when impact can be measured, the type of impact is identified as: (1) better access
to services/direct improvement of the situation of children, (2) behavioural and attitudes change; (3) institutional change (including institutional capacity raised); (4) change in policy
(including strategies, plans, laws, legislation of other nature/level); (5) improvement of financing for children
Strategies identified in the table are a simplified presentation of UNICEF Strategies as in the schema below.

Annex 2. Case Studies on UNICEF impact and contribution
Methodology for Process Tracing
Process Tracing is a theory-based evaluation method. It questions why and how change happens by
tracking evidence of each link in the causal chain. Therefore, it is suitable for the evaluation of
effectiveness and impact and, partially, the relevance as part of causal chain in the Theory of Change.
This method as a qualitative approach through ex-post design where there is no control group available. It is
distinguishable from other more commonly used approaches of evaluation because it focuses on increasing
our level of confidence in a causal story rather than trying to measure impact and attribute it to a particular
event. It rests on the belief that all processes, if correctly identified and specified, would show empirical
manifestations that if observed would increase our confidence on its existence.
The method includes assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and
evidence of how and why an effect occurred.
Assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and evidence can be subjective,
within the limit of the existing evidence. On the other hand, the entire Process Tracing analysis is transparent:
the evidence determining the probabilities assigned are presented to all readers of the report and this allows
stakeholders to understand the impact and contribution of UNICEF beyond the numbers related to the
evaluators own (subjective) assessment.
The impact case studies about UNICEF contribution on three selected areas – (a) adolescents and youth
participation and health; (b) inclusive education; (c) justice for children – are based on Process Tracing.
The reports sections dedicated to the impact case studies is structure according to the steps that a PT
evaluation needs to follow, explaining briefly in each sub-section what the evaluation team did,
following the six steps of Bayesian Updating in Evaluation set out by Befani (2019): 1) formulating a
contribution claim; 2) establish a prior level of confidence in it; 3) focus on one specific piece of evidence
at a time; 4) estimate the sensitivity of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the
question: If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?); 5) estimate the type I error
of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the question: If the claim is false, how
likely would we expect to see the evidence?); 6) Update of the prior into the posterior using the Bayes
formula.
The contribution claims have been formulated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and updated
based on the feedback from UNICEF Kyrgyzstan Country Office (CO), before data collection through
interviews. The prior level of confidence is established conventionally at 0.5.
The evidence used was collected from documents provided by UNICEF and the implementation partners
for each of the three selected areas mentioned above and from interviews. Prior to the interviews, the
evaluation team sent a list of the types of documents required to UNICEF CO and received the most
important documents. Interviews have been also used to collect evidence and documents. Interviews
are not considered independent evidence because the people interviewed know each other and have
been working together, sometimes for several years. This would make them more likely to have a
common discourse about the analysed subject. Even though complete independence is not assumed, the
interviews of public authorities and civil society organisations about UNICEF’s contribution, its relative
importance compared to other stakeholders, its reputation and their trust in the organization are
considered important evidence when documents are missing, also considering that evidence on
reputation and trust are traditionally based on stakeholders contributions to the evaluation.
More iterations between the data collection and the analysis of the evidence can increase the possibility
of obtaining more supporting evidence and minimize issues arising from absence of evidence. However,
in practice, this process may increase the time and cost of the evaluation. For this evaluation, only one
iteration of data collection and analysis was possible, due to time constraints.
Assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan’s contribution to early childhood development and
education
For the assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribution in early childhood development (ECD) and
education (ECE), Process Tracing was used, to determine the extent of UNICEF contribution and the
80
results of the contributing in a clear way. Using Process Tracing, each claim was analysed and, based on
the available evidence, the level of confidence that the claim is true was assessed.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain:
(1) UNICEF provided guidelines and methodologies for community-based kindergartens and Child
Development Centres (CDCs) within existing municipal libraries, (2) started testing early
identification of CwD and the development of trans-sectoral intervention methodology, including
the parenting package and (3) provided remote preschool lessons and the preparation for Safe
Reopening of Kindergartens. Overall, (4) these contributions have been well received by the
Government of Kyrgyzstan, endorsing the piloting of methodologies for better support early
childhood development.
(5) UNICEF also supported the revision of the ECD/ECE standards, (6) provided technical
assistance for Early Childhood Education (ECE) financing and (7) developed technical officials’
capacity to mainstream early childhood education into education sector plans and budgets, to
improve financing and institutionalization of quality early childhood education resulting in the

(8) UNICEF supported the development of standards for home visiting and, (9) together with other
interventions, this contribution to a better understand the importance of the policy on home
visiting and other ECD policies among decision makers.
As a result of all UNICEF efforts, (10) access to Early Childhood Education (ECE) remains a priority
to reach the Government's target of 80% coverage by 2022, leading to (11) the improved coverage
of ECD/ECE services in 2021 compared to 2014. (12) More attention to ECD also resulted in the
steady decline in the infant mortality rate and child mortality rate under 5 years old.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF provided guidelines and methodologies for inclusive early childhood development and
education in community-based kindergartens and Child Development Centres (CDCs) within existing municipal
libraries
a) Evidence
Interviews and documents128 underline that the community-based kindergartens have been introduced in
the last decade in Kyrgyzstan with support from several development partners and SitAn 2021 underlines
that they are proving successful at improving school-readiness, targeting especially children aged 3-7 years.
In 2018, UNICEF reported providing a new curriculum aimed at promoting positive gender socialization,
appreciation of diversity, and the development of peaceful and tolerant behaviour among children and
parents to 62 target community-based kindergartens. “A total of 120 teachers had received training and
learning materials to nurture attitudes and perceptions among 2,000 children free of negative and
restrictive gender stereotypes” and among 1,200 parents in 2018.129 The benefits extended to about 6,000
children in 2019.130 The novel approach has been also documented using experimental research design
(report not identified/to be requested).
On the other hand, the promotion of Child Development Centres (CDCs) started more recently, based on a
2018 report on their relevance and recommended pathways for development131. According to UNICEF
reports and the interviews with UNICEF staff, the CO advocated for legal reform to enhance, extend and
improve the nation’s early childhood development / early childhood education (ECD/ECE) system. Within
this approach, CDCs have been piloted in eight libraries and at kindergartens across the country in 2018, in
65 libraries in 2019 and 2020, reaching to more than 100 in 2021. By leveraging pre-existing infrastructure
and professionals, the CDCs have been designed with the intention “to act as a cost-effective mechanism to
extend government-guaranteed ECD/ECE services, both in terms of geographic accessibility and ensuring
that the youngest age groups are reached.”
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.85. There is convincing evidence that UNICEF guidelines and methodologies for inclusive
early childhood education in community-based kindergartens and Child Development Centres (CDCs)
within existing municipal libraries in selected communities for piloting. However, there is no evidence that
methodologies and guidelines have been developed considering all bottlenecks of the system and risks,
including the need to extensively train existent staff and to recruit new staff.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.2. Although there is no evidence that will contradict the claim, all available
evidence is based on UNICEF reports and interviews with UNICEF staff and stakeholders recommended by
UNICEF. There are no good reasons to suppose UNICEF is falsely presenting facts about the number of
teachers trained or CDCs organised, but there is no direct evidence available about the implementation of
the guidelines and methodologies at local level that could indicate they are feasible. In the theory of change,
for the theory to be strong, identified support from UNICEF to the government needs to be usable and used
effectively by the ECD/ECE system, otherwise the claim is considered (parlay) false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.85) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.8000) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF providing guidelines and

Claim 2: UNICEF started testing early identification of CwD and the development of trans-sectoral intervention
methodology, including the parenting package
a) Evidence
UNICEF reported in 2019 the continuation of testing innovative approaches to early identification and
intervention of disability. Concretely, 25 national members of transdisciplinary teams have been trained on
developing individual family support plans and the intervention was implemented in 10 kindergartens and
10 pre-primary classes during the 2019/20 academic year, for the benefit of over 1,000 children.
The trans-sectoral intervention methodology for early identification of CwD and provision of services for
children aged 0-8 years was developed in 2017 and tested in 2018-2019 and documented. The documenting
report concluded that the piloted approach is successful in addressing the needs of children with
disabilities, but rising awareness among parents is a key element of the effectiveness of the
transdisciplinary approach for child development. The report also emphasises the need for: training,
network support, motivation (including wages) and other capacity building for transdisciplinary teams,
strong and clear coordination mechanisms, group work with specialists and children.132
According to interviews with UNICEF staff, the positive parenting package was ready for testing when data
was collected for this evaluation.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.95. There is high confidence that the existing evidence appears in the case the claim is true.
An independent evaluation of the intervention would be able to increase the confidence level on sensitivity
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.3. The contribution of UNICEF is not very well underlined by the evidence, except
for its role as a supporting partner for the implementing partner – the Public Associations of Parents of
Children with Autism "Hand-in-Hand".
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.76) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF testing early identification
of CwD and the development of trans-sectoral intervention methodology, including the parenting
package”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and trail

evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7600
Claim 3: UNICEF provided remote preschool lessons and the preparation for Safe Reopening of Kindergartens
a) Evidence
Interviews and documents show that UNICEF helped develop remote learning lessons for both preschool
and school students, producing a total of 2,637 video lessons (988 for preschool and 1,649 for schools
students) and supporting financially the production process. UNICEF estimates that 274,902 preschool-age
children, including children with disabilities, benefited from remote lessons for preschool children, online
and broadcasted by the national TV station, during COVID-19.
According to interviews, UNICEF lead the advocacy conducted by the Development Partners Coordination
Council (DPCC) to convince the government to include lessons for preschool education in the package of
remote lessons.
Moreover, guidance for the Safe Reopening of Kindergartens were developed and 5,686 printed guidelines
have been delivered to 1,004 preschool educational institutions. In total, 9,500 preschool teachers were
trained on the safe reopening of kindergartens.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.85. Existing video lessons and guidance, as well as records of the training provided to teachers
are the expected evidence for this claim. The confidence level could be increased by data related to the
satisfaction of participants to training, to ensure that the support was effective.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.2. There is no evidence to link UNICEF recommendations, guidance and training
with actual practice in kindergartens. Therefore, although there is no reason to think that UNICEF did not
provided support for the Ministry, there is no straightforward evidence that UNICEF support was effectively
used in the preparation of kindergartens reopening. In the theory of change, for the theory to be strong,
identified support from UNICEF to the government needs to be usable and used effectively by the ECD/ECE
system, otherwise the claim is considered (parlay) false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.85) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.800) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF provided remote preschool
lessons and the preparation for Safe Reopening of Kindergartens,” being true given the evidence.
Claim 3 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.85
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.2
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.800
Claim 4: The Government of Kyrgyzstan endorsed the pilot activities and methodologies for better support to
early childhood development
a) Evidence
Piloting CDCs have been supported by the Government and an Order on how libraries can open the centres
have been issued in 2018 and financial support has been ensured by the Ministry of Culture – the
responsible authority for libraries. The Law on Preschool Education, defines development centres as
85
providers of “physical and mental development, early detection of the child’s individual developmental needs,
diagnostics and the provision of special education and related services, as well as the improvement of the health
of children who attend other educational institutions or who are being brought up at home.” 133
Moreover, the institutionalization of early education within the Ministry of Education – that organised a
separate department for early education: the Preschool Department – is an important indicator of the
governmental endorsement for ECE.
On the other hand, although piloted in 2018-2019, the transdisciplinary approach for early identification of
CwD and for effective services provision was not effectively institutionalized by the government, both due
to difficulties to reorganize services in 2020, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, but also to the structural
bottlenecks that have been identified during the piloting phase. Moreover, the interview with the UNICEF
specialist on communication for development shows that there is less commitment from the government
on the roadmap for communication and initiating change of the social norms in this respect. This may
explain the lack of endorsement for the transdisciplinary approach for ECD targeting especially CwD.
The remote lessons for preschool children used online are broadcasted by the national TV station, as well
as the guidelines distributed by official government channels for Safe Reopening of Kindergartens are
themselves the evidence of the government assuming ownership over the materials prepared to support
the early childhood education system to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.55. Although the institutionalization of early education within the Ministry of Education – that
organised a separate department for early education: the Preschool Department – is an important indicator
of the governmental endorsement for ECE, and there is good evidence on how the government took into
account UNICEF recommendations and used the input of UNICEF in 2020 on its response the COVID-19
crisis, there is not enough evidence to support that overall the idea that the Government of Kyrgyzstan
endorsed the pilot activities and methodologies for better support to early childhood development.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.4. It is possible that, apart from the recommendations considered in 2020, the
Ministry of Education and Science only used the name UNICEF proposed for initiative, but endorses other
types of ECD/ECE implementation. The legal definition for CDCs is not clear enough to allow the evaluators
to assess that the provision is institutionalising UNICEF proposal.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.55) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
only allow us to be more confident than not (0.5789) about the probability of the hypothesis of “the
Government of Kyrgyzstan endorsing the pilot activities and methodologies for better support to early
childhood development”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail

Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.55
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.4
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.5789
Claim 5: UNICEF supported the revision of the ECD/ECE standards
a) Evidence
133 Law on Preschool Education, Article. 7(1), ¶ 8.
86
In June 2020 National Early Childhood Development Standards were approved by the Prime Minister. The
standards have been updated in line with social cohesion, gender and early intervention approaches and
include Early Learning Development Standards (0-3). The standards are effectively disaggregated by month
for each of the child’s first 12 months; and then for two years; three to four years; five years; and six to seven
years. They have been introduced to local education departments through an online conference134 and
UNICEF reports supporting the government in the elaboration of the standards.
However, it is still unclear how the standards are and will be used in practice, as there is no evidence on a
monitoring system for the development of individual children.135
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.65. Additional evidence on the concrete contribution of UNICEF to the standards and
acknowledgement of the contribution from the Ministry would be needed to increase the confidence level.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.5. Except for sources from UNICEF, there is unclear which was UNICEF
contribution and there is also unclear how the standards will function, based on the findings of SitAn 2021.
In the theory of change, for the theory to be strong, identified support from UNICEF to the government needs
to be usable and used effectively by the ECD/ECE system, otherwise the claim is considered (parlay) false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.65) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.5), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
only allow us to be more confident than not (0.5652) about the probability of the hypothesis of
“UNICEF supporting the revision of the ECD/ECE standards”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 5 Evidence – Account and trail

Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.5
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.5652
Claim 6: UNICEF provided technical assistance for Early Childhood Education (ECE) financing
a) Evidence
Kyrgyzstan is one of the four countries selected for implementing the global Better Early Learning and
Development at Scale Initiative (BELDS). In the BELDS framework, UNICEF developed technical officials’
capacity to mainstream early childhood education into education sector plans and budgets, and to improve
financing and institutionalization of quality early childhood education.
Workshops on the efficient fiscal management of ECE in the Kyrgyz Republic have been organised in 2019.
According to BELDS Documenting report, 47 trainees participated in the questionnaire on the evaluation of
the training's effectiveness showing that 100% of the participants claimed that their expectations from the
training were fulfilled, 96.8% of the participants noted the importance of the training to enhance the skills
of specialists of financial and economic departments of ministries, agencies and their regional
representatives, directors of PSEOs, specialists of Local self-government bodies.
Moreover, an information video has been developed to summarize Kyrgyzstan’s BELDS experience with
strengthening ECE in the Education Development Strategy and Action Plan, as well as highlight the ECE

135 SitAn 2021.
87
financing challenges and recommendations to address them (based on the results of the ECE financing
workshops that took place in November and December 2019).
In 2020, UNICEF prepared a budget brief for the ECD/ECE subsector and presented it to national
stakeholders through capacity building workshops. The event: "From strategic goals to budgetary
commitments" was held at the Conference Hall of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Kyrgyz
Republic on December 8, 2020 with the participation of specialists from the Department of Budget Policy
and Financial Analysis, Ministry of Education and Science of the KR, staff of the Department of Preschool
Education of the Ministry of Education and Science of the KR, staff of the Department of Financial and
Economic Activity of the Department of Education of the Mayor's Office of Bishkek, staff of the district
education centres of Bishkek, specialists from the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic.136
A publication on ECE funding was public in April 2021 and serves as a strong advocacy supporting
document for the continuation of the work in the area.
As a result of the workshop a larger capacity building programme has been initiated. A training of trainers
has been delivered to 84 persons that are expected to train 700 local staff members for better budgeting.
Interviews show that the representatives of the Ministry of Education appreciate UNICEF support
concerning early ECE funding as exceptionally good, needed and with great chances to generate a significant
impact in the field.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.9. Additional expected evidence, on the effectiveness of the technical assistance provided is
not available.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.25. Although we can be certain about the assistance provided, based on the
existing evidence is not clear that the Ministry and local level staff is following assistance from UNICEF,
although it was very well appreciated. In the theory of change, for the theory to be strong, identified support
from UNICEF to the government needs to be usable and used effectively by the ECD/ECE system, otherwise the
claim is considered (parlay) false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.2), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF providing technical
assistance for Early Childhood Education (ECE) financing,” being true given the evidence.

Claim 7: UNICEF contributed to the development of technical officials’ capacity to mainstream early childhood
education into education sector plans and budgets, and to improve financing and institutionalization of quality
early childhood education
a) Evidence
From March 2019 to December 2020, “financial and consultancy support was provided to the Ministry of
Education and Science (MoES) to integrate pre-school education into the national Education Sector Plan,
136 BELDS documenting report.
88
analysing key priorities and challenges such as access, equity, quality and governance. Through the BELDS’s
initiative project served to build capacity of key partners, national stakeholders and care givers to plan and
budget for inclusive and quality ECE at scale.”137
The Education Development Strategy and Action Plan have been finalized (based on the recommendations
of the independent appraisal) after an intensive iterative process with multiple rounds of review and
revisions. The Education Development Strategy (2021-2040) was structured by subsectors, including the
ECE subsector. ECE therefore has a distinct section dedicated to it, which outlines the vision for preschool
education in Kyrgyz Republic in terms of expanding and ensuring equitable access while improving
quality.138
UNICEF contribution to planning and drafting the strategic documents is underlined by UNICEF in reports
and interviews and it is acknowledged by the representatives of the Ministry of Education. UNICEF provided
the education sector analysis that supported the strategy development.139 Moreover, both UNICEF and
Ministry representatives underlined in interviews that advocacy for mainstreaming ECE into the education
sector strategic planning was enable by UNICEF participation to the Development Partners Coordination
Council (DPCC) as co-chair with a specific focus on education. In this capacity UNICEF organised several
meetings and lead the discussions on several stages of the strategic planning process and focusing on
different drafts of the strategic documents.
The World Bank (WB) was also an important stakeholder in the strategic process. The BELDS documenting
report states that the WB effectively led the development process and hired an international consultant, but
UNICEF and GPE also played important roles in the process.
However, concerning progress in the mainstream of ECE into education sector plans, there is mix evidence.
By one hand it is important to underline the creation of the Preschool Department within the Ministry of
Education, as an institutional structure strengthening the government commitment for ECE. On the other
hand, pre-school education was defined as a priority area in the Education Development Strategy for 2012-
2020 as well.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.65. The likelihood of the evidence, if the claim is true, is affected by the limited evidence about
a meaningful change in attitude about ECD/ECE at the level of the government. Moreover, there is no
evidence that financing of ECD will be improved.
Concerning UNICEF contribution to strategic planning, although accounts of the meetings (minutes) –
organised by UNICEF with the participation of the Ministry and DPCC members – have not been provided
for the evaluation, all interviewed stakeholders acknowledged the importance of these meetings.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.4. Evidence do not allow for high confidence that UNICEF involvement in the
elaboration of strategic documents for ECD/ECE made a significant difference in the improvement of
provisions and a better approach of the government. An alternative interpretation of the evidence is that
UNICEF organised important discussions and was present to debates but did not provide the needed advice
for the strategic planning.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.65) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to cautiously confident (0.6190) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF contributing
to the development of technical officials’ capacity to mainstream early childhood education into

Claim 8: UNICEF supported the development of standards for home visiting
a) Evidence
An analytical review of the home visiting system in Kyrgyzstan has been published by UNICEF in 2016. The
review identified several bottlenecks in the how home-visiting is planned and implemented, in relation with
the health system.140 On the other hand, the initial approach of home visiting was health sector specific,
without attention to the possibility to develop an inter-sectoral approach.
As part of the project “Strengthening Maternal and Child Healthcare Systems” for 2018-2021, funded by the
Government of Japan, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic and optimized the
home visiting practice for new-borns and their mothers and modelled postnatal home visiting services in
Suzak and Nookat Family Medicine Centres.
The pilot home visiting practice also encourages doctors and nurses to provide psychosocial support and
make sure that new-borns grow up in a safe and healthy environment. The result of the project, according
to UNICEF report, home visiting service was updated to include: (a) introduction of task shifting mechanism
from family doctor to family nurse; (b) identification of a child at risk of developmental delay, abuse and
neglect; (c) initiation of a family-oriented approach to address not only medical but also development and
social needs.141
Within the pilot project for the intervention methodology for early identification of CwD and provision of
services for children aged 0-8 years, the implementing partner noted that guidelines for home visits for
home visiting professionals were developed in 2018, but the inclusion of a module on monitoring children
with disabilities in the context of home visits was required. Moreover, training for healthcare professionals
was provided for integrating early identification and monitoring of disability in the home visiting
practice.142
In 2020 UNICEF also reported that technical assistance was also provided to maintain home visiting
services for new-borns through remote communication using smartphone-based technologies.143
However, progress in reforming home visiting is reported as slow by stakeholders interviewed and UNICEF
still needs to continue to support the Ministry of Health to scale up this intervention across the country,
based on the success of the pilot programme.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.65. Although the evidence is necessary, it is not enough for the claim. The evidence on actual
improvement of home visiting standards is missing and this is linked to the fact that UNICEF the
intervention is reported to be still in piloting phase.

c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.5. Because UNICEF the intervention is reported to be still in piloting phase, there
can be no taking over from UNICEF model into the national policy.

Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.65) and the probability of seeing

“UNICEF supporting the development of standards for home visiting”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 9: UNICEF contributed to better understand the importance of the policy on home visiting and other ECD
policies among decision makers
a) Evidence
In 2018 and 2019, UNICEF supported the piloting of postnatal home visiting services for new-borns at two
family medicine centres in accordance with updated guidelines that include identification of children at risk
of developmental delay, abuse and neglect, and referral to transdisciplinary services. This work and
successful advocacy has resulted in the inclusion of a home visiting indicator into the criteria for bonus
payments to family doctors from the Mandatory Health Insurance Fund. Moreover, the government
understanding and support for CED is underlined by interviewed stakeholders with examples of initiatives
recommended by development partners and taken onboard, as in the case of the booklets for parents,
distributed by the government.
Evidence on government developing ownership and making progresses in the field on ECE have been
presented above. However, educational and developmental opportunities for children aged 0 to 3 are
limited, as the institutional network (excepting pilot CDCs) is covering children over 3 years old and the
Law on Preschool Education has only provisions starting with 6 months144. The general understanding in
the policy framework seems to be that ECD for 0-6 months is limited to healthcare.
The Law on Preschool Education defines the preschool age as 0 to 7 years, the legislative framework for
preschool education stipulates only that preschool educational organizations are to cover children from
ages 6 months to 7 years, leaving out the vital period from 0 to 6 months.
Evidence, including the interviews with UNICEF staff, also show limited integration of the education,
healthcare, child and social protection sectors when planning piloting and advocacy for home visiting and
ECD in general, including within UNICEF office.145
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.55. Although, there are some progresses reported, evidence shows that ECD is not a policy
sector and remains scattered between sectors, with little progress at policy/government level in ensuring
coordination and trans-disciplinary work. There is no evidence that ECD/ECE standards developed and

145 Although underlying the cross- and inter-sectorial character of ECD, members of UNICEF staff interviewed repeatedly referred
the evaluators to other persons and recommended interviewing other persons within the CO to develop a full picture of the ECD
work of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan. Although specialization is needed, the fact that the various interventions and pilot projects in the
field of EDC are not closely coordinated is indicated by the interviews, even though this coordination is understood and
emphasized by UNICEF staff.

Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.55) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.45), the account evidence of the documents and

hypothesis of “UNICEF contributing to better understand the importance of the policy on home visiting
and other ECD policies among decision makers”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 10: Access to Early Childhood Education (ECE) remains a priority to reach the Government's target of
80% coverage by 2022
a) Evidence
The new Education Sector Strategy 2021-2040 adopted by the Government in May 2020 puts forward a
target of reaching at least 80% of all children (aged 3-6) enrolled in ECE organizations and programmes. It
seeks to leverage state- and local-level resources as well as public-private partnerships to expand services.
Quality of ECE will be enhanced with the strengthening of quality standards, data systems, innovative
educational materials as well as preschool workforce development.
The education sector analysis147 shows there are diffident types of pre-school educational services,
including new forms of early care already introduced to expand access to pre-school - Community Based
Kindergartens (CBK), Child Development Centres (CDC) and the Nariste 480-hour school-readiness
programme. All these programmes are supported by the new strategy, as each proved to be effective, based
on separate evaluations for their pilots or implementation.
Other progresses in the field of ECE show the constant commitment of the Government (despite political
instability) for the sector: “as additional measures to reduce the urban-rural gap in preschool education
coverage, in 2017-2018 over 100 preschools were repaired, 40 preschools were opened thanks to the
optimization of the network of schools and classes, and 471 community-based preschools were opened in
2013-2019. As a result, preschool education coverage in the country regions increased from 7.4 percent in
2012 to 19.5 percent in 2019. In addition, the requirements for sanitary and epidemiological standards and
regulations, as well as the fire safety rules for the licensing were eased to encourage the growth of private
nursery schools throughout the country. Also, the Tax Code has been amended to exempt private preschool
education institutions from income tax. Thanks to these measures, the number of private preschool
institutions increased from 58 to 171 as compared to 2012-2013.”148
The content of the strategy and the interviews support the claim that ECE remains a priority for the
government. Interviews with representatives of the ministry also show that the process of strategic
planning, including decision makers, technical policy makers within the Ministry and development partners

allowed the government to develop ownership (to a certain extent) over the targets recommended by the
development partners and consultants employed to provide technical assistance for the strategy.

Sensitivity– 0.8. Existent strategic priorities are not enough to convince the commitment of the government.

Kyrgyz Government,” being true given the evidence.

Claim 11: Continuous prioritization of ECE ensured improved coverage of ECD/ECE services in 2021 compared
to 2014
a) Evidence
After the decline of the ECE sector in the first post-Soviet decade, pre-school education was defined as a
priority area in the Education Development Strategy for 2012-2020. Statistics show that the strategic
commitment was followed by actual implementation and results, as Kyrgyzstan has made steady progress
in providing access to pre-primary education in the last decade.
According to SitAn 2021, the number of ECE institutions in Kyrgyzstan, particularly nurseries and
kindergartens, has increased consistently with the increasing number of children aged 0-7 but access to
pre-school education is still limited and far from universal. Overall, in 2019 the percentage of the children
enrolled in preschool education increased to 40% of children across the country, including 26% of children
attending full-day preschools (197,000 children were covered by such nursery schools in 2019, which is 1.8
times more than in 2012, when 132,000 children attended standardized PPEIs). Coverage of children aged
0-3 with early development programs remains low at 4%.149. Access to pre-school institutions is twice as
high in urban compared to rural areas but this increased urban coverage is due to increases in the number
of children in existing kindergartens. This has reached an average of 230 children per kindergarten in urban
areas while in rural areas the average number of children per institution is 93. This inevitably impacts on
the quality of the service provided.
Most ECD coverage in Kyrgyzstan is for the age group 3-6 years, which is used in official statistics to
calculate coverage rates. For this age group the gross enrolment ratio (GER)150 has almost doubled in recent
years rising from 12.5% in 2006 to 25.2% in 2016, as has the net enrolment ratio (NER)151 - from 13% in
2007 to 26% in 2016. However, this means that three out of four children aged 3-6 years (75%) still do

not have access to early childhood education.
According to MICS 2018152, attendance at early education programmes is higher among children from urban
areas and among families with higher levels of well-being. The levels of early childhood development are
higher among children from urban areas (76%) and families with higher level of well-being (78%).
Furthermore, most children with disabilities do not go to preschool. Those who attend do not always receive
appropriate attention from pre-school teachers, who lack the skills necessary to provide inclusive
education.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.9. The sensitivity is diminished by the lack of data for the year 2020-2021 and the impact of
COVID-19.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.25. Although the trend cannot be denied, the limited coverage for the most
vulnerable children and the impact of COVID-19 could reverse the trend for 2020/2021 and 2021/2022.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.25), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of “continuous
prioritization of ECE generating improved coverage of ECD/ECE services in 2021 compared to 2014”,
being true given the evidence.

Claim 12: More attention to ECD also resulted in the steady decline in the infant mortality rate and child
mortality rate under 5 years old.
a) Evidence
Kyrgyzstan has made progress in decreasing child mortality by half, from 2006 to 2018, (from 38 to 19
deaths per 1,000 live births and reducing the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) from 19 to 13 deaths per 1,000
live births from 2006-2018.153 However, despite this progress neonatal mortality rates remain twice as high
as the CEE/CIS region average mortality rate.154 However, large regional disparities are still registered.155
In 2018, the top causes of under-five mortality (which contribute to half or more under-five deaths per
region) were primarily: neonatal causes; injuries; pneumonia; diarrhoea; and other causes of mortality
(2015).156 Data from UNICEF studies show no direct correlation of wealth status and under five mortality
rate. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between gender and the under-five mortalities rates, but a
strong correlation between urban/rural residency and the child mortality. This leads to the conclusion that
quick access to basic services can be a factor limiting the child mortality rate.
However, considering that only 4% of children under 3 years old are benefiting from ECD dedicated services
and the limited development of home visiting services (see above analysis under claim 9), the decline of the

infant and child mortality rate is related with improvements of the healthcare services for mothers and
new-borns.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity– 0.6. The evidence shows that improved access and quality to health services is effective. There
is no evidence of Governmental commitment to develop cross-sectorial early childhood services as a
strategy to maintain and accelerate the trend of declining infant and child mortality rates.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.5. The evidence can show commitment to improvement of in the health sector,
not necessarily in the cross-sectoral sector of ECD.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.65) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.5), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
only allow us to be more confident than not (0.5652) about the probability of the hypothesis of
“increased attention to ECD resulting in the steady decline in the infant mortality rate and child
mortality rate under 5 years old”, being true given the evidence.

Conclusion
According to Process Tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest link”
(or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 9 (UNICEF contributed to a better
understand the importance of the policy on home visiting and other ECD policies among decision makers) with
a posterior of 0,5500. This means that we can only be more confident than not that UNICEF contributed
in a substantial manner to the development of the Kyrgyz policy on early childhood development
and education, in line with the change chain presented above and with the theory of change of the area.
The analysis allows us to be confident about UNICEF input regarding:
- guidelines and methodologies inclusive early childhood development and education in community-
based kindergartens and Child Development Centres (CDCs) within existing municipal libraries
- remote preschool lessons and the preparation for Safe Reopening of Kindergartens
- general recommendations generated by the modelling project of early identification of CwD and the
development of trans-sectoral intervention methodology, including the parenting package.
Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to be confident that access to Early Childhood Education (ECE)
remains a priority to reach the Government's target of 80% coverage by 2022, although existent strategic
priorities are not enough to be certain about the commitment of the government and additional
improvements of ECD/ECE funding are needed. Moreover, although coverage of ECD/ECE services
improved in 2019 compared to 2014, the limited coverage for the most vulnerable children and the impact
of COVID-19 could reverse the trend for 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 and there is no evidence of a
comprehensive plan to reach the most disadvantaged children: children form rural areas, children from
poor households and children with disabilities.

Evidence at the disposal of the evaluation team is not enough to assess with confidence that UNICEF
contributions have been well received by the Government of Kyrgyzstan and they generated directly
improved policies. We can be cautiously confident that public officials increased their capacity for financing
and budgeting planning regarding ECD/ECE, but this is not enough to be confident about the practical
improvement in financing that will ensure implementation of the governmental commitment concerning
the ECE attendance target at 80% in 2020.
The evidence on infant mortality rate and child mortality rate under 5 years old shows that improved access
and quality to health services for new-borns and young children. However, there is still no convincing
evidence of governmental commitment to develop cross-sectorial early childhood services as a strategy to
maintain and accelerate the trend of declining infant and child mortality rates. This is related to the fact that
ECD is not a policy sector and remains scattered between sectors, with little progress at policy/government
level in ensuring coordination and trans-disciplinary work. The institutionalisation of early education
within the Ministry of Education – that organised a separate department for early education: the Preschool
Department – is an important indicator of the governmental endorsement for ECE, but not an indicator of a
cross-sectoral policy approach, needed for ECD. There is also not enough evidence that ECD/ECE standards
96
developed and approved by the Government are well connected with the development of the home visiting
policy, as the SitAn 2021 underlines there is no mechanism for monitoring the standards.157.
Although existing evidence allow a cautiously optimistic assessment of ECD/ECE policy development and
UNICEF contribution to thesis progress at policy, the most important bottlenecks identified still need to be
considered in the future:
- lack of training and overall capacity of local staff in educational institutions, but also of local social
workers to address the needs of young children in a comprehensive/holistic way
- lack of motivation (including wages) and other capacity elements (communication and team-work
competences) for transdisciplinary teams that need to work together
- lack of strong and clear coordination mechanisms at government level and at local level
Moreover, COVID-19 impact on access to services and increased poverty generated by the pandemic affects
the development of ECD / ECE because it affects the available budgets for service developments and
increases a major risk factor associated with lack of access (poverty)
Methodology for Contribution Analysis
Contribution Analysis is a theory-based evaluation method. It analysis attempts to describe “plausible
association”: where a reasonable person, knowing what has occurred/is occurring in the programme
agrees that the programme contributed/is contributing to the outcomes. Therefore, it is suitable for the
evaluation of effectiveness and impact.
Although Contribution Analysis does not specify the criteria used for assessing what constitutes evidence
of the causal story, it does provide framework in which these valuative research decisions become
transparent, which is a principal element in this methodology to bring empirical support to the claims
contained in the causal story.
Contribution Analysis does not prove a contribution but provides evidence to reduce the uncertainty about
the contribution made. This means that the approach does not intrinsically provide mechanisms for the
quality assurance of evidence and rigor, but appropriate methods to assess evidence can be incorporated
into the Contribution Analysis process, and in this way, it can be closer to Process Tracing.
Six steps are taken to produce a credible contribution story:
1) Set out the attribution problem to be addressed
2) Develop a theory of change and risks to it
3) Gather the existing evidence on the theory of change
4) Assemble and assess the contribution story, or performance story, and challenges to it
5) Seek out additional evidence
6) Revise and, where the additional evidence permit, strengthen the contribution story
Using a generative perspective on causality to infer that a programme made an important contribution to
an expected result that has been observed, Contribution Analysis argues that a reasonable contribution
causal claim can be made if:
- There is a reasoned theory of change for the intervention: the key assumptions behind why the
intervention is expected to work make sense, are plausible, may be supported by evidence and/or
existing research, and are agreed upon by at least some of the key players.
- The activities of the intervention were implemented as set out in the theory of change.
- The theory of change—or key elements thereof— is supported by and confirmed by evidence on
observed results and underlying assumptions—the chain of expected results occurred. The theory
of change has not been disproved.
- Other influencing factors have been assessed and either shown not to have made a significant
contribution or their relative role in contributing to the desired result has been recognized.

Assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribution to adolescents and youth development,
empowerment and engagement
The assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribution to youth development, empowerment and engagement
is based on the theory of change (ToC) developed by the evaluation team in consultation with UNICEF CO
and following closely the planned ToC for Adolescents development and participation (ADAP). Short- and
medium-term changes have been added to the theory of change to reflect UNICEF’s activity targeting young
people health, education and protection, considering that no empowerment and engagement is really
achieved if the child/adolescent/young person is not safe and does not have a positive perspective about
her future due to poor health or education or due to lack of access to healthcare and education.
UNICEF work targeting young people is complex and covers different areas. Among the most important
activities158:
- Studies have been conducted by UNICEF (or with UNICEF support) especially around youth health
and well-being. This informed UNICEF actions resulting in regulations, clinical protocols, standards,
plans and tools developed or endorsed, such as on post-natal care and screening adolescents to
identify those using drugs;
- To encourage HIV prevention and care, UNICEF provided 100 adolescents living with HIV with
support through smartphone-based applications. This supported the development of a collection of
stories based on their real-life experience, adhered to ARVs, and given information on HIV
disclosure and healthy living;
- UNICEF and the Ministry of Education continued to implement multilingual and multicultural
education in 18 schools in Batken Oblast;
- Within the ADAP programme in border areas a special attention was paid in 2020 to youth mental
health and training was provided to duty bearers on this issue;
- UNICEF involved young volunteers in modelling model disaster risk reduction education in pilot
schools in all seven provinces and to support emergency drills in 109 schools;
- To empower girls and to support economic participation and employability among girls, UNICEF
implements STEM and STEM4Girls.
Evaluations and reviews of each of these interventions can inform about the impact for adolescent
and young people directly targeted in the pilot schools and communities and the theory of change
of each of these interventions is consistent and able to generate impact.
However, these activities are not able to generate a wider impact, at scale, for children, and have not yet
been scaled-up nationally. The existing statistics and analysis, including the Situation Analysis of
Youth and Adolescent Health and Well-being in the Kyrgyz Republic from 2019 and Situational
Analysis (SitAn) from 2021, do not allow for the identification of the long-term change envisaged by
the ToC. The SitAn 2021 underlines that: “Youth unemployment is also higher than the national average
and young men between 15 and 34 make up the largest group of labour migrants, so any reduction in
employment opportunities affects this population group disproportionately.”159 Moreover, a majority of
158 Based on UNICEF reports.
159 The labour force participation rate for Kyrgyz youth (aged 15 to 24 years) was 40.1% in 2018, about two thirds of the national
norm. The youth unemployment rate was 13.4% with 29.4% not in education, employment or training (NEET). Gender and
regional disparities are noticeable factors impacting negatively on youth’s life chances. Labour force participation by young males
(52.4%) was twice as high as for young females (27.3%) and young women (22.3%) were 2.2 times more likely to be unemployed
than young men (10.1%). The NEET rate was also much higher for females than for males - 29.4% of young women versus 12% of
young men. (ILOSTAT (2018) http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/ accessed 17 May 2021). SitAn 2021 also underlines that The transition
from school to work is challenging, especially for girls. In 2018, only about 14.2% of youth aged 15 to 24 were officially
unemployed while about 20.50% were not in education, employment or training (NEET). Gender and regional disparities are
noticeable factors impacting negatively on adolescents’ life chances. Labour force participation by young men (52.4%) is almost
98
young people are working in low-skilled jobs in low pay sectors - agriculture (27.0%); construction
(16.0%); and trade (16.0%). Jobs which do not require specific technical education or skills, account for
more than half of youth employment and most working youth are employed in the informal labour market,
particularly young women.160
SitAn 2021 also mentions that youth- and adolescent-friendly services are particularly rare in rural areas,
which restricts young people’s access to youth- and adolescent-sensitive health issues, such as sexual and
reproductive health. In recent years, Government investment in health has focused on child survival and
adolescent health has not been prioritized, resulting in little progress made in promoting healthy lifestyles
and well-being for youth and adolescents (SDG 3), low rates of sport activities among young people and
nutritional deficiencies presents to over a quarter of the young people.161
Although all the indicators of HIV knowledge and testing improved from 2014 to 2018,162 the low level of
knowledge among young women is a real concern.163
UNICEF focused its energy and mobilized other developmental partners to prevent child marriage:
- A roadmap for communication and action against child marriage was developed and endorsed by
the government.
- As part of Spotlight Initiative, UNICEF is conducting monitoring of judicial practice on child marriage
cases and developed a specific roadmap for six pilot communities.
- A series of communication and advocacy products and events during 2018 sought to raise
awareness and influence attitudes toward child and forced marriage, including production of an
award-winning short film called ‘Abduction’ that was broadcast widely.
- More than 700 young children participated in celebrations of the International Day of the Girl Child
in the city of Osh. Innovative live statue performances staged by children against gender-based
violence drew public attention and gained extensive social media support, with over 190,000 views,
3,000 likes, and 277 comments in support of ending forced and child marriages in the country.
- Activities against child marriage are implemented at local level by partner CSOs to gain support
from community and religious leaders and the strategy seems to generate results, as the rate of child
women married before 18 decreased from 11.6% in 2012 at 9% in 2018.
- Materials for children and their caretakers were developed and disseminated on how to prevent
sexual violence against children.
- Support was also provided to the Child Hotline and the number of calls to the hotline more than
tripled in 2020, which is both an effect of the promotion and an indicator of the impact of COVID-19
pandemic and lock-down/isolation.
- A mobile application for prevention of violence against girls and child marriage was developed,
assessed and already reached over 150,000 downloads.
Although all these activities had immediate results and can be considered successful, SitAn 2021 still
underlines that “Kyrgyz women, and especially rural women, are subject to specific types of violence such
twice as high as for young women (27.3%) and young women (22.3%) were twice as likely to be unemployed as young men
(10.1%). (Kanat et al. Analysis of Youth Labor Market Trends in the Kyrgyz Republic University of Central Asia (2019) Bishkek

162 According to the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and UNICEF, MICS (2014 and 2019), in Kyrgyzstan,
most youth (58.6% in 2014; 74.4% in 2018) had heard of AIDS, while only a small portion of adolescents had (15.5% in 2014;
17.8% in 2018). While those numbers increased between 2014 and 2018, the proportion of those who were aware of the two
main ways of preventing HIV transmission was only 61.6% in 2014 and 67.1% in 2018. It should also be noted that the
percentage of young women aged 15–24 who have comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS is only around 25%, with an even
lower rate in rural areas (around 20%). Over two thirds (67.2% in 2014 and 74.0% in 2018) of women in the country had been
tested, but this may have been as part of regular ANC screening, rather than as a discrete HIV testing.

Important progresses have been made in justice for children. With UNICEF support and involvement
trained legal aid is available for children and probation is developing to support child offenders
reintegration. Although a remarkable achievement, the progress made around justice for children still
needs to be measure at the level of the children, and judicial statistics needs to be improved on reintegration
and recidivism, with disaggregation by age, gender, etc. in order to allow an impact evaluation.
SitAn 2021 also underlines that “overall prevailing gender and social norms do not fully support the concept
or practice of children or adolescents participating in government decision-making processes. This lack of
participation in turn reinforces and renews the existing lack of trust in government and undoubtedly opens
the child’s mind to the idea of migration as it develops into adulthood. Awareness-raising among young
people and their adult counterparts, together with both individual and institutional capacity-building, and
community engagement for social norm change are vital.”165

A theory-based impact evaluation requires the evaluator to identify the impact to be studied and to
assess the processes and/or contributions and/or mechanisms that participate to the impact. In the
context presented above, the assessment of UNICEF contribution for the benefit of young people in
Kyrgyzstan uses Contribution Analysis as the main methodological framework, to understand
how UNICEF contributed to one important medium-term results: the Government promotion of
youth engagement initiatives implemented at local level;
To conduct the analysis, one parts is identified in the theory of change for the in-depth analysis and
presented in the red frame in the ToC figure. This is in line with the methodological approach specific to
Contribution Analysis, where ‘nested impact pathways’ are recommended in order to focus the analysis
and to organize the evidence.166 The next analytical step, after defining the ‘nested impact pathway’, is
to embellish the nested impact pathway into the theory of change, by naming a subset of assumptions
and contextual factors that may be most influential in explaining the links in the impact pathway. The
primary purpose of Contribution Analysis is to assess the validity of the ToC (observed results,
assumptions, influencing factors). Our goal was to gather the most relevant evidence of sufficient quality
and from diverse sources to assess each impact pathway in the ToC. Data was initially collected based
on documents provided by UNICEF CO167. The narrative contribution was revised based on the initially
gather evidence and additional evidence was collected through interviews and from sources indicated
by the interviewees to further support the ToC. For the identified pathway, the evidence gathered is
organised in a table168 underlying the limitations of the evidence.
The analysis of the collected evidence shows that UNICEF successfully piloted an intervention with two
main objectives:
3) encouraging young people to participate and
4) raising the awareness of duty bearers and (to a lesser extent) caregivers (parents) and their
capacity to listen child and adolescents voices and to integrate them into their decisions.
The initiative, implemented in communities, in the southern regions of the country, in the context of
peacebuilding and social cohesion activities, was labelled Youth and Child Friendly Local Governance
(YCFLG).
Initially the intervention included two types of activities:
3) organising consultations of adolescents and young people and
4) activities for duty bearers, together and separate from the ones with young people, including
hearings of young people, to determine decision making at local level in line with the needs and
expectations of young people.
The intervention sometimes has been implemented in cooperation by UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP,
with high-quality cooperation assessed by the dedicated evaluation169. The State Agency for Youth,
Physical Culture and Sports under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic partner for the
implementation of the initiative in cities and towns included in the Regional Development Concept for
the period of 2018-2022, considered as "growth points", under the label: ‘Child Friendly Cities’ in
partnership with UNICEF.
Interviews also underlined the importance of the quality of cooperation and the work of the
implementing partners and teams, their familiarity with the local communities and capacity to
mobilise local resources.
Concerning mobilisation of resources and outreaching activities, these have been conducted based on
the work with schools and local authorities, based on social media promotion and promotion at national

Models”, Canadian Journal of Program Evaluation, 2015, 30/2: 119–42.
167 A practical aim was to gather evidence as efficiently as possible. To this end, we sought to identify existing information
(collected for a purpose other than the current evaluation/Contribution Analysis) that met our criteria, and collected added
information to fill gaps and expand on existing evidence.
168 The table follows the model of the ‘evidence of impact’ table from Morton, S., “Research Impact Assessment: A
‘Contributions’ Approach,” Research Evaluation, 2015, 24/4: 405–19.

Uzbekistan’ (2019-2020)”, 2021.

level (through interviews about the activities, with representatives of the Government, broadcasted at
national TV). To a lesser extent the local teams have been collaborating with social workers and
pedagogists to identify and engage the most vulnerable young people.
As most outreach was organised in schools, the support from teachers, as well as the support and
openness from local authorities and community leaders throughout the activities and the
absence of direct opposition from parents proved to be key factors supporting the results. The
absence of these factors: lack of support from teachers and local authorities and community leaders or
the manifest direct opposition of parents hindered the results.
These activities generated, according to the reviews and evaluation conducted by UNICEF:
3) a satisfactory level of engagement and satisfaction from young people and
4) youth and child responsive plans in various municipalities.
The YCFLG was boosted when adding an additional tool for youth participation, namely the social
innovation tool: UPSHIFT. This allowed adolescents and young people to participate to learning
activities and to get engaged afterwards by proposing innovative solutions for the problems of their
communities. Empowerment was achieved when proposed innovative solutions have been selected for
implementation, by young people together with adults and resources have been made available for the
implementation of solutions. Resources provided by local authorities and by the local businesses
ensured community support for youth participation, offering a concrete encouragement for
young people and straightforward evidence of the existing impact at local level of these activities.
In 2020, limitations to face-to-face activities determined the organisation of online activities. As
activities at community level continued. Young people have been additionally supported to
participate at national level in an UPSHIFT inspired online workshop. A total of 140 young people
from 25 cities and villages participated in this online event. The initiative, organized as part of the "Child
and Youth Friendly Cities" initiative under the State Agency for Youth, Physical Culture and Sports aims
to find innovative solutions to overcome the harmful effects that confinement might be having on
adolescents and young people. UNICEF, supported by civil society partners, assisted the teams in the
development of the projects, contributing indirectly to improve the digital and research skills of the
participants and enhancing their teamwork competencies.170
At local level, other activities to encourage young people engagement and to empower them have been
implemented (leadership and Innovation Academy, Janyration Chakyrygy Creative contest, cross-
border events among youth and local self-government) and they have been considered effective,
although sometimes not very well coordinated and without a clear connection.
Data collected from participants to initiatives show that boys and young men participants felt
empowered. Data are not consistent referring to girls empowerment, because some evidence
shows they too felt empowered and having more possibilities to participate, but other evidence shows
lack of empowerment. The percentage of Kyrgyz girls participant to the programme: ‘Increasing
Resilience of Youth for Peaceful and Inclusive Communities in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan’ that felt
excluded and powerless increased by 6% after programme implementation compared to the baseline
before.171 However, this evidence is not consistent with any other piece of evidence and therefore,
in this case of conflicting evidence, it is not possible to identify what is the factor that could
generate the lack of impact of the intervention over girls or if there is an error in the
measurement of the quoted statistic. Although there are more girls and young women participating
to activities, compared to boys and young men, the element of gender equity was not fully considered in
the programme implementation and only marginally addressed by the problems identified and
solutions generated by young people themselves.172 Considering gender differences and stereotypes,
this can provide a part of the explanation for a more visible impact of the intervention among boys.

Although the programme aimed at including vulnerable children, the evidence is not consistent in this
regard. In municipalities included in peacebuilding programmes more children in vulnerable
situations have been involved in project activities, as per the programme design (purposefully
placed in marginalised areas). This included children from ethnic minorities facing language barriers,
children otherwise isolated from the community, children in conflict with the law. Children with
disabilities were involved. The youth who participated in the project ‘Promoting Kyrgyzstan’s youth
cohesion and interaction towards Uzbekistan’ experienced it as a revealing experience of initiation into
adulthood and self-leadership. The most spectacular transformations were witnessed among the most
withdrawn, the most geographically isolated, and among young girls who discovered the roles they
could take on.173 On the other hand, there is no similar evidence on the involvement of children in
vulnerable situations in all cities considered as "growth points", included in the ‘Child Friendly Cities’
initiative.
Where the involvement of vulnerable adolescent and young people took place, this was supported by
the involvement of mentors in peer-to-peer activities, according to interviewed stakeholders and
UNICEF representatives and anecdotal evidence, however, there is a need for further research on the
contribution of the mentors to overall impact.
173 Evaluation of UNICEF / UNFPA / UNDP project, op. cit.
104
On the other hand, the impact at the level of local authorities is unclear. Although youth and child
responsive plans have been developed in several municipalities, there is no consistent evidence
about the implementation of the activities planned, therefore about the long-term commitment of
the local authorities.
However, the YCFLG was appreciated at national level and the Government bought-in, participating to
the organisation of a national competition. The initiative was concluded with the awarding of the
certificates to the three cities that won the "Child and Youth Friendly Cities" competition and to the other
seven cities that were certified as youth and child-friendly cities in April 2021, showing the commitment
of the President for the initiative.
UNICEF is directing advocacy efforts and technical support to drive the institutionalization of youth- and
child-friendly planning and budgeting locally with the objective to ensure mandatory collection of age
and sex-disaggregated data on children’s and young people’s needs and demands. National endorsement
for the ‘Child and Youth Friendly Cities’ completion may be a particularly key step ahead in the collection
of data about child and youth needs.
However, there is no guaranteed sustainability for the local activities addressing these needs at local
level and a continuation of empowerment activities for young people and engagement opportunities
that will allow these young people to participate.

The State Agency for Youth, Physical Culture and Sports under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, jointly with the
UNICEF and with public organizations, implements the "Child Friendly Cities" initiative in cities and towns included in
the Regional Development Concept for the period of 2018-2022, considered as "growth points".
However, interviews underline the limited allocation of resources for young people from the national budget.
Good cooperation and quality “From the project design to its implementation and reporting, the three implementing United Nations Agencies, with
of local implementing teams the administrative lead of UNICEF, experimented with an exceptionally deep level of cooperation. Joint design, joint
tendering, joint monitoring and reporting, co-implementation of activities converged to fully materialize the
“delivering as one” approach. The experience was time consuming, as procedures had to be adjusted and joint decision
making demanded long clearance and negotiations. Compounded by the COVID-19 crisis, which required profound
adaptation to move most activities online, these delays weighed on the implementing partners and (to a lesser extent)
participants, who had to rush into activities during the second half of the project despite a non-cost extension.
However, the commitment of the implementing partners and the leverage of the United Nations agencies made it
possible to intensify implementation and pick up a rhythm that participants found exhilarating. The joint process
maximized UN agencies' assets in terms back office, field presence, existing network of partners, reputation and
political influence. The donor can trust in the value for money of the project. The momentum thus created will be
precious for successor initiatives.”179
The conclusion of the Evaluation of UNICEF / UNFPA / UNDP project ‘Promoting Kyrgyzstan’s youth cohesion and
interaction towards Uzbekistan’ is consistent with evidence from interviews conducted for the present evaluation.

UNICEF underlines in the reports and UNICEF staff states in interviews the importance of engaging the central
Government, not only the local ones. Moreover, this is visible in the advocacy of UNICEF for the rolling-out of the local
youth participatory model.

UNICEF reports underline that “the transformative value of the process lies in supporting more
participatory processes for decision making and offering adolescents and young people opportunities
to be heard before they can express their opinions through the electoral system. In turn, participation
and active citizenship among youth will help reduce the gap between politicians and civil society, thus
leading to a more cohesive and peaceful state.”186 This is true in theory, however, at this moment the
intervention generated impact at local level, with limited sustainability and a window of opportunity in
the President’s involvement in awarding the certificates to ten cities recognized as friendly to children
and youth. There is need for sustained advocacy taking profit of this window of opportunity, if still
possible, not only for age and sex-disaggregated data on children’s and young people’s needs and
demands, but also for regulations on youth consultation at local level, students and youth councils at
school and community level, supported by the government and the development agencies and provided
with tools to empower and engage young people, on the model of the initiative described.
The Contribution Analysis asks for an investigation of competing contribution stories that could have
been supported by the same evidence. In this context, one needs to acknowledge that UNICEF
contribution is not very well visible in the existent documents and evaluations, but this is often a
strategy of UNICEF to allow for ownership development at the level of central government and local
authorities. The intervention in some communities would have been possible without UNICEF
participation, because UNDP and UNFPA187 and the local implementing partners also have experience
and expertise in implementing initiatives dedicated to youth development, empowerment and
engagement. However, as UNICEF was involved, there evidence is convincing that it made a significant
contribution, but it is difficult to confidently isolate it. The evidence collected show different specific
objectives and targets for each partner, with UNFPA focusing on health (especially reproductive health),
UNDP focusing on participation of young people over 18 years old, and UNICEF focusing on activities
with adolescents. Moreover, interviews show that UNICEF and the implementing partners have the main
ownership over the initiative, with UNFPA and UNDP manifesting less ownership when speaking about
youth empowerment, engagement and participation.
Assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribution to social protection for children
The assessment of UNICEF Kyrgyzstan contribution to youth development, empowerment and
engagement is based on the theory of change (ToC) developed by the evaluation team in consultation
with UNICEF CO.
A theory-based impact evaluation requires the evaluator to identify the impact to be studied and to
assess the processes and/or contributions and/or mechanisms that participate to the impact. In the case
of social protection, we identified the extended coverage of the coverage of social assistance
programme (SAP) for children by 7% in 2020 or additionally 25,329 children enrolled to the
SAP.
To conduct the analysis, one parts is identified in the theory of change for the in-depth analysis and
presented in the red frame in the ToC figure. This is in line with the methodological approach specific to
Contribution Analysis, where ‘nested impact pathways’ are recommended to focus the analysis and to
organize the evidence.188

children, # of beneficiaries observed was from August 2020 {308,842 children) to December 2020 (334,171). Regulation to relax eligibility criteria and thus, enroll more poor
children came in force on 1 September 2020. The latter was recommended/advocated by UNICEF.

The next analytical step, after defining the ‘nested impact pathway,’ is to embellish the nested impact
pathway into the theory of change, by naming a subset of assumptions and contextual factors that may
be most influential in explaining the links in the impact pathway. The primary purpose of Contribution
Analysis is to evaluate the validity of the ToC (observed results, assumptions, influencing factors). Our
goal was to gather the most relevant evidence of sufficient quality and from diverse sources to evaluate
each impact pathway in the ToC. Data was initially collected based on documents provided by UNICEF
CO193. The narrative contribution was revised based on the initially gather evidence and additional
evidence was collected through interviews and from sources indicated by the interviewees to further
support the ToC. For the identified pathway, the evidence gathered is organised in a table194 underlying
the limitations of the evidence.
UNICEF Kyrgyzstan reports a long-term advocacy endeavour for extend for a universal or quasi-
universal social assistance/social aid support for children. Evidence provided by UNICEF and key
informant interviewed show that UNICEF has been working in promoting (near to) universal
social protection benefits for children and families in Kyrgyzstan, for more than a decade.
However, the constant economic development and growth in the country until the COVID-19 pandemic,
as underlined by the World Bank195, distracted the decision makers and international financial
institutions from the needs of the most vulnerable families and children.
The evidence collected for this evaluation show that the reform regarding social benefits in the
country has been started and progressed with difficulty, due to two main factors:
- Institutional and leadership instability, which made decisions obsolete due to the change of
decision makers;
- Disagreement among development partners and international financial institutions,
especially UNICEF, that advocated for (near to) universal social protection benefits for children
and families, World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), warning about the
lack of fiscal sustainability of the social policy proposals (and to a lesser extent UN Women, that
advocated for a different social benefit system, which will also promote better gender equality).
The goal of investing in social protection for children has been explicitly recognized in the country’s
upcoming Development Strategy in 2018 and provided in the legal framework in July 2017, regulating
initially universal benefits for children from 0 to 3 years old. However, the law was amended in October
2017, even before entering into force, in 2018.
In this context, the Monthly Benefit for Poor Families, renamed to Uybulugu Komok (UBK) in July 2018,
is currently the only scheme that provides regular, predictable income support to poor households with
children. Its limited coverage, targeting errors and low benefit value have been the topic of discussions
among the Government and its development partners.
The latter agreed that “the current demographic window can be seen as an opportunity to invest in the
youngest generation’s human capital development and boost their long-term productivity. In such a
context, social protection is a key strategic tool in further decreasing poverty and securing the Kyrgyz
Republic on a path of inclusive socio-economic development.”
Evidence shows that, due to this joint advocacy effort, the Government of Kyrgyzstan agreed to reform
the UBK by introducing a universal birth grant and adjusting the means-test that determines eligibility,
to strengthen the performance of the social assistance system. This decision may have been supported,
as well, by the examples of countries in the region (one key informant interviewed mentioned that the
example of the Russian Federation represented a key factor in determining the decision of some decision
makers).
The situation when the reform was initiated – in 2019 – showed that a quarter of the population still
lived in poverty, if measured at national standards. The institutionalisation of a multidimensionally
193 A practical aim was to gather evidence as efficiently as possible. To this end, we sought to identify existing information
(collected for a purpose other than the current evaluation/Contribution Analysis) that met our criteria, and collected added
information to fill gaps and expand on existing evidence.

measurement of poverty, considering monetary and material deprivation, but also the lack or limited
access to services, helped informing the decision makers in formulating solutions for the reform of UBK.
As reported by UNICEF, better data and evidence on children has been achieved in two steps:
- the institutionalization of National Multidimensional Poverty Measurement in 2019, because of
UNICEF technical assistance and advocacy
- National Statistics Committee (NSC), with UNICEF’s support, introduced the Multidimensional
Child Poverty Index (child well-being index). Routine measurement of monetary child poverty
is now complemented by an assessment of deprivations in health, education, living conditions,
social inclusion, and protection196.

In 2021, all existing data show that COVID-19 can double the poverty rate and generate a profound social
and economic crisis. Based on the WB-UNICEF study conducted in May 2020, the socio-economic impact
of COVID-19 could affect children in a disproportionate way, increasing the number of children living in
poverty by between 160,000 and 570,000.
In this context, WB-UNICEF report on the predicted increase in child poverty informed advocacy for
improved social protection coverage for children. The two organisations showed that the means-test
used is not appropriate to respond to poverty generated by the COVID-19 crisis, because the “asset
filters do not respond to transient poverty: households who have lost their source of income may still
have assets they purchased before the crisis.”197 Four options/scenarios have been presented to the
Ministry of Labour and Social Development, including the status quo scenario – the no change option
(Option 1), but also one option eliminating the means-test (Option 2) and two other options promoting
a different threshold for eligibility for the social protection benefit, with the means-test (Option 3) and
without the means-test (Option 4).
The Ministry of Labour and Social Development to eliminate one of the eligibility filters for child benefits
and thereby contributing to the 7% increase in coverage in 2020 and UNICEF can be cautiously confident
that the recommendations provided, together with the WB, and the advocacy work done determined
the change in the approach. There is no direct evidence regarding UNICEF and WB contribution, and an
alternative explanation would be that the decision on changing the eligibility filters for child benefits
was developed independently from development partners, by the Ministry. But there is a great

While this is a good first step, the magnitude of the problem still a much bolder approach to the
expansion of social protection, but there is an important lesson learned that cooperation between

Annex 4. Results of the Social Network Analysis
In the case of Kyrgyzstan, the specialists/country officers that have provided us answers to the
questionnaire work in following areas: early childhood development, child health, health and nutrition,
education, child protection, climate change and disaster risk reduction (DRR), customer relationship
management (CRM), technology for development (T4D) and knowledge management.
According to the collected data, the main institutions with whom the CO collaborates are: Governmental
bodies, NGOs and national public agencies/institutes/centres. As the below figure shows, from the
institutions that have been mentioned by respondents, most connections have been established
between governmental bodies and UNICEF CO (40% of the total number of connections), followed by
the collaboration developed with national public agencies/institutes/centres (29%). Higher education
institutions are also important partners of UNICEF CO Kyrgyzstan (10%) and UN agencies and other
international organizations (8%).

According to the collected data, the institutions with whom UNCEF CO staff has established the most
connections are The Ministry of Education and Science (which has been mentioned 23 times by
respondents to the social network questionnaire) and the Ministry of Health and Social Development
(mentioned 15 times). Further, the respondents have also mentioned times The Republican Center for
Health Promotion (6 times) and The Center of Immuno-prophylaxis and The Kyrgyz Academy of
Education (4 times each).
Regarding the frequency of communication, as observed from the data collected, most frequent contacts
have been established with: Humanitarian University, Osh State University, Pedagogical University,
Perinatal Center of Bishkek, Regional clinical hospital and Teacher training Institute. For all the above-
mentioned institutions the respondents indicated that they communicate daily. According to the data
collected and based on the average frequency of collaboration for each identified category of
stakeholders, the most frequent contacts have been established with local authorities. Nevertheless,
only 2 respondents have mentions LPAs as important collaborators. Further, the COs staff mentions as
frequent collaborations, on a scale from 1 to 10 (where 10 means daily communication) the ones with
national agencies or institutions (with an average of 6,91) and universities or higher education
institutions (with an average of 6,52). The least frequent contacts, with an average of 5,38, were
developed with the governmental bodies (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Regional
Development, Ministry of Digital Transformation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Health and Social Development). As we can observe, the frequency of collaboration with
diverse types of partners is not a significant facture.
According to the opinion of respondents, the primary benefit of the collaboration developed with the
indicated institutions or organization was rated to access to target groups, other than decision makers
(25% of the analysed case), followed by receiving information that helps solving problems (23%) and
support in accessing and convincing decision-makers (22%). The figure below shows that the
116
importance given by the respondents to the benefits received from the collaboration with various
stakeholders is similar.

In the case of governmental bodies, the most important types of support identified were information
that helps solving problems (22,22%), followed by support for accessing and convincing decision
makers, access to decision makers and to target groups, other than decision makers (each representing
20,37%). In the case of national agencies and institutes, the most valued type of support is related to the
facilitated access to target groups (32,56), followed by information that helps solving problems and
support for accessing and convincing decision makers (each representing 20,93%). The collaboration
with higher education institutions brings UNICEF the benefit of receding information that helps solving
problems (40%) and of accessing target groups, other than decision makers (33,33%). In the case of the
collaboration with UN agencies (such as: UNDP, UNESCO, USAID, but also the established collaboration
within the departments of UNICEF CO of Kyrgyzstan) and other international organizations (such as:
WB, WFP, WHO, EU), the most frequent benefits according to the opinion of respondents are support in
accessing and convincing decision makers (41,66%) and information that helps solving problems
(33,33%).
Another important criterion of the analysis is the perceived value of the collaborations established with
diverse types of organizations or institutions. According to the collected data, on a scale form 1 (no
value) to 10, the most valued collaboration is the one established between UNICEF CO and local
authorities, receiving an average of 10 points, but as mentioned above, there were only two local
authorities mentioned as important partners for UNICEF out of 147 nominalizations. Therefore, this
case cannot be considered representative, but an outlier. Further, state agencies or institutions have
received an average score of 8,22 and are followed by the partnerships developed with governmental
bodies (ministries), which received an average of 8,06 points.

Source: Data collected through a survey conducted in Kyrgyzstan
In Kyrgyzstan, the social network of UNICEF CO has an average degree of 2.7 edges per nodes. When the
weight is accounted in the calculation of the average, the average number of edges per node is 3.12
edges. These metrics indicated that on average, UNICEF’s experts and the external partner organizations
of UNICEF have around 3 connections in the network.
The size of the network is 93 nodes, and the network diameter has a coefficient of 6 nodes. According to
the latter coefficient, the peripheral areas of the network of UNICEF CO Kyrgyzstan are not as isolated
as the networks of UNICEF CO Ukraine and Bulgaria. The coefficient of 6 represents that the shortest
path between the two most distant nodes in the network is 6 nodes. Regarding the characteristics of the
overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO of Kyrgyzstan, the data analysis shows the
existence of a strong community, with various connections between actors in different clusters formed
around the departments of the CO or the specialists/experts of the CO. This conclusion is based on the
118
modularity coefficient (0,609), which shows strong connections also between different clusters of
interactions and not only within clusters.
Concerning the average path length, it has a coefficient of 3.616, which indicates relative strong flow of
information in the network of UNICEF CO in Kyrgyzstan. The average number of steps along the shortest
paths for all pairs of network nodes around 3 or 4 UNICEF experts and/or external partner organization
of UNICEF, which is similar with the path from the network of UNICEF CO Moldova. This length shows
that the peripheral areas of the network in Kyrgyzstan are not isolated and that edges are traversed
between nodes multiple times. In other words, to reach a certain node in the network it only requires a
path through 3 or 4 UNICEF’s experts and/or external partner organizations of UNICEF.
Nevertheless, based on the connected component indicator, we observe that there are two groups of
nodes or actors connected with each other, but not connected with the rest of the network. The Finance
Associate, together with the Demir Kyrgyz International Bank, State Enterprise "KyrgyzDipServis", Tax
Inspection from Kyrgyzstan, UNDP and Ministry of Foreign Affairs KGZ, are separated from the overall
network of UNICEF CO Kyrgyzstan. The Finance Associate serves as hub in the separate connected
component, as the Finance Associate has many edges pointing out of it to the other nodes that are part
of the connected component.
