Thanks
The evaluation team1 thanks the people and institutions that have participated and collaborated
from different places, with receptivity and enthusiasm, promoting and enabling the approach to
The reality of the youth justice system in Uruguay, as well as to the production of knowledge. Without him
support from the officials of Inisa-Promesec, INAU, Movement Gustavo Volpe, Renacer,
Option, Miguel Magone project, Judicial Power and Prosecutor's Office, as well as the supervision of UNICEF, this
work would not have been possible. We hope deeply that the findings and conclusions
presented they collaborate in the continuity of the creation of public policies that act in favor of the
Improvement of professional and institutional practices nationwide.

Executive summary
General description of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
Adolescents in Uruguay: Design and implementation evaluation.
Uruguay is internationally recognized for having ratified standards and rules that refer in form
applied to Human Right. However, it has a history of violations and breaches of
Basic guarantees and Human Rights in the penitentiary field. For example, it was observed in 2009 after the
Report by Nowak (2010), the United Nations Official Rapporteur, which confirmed, among other things,
The high rates of people deprived of liberty in all age groups compared to others
Countries of similar socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Additionally, in 2013 the Committee
of human rights urged the country to expand the integration of alternative sanctions to prison,
based on the basic principles proposed by the minimum rules of the organization of
United Nations on these measures (Tokyo Rules). On the other hand, in 2015 the committee on the
Rights of the child observed Uruguay for the excessive use of deprivation of liberty of less than 18
years, the limited use of non -deprivation of liberty and lack of programs for the
social reintegration of these young people.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child urged the State to carry out a global policy review
public inherent to the judicial and penitentiary system and to promote the application of alternative measures
To deprivation of liberty such as waked up or assisted freedom, damage repair, benefit
of community service and psychosocial support; and to use deprivation of liberty as a last resort
-as local legislation and multiple guidelines and international recommendations foresee-,
adhering to the principle of exceptionality. While the Code of Children and Adolescence of Uruguay
(Law 17,823 of 2004) lists a series of alternative socio -educational measures to the deprivation of
Libertad, the statistical reports of the Judiciary of - at least - the ten years elapsed until
2018, reflect the minority adoption of this type of sanctions.
On the other hand, the definition of non -private liberty sanctions in national regulations was scarce
and superficial, deriving in approach and execution methodologies of this type of sanctions that do not
They were systematized, they were not part of an articulated program or aligned
inter -institutionally. This lack in the conceptualizations and delimitations of interventions
impacted on the guarantee of the rights of adolescents, leaving the low work methodology
the discretion of the professionals who managed the measures.
From the aforementioned background, in 2015 the institutions gathered at the sanctions table
Not deprivative of liberty (UNICEF, prosecution, INAU, Inisa, Judicial Branch, Anong) began to
Promote the creation of an intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
teenagers in Uruguay (from here in more, MSNPL or the model). The model works as a device
of work in search of homogeneous criteria that allow to meet processes guarantees
and executions, as well as with scheduled and concrete interventions, offering a unique protocol at the level
national. In 2018, the MSNPL was published with specific programmatic guidelines oriented to
Describe in your planning, management and monitoring, the measures of assisted freedom (from here in more,
The) and of the provision of community service (from here in more, PSC). In addition, the model attached all
the registration forms linked to each process scheduled.

Purpose, objectives, and evaluation users.
The present work has as a fundamental purpose of the model's formative evaluation in its first
year of execution, with the objectives of evaluating its design, the effectiveness in its implementation, the first
Results, extract learned lessons and recommendations for improvement.
The specific purposes of this evaluation of the intervention model of non -private sanctions
Freedom were two: (i) analyze design relevance, as well as (ii) the efficacy of practices
executed and their eventual first results, detecting the factors that influence positive or
negatively in its implementation so far that allows an assessment of design and
application of the model, with the objective of detecting strengths, weaknesses, knots and learning for your
Adjusting and continuous improvement.
The objective of the evaluation was to evaluate the model in its first the first year of execution, in
Relationship with its design, the effectiveness in its implementation, and results, in order to extract lessons
learned and recommendations for improvement.
Audience for evaluation
The expected audience of the evaluation includes and its INISA and OSC as responsible institutions
of the execution of the Government's key measures, the Prosecutor's Office and Judicial Power as members
of the justice system and UNICEF Uruguay. INISA through the Program of Socio -educational Measures
With community base (promise), you will have available the findings of this evaluation to inform
The work on the attention of adolescents in the interior of the country, and with organizations of society
Civil (option, Renacer, Gustavo Volpe in Montevideo, Magone Project, in Salto). UNICEF too
will use the conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation to improve your response and support to the
Uruguay Government in the evolution of the intervention model of non -deprivation of liberty sanctions.
In summary, the findings of this evaluation allow to account for possible changes to be implemented
at different levels of politics, achieving the sustainability of the model and improving the quality of
Life of the recipient and attended population.
Methodology
The methodology of this evaluation was non -experimental, integrated qualitative techniques and
quantitative and considered the participation of several groups of interested parties, including the
teenagers. The evaluation is formative and evaluates the evaluation criteria: relevance,
Efficacy and sustainability. Information lifting techniques included a review
documentary of the files and forms of adolescents who complied with non -private sanctions
freedom; a survey answered by 19 of the 45 adolescents who were fulfilling the PSC, a
Focal Group and a group interview with adolescents convened by the executing institutions of the
Model; 22 semi -structured interviews with qualified personnel from these institutions and with
reference personnel of the youth justice system; and a self -administered survey to personnel that
works directly in the approach to non -deprivation of liberty, answered by 46 of the
87 officials to whom it was directed ..
It is necessary to mention that the evaluation went in times of important changes in the
Youth Criminal Legislation. During the elaboration of the MSNPL the Uruguayan criminal process code
incorporated the figure of the processes conditional suspension (SCP), which implied an agreement between
Parties in order to avoid judicial processes for infractions whose level of gravity does not merit it.
7
This figure displaced the one foreseen in the model and despite not being a sanction, it also established
derivations for monitoring by the same institutions referring to compliance with
SNPL. In July 2020, the SCP was repealed through the Law of Urgent Consideration No. 19,889,
But the field work had already ended at that time.
Findings
A. relevance
Finding 1. In general, adolescents consulted and who comply with the sanctions of the PSC
They are satisfied with the activities they carry out within the framework of the model. As an aspect of
improvement, many mention as important for compliance with the sanction that
Activities of the non -private measure do not overlap with education schedules
Formal, while preferring more proposals oriented to employment. They even manifest
need to work and get greater response in mental health care and topics
related to problematic narcotic consumption.
Finding 2. At theoretical level, the design of the intervention model for non -private sanctions
Freedom for adolescents in Uruguay fits international reference instruments
coined and promoted by the United Nations General Assembly, as guides of good
practices The Convention on the Rights of the Child, the rules of Beijing, Riad and Tokyo
They constitute the international legal framework that is mentioned and develop in the model affirming
its consideration at the time of approach with adolescents charged with measures not
deprivative of liberty by the criminal justice system and guarantee their rights. However, no
The rules of Havana and Bangkok are included within that development.
Finding 3. At the local level the design of the intervention model for non -private sanctions of
Freedom for adolescents in Uruguay is part of Uruguayan politics and institutions
destined for compliance and approach to private and non -deprivation of liberty sanctions
teenagers; considering in its creation the current regulations linked to the criminal system
youth, and with the general regulation of aspects inherent in childhood and adolescence. It stands out
The Code of Children and Adolescents (CNA) that although it mentions some guidelines that give guarantee
of the rights of that population does not deepen the approach with sanctioned teenagers
with alternative measures to deprivation of liberty.
Finding 4. The referent actors recognize the model as an input that promotes and
It guarantees the rights of adolescents with SNL and protocolizes professional work.
Montevideo concentrates the largest number of adequate care technicians and spaces. Yes ok
This is expected because the capital concentrates approximately half of the population
from the country, there are departments from the rest of the country where the offer and specialized training of
They are low. Technical and infrastructure deficiencies of departments such as
Maldonado, Paysandú, Salto, Rivera must be taken into consideration in order to strengthen the
MSNPL applicability.
B. Efficacy
Finding 5. It cannot be established that all actors know and apply the model. It is observed
a certain ignorance of the model by the different actors of the justice system
(fundamentally outside Montevideo), knowledge that varies in degree of depth, and
8
Non -application in some cases.
Find 6. The global assessment of the creation of the MSNPL is positive, being considered by the
majority of actors as a necessary guide for the unification of criteria and
Compliance with guarantees. Even clearly perceiving the advantages that the model entails,
different disadvantages and limitations are also pointed out, mainly in
Sufficiency of resources for its implementation and contemplation of territorial diversity
concern.
FINDING 7. SNPL does not apply following the procedures and records scheduled,
detecting through the survey with officials and adolescents, the review of files, and
interviews with qualified informants, that there is discretion at the time of following the
step by step planned by the MSNPL, and that, in addition, there are other variables such as the SCP that
It crosses its implementation and correct implementation in terms of sanctions.
Finding 8. The MSNPL refers to three axes from which interventions with
teenagers should gravitate, briefly describing what would imply responsible,
restitution and qualification as fundamental premises to be carried out from the actions
to execute in compliance with the measure. In general, it is valued that the adjustment is
partial, in the case of a weak point in the execution of the measures, recommending its
future review for comprehensive and sustained adjustment from activities that account for a
Orientation supported by intervention pillars. The adjustment is mainly oriented towards
the axis of qualification and secondary to restitution, and in general, with certain
weaknesses
Finding 9. According to the qualitative analysis of interviews with qualified informants, it arises that the
factors that affect the fulfillment of the SNPL are those linked to support and
Accompaniment of affective and institutional references, to the type, duration, content and
monitoring of activities that includes the sanction, to the clarity of the information inherent in the
step by step of the process, to existing human and material resources, to risk factors
that are based on the lives of young people and their receptivity with respect to
measure objectives.
C. sustainability
Find 10. UNICEF works by promoting and articulating an exchange space where
Convene the different institutions in order to share experiences, agree approaches and
agreements and unify criteria. In this inter -institutional table all organizations converge
And referents are summoned to work within the framework of the model and sanctions
non -private and usually meet monthly with at least one representative by institution
part. Additionally, there are different agreements between the entity responsible for executing the SNPL
and OSC, INAU and other institutions that promote territorial distribution, although
They observe difficulties when covering the entire territory.
Finding 11. The designation of human resources does not correspond to the suggested in the
MSNPL, emerging from the analysis that there are technicians hired for the task, but they are not the ones
The model provides for the formation of interdisciplinary equipment, nor in quantity, nor are they
necessarily hired exclusively for the objectives of the model.
9
Finding 12. In Uruguay there are various institutions involved in the execution of
Non -deprivation of liberty sanctions which make it difficult to access the amount
Total financial resources assigned to the MSNPL compliance. By law, Inisa is the only
Public institution to receive a budget for the fulfillment of these interventions. He
Inisa does not have adequate infrastructure, nor the technical capacity suggested in the model for
perform at the national level, which from that institution generated agreements with
Civil society organizations. The INAU (state and with their own budget) also collaborates
in said execution in some departments of the country.
Finding 13. Elements such as effort for the alignment of the MSNPL with the
national and international regulations, the search for general improvement in the operation of the
system, and the commitment to inter -institutional work from unified criteria, which suppose
necessary strategies for sustainability. However, there is still no clarity regarding
sufficient and/or adequate implementation of strategies that promote correct execution
of the MSNPL, its diffusion, as well as the allocation of necessary resources.
A. Gender and Human Rights
Finding 14. The MSNPL design conforms to international regulations that refers to rights
humans and from which the equity approach also follows. It is presented to a lesser
Measure the gender, being an approach that is not addressed with depth or in a way
explicit in the model.
Finding 15. In the implementation of the intervention model for non -private sanctions of
Freedom for adolescents in Uruguay practices are visualized to recognition of
different human rights of this population as rights to education, participation,
Identity, good treatment, privacy, fair penalties and protection against discrimination, among others.
However, a guideline of rights is not found in practice
humans, no equity, or gender. In turn, it happens that the population of women fulfilling this
Type of measures is very small and it was not possible to recognize a differential approach to sex.
Conclusions
This evaluation evaluated relevance, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability, as well as equity and equality
gender, of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions below
They present some conclusions that the evaluation extracts from the evidence presented in this report of
assessment. The conclusions include reflections on the performance of the intervention model
evaluated through the lenses of the evaluation criteria, the theory of change and the implications
for gender and human rights.
A. relevance
The relevance of the intervention model for the context, coupled with the need to have
a model that unified approach criteria where rights will be guaranteed and recognized
of adolescents in conflict situation with the criminal law was solid. In that sense, the model
It constitutes an important advance, but an update of the offer of
SNPL in the CNA that allows expanding the possibilities of sanction.
The creation of the model is positively seen by institutional actors and is also
Positive the positive assessment of adolescents. The model was very relevant since it provides
10
political guarantees and techniques of approach to follow, incorporating as a framework of
International regulatory reference to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the rules of
Beijing, Riad, Tokyo and as national regulations the Code of Children and Adolescents.
B. Efficacy
Most of the technical staff interviewed recognize the model and use it as a tool
Guide for the implementation of non -private sanction. However, the application is not
homogeneous Those who recognize the model most frequently are technicians, officials
in general and institutional references that have participated or have a close link to
Members of the inter -institutional work table led by UNICEF. It is essential that,
For proper execution, all institutional actors recognize the MSNPL. In addition,
From the evaluation it arises that the forms of work records provided for in the model are not
Used fully and also has no computer system that facilitates the
Process monitoring.
C. sustainability
There are several threats to the sustainability of the model. On the one hand, in the evaluation it arises
Evidence of multiple discrepancies at the level of operation between institutions. While not
The centralization of the model in the INISA is made, it is necessary to deepen the agreements
inter -institutional that guarantee compliance with the planned objectives and procedures
In the model. UNICEF has a key role in the improvement in the articulation of work between
institutions. On the other hand, in the interviews the technicians mentioned
Recurrently the lack of resources for the implementation of the model, and, ultimately, of
Interventions related to SNPL. The model orders, unifies and systematizes the practices that
They were already carried out but does not imply great changes in the distribution of economic resources. In
In the same sense, the real designation of human resources is not consistent with the proposal in the
Model, since after its implementation the guidelines have not been followed
proposed in the formation of technical teams. In particular, the evaluation shows that
There are important structural differences between Montevideo and the rest of the country, being in the
capital where more technical are concentrated, with greater training, better conditions and
Spaces for the execution of the measures.
D. Gender and Human Rights
The results of this evaluation indicate that the intervention model lacks an approach
explicit that contemplates the differentiated needs of adolescents women and men in the
course of compliance with the sanctioning measure. In addition, the model does not integrate its
Legal Framework The rules of Havana, nor the rules of Bangkok, although it mentions them.
The latter leaves the doubt about the consideration and recognition of the differences for
The approach with teenager by gender, sex, or for minorities if there were them. In fact, the
Model does not raise a distinguished approach according to sex or specific characteristics as it can
be the case of trans or migrants.
Lessons learned
This evaluation evaluated relevance, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability, as well as equity and equality
gender, of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions below
11
They present some conclusions that the evaluation extracts from the evidence presented in this report of
assessment. The conclusions include reflections on the performance of the intervention model
evaluated through the lenses of the evaluation criteria, the theory of change and the implications
for gender and human rights.
A. relevance
• The structuring of a national intervention model requires the
Participation of multiple actors working in an articulated manner and a systemic approach.
• The complexity of the design of a model that manages to consolidate, not only theoretically,
but also from practice, the articulation of a proposal that contemplates the needs
of the beneficiary population, in a field prepared for its execution.
B. Efficacy
• It is indispensable when implementing an intervention model that guides
As step by step of the execution of the SNPL, that the justice system provides professionals
specialized in the field of adolescents to all departments of the country.
• The implementation of an intervention model that promotes the unification of criteria of
work and better organization in professional practices, requires a process of
Continuous effort in its articulation, dissemination, training, updating and monitoring.
• The family is a fundamental pillar in the accompaniment of adolescents in execution
of the SNPL and in the successful fulfillment of it.
C. sustainability
• Advocacy is a key strategy to keep the model into operation
• The availability of access to a detailed budget that allows
visualize with clear planning and management of resources, aligned with the proposal.
D. Gender and Human Rights
• The gender approach is an indispensable intervention axis in work with young people who
They cross judicial processes.
Recommendations
A. relevance
Recommendation 1. centralize in an institution the management of the criminal responsibility of the
teenagers.
RECOMMENDATION 2. Review the socio -educational measures not deprived of liberty provided for in the
CNA, both in its content, as in the viability of its application with the objective of assessing its
possible update and adjustment.
B. Efficacy
Recommendation 3. Make a greater promotion of the model, disseminating information about the
same in institutions in a coordinated manner, training and accompanying the technical staff
in its execution and assigning the necessary resources.
12
C. sustainability
Recommendation 4. Promote more formal spaces for dialogue and institutional exchange than
They transcend the unique presence of referents, also involving work teams
Direct with teenagers.
Recommendation 5. To ensure the sustainability of the model, the main ones must be solved
limitations around communication, lack of resources, the ambiguity of the place that
They occupy the SCP.
D. Gender and Human Rights
Recommendation 6. Include the gender and human rights approach explicitly in the
body of the intervention protocol, as an essential part of the approach.

1. National Context and Background
1.1 Sociodemographic context
The Oriental Republic of Uruguay is a country located in the southern cone of Latin America. Is the second country
smaller in South America with a territorial extension of 176,215 km2. According to institute data
National Statistics (INE) in the last population census of 2011, in the country there were 3,286,314
population. As indicated by its name, it is a subdivided presidential republic in 19
departments, being Montevideo with 1.3 million people, the capital of the country.
Uruguay is characterized by being one of the countries in the region with the highest per capita income, low levels
of inequality and poverty, and almost the absence of destitution (World Bank, 2019). Under the calculation of
INE income to measure poverty, in 2017 it was estimated that 7.9% of the population was
Below the poverty line (LP) (INE, 2018). According to the latest population census,
Uruguay is characterized by concentrating 94.9% of its population in urban areas, housing almost the
70% of its population in their capital and metropolitan areas (INE, 2011).
Population projections of the INE indicate that in Uruguay there are 250,115 adolescents (people
between 13 and 17 years). Of the total, 51.1% are male and 48.9% women. They are mostly concentrated
In urban areas, there are 95.5% of adolescents, the remaining 4.5% of them live in areas
rural
Regarding assistance to educational centers and academic achievements, the Office of Research and
Statistics from the Ministry of Education and Culture of Uruguay (MEC, 2019) 2 states that, in 2018, in
Average more than 80% of adolescents between 13 and 17 years attended some educational center
Formal, specifically 97.4% of 13 -year -olds are within the educational system,
While those who are 17 years old attend 79.7%. If your assistance is geographically observed,
The difference is small, in the capital of the country they attend more than in the rest of the country, 91.8% in front of the
90.4% assistance. Although 86.7% of adolescents between 15 and 17 years attend education
formal, only 57% do so at the level that would correspond to them (net assistance rate adjusted to
level). In turn, if assistance is seen by sex, women attend more than men, on average their
Assistance is 92.4% and that of men is 89.5%.
On the other hand, from the Judiciary it was reported that in 2019 there were 222 adolescents with processes
concluded. 95% of them are men who are between 16 and 17 years old. For the total of these young people,
The justice system ordered deprivation of liberty for 45.7% and socio -educational measures
non -private for 49.1% of them. The prey3, reception4 and theft concentrate almost 75% of the

a crime, without a concert prior to its execution, with the authors, co -authors or accomplices, with benefit to itself or for

crimes committed by formalized adolescents, all of them in crimes against
property.
In the multiple reports published in at least the last ten years the high arises
prevalence of the use of deprivation of liberty as a measure in executed sentence in the capital and
some departments of the country, not being respected the expected exceptionality, fundamentally
In the case of young population (Duarte, 2017; Palummo, 2009; Palummo, 2010; Judicial Branch, 2009;
Judicial Branch, 2010; Judicial Branch, 2011; Judicial Branch, 2012; Judicial Branch, 2013; Judicial Branch,
2014; Judicial Branch, 2015; Judicial Branch, 2016; Judicial Power, 2017). It is argued that the treatment of
Justice system towards Uruguayan adolescents has been especially punitive, not adhering
to the international recommendations and guidelines that insist on the minimum use of this type
of sanctions and in the specialized treatment of the adolescent in conflict with the criminal law (UN, 1985; UN,
1989; UN, 1990a; UN, 1990b).
The description of all non -private socio -educational measures in the law is scarce and superficial. TO
starting 2015 the execution procedures of socio -educational measures were organized, through
of the National Institute of Adolescent Inclusion (INISA). In 2018 the intervention model was born for
SNPL for teenagers in Uruguay to propose programmatic intervention guidelines
concrete aimed at describing the measures of the PSC in its planning, management and monitoring
(Morais de Ramírez, 2018). This work process had the promotion of UNICEF Uruguay.
1.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR NON -LIBEHOLDER SANCTIONS (SNPL)
1.2.1 International regulatory framework
Uruguay is a positively recognized country for the ratification of international normative frameworks
linked to human rights issues5. The hierarchy given to international rights treaties
Humans does not expressly arise from the Constitution. However, articles 7, 72 and 332 of the
Constitution propose the respect and promotion of the human rights listed in it, and also
those that derive from the dignity of the human person and the republican form of government. In this
meaning and in relation to the object evaluated, Uruguay has ratified the civil rights pact and

Alternatives to deprivation of liberty, in 2013 the Human Rights Committee urged Uruguay to expand the
Incorporation of alternative penalties to deprivation of liberty, taking into account the minimum rules of

treatment of inmates and non -deprivation of liberty for women's women (final observations

International treaties complement the legal framework and the political context in which it is located
the model of non -deprivation of liberty (hereinafter MSNPL).
1.2.2 National Regulatory Framework
First, specific provisions regarding measures
Alternatives to private sanctions referring to adults or minors. However,
It should be noted that in article 26 the reeducation and rehabilitation of the deprived of liberty is expected
as an objective of the prison system, and prohibits prisons from serving to mortify10, being
relevant to the object of study because it implies that constitutional philosophy is intended to
rehabilitation. Therefore, a model that allows the concretization of measures with this objective does not
would violate the constitutional precept.
In legal terms, in 2004 it was arranged through Law No. 17,726 that in cases where they are imputed
Failures or crimes sanctioned with fine, suspension or disqualification penalty
Preventive to the processing. Along the same lines, in the Criminal Procedure Code, Law No. 19,293, they are made
several references to the possibility of having alternative measures to deprivation of liberty11.
Specifically referred to under 18, Law No. 17,823 Code of Children and Adolescents
(From now on, CNA) establishes in its article 76 the criminal regime related to responsibility
adolescent, and in its numeral 12 by delimiting the content of the sentence, establishes that “deprivation
of freedom will be used only as a last resort and during the shortest period.
It must base why it is not possible to apply another measure other than that of deprivation of liberty ”.
However, the aforementioned principles, by modification of Law No. 19,055, the same standard in its
Article 116 bis establishes that in cases where the alleged perpetrator of a very serious infraction12 is
over fifteen and under eighteen, the judge, at the express request of the Prosecutor's Office and after having

1.2.3. Model regulatory and institutional context
The CNA, in relation to adolescents13 in conflict with the law, in article 80, provides for a series of
socio -educational measures, and non -deprivation of liberty, for the purposes of sanction in those cases
in which an executed sentence falls on the young man, and the first must be applied
Exceptional (Law 17,823).
The description of all socio -educational measures in the law is scarce and superficial, and the forms of its
execution have been historically subject to what the devices involved arranged, without
An inter -institutionally articulated and aligned programmatic line, which has resulted in forms of
diverse work between the private and the public (Morais de Ramírez, 2018), emerging the need
of a unification of flexible criteria that allow the work to be orient. The
absence of a concise definition of the socio -educational measure impacts on the guarantees for the
adolescent, then, in short, there is no clarity at the time the judge selects one and not another,
In addition to being discretionary the format of its fulfillment, with the consequences that this may have
also at the level of efficiency and efficiency of this.
As of 2015, the execution procedures of the socio -educational measures were organized, through
of the National Institute of Adolescent Inclusion (from now on Inisa). However, it is not even
The recent creation in 2018 that the Intervention Model for SNPL for adolescents was born
In Uruguay and with that objective, that, from a collective work, guidelines of
concrete programmatic intervention, although also based on experience so far,
oriented to describe the measures of the PSC in its planning, management and monitoring (morais of
Ramírez, 2018). This work process had the promotion of UNICEF Uruguay, as guarantor of
the rights of Uruguayan children and adolescents, through the inter -institutional articulation and
support in hiring an international expert who guides Uruguayan organisms
involved in the subject to go along the way of good practices and recognition of rights
of these teenagers.
The creation of the intervention model implies a progress in legal and psychosocial matters, and responds
to demands that are urgent in relation to the accompaniment of public policies directed towards the
Responsibility, from qualification to social insertion and repair from three approaches:
of rights, community and educational (Morais de Ramírez, 2018).
1.2.4. SNPL intervention models for teenagers in conflict with criminal law in Latin America
The evaluation team made an official documentation review of the International Observatory
of youth justice (OIJJ), of the Latin American Council of Youth Justice (CLJJ), as well as the

Managing institutions for adolescents in conflict with the criminal or departments of
Youth justice of the countries of the region in order to know other models or programs of
Intervention in Latin American countries.
The OIJJ has led to the development of models of intervention and systematization of good practices.
Together with the European Council, it has developed guidelines and rules for the implementation of the
Freedom monitored (Committee of Ministers, 2010), under which recommendations are also made for
The implementation of the work for the benefit of the community. In this continent also has
made a guide of good practices for alternative measures to deprivation of liberty (Kilkelly,
Forde & Malone, 2016).
For its part, the CLJJ facilitates the Regional Model of Youth Justice Policy: Roadmap and
Recommendations for the States of Latin America (Cillero & Vázquez, 2016). It does not develop
concrete proposals regarding alternative measures to deprivation of liberty, but provides
general guidelines and recommends following the principles and guidelines established in the Tokyo rules
(UN, 1990b).
The review by countries showed that, although almost all of the countries in the region have
Assisted/Vigilated Freedom Figures and with the provision of community services -although with
different denominations-, very exceptionally countries have models or programs of
intervention that develop nationwide. Some countries have specific programs
developed in local government levels, such as Argentina, which has 25 programs
different from the one developed at the provincial level (Llobet, Villalta, Barna & Medan, 2018).
In Colombia, technical guidelines have been developed for all sanctions for
Adolescents in conflict with criminal law, both private and non -deprivation of liberty. I also know
has developed a proposal and systematization of a pilot experience14 for the PSC (Padilla
Villarraga, 2012).
In Chile the existence of two tools15 is recorded: the Assisted Freedom Program (Pla) (Sename
& Juvenile Department of Justice, 2017) and the Services Program for the benefit of the community and
Damage repair (PSBC) (Sename & Department of Youth Justice, 2017).
The fact that only three countries in the region have programs nationwide, and that they have
been developed only recently implies a great opportunity to generate resources -both for
the design as for the evaluation of them- relevant to the characteristics presented by the
14 This intervention proposal is technical, specifies the regulatory framework, the objectives of the
intervention, stages (framing of sanction, execution, completion), transverse strategies (registration of
Activities and review of practices), human team (psychosocial, service facilitator, pedagogue, reference,
coordinator). It should be noted that explanatory approaches or models are not explained on which it is based.
15 both together make up a tool very similar to what the Uruguayan MSNPL proposes, providing
the framework defined by the National Minors Service (SENAME) for the execution of the measures of the and
Service for the benefit of the community, as well as the theoretical frameworks on which they are based, technical guidelines
and forms for the development of the intervention strategy, the implementation and evaluation of cases, thus

countries of our region, with its challenges and opportunities.
Participation of rights and guarantors of rights
To answer the evaluation questions, guarantors of duties were contacted as agencies of
Implementation (UNICEF, Inisa-Inau, ORC), in addition to national technicians that involved
The implementation of the protocols of the Intervention Model (MSNPL). The
rights holders, such as adolescents and their families. All these groups of interested parties
They made substantial contributions to the findings presented in this report.
It is important to note that this evaluation transversely contemplates the integration of the
Human rights, equity and gender approaches. In this way the evaluation relieves participation
of adolescents as main rights holders in this intervention, as well as
institutions that act as guarantors of these (Judicial Branch, Prosecutor's Office, Inisa, organizations in
Agreement for implementation, families). In this way, headlines and guarantors are contemplated
Rights as main users of the results of this evaluation.
As established by the CNA, the “adolescent older person of thirteen and minor of
eighteen years of age (article 1), who is expressly recognized as rights subjects and
Duties (Article 2.), which exercise progressively, according to the evolution of their powers
and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic, international instruments,
to the same code and in special laws (article 8) ”(CNA, in Morais de Ramírez, model of
Intervention, 2018). In this evaluation it was considered relevant to know the perception of the
Adolescents who, in conflict with the law, comply with non -deprivation of liberty. In
This sense was the look of these about current practices in the fulfillment of these
measures, the level of information they obtain on the institutional operation regime, their
Rights and duties in this framework. It also seeks to know the degree of satisfaction with the measures
socio -educational that are implemented within the framework of the sanction, and the valuation they make in relation
to its current vital process.
The direct and specific participation of adolescents with SNL
of a satisfaction survey, of a focal group and a group interview, with teenagers who are
or they were studying non -private sanctions in the passing of the year.
Article 14 of the CNA establishes that:
The State will protect the rights of all children and adolescents subject to jurisdiction,
regardless of ethnic, national or social origin, sex, language, religion, political opinion
or of another nature, the economic position, psychic or physical impediments, birth or any
Another condition of the child or his legal representatives.
The institutionality in charge of guaranteeing the protection of adolescents in conflict with the
Law by the State is the INISA through the program of socio -educational measures based
Community (Promsec), is responsible for the execution of non -deprivation of liberty measures. As
responsible body establishes agreements with other agencies of the State, in order to cover the
adolescents' care in the interior of the country, and with civil society organizations (option,
Renacer, Gustavo Volpe in Montevideo, Magone Project, in Salto).
To know the gaze of these institutional actors, interviews were conducted
19
qualified in the execution of the model in Montevideo (Promsec); Programs referents
departmental and regional interior of INAU in agreement with Inisa; and referents of the OSC in
Convention with Inisa. A survey was applied to all members of the equipment that are
working with non -private sanctions with adolescents from the country.
1.3 UNICEF role
UNICEF works worldwide so that the rights of children and adolescents are respected
and that everyone has the same opportunities to develop their abilities. In Uruguay, lo
does, among other things, promoting the implementation of conventions, rules and norms
ratified by the Uruguayan government. With the promotion of the sanctions intervention model
Non -liberty for adolescents in Uruguay and its presentation in June 2018, UNICEF
He supports the fulfillment of the Tokyo rules that Uruguay was violating.
For the design and implementation of the model, an inter -institutional table included by
The Attorney General's Office, the Judiciary, the INAU, Inisa and Anong, coordinated by UNICEF.
UNICEF was responsible for systematizing the existing evidence of experiences of pilot projects in the
Latin America and the Caribbean region. This study focused on the models available to influence
The results of adolescents, through policies and programs nationwide. During the
Identification and selection process some critical factors were recognized as an environment
Enabling, support and guidance by key actors, as well as evidence that was developed
To support these policies (Pompa, 2019).
One year after its implementation, UNICEF requests this evaluation in order to know the operation and
scope of your approach, vicissitudes; potentialities and shortcomings, promoting good communication
between the various institutions involved and those who carry out the evaluation.
2. Evaluation object
Since 2015, institutions gathered at the table of non -deprivation of liberty sanctions (UNICEF,
Prosecutor's Office, Inau, Inisa, Judicial Branch, Anong) began to promote the creation of a model of
Intervention for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for adolescents in Uruguay (from here more,
MSNPL or the model). The model works as a work device in search of criteria
homogeneous that allow to fulfill the guarantees of processes and executions, as well as with
scheduled and concrete interventions, offering a unique protocol nationwide.
The intervention model, object of the evaluation for the period between 2018 and
2019, is registered within the framework of compliance with article 80 of the CNA, which provides for the
adolescents in conflict with the law sanctions called "socio -educational measures" and the publication
of Law 19,367 in 2016, which in its article 2, attributes to Inisa the competition for the “insertion
social and community of adolescents in conflict with criminal law through a psychosocial process
educational and comprehensive that leads to the recognition of the subject of rights ”. The chapter
4, awards to the body the articulation of various programs, including: income, diagnosis and
derivation; Education through sports, recreation and formal and non -formal teaching; Technical
psychosocial; Social and community insertion; Security and transfer; Instrumentation, surveillance and
evaluation of measures (private, not deprivative of liberty and healing), in order to ensure
That the planned objectives and committed are met.
20
The intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for adolescents in Uruguay
It contains a set of principles, guidelines and methodological guidelines to guide the execution of
Socio -educational measures not deprived of liberty provided for in the Code of Children and Adolescents.
The objective of the MSNPL is to provide a general framework that serves as a reference to the institutions both
public as private that execute non -deprivation of liberty. The model does not resort to
standard recipes for the approach of adolescents submitted to programmatic intervention, but
which promotes your individualized monitoring and knowledge to give in accordance with agreement
to the needs and possibilities of each teenager.
The purpose of this evaluation is conceived as a training process that seeks to understand
The relevance, efficacy and sustainability of the MSNPL proposed in its first year of execution, with the
objectives to evaluate its design, the effectiveness in its implementation, the first results, extract
Lessons learned and recommendations for improvement.
Likewise, the evaluation is expected to provide information to identify the advances and challenges of the
MSNPL implementation, in order to evaluate its design considering its objectives, applicability and
efficacy both at the level of institutions and territories and populations involved, and at the same time
There are supplies (recommendations) to strengthen your response to the needs of the
adolescents to achieve compliance with non -deprivative sentences for adolescents in
Uruguay.
2.1. Programmatic frames and actors involved
In Uruguay it is facing a national and international constitutional and legal framework where they are described
the provisions applicable to SNPL, and confirms ratified through international treaties
referred to human rights.
In that context, in 2015 it is created under Law No. 19,367 the Inisa as a decentralized service
in relation to the Executive Power through the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES). This service
replaces, by law, the decentralized organ of the Institute of Children and Adolescents of Uruguay (in
ahead inau), called Adolescent Criminal Responsibility System (SIRPA) created in the law
18,771 in 2011.
Inisa has legal domicile in Montevideo, notwithstanding that it is installed throughout the country. Its structure
Organizational is distributed between directories, divisions and departments. Within the divisions,
They find the program of non -deprivation of liberty. Currently the organisms that are
They in charge of carrying out interventions for SNPL is Inisa, civil society organizations
(OSC) in agreement with Inisa and INAU in the case of departments where you are not yet
Inisa installed. As observed, institutional diversity becomes heterogeneity to
Moment to apply the SNPL.
According to official data collected by the UNICEF office in Uruguay, during 2018, 782
21
Adolescents between 13 and 17 were arrested by the Police for alleged infraction commission16.
For its part, the Prosecutor's Office reported that, in that same year, there were 355 adolescents formalized in
Montevideo. This number includes both private and non -deprivation of liberty sanctions.
Meanwhile, the Judiciary reported that, in 2018, within the entire national territory, there were 174
adolescents with private liberty sentences, 13 with private semi -liberty and 183 adolescents
with non -deprivation of liberty sanctions. In relation to this, Inisa reported that until November 30
of 2018 attended 58 adolescents by judicial sentence were with non -private sanctions of
freedom.
In relation to the above is the base study by the consultant María Gracia Morais17
which resulted in the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
teenagers in Uruguay. It allows visualizing the work dynamics involved in the
SNPL intervention together with the recognition of critical knots in the approach of these and a mapping of
actors that are considered in the evaluation and presented in the following figure.

2.2 Change theory (TDC) of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
teenagers in Uruguay.
In pompa (2019) the change theory for the intervention model for sanctions was built
Private of liberty for adolescents in Uruguay. The change of change was validated by UNICEF
Uruguay and other institutional actors. From an approach to change theory, the model identifies
elements that need to be changed [in the way they are presented] to public opinion on
The youth justice system (Pompa, 2019). The theory of change, in addition, identifies key activities
necessary to implement these changes and allow a successful social reintegration of the
teenagers.
Figure 2: Change theory - Model of non -deprivation of liberty (MSNPL) for adolescents in Uruguay
Source: Pompa (2019). Own translation.
As mentioned in (Pompa, 2019), the theory of change for the MSNPL is based on the following
associations and assumptions:
If adolescents develop an individual approach plan, they recognize that they have violated rights
of other people, are supported by their reintegration process, and the appropriate conditions are
They provided, then the number of detained adolescents will be reduced and their probability of
reintegration will be higher;
If the adolescents are provided by the support and orientation they need, then they will be able
to fulfill its SNPL.
This conceptual framework is also fully in line with an approach based on the
rights used by UNICEF, and that places the best interest of adolescents in the center, and the
23
importance of rights guarantors, such as local and national governments, to ensure that
adolescents have access to support and guide with emphasis on socio-educational action including family,
Educational institution, work and community.
3. Promiting, objectives and scope of the evaluation
3.1 Purpose of the evaluation
The purpose of this evaluation is to generate knowledge that allow institutional learning of
The application of non -deprivation of liberty measures raised in the MSNPL in its first year of
implementation, and that are useful for making adjustments to the model that ensure their relevance, effectiveness
and sustainability over time.
According to the terms of reference developed by UNICEF Uruguay for this
evaluation of the non -deprivative sanctions intervention model, is conceived as a
Formative process that seeks to understand:
i) Design relevance, as well as
ii) the effectiveness of the practices executed and their eventual first results, detecting the factors
that positively or negatively influence its implementation so far.
Likewise, the evaluation is also expected to allow an assessment of the design and application of the
Model, with the aim of detecting strengths, weaknesses, knots and learning for adjustment and
Continuous improvement. In summary, the findings of this evaluation allow setting to the program
before successive implementation phases. And account for possible changes to implement to
achieve the sustainability of the model and improve the quality of life of adolescents.
3.2 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
According to the terms of reference (Annex XX) developed by UNICEF Uruguay for this
evaluation, the objective of the evaluation was to understand the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of the
Intervention model proposed in its first year of execution, with the objectives of evaluating its
design, efficacy in its implementation, the first results, extract lessons learned and
recommendations for improvement compared to the CAD-OCDE criteria to evaluate the
relevance, efficacy, sustainability when addressing the needs of adolescents and their families, and
Performance of the intervention model was also examined in the context of its contribution to the
equity and gender equality.
Likewise, the evaluation is expected to provide information to identify progress and challenges to a
year of the implementation of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
teenagers in Uruguay (2018), in order to evaluate their design considering their objectives,
applicability and efficacy both at the level of institutions and territories and populations
involved, and at the same time have supplies (recommendations) to strengthen your response to
needs of adolescents to achieve fulfillment of non -deprivation of liberty for
teenagers in Uruguay. During the initial phase of the evaluation, the meetings and interviews with the
Key interested parties helped refine the definition and meaning of evaluation criteria
of the CAD-OCDE for this evaluation and agree on the purpose of the evaluation.
24
In that sense, the present evaluation of the MSNPL contemplates three general objectives and a fourth
objective involving the recognition of human rights, equity and gender which
Transversalize others. The general objectives are described below:
Goals:
1. Evaluate the design of the intervention model taking into account the objectives you pursue and
its applicability both at the level of the institutions that are part of the territories. The
Design evaluation evaluates the program itself, its structure, internal coherence and
Human resources destined. It also evaluates whether socio -educational contents or experiences
They are suitable to meet the objectives, the media and general functioning are relevant
and consider from a human rights perspective, the diversity and particularities of
The population that serves.
2. Evaluate the efficacy of the implementation of the MSNPL model, its first first
results and sustainability, as well as the factors that positively or negatively influence their
implementation. In the process evaluation or development of the model
The methods used, their difficulties, the activities carried out to achieve the
objectives (efficiency) and some results obtained during implementation.
3. Establish lessons learned and learning of the implementation of the model and
Recommendations for improvement. This training evaluation allows to visualize strengths,
Weaknesses, threats and opportunities of the model.
4. Articulate the analysis in a transversal way, the integration of the rights approaches
Humans, equity and gender in the evaluated model. Through current regulations and
commitments signed in standards, rules and guidelines for good practices, the State and
Uruguayan government promotes the transverse inclusion of human rights approaches,
equity and gender of the model evaluated. In this evaluation they are considered
the effects of knowing its fulfillment.
Users
The direct/main protagonists of the evaluation results will be the institutions
participants in the implementation of the intervention model, having participated throughout the cycle
of the design, implementation, evaluation, communication and use of recommendations.
The secondary protagonists will be the adolescents, who will provide information related to the
knowledge and practices related to the intervention model, and will allow possible to analyze
changes. His participation is articulated through a survey, a group interview and a focal group.

The analysis focused on the relevance evaluation criteria (coherence), effectiveness, sustainability and
human rights and gender of interventions framed in the MSNPL, from the year in which
It began to be implemented in 2018 until mid -2019.
to. Thematic reach.
As mentioned above, in Uruguay the definition of non -private sanctions
Freedom in national regulations was scarce and superficial, deriving in approach methodologies and
execution of this type of sanctions that were not systematized, they were not part of a program
articulated or inter -institutionally aligned. This lack in conceptualizations and
interventions delimitations impacted on the guarantee of adolescents' rights,
leaving the work methodology under the discretion of the professionals they managed
The measures. The intervention model, object of evaluation, is mostly aimed at attending
adolescents, from an approach to protect their rights that allow them to comply with
guarantees of processes and executions, as well as with scheduled and concrete interventions, offering a
Single national protocol, based on specific programmatic guidelines oriented to
Describe in your planning, management and monitoring, the measures of assisted freedom (from here in more,
The) and of the provision of community service (from here in more, PSC).
b. Geographical scope
The evaluation had national reach (Uruguay), within which, for most of the work of
field, the departments of
Montevideo, San José and Canelones within the metropolitan area; Salto and Paysandú within the area
West coast; Rivera in the north and Maldonado on the east coast. Additionally, the
capitals of these departments in all cases except in Canelones, being Pando and Las Piedras
the institutionally referenced locations. Particularly, regarding design work
qualitative, also of national scope, this involved officials who actively work in the
Program of socio -educational measures that include the model.
This selection has been made from the indications of the UNICEF Uruguay team consensual
under geographical criteria. Interviews with qualified personnel were made to local referents of
Montevideo and the selected departments in conjunction with the contracting team. Bliss
selection was made according to geographic accessibility criteria and statistical data on
26
adolescents with SNPL such as the provision of community service. As mentioned
Previously, in Uruguay 95% of the population lives in urban centers and care centers
adolescents with non -private sanctions are concentrated in the capital of each department, for which
It was not necessary to contemplate villages, locations, or rural areas.
c. Temporary reach.
According to the terms of reference, the present evaluation is of an intermediate and encompass
the period between the year the interventions began to be implemented

5. Evaluation framework
The terms of reference for evaluation recommended including evaluation questions
organized according to the evaluation criteria relevance, efficacy, sustainability of the CAD / OCDE, and of
transverse way, also evaluate gender and equity equality approaches
humans The initial evaluation phase helped agree on a prioritization of these questions of
evaluation and to reorganize the evaluation questions within an evaluation framework. In this
Evaluation framework, the general evaluation questions were listed to guide the evaluation,
which were used to develop indicators and as shown in the evaluation matrix in
The annexes. The final evaluation matrix included a final list of 15 evaluation questions (EQ).
Evaluation questions were used to inform the CAD / OCDE evaluation criteria that
They were defined in this evaluation as follows:

Prepared by UNICEF at the beginning of the model design, he joined and considered the
findings and recommendations. In addition, at the time of implementation of the model of
Intervention, design and efficacy evaluation is constituted as “systematic monitoring and
newspaper of the execution of an activity, seeking to integrate the degree to which its outcome coincides
with the programmed, in order to detect the deficiencies, obstacles and/or
Adjustment needs in execution ”(Mides, 2009). It has served as a guide for lifting and
information and data analysis and align with the TDC that was built during the process, in order to
Focus the analysis on the changes, rather than in the results (outputs) of the activities. The matrix of
evaluation includes a specific criterion on the human rights and gender approach, already
that questions were included in the rest of the criteria, to promote an analysis
cross.
6. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
6.1 Methodological design
The evaluation has a formative approach and was based on a non -experimental design using methods
mixed The use of mixed methods has allowed to assess the evidence from primary data and
28
secondary both qualitative and quantitative and based on the compilation and triangulation of
information.
This design allowed to collect the opinions and perceptions of the parties involved, as well as observe
processes, dynamics of change, practices and an overview of the results obtained, with the
object to perform a triangulation of the information that allows to focus the evaluation towards judgments
training and identify lessons learned.
The methodological proposal has been designed to respond to the objectives of the evaluation and the
Expected results. Therefore, a perspective with formative and oriented approach to the
use of evaluation results, which allows learning and eastern future actions, without
neglect the elements of performance assessment that favor the redesign and improvement of the MSNPL,
to allow:
• Demonstrate whether the intervention model (MSNPL), has had a practical utility to produce
changes in adolescents' lives
• Fulfill two purposes: generate knowledge and generate institutional learning, and hence your
formative character for the strengthening in the implementation of the model of
intervention.
Likewise, the evaluation of the intervention model was used for a methodological triangulation,
combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. The basis of this choice is in the premise
that obtaining information from different perspectives enriches the research process, providing
to the results of the most relevance and reliability evaluation, given multidimensionality and
complexity of the subject. The approach to mixed methods allowed to extract evidence from primary data and
secondary both qualitative and quantitative for an integral evaluation of the role of the model of
Intervention (MSNPL), in addition, allowed quantifying qualitative data and qualifying the data
quantitative to extract meaning of data sets that could otherwise be hidden.
In this way, the use of primary and secondary data remains in light. The primary ones were obtained
from individual and group interviews, surveys and focal group, and the secondary ones from the
Review of work documents, technical and management reports such as expenses.
Through the use of an approach focused on use and participation, the evaluation sought to ensure
The participation of key stakeholders in evaluation planning, in participation
of key informants and in the process of validation of the evaluation findings. These are defined to
continuation.
• Evaluation focused on use. This evaluation was carried out for and with primary users and
Specific secondary considering its planned uses. Interested parties, interviewed,
They had a high level of participation during the evaluation, since the main objective was to evaluate
The intervention model (MSNPL), as well as identify the lessons learned and draw conclusions
and recommendations to improve the model in its following implementation phases. Therefore, the
Evaluation focused on use, and was performed for and with specific users, such as UNICEF
Uruguay, the Government of the Republic of Uruguay and other key stakeholders.
• Participatory: This approach emphasizes participation and collaboration during the process of
evaluation by involving key stakeholders in the design of the methodology, the tools
data collection and analysis through regular consultations and opportunities to provide
29
Feedback This allowed interested parties to get a better understanding of the program
and its evaluation, thus increasing the property and probability that these interested parties use
The findings and recommendations of the evaluation to inform your decisions.
6.2 Data and sampling techniques
Below is a picture with information that summarizes the target population within the
field work by type of participants, applied instrument, geographical coverage and are detailed
the amounts relieved according to target population.
Table 3: Actors involved in field work according to instrument used and geographical coverage
Source: Own elaboration.
Within this approach, various qualitative techniques were carried out: (i) interviews with
CALIFIED INAU, INISA, IINF, UNICEF, Prosecutor's and OSC informants of the selected departments,
in order to know the implementation and operation of the MSNPL; (Ii) theoretical documentary review, with
The purpose of deepening the model and its background, accessing national precedents
and international, recognition of rules, rules and conventions articulated in interventions
implemented; (Iii) Practical documentary review, from the study of files, of 81 folders 18 of the
teenagers who have fulfilled and PSC measures; (IV) and Focal Group and group interview of
teenagers who are fulfilling or who have recently fulfilled a non -private measure of
Freedom in Montevideo.
On the other hand, within the quantitative techniques are: (i) surveys to the technical personnel that
They perform their role within programs for the implementation of non -deprivation of liberty measures; (II)
Surveys to adolescents fulfilling an SNPL, of the PSC. Those two legal figures were taken
for being those contemplated in the model.
The survey administered to adolescents with a judicial judgment of non -deprivation of liberty measures (the
or psc) is aimed at recognition of satisfaction in the attention and implementation of the model
of intervention of non -private sanctions. From these, the sociodemographic profile was obtained,
18 In Canelones there were no access to the forms that do the work of the execution of the sanctions not
deprivative of liberty because the program referent indicated that work documents and reports
technicians are owned by the work team in question. He alleged technical protection and privacy, denying the
access to them.
30
participation and commitment within the model, and with its individual plan, activities carried out,
Assistance to ASSE services or other centers, existence of support or containment networks offered by the
service, recognition of new skills and resources learned, assessment of measure and
Work process The survey had the informed assent of adolescents. In this case, given
that the survey was fundamentally of satisfaction, the consent of the
adult referents for those young minors. In all cases, adolescents were
fully free to choose or not to participate in the survey without generating any damage in its
Judicial process. Within the survey to adolescents, it was reached, through the survey, at 19
teenagers (2 in Canelones, 1 in Paysandú, 16 in Montevideo), of a total of 45 adolescents that
They were fulfilling the PSC.
Another primary collection technique was the focal group and the group interview with adolescents.
Two group instances were completed that initially intended to form two focal group, without
However, one of them, given the low assistance of adolescents ended in the realization of a
Group interview. On the one hand, a focal group with four teenagers who fulfill their SNPL was carried out on the one hand
In Inisa-Promesec, and, on the other, a group interview with 3 teenagers fulfilling the sanction in
OSC.
Meanwhile, the 71 -adolescent file review allowed more recognition
broad of the institutional interventions of the model. In that sense, the file study had as
reference to adolescents who have fulfilled and PSC measures during the first year of
implementation of the model in order to know the work process plans; verify the
existence of valuation reports of the work process and the degree of adolescents participation
Attended, to later carry out a triangulation of information with the interviews and survey
to the actors involved in the process.
Regarding the institutional population of qualified references, technicians and linked officials
With the model, through the interviews the voice of 27 key people from diverse
departments of the country, including Prosecutor's Office, Judicial Branch, Inisa, INAU, OSCS in
Agreement with Inisa, an external consultant19 hired by UNICEF for the design of the model and
Personnel of the Contracting Organization. The interviews were conducted by the researchers
main evaluation with the objective of recognizing the reality of work, detecting cracks and
Potentialities For all cases there were prior telephone coordination or via e-mail and the respective
Informed consent of the interviewees. Below is a picture that allows

At the same time that the interviews were conducted, an online survey was implemented to the staff
responsible for carrying out and implementing the approach with adolescents sanctioned with measures
non -deprivation of liberty, in order to know its institutional and labor implications. The present
Survey had census intentions, as long as the questionnaire was sent to the entire population

6.3 Information analysis
All national information collected was systematized and organized through a designed matrix
especially for each collection tool. Both survey related to
Working documents and adolescents such as surveys conducted to technicians and
Adolescents, was processed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPS) program. The
Interviews were unfortunate and analyzed through discourse analysis techniques. In all
Cases participants signed the corresponding informed consent.
The analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, was guided by the specified units and criteria
In the evaluation matrix, sustaining between the triangulation of the various sources of information.
The instances of field work with adolescents, their perceptions and survey were compared
documentary with the vision of the technicians and referents of the justice system involved in the
model implementation.
Finally, by way of exchange and learning, promise was considered a workshop with the
adolescents and in parallel carry out the return of results where the technicians can participate and
Institutional referents involved and personnel of UNICEF.
Participation of interested parties
This evaluation transversely contemplates the integration of human rights approaches,
Equity and gender. In this way, the evaluation relieves the participation of adolescents as
33
main rights holders in this intervention, as well as the institutions that act as
guarantors of these (Judicial Branch, Prosecutor's Office, Inisa, Organizations in Agreement for Implementation,
families). In this way, rights and rights are contemplated as main users
of the results of this evaluation.
General aspects and ethical and methodological approaches.
The evaluation process was completed in accordance with the ethical guidelines for the evaluations of the
United Nations, United Nations Guidelines for the Integration of Human Rights and
Gender equality in the UNICEF evaluations and requirements for ethical research with
children. The ethical considerations involved in this particular evaluation, including risks
versus benefits, gender and equality considerations, and alignment with standards and standards of
assessment. The evaluation team followed the code of conduct of the evaluation group of the
United Nations (UNEG), which requires a research approach that takes into account both the
conflict like gender and adhere to the principle of "not harming", as well as transparency,
Confidentiality, precision, responsibility and reliability, among other key principles.
In addition, the evaluation team ensured that the evaluation complied with the procedures of
UNICEF for ethical standards in research, evaluation, collection and data analysis. AND
Finally, the evaluation was guided by the ethical principles of independence, impartiality, credibility,
Responsibility, honesty and integrity.
Protection of human subjects.
Before the evaluation data were collected, a comprehensive plan was approved to protect the
privacy and confidentiality of participants during data collection, transmission,
analysis and storage.
Since the evaluation of the intervention model project (MSNPL), directly involved
teenagers in data collection, ethical issues and safeguards were a part
Integral of the design and implementation of the methodology and the tools. To do this, the design and
Evaluation implementation was based on the standards established in the ethical guidelines of
Evaluation of UNEG (2008), the integration of human rights and gender equality in the
Evaluation of UNEG (2008) and the UNICEF procedure for ethical standards and research,
Evaluation and collection and data analysis (2015). To guarantee the protection of adolescents
During and after the evaluation, all the researchers went through a basic knowledge of the
Protection of adoelescent as part of a field research training.
The ethical aspects of the project were considered based on the criteria established in the Code
of ethics of the psychologist of Uruguay and the decree of the Executive Power No. 379/008, and in those proposed by
the American Psychological Association (1992), which establish that adolescents are entitled to
be protected from all physical and psychological damage of any research, to be informed in a
appropriate language at your level of understanding of all aspects of research that can
affect your will to participate.
Likewise, this evaluation considered the aforementioned evaluation standards suggested by the UNEG,
applying the ethical protection criteria established in the Ethical Standards in UNICEF in
Research, evaluations, collection and data analysis (cf/pd/drp/2015-001. UNICEF, 2015).
Together with ethical aspects and in favor of compliance with international standards, this
34
Evaluation was presented to an ethics committee that it evaluated, ensuring the correct procedure of the
work process, highlighting the design of the informed consent and pacts of
Confidentiality This External Ethical Supervision Council or Panel (University Ethics Committee
Católica del Uruguay), gave its approval on 07/19/2019 and immediately later began with
The implementation of the evaluation.
The evaluation followed the Ethical Research Involved Children (Eric) guide in consideration of damages
and benefits for children, dignity, well -being and rights of all children and parents
involved in the study. The evaluation team made all possible efforts to guarantee the
informed and voluntary participation, privacy and confidentiality and well -being of all
participants during this process.
From the initial design and planning of the evaluation, the standards suggested by the
United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) and the evaluation criteria of the Aid Committee
Development of the Organization System for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD-DAC).
The consideration of these standards implied that the evaluation is under agreed goals
Internationally and at the local level, prevailing the utility, credibility, independence, impartiality,
ethics, transparency, professionalism always advocating human rights and equality of
Gender (UNEG, 2017, OECD, 2000). Within the DAC criteria, the evaluation is focused on the
relevance, efficacy, sustainability and human rights and gender of interventions framed in
The model.
Ethical approval
Regarding the quality control process involving the Ethics Committee of the Catholic University
of Uruguay, initially all requested documentation was delivered (in
https://ucu.edu.uy/es/node/45009), this being the complete project, as well as the vitae curriculas of
The entire work team, the evaluation application form, a job commitment and all
The consent to be applied, based on the models that the Committee itself recommends. Within the
Work commitment, it has been included that the objectives, methodology and other ethical conditions do not
They would be modified in the course of the investigation, accepting at the same time audits and preservation
of gross data for 5 years, with a registration in digital media with passwords,
contemplating that the data will be administered through participants numbers, locked up,
within the Department of Social Psychology and Labor, having access to them those responsible for the
investigation.
The process analysis process carried out by the Committee implies receiving a version
digital and a physics, which are initially checked and in case of not being complete, the
Director of the project. The protocol is distributed among the secretary, the president of the committee, with
ethical perspective and the five remaining members confirming the perspective dentistry, science
Social, nursing, psychology. Once read and in case you require it, you can consult with a
specialist in the area and subsequently a plenary meeting is held in which it is resolved or
an approval conditioned to changes, or definitive approval.
On July 1, the project returns are notified, with comments and request for
Format modifications inherent to consent (eg, added to the impact
of the positive and negative participation of the adolescent; online questionnaire heading, etc.)
and of the general authorization of UNICEF, as well as the conditional resolution of approval after being carried out
35
the requested settings. On July 3, all the required documentation with the modifications is forwarded
carried out. The definitive approval of the project is on July 10. The
monitoring reports every three months, as will be delivered the ultimate version of the initial report and
end. Throughout the evaluation, all the planned working conditions have been maintained not being
necessary to inform regarding modifications, although it has been informed three months after the beginning,
the situation of progress of the project until the day of the date and the situation inherent in the recording of the
Gesell Chamber during the focal group.
Regarding adolescent data protection, it is noted that at all times they have been
separated the informed consent, of the surveys in themselves, not being identifiable the
answers. Additionally, there was the consent of adult managers of those
participants under 18 for focus groups.
The evaluation will integrate a series of ethical and methodological approaches:
APPROACH BASED ON THE RIGHTS OF ADOLESCENTS: The evaluation analyzed how they have been promoted,
observed and respected the rights of adolescents. To do this, in the evaluation matrix it was
incorporated the approach based on the rights of adolescents with questions, and indicators
Specific, which were also reflected in the tools for information lifting.
Likewise, all efforts were made for teenagers, in their capacity as rights holders,
They will participate in the evaluation process as key informants.
Gender approach: in the analysis two specific criteria were applied: i) the equity criterion, which
refers to the strategies developed to meet specific needs and respect for
rights of adolescents without discrimination or prejudices due to their sex and, ii) the criteria of
equality, referred to the strategies contemplated to promote full inclusion and equal
Conditions in the benefits proposed by the interventions of the model implemented. Hence,
It was identified how said approach was incorporated into the design of interventions and how
He was put into practice, according to the differentiated needs of adolescents. In the frame
From the information lifting with adolescents, men and women were included, and they were
Consulted in separate spaces, to identify differential gender factors in the
experience.
The approach focused on use (UFE): This approach allows the findings and recommendations of the
Evaluation enable the creation of knowledge by identifying good practices,
Lessons learned and challenges to be considered in the intervention of the intervention model
(MSNPL), in order to provide useful recommendations to interested parties. This approach only
It can be operational if it contemplates the participation of the users of the evaluation and the
Process appropriation and results. Therefore, the evaluation included work sessions with the
OP for the confirmation of the object and use of the evaluation, the validation of the theory of change
built, and the presentation and feedback of preliminary findings and recommendations
Suggested.
6.4 Limitations
Next, the limitations and conditions identified with character are briefly described
Prior to virtual field work and during its realization, as the planned mitigation measures

7. Findings
This chapter is organized to present findings for evaluation criteria and respond to
Evaluation questions. Presents relevance, efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, gender equality
and human rights, of the intervention model approach (MSNPL), which was supported by UNICEF
and associated agencies as reflected in the TOC.
7.1 relevance
To evaluate relevance, the evaluation considered both the relevance of the intervention model
(MSNPL), in the context of the national and local political priorities of Uruguay; If the model of
intervention satisfied the needs of adolescents that meet the sanctions of freedom
Assisted (LA) and provision of community service (PSC).
Question 1: Does the design of the non -deprivation of liberty sanctions (MSNPL) answer the
needs of adolescents who meet the sanctions of assisted freedom (LA) and benefit of
Community service (PSC)?
The answer to this question is based on the perception and valuation of adolescents who are
Fulfilling a SNPL of the O PSC and the following indicator (s):
• Your participation in the elaboration of the Individual Procedure Project (PIEM) for the
Measurement
• The usefulness of the measure in relation to your life project
• The type of activities they carry out during compliance with the measure
• The type of accompaniment/monitoring they receive from institutions during compliance with
The measure
Finding 1. In general, adolescents consulted and who comply with the sanctions of the PSC are
satisfied with the activities carried out within the framework of the model. As an aspect of improvement, many
they mention as important for the fulfillment of the sanction that the activities of the
non -private measure do not overlap with formal education schedules, while preferring more
proposals oriented to employment. They even express the need to work and obtain greater
Response in mental health care and issues related to problematic narcotics consumption.
In relation to this and to the objective of knowing if the design of the model gives guarantees to the needs of
The adolescents recipients of this one, through the various techniques implemented during the
Field work is investigated on the perception and valuation that they do of the MSNPL and the
interventions involved. We worked with teenagers who, at the time of field work,
They were fulfilling a non -deprivation of liberty, of the PSC; or they would have already gone through
said process.
Their participation in the elaboration of the individual project for the execution of the measure (PIEM) for
compliance with measure
To know the level of satisfaction at the time of compliance with the SNPL, it was consulted to
adolescents sanctioned judicially and linked to any of the state institutions such as Inisa
- INAU, or civil society organizations (OSC) agreed with the State to carry out said
38
processes.
Regarding adolescent participation in the initial care phase, regarding the elaboration and
Construction of the objectives of the PIEM, 12 adolescents of the 19 respondents refer to having been
involved. The model provides that together with the technical team adolescents elaborate their piem, which
Together they establish actions, goals and deadlines, it states that, according to adolescents it is not seen
reflected in practice. Additionally, in 18 cases they positively value the way in which
considered their personal interests in the planning of activities and consider special utility
The learning acquired in the projection to your future. Punctually, the type of activities that
young people surveyed refers to, are mostly oriented to labor insertion, such as
case; Cellular repair course, realization of curriculum vitae, electricity courses,
Barbing and welding. They also showed restlessness for pedagogical assistance and support
psychological.
Linked to the proposals of the place where they meet the measure, in 6 (%) cases, adolescents
They refer only to attend the institution at the instances of monitoring, not having other types of activities
provided for in your plan; And specifically, 8 cases specify to attend non -formal education courses, five
to formal education courses and four to search for employment.
The figure below presents the percentages inherent in the realization of activities within the framework
of the fulfillment of the non -private liberty sanction.
Figure 4: Types of activities and services that adolescents receive
Source: Own elaboration.
The usefulness of the measure in relation to your life project
Through the survey, fourteen 14 of a total of 19 respondents claim to be satisfied with the
proposed activities and believe that it gives them a positive contribution, while the rest is manifested
indifferent or disagreement.
Most of the population surveyed agrees and well agrees that the objectives and/or
Goals planned at the beginning of the plan, were viable in compliance, except for 3 cases that emphasize their
disagree in the contributions of the contents of the sanction. The remaining 16 cases state that they have
39
learned from experience throughout the process and value these learning in the medium term.
The type of activities they carry out during compliance with the measure
In 13 and 7 cases respectively, adolescents have been presented at work levels
and educational in the course of compliance with the sanction, and only in one case it refers that the/
Participant has had to abandon other activities to meet the sanction. It is important
clarify that 11 of the participants do not carry out any activity beyond the proposals for the
institution. However, they do express interest in tasks or courses related to non -formal education,
as long as they do not overwhelm with their pre -existing activities to the sanction. In that sense,
fundamentally motivation for activities that mean a contribution to the development of their
affectivity, values and social skills. Also, the focal group shows that adolescents
prefer and demand activities that allow them to access the labor market, either through a
employment or internship contract, or training focused on the labor market. However, I don't know
reports that these opportunities have emerged. Nor are instances of group attention recognize
aimed at its responsibility and autonomy. Teenagers declare not having received workshops that
Address issues about sexuality, addiction prevention, citizenship construction, reinforcement
family, anger management, aggressive behavior, disease, nutrition, parents' role or
communicational skills.
The type of accompaniment/monitoring they receive from institutions during compliance
of the measure
In relation to the link with educators and staff, adolescents perceived that in the OSC
The referral educators controlled them less, and that in that sense he preferred to fulfill the measure in
Those spaces. On the other hand, those who fulfilled their sanction with the state institution, in general
They valued the measure positively. Young people conceive the SNPL as an instance of help and
control and the process of compliance with the measure as an opportunity to be able to reintegrate
formal education instances or professional training courses.
The perception of social support provided by the institution's personnel is identified (educators/s,
Psychologists, worker/is social), and the motivation in the situations that happen to them.
Question 2: Does the MSNPL design conform to international regulations linked to adolescence?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicator:
• Presence of international regulations contemplated in the MSNPL
Finding 2. At theoretical level, the design of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions
For teenagers in Uruguay, it fits international reference instruments and
promoted by the United Nations General Assembly, as guides of good practices. The
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the rules of Beijing, Riad and Tokyo constitute the legal framework
International that is mentioned and developed in the model affirming its consideration at the time of
approach with adolescents charged with non -deprivation of liberty measures by the justice system
penalty and guarantee their rights. However, the rules of the
Havana and Bangkok.
Presence of international regulations contemplated in the MSNPL
The MSNPL has theoretically considered international conventions and treaties
40
in the orbit of human rights, as guide instruments of their strategic actions.
International tools considered as a framework for MSNPL design, highlighting
Those aspects directly linked to adolescence are:
• Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989).
• United Nations Rules for the Administration of Minors Justice (Beijing Rules)
(UN, 1985).
• United Nations Guidelines for Youth Crime Prevention (guidelines
Riad) (UN, 1990a).
• United Nations Minimum Rules for the Administration of Non -Private Measures of
Freedom (Tokyo Rules) (UN, 1990b).
• United Nations rules for the treatment of inmates and non -private measures of
Freedom for criminal women (Bangkok rules). (UN, 2010).
• United Nations Rules for the Protection of Minors deprived of liberty (rules
of Havana) (UN, 1990c).
The aforementioned regulations are the theoretically referred to the model and are fundamentally integrated
as part of the international legal framework. In that sense, respect for the rights of
Children and adolescents, for their legally expected judicial times, for the right to be in
communication with their families, good treatment and treatment that benefits them entirely, that
advocates adequate resocialization and social reintegration and alternative measures are favored
to the deprivation of liberty against their imprisonment.
However, despite being appointed, the documentary review shows that they are not integrated into the framework
Legal of the Model The rules of Havana, nor the rules of Bangkok. The latter leaves the doubt open
on the consideration and recognition of the differences for approach to adolescent by
gender, sex, or for minorities if there were them. In fact, the model does not raise a distinguished approach
according to sex or specific characteristics such as trans adolescents, migrants or
others.
Question 3: Has MSNPL design taken into account national adolescence policies?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicator:
• Presence of national regulations contemplated in the MSNPL
Finding 3. At the local level the design of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions
For adolescents in Uruguay, Uruguayan politics and institutions are part of
compliance and approach to private and non -deprivation of adolescents;
considering in its creation the current regulations linked to the youth criminal system, and with the
General regulation of aspects inherent in childhood and adolescence. The childhood code stands out and
Adolescence (CNA) that although it mentions some guidelines that give guarantee of the rights of that
population does not deepen the approach with sanctioned adolescents with alternative measures to the
deprivation of liberty
Presence of national regulations contemplated in the MSNPL
For the Uruguayan case within the national regulatory framework, a must of the subject is established in the
which refers to its maximum norm; The Constitution of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (Constitution). The
41
Constitution does not contain any rule on adolescents in conflict with criminal law. In
Their articles only recognize them as rights subjects, mentioning rights, duties and guarantees
For this population.
In turn, in Uruguay is the CNA, which recognizes the Constitution and the Convention on the
Rights of the child (CDN) as a source of interpretation. This takes the principles of equality, of
Higher interest and co -responsibility.
Specifically referred to with minors, Law No. 17,823 (CNA) establishes in its article 76 the
criminal regime related to adolescent responsibility, and in its numeral 12 by delimiting the content
of the sentence, states that “deprivation of liberty will be used only as a measure of last resort
and during the shortest period. Must base why it is not possible to apply another
measure different from the deprivation of liberty ”.
In article 79 of the CNA, the non -deprivation of liberty is subtly mentioned and it is affirmed that “they will have
an educational character through the proportionality criteria and which is intended to strengthen the
family linking, responsibility and respect for human rights. ”Likewise, in your article
80, provides a series of socio -educational, private, and non -deprivation of liberty, for the purposes of
sanction in those cases in which an executed sentence falls on the young man, and must
first, apply exceptionally (Law 17,823). Despite this, in the current Uruguayan regulations
The adolescent's resocializer function does not appear as a primary one, leaving the doubt as far as
Really the best interest in children and adolescents is a fundamental principle.
Question 4. The design of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
Adolescents in Uruguay is applicable under the current infrastructure conditions?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Technical personnel number linked to the execution of department measures
• Technical personnel number linked to the execution of measures with specific training in
adolescence or vulnerable population promoted by the institution
• Existence of physical spaces for execution and/or follow -up of the SNPL
Finding 4. The referent actors recognize the model as an input that promotes and guarantees the
teenagers rights with SNL and protocolize professional work. Montevideo concentrates the
greater number of adequate care technicians and spaces. While this is expected because
The capital concentrates approximately half of the country's population, there are departments of the
rest of the country where the offer and specialized training of them is low. Technical lacks and
of infrastructure of departments such as Maldonado, Paysandú, Salto, Rivera must be held in
consideration in order to strengthen the applicability of the MSNPL.
Technical personnel number linked to the execution of the department measures
Next, within the political map of Uruguay, the number of technicians linked to
The execution of non -deprivation of liberty for adolescents. This information was reported
during interviews with technical personnel linked to the execution of the SNPL, specifically by
Each departmental reference.

Note: It is clear that 27 people who coincide with 4 people who also possess in Montevideo are published
charge in the OSC in agreement in San José. However, the total sum, amounts to 27 because the
people of the total country, and not the charges. In the case of Paysandú, the institution is notified that there are 4
officials who are working directly with adolescents, however, during the work of
field and in person, arises that there are 6 officials in total.
In this map in addition to presenting the number of linked officials, you can also
Observe the number of officials who agreed to answer the survey, by department. He
Total technicians linked to the time of survey amounts to 87 people, 27 of them
It concentrates in Montevideo and 60 in the rest country in accordance with INAU availability or agreement
agreed by the Inisa. The distribution is expected since it is important to highlight that Montevideo
It concentrates approximately half of the country's population.
Technical personnel number linked to the execution of measures with specific training in
adolescence or vulnerable population promoted by the institution
From the report of the 87 officials or technicians linked to the fulfillment of the SNPL, through
The online survey was known to know the reality of 43 of them25. Of the total, 35 are women, 6 men
and 2 did not give data about their sexual identification. Of the N⁼43, 12 are from Montevideo (28%), the capital
from the country and 31 of the rest of the country. It should be clarified that Montevideo concentrates approximately half of
The total population of Uruguay.
Regarding the applicability of the MSNPL, most respondents work with teenagers who
They meet measures linked to the model, and 46% also work with young people with other types of
sanctions and projects.
As for the academic training of technicians, 2 have a type specialization
25 The data is not presented in percentages due to the reduced total number of responses.
43
Postgraduate/Master/Doctorate, 23 have tertiary/university degree, 10 studies
Incomplete tertiary/university students and the remaining 8 did not reach levels of tertiary education. Yeah
Well more than half of the technicians have a tertiary and higher training, the model foresees
that the formation of technical teams must reflect the inclusion of professionals in the field of
psychology, social work, law and education, which is not reflected in the remaining
respondents, which have incomplete studies. In fact, the model states that it is responsibility
of the institution that manages the sanctions to hire personnel who have the necessary training
To carry out its functions, which questions the level of interdisciplinarity to be able to
Plan and execute individual plans from an integral accompaniment of adolescents.
Punctually the question about specific training in adolescence or vulnerable populations
promoted by the institution it was recorded that of the 43 respondents, 3 do not have any kind
training linked to the aforementioned themes, 5 cases were promoted by the institution of
work, 29 cases in addition to having carried out institutionally promoted courses also
He made others by their own means and 6 of them did not have institutional support, however the same
They have specialized training.
Existence of physical spaces for execution and/or monitoring of the SNPL
Of the 43 technicians who responded the survey, 37 refer to spaces to interview the
adolescent and/or your family individually/privately, while in 6 cases they manifest not counting
With it.
At the infrastructure level, the model includes that there are spaces for carrying out activities of
Income, individualized and collective attention, offices for professionals, meeting rooms and
Sanitary Regarding the adequacy of spaces for the organization of collective activities, in 29
cases the presence of a space for them is relieved, 6 declare a more sporadic frequency in their
utilization; 6 respondents state that they do not have them, 1 refers not to count and not perform this
type of activities, while in 2 cases, although there are this type of infrastructure, they are not carried out
group activities. On the other hand, all respondents allude to the presence of spaces
heated.
Given the current conditions in terms of technicians linked to the model and infrastructure,
Its correct implementation is questionable. In Uruguay the number of adolescents with
sanctions of the PSC, and, in turn, most are concentrated in Montevideo where there is greater capacity
of response. In the rest of the country, without good there are agreements that respond to approach to these
adolescents, technicians do not usually have specialized training, and neither the building structure nor of
Work networks is strengthened. Examples of this is the case of some departments where, the
Referential educator has no tertiary training, in the same space where the adolescent has a
Interview with the technicians, their family or pairs there are cells for visible liberty and the offer
of educational or labor proposals is scarce. In sum, the recognition of these shortcomings must
be a kick to consider the improvement and implementation of the model.
7.2 Efficacy
To evaluate efficacy, the evaluation considered the assessment, knowledge and application of the model
by the institutional actors, as well as the adjustment of the model to the axes of responsibility,
restitution and qualification, and the factors that affect the compliance of the sanctions provided for in the
44
model.
Question 5. The institutional actors who work in the SNPL execution of the PSC with
teenagers, do they know and apply the MSNPL?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Number of actors who know the MSPNL per institution
• Number of actors who apply the MSNPL per institution
Finding 5. It cannot be established that all actors know and apply the model. It is observed true
ignorance of the model by the different actors of the justice system
(fundamentally outside Montevideo), knowledge that varies in degree of depth, and not
application in some cases.
In relation to this and to the objective of knowing if the design of the model gives guarantees to the needs of
The adolescents recipients of this one, through the various techniques implemented during the
Field work is investigated on the perception and valuation that they do of the MSNPL and the
interventions involved. We worked with teenagers who, at the time of field work,
They were fulfilling a non -deprivation of liberty, of the PSC; or they would have already gone through
Number of actors who know the MSPNL per institution
Regarding the findings that arise from the 22 interviews with qualified informants, most
The interviewees know the model, although to a different degree of depth. It is also detected
that some do not know what it is, especially among members of the justice system. As
expected, those who have integrated the inter -institutional work table have knowledge
Direct from your participation in the elaboration of the MSNPL design. Judges, prosecutors, referents
INISA AND INAU Institutional, as well as the institutional referents of the OSC in agreement with Inisa
in charge of the accompaniment of non -private sanctions with adolescents, they have participated in
Training workshops for this elaboration generating inputs and presenting “pilot cases” or
testing for implementation.
It emphasizes a shared ignorance of the model by the different actors
of the justice system, which stands out even more among the judges and prosecutors of the interior, also being
An element that hinders the process.
From the survey conducted with officials, specifically 40 forty technicians26 are the ones
They express to know the MSNPL.
Number of actors who apply the MSNPL per institution
Of the findings of the survey conducted with officials, regarding the adjustment of the practices
26 It is recalled that this survey was sent to the 87 technicians who worked at the time of field work
in the execution of measures nationwide.
45
Reales depending on the model, of the 40 forty technicians who express to know the model of
non -deprivation of liberty measures, 37 put it into practice, while 3 declare not to carry it forward
In labor/professional practice.
It is found that although not all the actors who work in the execution of SNPL of the PSC are
knowledgeable about the existence of the model or apply it, mostly there is a knowledge and
application of this, although not necessarily from the criteria scheduled. This situation is observed
Not only among technicians who work with direct care with adolescents during the
compliance with the measure, but also, the actors of the justice system and the
importance of reviewing universal access to the model and a follow -up that allows you to account for
Its correct application.
Question 6. The institutional actors who work in the SNPL execution of the PSC with
adolescents, how do you value the creation and design of the MSNPL?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Assessment of institutional actors on the need and relevance of the MSNPL
• Valuation of institutional actors on the advantages and disadvantages of the MSNPL
• Assessment that actors make on the socio -educational measures included in the MSNPL
• Assembly that institutional actors on inter -institutional communication and networks do
Find 6. The global assessment of the creation of the MSNPL is positive, being considered by the majority of
actors as a necessary guide for the unification of criteria and compliance with guarantees.
Even clearly perceiving the advantages that the model entails, different are also pointed out
disadvantages and limitations, fundamentally in terms of sufficiency of resources for their
Implementation and contemplation of territorial diversity in respect.
From the qualitative analysis of interviews with qualified informants, the assessment of the
following aspects linked to the creation and design of the MSNPL:
Valuation of institutional actors on the need and relevance of the MSNPL
The majority of the interviewees (15) consider the creation of this model necessary. 7
remaining informants did not make any type of valuation, being the 5 members of the system
Judicial who do not know the model, and 2 institutional referents in INAU territory. The actors of
Judicial system raises the need to frame work and available measures by establishing
Pacts of action from common criteria. Also, being deprivation of liberty a “last
resource ”, by the principle of exceptionality, the model proposes an intervention mode that“ there are
to go down to reality to allow the adolescent to become aware of their rights and
obligations. ”The need for this type of tools is also perceived especially outside the
capital of the country due to the lack of courts specialized in adolescence and the scarce resources that
They tell.
Regarding the response of institutional references, the need to provide content is raised
to the SNPL and establish an order that benefits their status within the CNA, and how to work
With the teenager with clear guidelines. Offer a sustenance to the SNPL through credible tools
and valid. In this same sense, there is a great coincidence in the need to order what is already
46
I was doing, providing "professionalization" to practices through a systematization that
Improve performance and efficacy.
Another aspect referred to in a recurring way is the need to homogenize the
practices, in order to establish a “equitable justice” distribution, avoiding discretion
In the way of acting, adopting a common language, with inter -institutional approach and a look
socioeducational.
Then arises that the perception of the actors about the need to create the MSNPL, is expressed
mainly in offering an orderly frame to the accompaniment practices of the SNPL with
offending adolescents, uniformizing the criteria of action and valuing this type of sanction to
from an educational perspective with the objective of working on the framework of rights and
Adolescent obligations.
Assessment of institutional actors on the advantages and perceived disadvantages of the MSNPL
In short, the advantages are mainly based on the fact that it is a tool that orders
and professionalizes the work of SNPL with offenders. It would also be presented as a
Model that offers greater guarantees for these sanction measures, trying to avoid
discretion in practices and promoting greater co -participation and involvement of the
Infringer teenager with the measure. It will be important to assess this aspect when thinking about
socio -educational measure within the framework of a sanction that allows to accompany the process of
Criminal responsibility in the management of the conflict generated by the infraction.
Perceived advantages:
• Facilitates the homogeneity of professional practices
• It has technical criteria and specific work tools
• Unifies language and criteria at the interdisciplinary level
• The actions are of professional
• Organize and clarify work procedures
• Hierarchizes the adoption of SNPL
The disadvantages consigned regarding the operation of the model are not focused on a criticism of the
MSNPL itself but in the allocation of resources for its implementation. You can also
appreciate that the difficulties that arise are: the lack of knowledge of the MSNPL by the
justice system actors mainly in the departments that are not Montevideo, the
difficulty in conformation of suitable technical teams with a certain degree of permanence to
Accompany inter -institutional tensions, and lack of articulation or consideration
of the new CPP figure applied to offenders, such as the SCP, which would not allow the
Application of the MSNPL, because it is not a sanction in itself.
Disadvantages:
• Difficulties in communication and articulation between acting institutions
• Lack of resources for adequate execution
• Low adaptation to the contextual needs of the different territories
• Tension between institutions in relation to their competences
• Does not contemplate the SCP figure
47
Regarding the global assessment of the model, the members of the judicial system that they achieved
establishing it said that it is something extremely positive, which contributes a lot in the matter of
offending adolescents and that it is a good model but that is difficult to implement
Due to the lack of resources.
On the other hand, it is valued that it is a "starting point" to make decisions that affect life
of adolescents and that could be expanded for the treatment and comptroller of the measures so that
These are more effective and support the credibility of this legal figure in the gaze of the
teenagers who fall into infraction.
Assessment made by actors on socio -educational measures included in the MSNPL
As for the LA, among the members of the justice system, it was found that the application of this
measure is limited, declaring that it is due to lack of resources for the control of your
compliance, this being one of the reasons why they apply in a few cases. Also, in his
Speech It is not clear if it is possible to distinguish the contents of the measure beyond control,
generating any questions that confuses the hospitalization in INAU's home with the. What is most mentioned
It is precisely the shortage of sentences that are being given in this last year. This situation
It is presented as one of the limitations and difficulties to implement the model.
As for the inclusion of the PSC in the model, beyond the positive global assessment it possesses
Regarding its objectives, it would present several aspects that hinder its implementation. One is the fault
of territorial and community resources to carry them out or because the measure is not contemplated in
articulated form with the crime or with the resources of the reference institutions that make the
accompaniment. Also, beyond assessment of the measure as SNL, criticism is made in
So much that there is no very clear frame in this regard, both for not considering the available resources
as not to adapt to the established times or deadlines, especially when established, not as
sanctioning measure but as a condition, as is given in the SCP.
In the assessment of the SNPL, and in tune with the previous point, the one that, although it is the measurement is valued
more suitable for working responsibility content with adolescents, currently not

As for the PSC, it is positively valued as possible symbolic repair of damage, and as
Mechanism of integration into the community, however, the ambiguity it presents is noticed
when you do not have community and institutional resources to carry it out. It is observed that it is
a measure that is currently prescribed within the SCP figure, which also blurs the
content as a sanction since it is established as a condition to comply, to suspend the trial. By

48
of infraction.
Assessment made by institutional actors on inter -institutional communication and networks
One of the points that is presented as one of the limitations for the operation of the model,
It is inter -institutional communication itself and network work. In interviews held with
actors of the referent institutions, as well as the judicial system, opinions are recorded that
They express difficulties at the level of inter -institutional communication that affects their human resources
and technicians, mainly within INAU. In turn, it is identified that limitations in resources
humans and infrastructure influence inter -institutional communication.
Additionally, it is identified that the perceived tensions by the interviewees in the
Inter and intra -institutional communication have an impact on the operation in the network of systems and
services for the offer of proposals for compliance with the SNPL, as well as for the approach to
problems related to specific treatment needs, lack of devices
Health, particularly for the treatment of addictions. At the same time, in the execution of the proposals
existing within the framework of the and PSC, difficulties are recorded in the coordination and insertion of the
adolescents on devices, of the educational, community and health field.
The relationship between the actors of the judicial system and the referent institutions is perceived by
The interviewees as not fluid enough and with low levels of trust. This, in turn,
is crossed by recent changes that are still processed at the regulatory level (new CPP and
creation of the SCP) and in the intervention proposals (such as MSNPL itself).
In short, although there is a global positive assessment in relation to the creation of the model, the actors
institutional account for various limitations both in their design, as well as in its implementation
that are reflected promptly through the perception of their disadvantages, the pro and cons with
relation to the proposal of measures, and aspects related to work teams and communication
Interinstitutional.
Question 7: The SNPLs provided for in the MSNPL apply following the procedures and performing the
recorded records in it?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Percentage of laws of adolescents who comply with SNL
PIEM according to the MSNPL
• Presence of the registration of activities and efforts in the forms established in the MSNPL
• Perception of the implementation of the individual plan suggested in the MSNPL by actor
Finding 7. SNLs do not apply following the procedures and records, detecting to
Through the survey with officials and adolescents, the review of files, and interviews with
qualified informants, that there is discretion at the time of following the planned step by step
For the MSNPL, and that, in addition, there are other variables such as the SCP that crosses its implementation
and correct implementation in terms of sanctions.
Percentage of files of adolescents who comply with SNL
TO PIEM ACCORDING TO THE MSNPL
49
From the survey of files28 it is reaffirmed that professional practice is very diverse according to
work scope and the use of all model forms is not carried out in a way
exhaustive While the form may be present, there is mostly no detailed information that
allow to recognize the process and evolution of adolescents' work, or specific data on
Factors associated with the crime commission. Only in some cases it is and it will be described
In the specific survey section. For example, only in 83.8% of the revised files are
It has the same. This makes it clear that, on the one hand, the
scheduled records, and on the other, the question arises regarding the monitoring of the process,
ignoring if indeed, these interventions have been carried out.
Regarding the process of preparing the PIEM with adolescents and regarding the results of the
Survey answered by 43 officials, in 24 cases there is a joint work between young people
and technicians, in another 15, the elaboration of these objectives has been carried out together only of
partial form, while in 4 four cases the teenager has not been considered directly
Moment to establish them. As in the results of the survey connual with adolescents, the
Technicians survey shows that in all cases the active participation of the young man in
His process, when the model itself explains that adolescent's participation in elaboration
of the individual plan is your right. In short, forms do not make it clear about participation
absolute of adolescents, nor the evolution of their implementation. There is also no clarity regarding
monitoring, being present in the review of files the form that implies its registration, in a
36.5%.
Additionally, in terms of registration in forms, it arises that regarding the individual interview
With the teenager who is the explanation of what the individual plan implies, it is present in a
76.7% of the files relieved, and therefore, as in the case of interventions records
Individuals, quantitative analysis realizes that it is a record that is not used in all
cases, and eventually could also lead to the absence of its initial participation in the
Preparation of the PIEM in some cases. On the other hand, according to the planned procedure, the steps to
continue to imply the technical meeting and subsequently the home visit. In 49.3% of files the
Record of meetings that should be with adolescent participation, does not include their participation.
Also, in 91.7% of the files there is no registration of home visits. The above opens certain
hypothesis that question, on the one hand, the realization of technical procedures that make the
intervention, and on the other, the use of the instruments designed to monitor these
interventions
Regarding the exploration registration29 by areas of the individual plan is found in 35.6% of the

with a forest form to register the Execution Plan of the measure30 (form 6) that in the
survey appears in 72.6% of the files reviewed. Other forms whose presence has been
scarce, are the following: Final evaluation form of compliance with LA (registered in a
6.8%), compliance report (registered at 44.6%).
Presence of the registration of activities and efforts in the forms established in the MSNPL
From the survey with officials arises that 15 technicians express that the registration inherent in the process of
Measurement is made in model protocols, 24 that use forms
included in the model, and also other forms that are not in it, and, finally, 3 use
Only forms that are not those provided in the model and one does not perform any type of registration.
At this point it is evident that, even taking into account that the majority of the participants of
The survey know the model and refer to apply, less than half use only
planned forms (which have also been designed to include all the edges of the process); And little
More than half includes other forms. The severity of the absence of registration and the
limitations that partially apply the protocols provided at the level of technical rigor.
From the field work and documentary information, it was found that all the
documents and forms that constitute the file of sanctioned adolescents are made
manually. At the moment there is no work with a management system that allows to unify,
systematize and analyze administratively and statistically documented information31. Promptly,
Regarding the use of specialized software for the registration of the forms inherent to the

remaining 33 cases, a specific management or software system for registration of the

both the presence and use of specific software allows a record, an organization, a
planning and fundamental monitoring to carry out the evaluation of the process.
Perception of the implementation of the individual plan suggested in the MSNPL by actor
Obstacles inherent to practices prior to the creation of the MSNPL do not disappear with the
PIEM creation, but, in its implementation, the experience so far related by the
(Educational, psychological, social, family).
30 In this sense, the MSNPL contains a section in which the way in which the piem
It must be presented, both in form, and in content.
31 As mentioned, the MSNPL provides for the creation of a system that integrates the data linked to the adolescent
which is fulfilling some SNPL, however, for various inter -institutional reasons, it has not yet been
Specified, which is raised as a challenge for the following stage.
51
qualified informants realizes that discrepancies arise again, but between what was raised
in terms of times in the work and approach processes so that they can be successful and the
Duration in the real time of the sanctions issued by the operators of the Justice System. In this
sense, it is proposed that again the times would not be contemplated, or internal processes of the
adolescent while the duration of the measure should be closely related to the objectives
To be fulfilled.
Everything is planned for knowledge, induction and adaptation in accordance with the context of the
teenager. However, the organizational differences mentioned and the resistances in the registry
of work do not contribute to the unification of the approach that is tried to homogenize with the model, and that
It seeks to recognize the rights and individualities of each adolescent sanctioned.
In addition, it arises from the qualitative analysis of an interview with qualified informants who, in general
realizes some causal factors that, in this first year of implementation, appear as
intervening variables in the execution processes of the MSNPL and the assessment of its effectiveness, which is
precise assess to answer the question of this section. In this way the interviewees
they identify and analyze unexpected effects by the fact that, when the model, it begins to
execute, it is sanctioned from a new CPP, which changes the approach to the sanctioning measures of
teenagers32.
In some cases the tools and protocols of the model are used in a reduced way and more
Synthetic of the Piem ("PIEMCITOS"). In this sense these changes pursue the objective of power
carry out the accompaniment of the few cases of adolescents who are sanctioned with and comply
with the task of working the criminal responsibility, with guidance and support that arises.
Likewise, the need for adaptation is due to the fact that the times determined in the sentences are
Very short to work in all areas proposed by the MSNPL. This accounts for true
mismatch between the norm that establishes the sanction and the expectations for monitoring and
compliance with this.
On the other hand, the changes perceived by the actors from the MSNPL, are crossed by
collateral factors that do not allow to assess whether they are direct effect of the implementation of this by
be affected by factors such as the new CPP that governs almost at the same time as the implementation
of the model. The figure of the SCP avoids precisely the sanction processes, although it does establish
derivations for monitoring by the institutions referring to the fulfillment of SNPL,
which makes the implementation evaluation more complex. This data is very relevant, already
That one of the reasons why the model is not applied is by the SCP, which, since it is not a penalty, the
32 Following the principle of opportunity, the figure of the SCP is established, which implies an agreement between parties with

for the control and monitoring of compliance with these actions that do not classify as a sanction. In this
sense The informants raise the need they had to adapt part of the MSNPL to the circumstances that
They were introduced.
52
Model as such should not be applied.
In sum, it arises from the evidence that the SNLs would not be applied according to the procedures and
records that the model provides, detecting through the different sources already mentioned, that still
With a well explained protocol of the expected procedure, there is still discretion at the moment
of executing the sanctions. This is visualized more clearly, both from the information that
Officials provide through the survey, as of the review of files, and the testimony
of qualified informants.
Question 8: In relation to compliance with the sanction of adolescents, the application of the MSNPL
It fits the axes of responsibility for responsibility, restitution, and qualification provided for in the
same?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Types of educational activities proposed by institutions
• Types of labor offers promoted by institutions
• Number of realized educational and labor offers
• Presence of proposals oriented to responsibility
• Assessment of the compliance process carried out by adolescents
Finding 8. The MSNPL refers to three axes from which interventions with adolescents
They should gravitate, briefly describing what the responsibility, restitution and
qualification as fundamental premises to be carried out from the actions to be executed in the
Measure fulfillment. In general, it is valued that the adjustment is partial, in the case of a
weak point in the execution of the measures, recommending its future review for a comprehensive adjustment
and sustained from activities that account for an orientation supported by the pillars of
intervention. The adjustment is mainly oriented towards the axis of authorization and secondaryly
to restitution, and in general, with certain weaknesses.
Types of educational activities proposed by institutions
Regarding the enable axis33 and in relation to the type of activities proposed by the institutions,
As reported by adolescents in the instance of Focal Group and/or interview, they arise
mainly those that suppose formal education34 and not formal35. In this sense, from the
Qualitative analysis An adjustment to the concrete axis is displayed in terms of what its content foresees, without
However, explicit information is lacking from which adolescents refer to a development of
specific potentialities, capacity for action and discernment that facilitate the resolution of

53
conflicts with responsibility and autonomy. Even so, it should be noted that, in terms of valuation
global of the process of compliance with the measure, it is more favorable in cases where
developed activities meet expectations and respond to their needs and motivations,
But this does not necessarily refer to the development and insertion to which the axis points.
Types of labor offers promoted by institutions
It is not reported that concrete job opportunities have emerged and information with
Relationship to the type of labor offers that could have been promoted on occasion. Considering
That the total population participating in the two instances is most of legal age, it is questioned
to what extent the development of potentials and expected autonomy in this axis is being promoted,
In relation to the objectives that a teenager could consider for the adult world. In
definitive, if the insertion of autonomy will be reflected in the insertion of the young man to the work world,
There would be no total adjustment to the axis.
Number of educational and labor offers specified
In the survey of adolescents, it arises that, at the formal educational level, they study in
Secondary, and training in Puntal Crafts36. On an informal level, they take drawing, ceramic and
Curriculum Vitae. Punctually, in 6 six cases, young people refer only to attend
to the institution within the framework of the performance of monitoring, not having other types of
activities provided for in your plan; and, in 8 eight cases they specify attending non -formal education courses,
five to formal education courses and four to work search. At the quantitative level, through
compliance with the measure, in 13 cases opportunities have been submitted at work and in seven
At the educational level.
Presence of proposals oriented to responsibility
It follows from the focal group and group interview, the lack of approach and intervention in
topics such as the construction of citizenship, autonomy, family reinforcement, anger management,
aggressive behavior, disease, nutrition, role of parents or communication skills,
Sexuality, addiction prevention. In the survey with adolescents it has not been investigated
specifically on the performance of activities oriented to responsibility or restitution
(except those few cases in which they are mentioned that they attend the Piñeyro del Campo hospital), without
however, when analyzing the responses related to the contents of the activities scheduled for the
Compliance with the measures, no indicators arise that account for explicit work from this
axis. On the other hand, the execution of measures such as the provision of community services would be a
clear example of what the axis intends, however, this measure has not been applied in the population
study.
Additionally, the effects of the SCP on the implementation of the MSNPL impact, since, although
It derives to the institutions referring to the territory, they could not work the process of

54
Criminal responsibility, because there is supposed to be no crime37.
On the other hand, it is pointed out that non -deprivation measures for which adolescents are derived from
The devices do not significantly take into account the crime on which they would have to work,
among other things because it is not about the, but of SCP with guidance and support, educational insertion,
labor insertion or service benefits. While it is not a criterion that is repeatedly explained
Among the informants, it arises that, given the repeated infractions or breach of the, some
Judges prefer to offer an alternative measure waiting for the offender to leave the justice system
of teenagers and pass to adults where prescriptive penalties are more severe, being in
Doubt the place occupied by responsibility in these decisions.
As regards restitution38, the MSNPL states that with a view to preventing recidivism, it is
aims to intervene promoting resocialization and reintegration, in order to address those
Personal and social variables that have influenced the appearance of criminal behavior. In this
sense, from the aforementioned sources, if the elaboration of the PIEM is considered as a
Planning that contemplates the demands and criminogenic needs of adolescents
intervened, and that seeks to monitor their social and personal development, it could be concluded that the
Application of the MSNPL, fits the axis.
Assessment of the compliance process carried out by adolescents
As the survey results, although there is no unanimity regarding the positive assessment of
New learning throughout compliance with the measure, or to its usefulness, the large majority
offers favorable feedback, except for three cases that highlight their disagreement in the contributions
of the sanction with respect to his future. The rest considers that you have learned throughout the process and value
These medium -term learning. With these results, the adjustment to the axis of
qualification is partial, to the extent that it would seem that the promotion of educational activities is
present, but there is no consensus regarding the real development of competences that are generated from
the same for social insertion.
In sum, it follows that, although theoretically the MSNPL is built on premises aligned with
what national and international regulations suggest with respect to the purpose of sanctions with
offending adolescents, in their application it still remains to review that the means for these purposes are the
adequate (types of activities and types of sanctions) and that they consolidate over time
(Impact study).
Question 9: What are the factors that affect the fulfillment of the SNPL provided by MSNPL?
37 In practice this means that the sanctions are conditions to be met in the same circumstances of
A sanction.
38 It is defined as action to guarantee the rights of young people from recognition
and execution as ways through which positive prevention is sought to achieve.
55
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Support and accompaniment during compliance with the measure
• Measure characteristics
• Clarity in the procedure
• Human and material resources
• Psychosocial risk factors
• Receptivity
Finding 9. According to the qualitative analysis of interviews with qualified informants, it arises that the
factors that affect the fulfillment of the SNPL are those linked to support and
Accompaniment of affective and institutional references, to the type, duration, content and monitoring
of activities that include the sanction, to the clarity of the information inherent in the step by step of the
process, to existing human and material resources, to the risk factors that are based on
They present in the lives of young people and their receptivity regarding the objectives of the measure.
Support and accompaniment during compliance with the measure
One of the study variables involves the participation of family and affective references during the
process. From all the statements of all the interviewees, the assessment that is
Fundamental support and accompaniment of families to achieve successful results. Without
However, they propose that, in this target population, these supports are scarce.
For informants of the Justice System, it is necessary to have the reference of the family and the
containment of this to facilitate the accompaniment processes. While this is also valued
In the findings referring to the criteria for the determination of private and non -private sanctions, and
It is clarified that this should not be a determining requirement for decision making regarding the type of
sanction, it can be for the fulfillment of the sanction, especially the SNPL. The perception of
Institutional referents is very similar in terms of the importance of achieving agreements with families
in order to facilitate processes39.
There is a great concordance in which, when there are family, friends or community services that
They receive sanctioned adolescents, the chances of success are increased, and that, otherwise,
This would not be possible. The somewhat generalized opinion in this regard is that the involvement of the
family is a great challenge within the process as the problem of the adolescent is
interprets as emerging from these family realities, taking care not to depart from the limits of the
own intervention.
The informants in general account for the complexity of these family configurations from what
39 It is unavoidable to highlight the importance of this dimension in the process, but that the involve does not imply
hold the family responsible for the activities that the adolescent must meet as accused of the facts
criminals that run on their own.
56
which is interpreted that incurring infraction, is often an emerging of those same
complexities However, a very important point to keep in mind is that in the intervention
It is clear that the work of responsible for the crime is with the adolescent and not on the
family.
Measurement characteristics
Another of the variables that, according to the qualitative analysis, crosses compliance with the sanctions, is
links with the characteristics and objectives of its proposals. One of the most important challenges for
The referents in territory is to change the image of the adolescent on the measures of the SNPL and work
about its contents, transcending the idea that "you have to come to sign", in the understanding that
This type of operation has removed value and seriousness to alternatives to deprivation of liberty. This
implies that the proposals for activities enable work on the responsibility of the crime in
a process that requires the involvement of the adolescent, an issue that was mentioned
Previously, it still requires a review, finding weaknesses in relation to the axis of
Responsibility
Institutional referents propose that the proposals of activities40 offered, no
They respond to the demand of adolescents, but they are the ones offered from the networks that are
They establish for the attention of childhood and adolescence, spaces that attend voluntarily.
On the other hand, in some departments (Montevideo excluded) community insertion is prioritized to
through community service as an activity, integration and to work behavior content
At risk, however, he realizes the limitation regarding these spaces in which
the situations that can cause adolescent stigmatization.
Likewise, the offer for formal and non -formal educational insertion would be the proposals with which
The referents tell to carry out. However, he realizes the lack of offers in function
of the vulnerabilities presented by the profile of the adolescent population with which they work, being
that many have been expelled from the formal system, and that not a few of them present difficulties of
Learning and understanding.
Additionally, sometimes from the Court they request that it attend treatment programs that
Most of the time they are not found in territory or quotas are limited as it happens with
Addiction programs, which even when the involved agrees to assist generates frustrations.
In short, there are multiple limitations inherent in the type of activity, to the way in which
40 accompaniment instances in the offices of the reference institution, from interviews with technicians and
educators; Thematic workshops of responsibility, process of social reintegration, self -esteem and autonomy;
derivation to educational, socio -educational training programs; Community service activities for
The reintegration.
In the metropolitan area the referents account for a series of options offered to adolescents
that arise from various agreements with Intendance and Ministries, for training activities for employment,
sports, recreation and various expression workshops, derivation to youth centers with activities
socio -educational.
57
They are managed, to the resources they have and their alignment with the interests and needs of
teenagers
Clarity in the procedure
It is detected that there are aspects inherent in the clarity that the actors have regarding the procedure,
that affect the fulfillment of the sanctions, this being a variable of relevance, given that, in
definitive, it is external to whom he is sanctioned. There is perception by any of the
interviewees that there is confusion in the actors of the justice system around the roles
institutional and the skills in each one, since the interventions that it has are combined
what to do with the appeal for the adolescent what would be in the orbit of INAU and what is a
Judicial measure of SNPL that is governed by the INISA and the Inau-Inisa, Inisa-OSC agreements, in the
Interior of the country41.
In some cases the intervention initiates in fact before a sentence is established, since
The referents of the measures devices are present from the moment of detention,
as guarantors of the process that is being carried out42.
On the other hand, regarding the process of monitoring sanctions as a variable that
It affects said compliance, it is limited to the presentation of reports to the Court by way
administrative, when he requests it or at the request of the territorial reference equipment when there is
breach and it is necessary to reinforce the agreements. All the interviewees of the Justice System
They propose that the way of monitoring is through the written reports that come from
The reference institutions for compliance with the measure43. They also realize that the greatest
part of the time only the process is reviewed when there is breach and a hearing is called to
The enchanted. in which the report would be oral44.
Institutional referents also claim that the main way of monitoring are reports,
Fulfilling the deadlines or for a special order. When breach or non -participation in
The activities are previously warned by the referents, if there is closeness with the court, it is
They contact directly to decide how to proceed.
Among the institutional references, it was possible to investigate the procedures and some activities and
41 This implies another incidence factor in compliance, to the point that a reference states that they have
Courts arrived with sentences without establishing explicit measures or sanction, or that internations are requested
on amparo devices for the fulfillment of the means of the.
42 This is clearly something that is not foreseen in the protocols for the fulfillment of SNPL, but some of
the institutional referents of INAU INTERIOR that had it as a practice previously, they maintain it in spite of
of the recommendation of the model of working from the sanction and not before. These argue that the presence of
Institutional reference changes the treatment of the police towards the adolescent.
43 In some cases the road is email or phone call. As for the periodicity, each one would be
or two months.
44 One of the judges says that this type of instances do not happen frequently, since when there are
Non -compliance in general The offender commits another crime for which he is sanctioned with hospitalization.
58
contents of the reports that mark the measure of compliance and that are linked to
the implementation of the MSNPL and the contingencies of the change of regulations of the last year. First
place, the model raises an administrative term for the first 30 -day report to present the
Agreements established with the adolescent in a PIEM, however, is not a judicial term, by
which would not be control over it. This in turn would be affected because, derived cases
To follow up they are under the SCP cover, so they assume that the agreements were made
previously in the Prosecutor's Office.
An important aspect to highlight from the SNPL compliance process is that the registration of
Action protocols, agreements, evaluations and reports remains in the files or folders, together with the
Copy of the documentation of the processed adolescent, and the judicial edicts of each case. Yes ok
This registration allows to follow individually, the interviewees state that there is no
a systematization of information46 that allows to generate evidence of good practices and
Learning.
The ambiguity that arise in some measures (sanctions or condition of) together with a poor
ability to understand the accused and simplification of these, is presented as an obstacle
For the intervention. This aspect brings again the influence of the SCP on the application of the MSNPL.
As regards other limitations that could affect compliance, when inquiring on the
monitoring with justice system operators The generalized response is that they do not
monitoring, fundamentally because they do not correspond to them, although some refer
to the so -called “execution procedure” in which a hearing is held to “modify, cease or aggravate
measures or when the non -compliance notification comes ’. Among the informants, it is proposed that no
They have evidence on the fulfillment of the processes as they are agreed (except for the reports
that present the referents), nor the resources to do so.
In the conception of monitoring by territorial references, first of all,
establish the criteria to consider that there is or not compliance by distinction between the
that it would be to work criminal responsibility and work the adolescent's responsibility in the
compliance with the infringing process, since the first is assumed once the guilt,
However, in processes suspension agreements there is no sentence in this regard, so
so much what is most worked is on the infringing process and you cannot work on the
Responsibility of the alleged crime.
45 The main content of the court reports refer to the development of the actions aimed at
finding that the adolescent has the documentation up to date in order to ensure their rights
basic in services, and benefits, on the one hand, and on the other information about the spaces and activities of the
that is participating in the framework of the measure. Likewise, the breaches is reported, before which
Some interviewees make the exception that an explicit response is not always obtained from the judicial,
Also limited by the perception of an inadequacy of the model for monitoring SCP measures.
46 The integrated childhood system (SIPI) is used, which is a registration software of the projects of
Inuu childhood, but is not processes monitoring, and they are not very useful for intervention.
59
A significant limitation that generates some tensions in the referents, is the idea that they consider
that would have to be enabled to intervene beyond the measure, since if the adolescent stops
go to the place and only “to sign” or notify that it will not continue to attend, or simply
There is no resources in territory for compliance, all they have left is to close the
File, which apparently closes the case in fact without enabling the actions of the referents.
For these informants the new regulations lead to the referents to have less contact with the
adolescent by removing the socio -educational content of the accompaniment and in addition to not working the
Responsibility, becoming a simple control.
For some territorial referents, another limitation presented is the deadlines that are
establish in some agreements that propose measures that simply could not be met in that
stipulated time and that the programs are evaluated in terms of the term and not of processes or content
referred to infractional responsibility.
Human and material resources
They are detected by the interviewees from the development of the MSNPL other limitations that
They affect compliance with sanctions, such as the inadequacy of territorial resources and
functional both of the institutions referring to compliance with measures, as well as judicial
for lack of judges and prosecutors specialized in the issue of the youth justice system. These difficulties
They also begin to manifest themselves in mismatches in intra -institutional communication, affecting the
Effectiveness of the intervention.
The lack of functional resources is perceived in almost all informants, mainly referring to the
Lack of technical and professional personnel for monitoring and compliance with the measure. Who
They make this approach, they report that the implementation of programs and projects linked to the area
Youth penalty, has not been accompanied by the adaptation of these resources, mainly inside
of the country, since there is no educators and professionals that MSNPL itself requires and foresees
To accompany the process of compliance with the measures and their control.
The lack of professionals is mainly revealed when making the technical reports that
They contribute the monitoring of individual projects, both in the psychological and social area and
Health, presenting in the latter the greatest difficulties. Most of the teams of
Monitoring have technicians linked to the educational area mainly.
The lack of devices in territory is presented as a very important stumbling block for the
Compliance with measures. In this sense, several referents state that they do not have proposals
sufficient concrete for compliance with the SNPL or for the agreements provided in the SCPs.
The consequences are mainly observed by demotivation, and sometimes frustration, which generates
In adolescents in compliance with measure, or given the need for specific treatment, the lack
of health devices and mainly for addictions. The lack of technical resources and proposals
would be crossed by the tensions that the interviewees perceive in the communication
inter -institutional and intra -institutional that hinders the network operation of systems and services
for the attention of this problem.
The lack of specialized judges is something that referents point out quite recurring
institutional, realizing that the rotation of judges, linked to the lack of specialization in the interior
of the country, further complex the search for efficacy in interventions.
60
Psychosocial risk factors
The characteristics of a population of adolescents arriving as an obstacle is consigned as an obstacle
with a particular profile with a great prevalence of risk factors linked to the low educational level and
cognitive, poverty situations, vulnerabilities within the home and, very particularly the
Reference to addiction issues. Informants refer to linked personal situations and conditions
Possible psychological pathologies, descended educational level (as in the family), illiteracy
functional that does not allow you to access other levels of teaching (as part of compliance with
measure), anxiety caused by consumption, and the aforementioned immediacy, which affect the levels of
Understanding the sanction, which leads to not being able to comply with the measure.
Receptivity
The sensations that several of the justice operators perceive are that the teenager presents
with anxiety that is transformed into relief when it is notified that a penalty of deprivation of deprivation does not fall
freedom, generally receptivity to the SNPL. The reaction in general is positive and of
tranquility, although it is also stated that it is not of joy or of great surprise, since, in the
most cases, as established in the category of previous analysis, are suspensions
conditional of the process, which implies previous agreements that already indicate that it would not go to trial or to
deprivation, and would also be without annotations as a history. In villages outside the capital, the
News of not going to a detention center also implies, not to get away from its place of origin.
The operators also perceive indifference in the adolescent's reaction to the news, which
He presumes that they are not clear that it is a sanction despite not being deprivation. This
same allows the informants to trust the real compliance with the measure by
of the accused, or that they consider that it is a simple control mechanism where they will only sign. "
The reason for this type of reaction is awarded, in some cases that they are repeat offenders, but the
most of the time, this simplification is due to other types of deficiencies for which they do not achieve
understand what the sanction is about its low level of understanding, intellectual deficit, associated with
shortcomings at the educational level, illiteracy or because they are not explained well. These expectations
Regarding compliance with the sanction measure, it would be associated with social and family contexts
of the teenager.
Among the institutional references is also perceived a clear reaction of relief and pragmatic
The SNPL, for the mere fact of not falling into deprivation of liberty. This allows these informants to be affirmed
that are with attitudes that are often the product of the naturalization of behavior
criminal, which would lead them to simplify the result of the sentence under having eluded the prison in
Immediate terms.
While the scenario that arises is similar to that observed from justice operators to the
establish the sentence or decision to suspend the process, it changes during processes
of compliance with the measures are of sanction or agreements as the referents write down
institutional in territory about the reaction of adolescents.
First, they account for a certain predisposition and rejection, generated by the non -acceptance of the
measure and resistances to it, on several occasions referring to being innocent ("the fault belongs to another"),
and having drives the crime to safeguard an adult (either by intimidation or bond
affective), presuming that a more severe sanction would fall in case of being charged. In these cases
61
The research team did not find information about how these situations are managed. Get over
These resistance depends on the operator's ability to address the conflict between what was declared
before the prosecutor or judge (as a strategy) and what supposedly comes to work in the institution of
compliance with the criminal responsibility associated with the sanction. In the case of this type SCP
of situations could be seen increased because the operator's task is also more control
of an agreement and unwill, to address the crime.
In the perceptions and some findings made by the references interviewees, they propose that
These reactions occur during the intervention process in which compliance levels are
They are making it difficult. In many cases this is due to the fact that the naturalization of criminal behavior in
Special in repeat offenders turns out as "shell to survive."
Anyway, it is also noted that some adolescents during the intervention process
They are falling into account from the demands of the practice that implies having several interviews
with different technicians (and "do not understand why so many interviews"). In this sense it is raised
that, also depending on the educational level and family and community support, it is possible to establish
Processes for compliance with the measure.
The positive reaction of adolescents to the SNPL is mainly from having avoided processes
or sanctions that consider more burvas. The informants agree that there is some naturalization
of the criminal behavior that causes indifference to the extent, which translates into rejection in the
Moment of entering the process of compliance with the measure. This also causes feeling,
both in judicial operators and in institutional references, that the expectations of
compliance are very low.
In sum, extremely rich information regarding the assessment and perception follows from the analysis
of the different actors about the variables that, in one way or another, from their experience,
they affect the fulfillment of the SNPL and that deserve in future studies, a greater deepening
considering that these are factors that can be both risk and protection for the
adolescent, regarding recidivism, rehabilitation, reintegration, etc.
7.3 Sustainability
To evaluate sustainability, the evaluation considered the articulation between executing institutions
of the model, the availability of resources (both human and financial) and the existing strategies
To hold over time.
Question 10. How are the MSNPL executing institutions articulated?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Existence of inter -institutional work table or group
• Number of monthly table meetings or working group
• Existence of inter -institutional agreements
Find 10. UNICEF works by promoting and articulating an exchange space where it is summoned to
the different institutions in order to share experiences, agree approaches and agreements and unify
criteria. In this inter -institutional table all organizations converge and references
They are summoned to work within the framework of the model and non -private sanctions and usually meet
62
monthly with at least one representative by institution part. Additionally, there are different
agreements between the entity responsible for executing the SNPL and OSC, INAU and other institutions that
promote territorial distribution, although difficulties are still observed when covering everything
The territory.
Existence of inter -institutional work table or group, and
Number of monthly table meetings or working group
The participation of the different acting institutions in the MSNPL is highlighted to each call that
It promotes UNICEF47, being, ultimately, an inter -institutional exchange space. Of these
spaces arises an articulation from which recommendations formalized by UNICEF and
Transferred to the Judiciary, Prosecutor's Office, Inisa and INAU. From that call the table was formed
of inter -institutional work48, one of the ways through which institutions articulate
MSNPL Executors, where they intend to work towards the design of a sanctions model
Private. Even so, this is only a starting point to continue working, to the extent
that, in these exchanges, the need to deepen the agreements and relationships is perceived
Among the institutions part.
Meanwhile, the inter -institutional table has monthly meetings or according to what the demand establishes,
Meanwhile UNICEF articulates internal work with the important role of secretariat, and each
Institutional representative assumes the commitment to disseminate among the other officials of their
Organization and corresponding personnel addressed in said instances.
Existence of inter -institutional agreements
Inisa, through its program of Community Socio -Educational Measures (Promsec), is the entity
responsible for guaranteeing the execution of the SNPL, however, it does not have infrastructure capacity,
nor technique to act throughout the national territory, which is why some are carried out
Agreements to comply with the established49.
47 UNICEF's participation in this model creation process is key to detecting flaws in the
Youth justice system, promote and articulate meetings, favoring instances of exchange between
local and regional institutions.
48 In addition to the institutions of the Justice System as the Prosecutor's Office and Judicial Branch, the table is constituted with
Representatives of Inisa, INAU, civil organizations that participate in the execution of non -private sanctions
of freedom for adolescents. At the beginning, the Child's Inter -American Institute also participated, although with
Sporadic presence at meetings, his intervention had the purpose of recognizing the Uruguayan experience,
But his assistance did not continue in time. This table is led by UNICEF and office representatives
In Uruguay they are the ones who, since 2017, are promoted, convening and energizing the same urging institutions
that designate a representative person. There are recognized the institutional differences that try to clarify
and UNICEF assumes an animator and strengthening role, generating a qualitative and consensual diagnosis, together with a
Implementation plan with commitments of all institutions.
49 It should be clarified that there are various types of agreements, which are properly carried out to execute and guarantee
compliance with the sanction or measure arranged by the justice system and others that are part of the
63
Inisa works through promise in the capital of the country, with the support of other organizations
with whom intervention projects have agreed and complements the work with some organizations
of civil society that support that function since the state apparatus cannot respond to all
needs and demands. For Montevideo and surrounding departments, are the movement
National Gustavo Volpe, Popular Education Center Foundation - Option Program, Renace Project
and a fourth agreement with an OSC of the north of the country; Miguel Magone Project - Don Bosco work
Leap. Also, for the fulfillment and execution of non -deprivation of liberty sanctions for
teenagers in Uruguay in addition to existing the aforementioned agreements with the Inisa, there is one between
The Inisa and INAU50, two public bodies. Since the Inisa cannot at the moment, cover all
Interventions with teenagers throughout the country, an agreement has also been made with INAU
To guarantee compliance with the measures, in the departments that the INISA is not present,
No agreement with OSC.
In addition to the 5 agreements mentioned, various actions are coordinated with other institutions51 with
The purpose of improving execution52 of the resolutions of the justice system.
Meanwhile, for health treatments, from dental to mental health, benefits are used
of the State, unless the adolescent has access to other health services, where it is prioritized
His. In turn, cases that require specialized care for issues related to consumption
Problem of Narcotics There are inter -institutional work fundamentally with two
providers; The yellow portal and citadel.
In summary, to approach the model, there are multiple agreements that point their work from
and to different areas. However, elements that hinder the correct execution of the
framework of the demands of adolescents and measures themselves.
50 The case of the Inisa-in-Nau Agreement is quite complex since INAU does not have in its institutional objectives
The guarantee of compliance with the SNPL of adolescents. In fact, at the time of survey the personnel
Technician belonging to INAU in addition to working with offenders also works on others
projects inherent to the institutional mission and sometimes manifest as priorities.
51 According to survey and interviews with qualified personnel from Inisa, these institutions are: Judicial Branch
(Courts of adolescents, criminal and family and defender of adolescents) General Prosecutor of the Nation,
UNICEF, Inter -American Institute of the Child, Ministry of Public Health - Administration of Health Services of the
State, Ministry of Social Development - National Disability Program- National Center for Technical Aid
and technological -National Youth Institute, Telefónica Movistar (Entrender Program), Food Network
Shared, INJU (area in conflict with the law), social forecasting bank, municipal intentions and board
Departmental of Montevideo, Public Employment Center, Training Center, National Administration of
Public Education, Spanish Villa Centro Centro, Barrio Nuevo Peñarol, OSC Vida and Education, Hospital
GERIATRIC Dr. Luis Piñeyro del Camp
Psychology, and Social Educators Training Institute.
52 In that sense, from interviews with institutional references arises that much of the proposals of
interventions available to agree with adolescents in compliance with their sanction, derive from
thematic workshops, socio -educational programs, social and labor reintegration, from agreements with agreements with
Intendencies, Ministry, Interinstitutional Network Labor related to Organizations Offers
belonging to non -formal education.
64
measures. While 96% of the country is urban and Montevideo has more than half of the total population,
Programs and treatments offers usually concentrate on the capital, leaving aside the
demands of the other adolescents from the rest of the country.
Question 11: Do the MSNPL executing institutions ensure the suggested human resources in the
same to apply it?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Number of officials or technicians who work in the execution of SNPL per institution and
department
• Type of employment contract of officials or technicians working on the execution of SNPL
• Assessment of the necessary competitions
• Presence of personnel self -care instances
Finding 11. The designation of human resources does not correspond to the suggested in the MSNPL,
emerging from the analysis that there are hired technicians for the task, but they are not the ones that the model foreseen
Regarding the formation of interdisciplinary equipment, nor in quantity, nor are they necessarily
hired exclusively for the objectives of the model.
Number of officials or technicians who work in the execution of the SNPL per institution and
department
According to the information provided by the institutional references and departmental addresses, to the
Moment of field work were 8753 technicians working directly with teenagers in
Compliance with SNPL at the national level, of which its email was facilitated to send
The survey. The distribution by departments of the total number of officials is as follows:
53 It is remembered that the four technicians that make up the San José team, also work on the team of
Montevideo and that is why the survey is sent to 87 people.
65
Table 7: Department technicians distribution
Source: Own elaboration based on field survey.
Regarding the previous figures, it should be noted that although at the national level, there are technicians assigned to
The direct work in the execution of SNPL, in some departments there are only one or two
Officials. The model refers to the condition that the technical teams that work with SNL,
Minimally they must have professionals of psychology, education, law and social work, ‘’ in
sufficient number ’’ according to the demands of the service.
On the one hand, the Inisa has promise with a team consisting of an educator, a psychologist,
a social worker, three teachers and an advanced social work student for care
of all teenagers in Montevideo SNL measures.
On the other, INAU, in agreement with the Inisa, presents teams made up of educators, and teachers,
And in some case attorney, for the specific program of non -private measures, and professionals
which are INAU technical staff who collaborate promptly with the evaluations and some
follow -up. So we can establish that in the departments selected for the
Evaluation We find the following situation: a team is formed by two educators,
one of them teacher and an attorney, with the subsidy of psychologists for evaluations; In another, they would be
an teacher and an administrative, plus a temporarily assigned educator, who would also count
with the punctual support of professionals in subsidy; There is a situation in which it is not very clear
who make up the fixed team but would initially be present a coordinator, teacher, a
educator, a workshop, and currently a psychologist and social worker; another is formed by a
educator, a teacher, psychologist and to a lesser extent social worker; in another case for a
Coordinator who is a attorney, two educators, a teacher and another social worker, psychologist and
Social worker with a few hours. The information we have from the other departments arises from
which offers the directors who coordinate the INAU-INISA Agreement and state that the conformation
of teams is similar as two or three people as relatively fixed educators and
66
professionals in the subsidy of evaluations that are not exclusive to the program.
The OSCs in agreement with the INISA, have teams made up of: a psychologist coordinator,
two educators with experience in work with adolescents and in non -private measures, a
social worker, a psychologist, an administrative and an accountant who is not part of the team as
such; In another are two educators, a social worker and a psychologist and an administrative, who would pass
to the role of educator; In another case, the team is formed with a coordinator, a last student
year of anthropology, two educators, students of the last year of social work, a lawyer who does not
It is fixed; In a last case, no information was received.
Type of employment contract of officials or technicians working on the execution of SNPL
The survey of officials collects information about the contracting modality and
work hours, points that the model enunciates and stands out as long as it determines a ratio of young people by
professional, emphasizes the presence of stable working conditions together with a time load
prudent, guaranteeing the operation of the institution. In relation to the adjustment of resources
humans and logistics regarding what the model states, most respondents work
In the institution for approximately between 2 and 5 years, they have a contract and fixed time,
as well as two days of weekly rest. Forty of the participants said they have a
Fixed contract and three had a term contract; At the same time, 29 said they have a schedule
Fixed, and 14 worked at rotating schedules. The amount of hours per week is between 5 and 40, being
The 30 hours, the most frequent response.
At present there is also a priority person assigned, but not necessarily exclusive to
Inisa's agreement with Inisa, that is, professional technical staff is shared with
other INAU programs, which often express other priorities, when the
intervention in a timely manner.
In the case of the OSC, they maintain an agreement with Inisa that pays a fiction for the attention of 10
teenagers, and then an amount for each of the teenagers who is treated that exceeds that
amount. They have exclusive personnel for their project, provided for in the same agreement, although
Some of the team members are part of other projects of this OSC54. Consider that
There is an inadequacy of the economic resources assigned in relation to those provided in the
Model, since it is not possible to cover all the resources of technical personnel required by the
same. This is why these teams are currently also a restriction in the
attention since they cannot hire technicians or have to reduce the number of hours of these. To the
54 also have a local and administrative equipment of the project of measures not
Private. The difficulties raised by these informants have to do mainly with aspects of the
Budget provided for in agreements that not only limits the quality of the service but also coverage,
especially in the departments with several locations (which are all inside). These organizations
Infrastructure resources give off these agreements, as is, in most cases, rent of
Local and administrative technical equipment, although some of the OSCs share resources with other projects
of this.
67
Like others interviewed, they do not attribute the problem to the design of the model but to resources
(in this case financial) assigned for implementation. Staff dedication would be seen
also affected in these cases also by the amplitude of territory coverage that implies a large amount
of hours of transfer of the referents and their implication regarding the time of remuneration of these.
The institutional references are the ones that mostly pose what the resources would be within the
territory based on the needs that are raised. We give how to know that the main
Functional resource is the accompaniment offered to adolescents from the teams themselves
technicians through their references that are with those who should develop the individual plan for the
compliance with the measure. These resources would exist, although quite bounded by issues
related to budget resources.
While it is a recurring theme of our analysis in all types of informants, the difficulty appears
raised by the lack of specialized courts and justice personnel specialized in justice
Youth, as a key functional resource for the development of any intervention in this regard55.
Assessment of the necessary competitions of the equipment
Of the interviews carried out could be investigated on the one hand what could be the "duty" on the
conformation and competitions of the teams, which is expressed in the opinions of the system actors
of justice, and on the other, their real conformation from the information of the referents
institutional, which, in addition to knowing the demands of the MSNPL, are the ones who integrate these teams,
as mentioned above in the section.
Starting from the responses that arise from the justice system actors we find that
His statements are not based so much on the model itself, but on the expectations that are regarding
to the necessary competences of those who would be in charge of accompanying the monitoring of the measures
SNPL. In this way it deduces the type of professionals that would form the teams. The vast majority
of informants state that they must be professionals or technicians in the area of psychology, the
Education, social work and law. They also refer to fundamental competences to
develop as are the capacity for empathy, opening to the complex, capacity for treatment
of problems linked to the maturation process of young people, as well as family approach and
the management of the legal56. Some propose specific abilities for addiction treatment and
of mental health.
Regarding the operation of the teams, the justice system actors value as important
55 In this sense, the lack of communication between the
judicial system and reference institutions, due to the lack of trust and the perception of discretion to the
time to dispose deepened measures in the controversy raised to the model with the SCPs and the Royals
Monitoring possibilities, something that is also recurring in the finding analysis.
56 While there is a great coincidence with the areas proposed by the MSNPL, these statements are based, on
Some cases, because they know team members directly, or product of the reports that
They present, highlighting that it is an associated vocational availability their training.
68
that each teenager has a reference educator with whom he generates an empathetic bond and
The incorporation of technical evaluations as required by each case according to what it is
of a non -private measure to work as a team.
Presence of personnel self -care instances
Regarding the self -care mechanisms that the MSNPL foresees, 29 technicians report that they have not
Performing instances of self -care of any kind, and 31 argue that the institution or facilitates, or
Manage this type of spaces. This lack is enhanced to the extent that a large part of the population
participant, nor do group supervisions, implying this that the professional works
mostly on your own.
In sum, it follows from the findings, that institutions do not ensure all human resources
that the model suggests, visualizing multiple weaknesses in the formation of the equipment, which.
On the one hand, they do not necessarily have the number of necessary technicians, or with training
and/or intended specialization. On the other hand, in some cases its availability is at the mercy of the
demands from other institutions. While from the survey with officials, there is a
Technical presence of the participants that covers the entire country, in certain departments it is
Insufficient, this is possibly linked to the low application of the SNPLs provided for in the MSNPL.
In this sense, questions arise regarding the sustainability of the model.
Question 12. Do MSNPL executing institutions ensure financial resources to apply it?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicator:
• Amount of financial resources assigned to the fulfillment of the MSNPL
Finding 12. In Uruguay there are various institutions involved in the execution of sanctions not
deprivative of liberty of adolescents which makes it difficult to access the total amount of resources
Financials assigned to compliance with the MSNPL. By law, Inisa is the only public institution in
receive a budget for the fulfillment of these interventions. Inisa does not have infrastructure
adequate, nor the technical capacity suggested in the model to perform nationwide, so
which from this institution generated agreements with civil society organizations. The INAU
(state and own budget) also collaborates in said execution in some departments of the
country.
Amount of financial resources assigned to the fulfillment of the MSNPL
Without further details inherent to real budget at stake, the distribution of resources is
It presents as difficulty in the execution of the model and the non -private sanctions. So it is so that
Interviewees of the judicial system coincide in the existence of a certain inadequacy of resources
assigned.
It was not possible to access the budget or expenses of the programs that allow you to account
of the total distribution of resources between the different care devices throughout the territory
national. Regarding budgetary resources, institutional referents linked to Inisa
Assignment account of own resources with exclusive personnel of the measures program
Community socio -educational (promisec), which has premises and technological equipment and
office, making visible the inadequacy and lack of update of these, associated with the demands of
Registration that arises in the MSNPL. Faced with this, there are no references in the interview with the aspects
69
of budget allocation, but in relation to the work teams that are made up of
officials and technical staff of the institution itself.
As against it, a report from the Planning and Budget Department of
Inisa where they make an approach to what the budget means. From there arises that
INISA budget is concentrated within a single budget program (461 -
Management of deprivation of liberty). This implies that planning is established through objects
generic that are distributed according to the needs of each of the areas in matters
referred to the operation of services (office materials, cleaning, security, among others),
being reviewed periodically if you are necessary adjustments. The objective expense for
compliance with non -deprivation of liberty, measurable at the time of survey, passes
mainly for salaries and agreements, the rest of the aspects can be analyzed and calculated
based on the use of goods and services only at approximate levels.
Table 8: Budget in 2019 (Uruguayan pesos)
Concept amount % of the total
Salaries 32,357,624 57%
(includes basic salary, bonuses, presentism and
employer contributions)
Transport 912,000 2%
(Tickets)
Office Materials/Workshops 600,000 1 %
Agreements 22,124,976 39%
(OSC that attend SNPL)
CLEANING/SECURITY 400,000 1%
Total 56,394,600
Of the 2019 Budget, it follows that the total credit assigned for the object of spending
"Benefits for agreements, assisted and monitored freedom" is used to promise 49% of the total, in
both of the total assigned for salaries that value is close to 2%.
On the other hand, an element to consider is that INAU has an important role in the execution of SNPL
and the intervention model in the rest of the country, since the INISA executes in Montevideo, assuming the
associated costs and dedicating public resources, without this representing an additional cost for the
Inisa
In sum, Uruguay's budget against non -deprivation of liberty is complex of
recognize because these until a few years ago depended on another state agency, different from the
current. After the Inisa became a reference in the execution of these measures, only in 2019 the
Budget management falls on the institute directly. Despite this and the Inisa agreements
With OSC, the participation of the previous reference, the INAU and with its own
70
budget. The INAU budget could not be accessed since there is no specific item for
This area.
Question 13: What strategies have been implemented so that the MSNPL is sustained over time?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicator:
• Presence of an inter -institutional field of law and promotion
Finding 13. Elements such as effort for alignment of the MSNPL with the regulations arise
national and international, the search for the general improvement of system operation, and the bet
for inter -institutional work from unified criteria, which involve necessary strategies for
of sustainability. However, there is still no clarity regarding sufficient implementation and/or
adequate strategies that promote the correct execution of the MSNPL, its dissemination, as well as the
Assignment of necessary resources.
Given the diversity of institutional positions, in the instances of exchange and consensus it was configured
a model implementation plan that delineates institutional commitments in accordance with the role
of each one. In this sense, an effort is valued for the promotion of alliances and agreements
institutional, as well as the creation of a model that aligns with national regulations and
International and that, in short, it is committed to a general improvement in the operation of the system. Without
However, the need for continuity of work is also observed when improving the
ties and inter -institutional coordination. For example; The qualified informants said that the
Judicial Power was first to make a series of formations to the judges and others
actors, the diffusion strategy. However, the questioning of them arises regarding itself
Indeed all the institutions involved fulfilled their part in this process of
construction and implementation, meanwhile, for example, not all members of these know the
objective of the model, nor the procedures inherent to it.
The proper dissemination, as well as the constancy in the update in training, as types of strategy
They suppose a key piece, which, among other things, promote the search for persuasion to the system
of adolescent justice on alternatives in sentences and differences and implications between
non -private sanctions and deprivation of liberty and confinement in the Inisa. However, field work
There is still a lack of clarity in relation to concrete strategies in these areas, which have been
launched to grant sustainability to the model.
The interviewed technicians share that the fact of calling the institutions and sharing the
Work process forms a more legitimate participatory model, with built guidelines and practices
collectively. The dimension of the participation of institutions at work grants legitimacy to the
Model, tool appropriation and commitment to its implementation. Also, another of the
elements that give sustainability to the model has to do with the trajectory of organizations that
They approach the theme; On the one hand, the political asepsis of the Judiciary and Prosecutor's Office and for another
work of civil society organizations.
After this evaluation, it is considered that, within the edges to take into account for the
strategies inherent to the sustainability of the model, the problematization of how
The SCPs will address in the future, not currently a clear strategy for the future of the MSNPL.
As for the institutional references, they also corroborate that it is a practice that
It is displacing the SNPL in the same sense raised by the informants of the justice system.
71
In any case, the assessment varies in that, on several occasions, also the control of
Compliance with these conditions is commissioned to the territorial devices to which they belong
These informants, being most of the cases they attend. This also begins to raise the
controversy on whether this figure can be included within the approach of a monitoring model of
SNPL, presenting itself as an obstacle to it, since what is requested to the referents is to perform
Compliance control tasks.
Additionally, it is a challenge linked to sustainability, the review of the types of resources
human and financial granted that are evidenced in the limitations raised from the different
Sources participating in the methodology of this work. This refers not only to the
conformation of teams that work directly with adolescents in compliance
of SNPL and its work spaces, but to the high rotation and lack of specialization of judicial personnel
fundamentally outside the capital of the country. These situations affect the continuity of
processes and in the correct implementation of these.
Finally, other intrinsic deficiencies arise to the youth justice system that are not new,
that generate an antecedent and that hinder the tuning of new procedures and
Work protocols, not guaranteeing in this regard, the effective implementation of the changes that
They are intended.
7.4 Gender and Human Rights
To evaluate the application of the gender and human rights approach, the evaluation considered whether the
Design adjusts to international regulations and if these approaches are being applied in the
model implementation.
Question 14: Does the MSNPL design conform to international regulations with gender approaches,
equity and human rights?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicator:
• Number of specific regulations and guidelines with gender, equity and human rights approach
Finding 14. The MSNPL design conforms to international regulations that refers to human rights
and from which the equity approach also follows. The one of
gender, being an approach that is not addressed with depth or explicitly in the model.
Number of specific regulations and guidelines with gender, equity and human rights approach
One of the three approaches to the model, is that of rights, which implies, on the one hand, that the
standards of international regulations, and on the other, which from its own design seeks to guarantee
Rights of adolescents in conflict with the law.
The international regulations on which the model is built and sustained explicitly
They contain fundamentally human rights and equity approaches:
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN, 1989): From the recognition of the Universal Declaration
United Nations Human Rights, highlights respect for the rights stated, without
Distinction of race, color, sex, religion, language, ethnic, social or national origin, economic position,
birth, physical impediments or any other condition, both of the child, as well as their
legal representatives.
72
• Beijing rules (UN, 1985): they refer to their application without distinction of sex, race, color,
religion, language, social or national origin, political opinion, with impartiality and without any kind
of distinction. Appeals that the application of justice in the field of minors is in order to
promote the well -being of these, without infringing their fundamental rights from a
administration that is humanitarian, fair and effective, respecting the presumption of innocence, and
other basic procedural guarantees, seeking to prevent its application of contradicting with
Instruments and regulations related to human rights.
• Riad Rules (UN, 1990a): Promote the inclusion of policies and measures contemplated by the
Rights, protection, interests and well -being of young people, being its application
Framed in the DDHH Declaration, Convention on the Rights of the Child, Beijing Rules,
among others.
• Tokyo rules (UN, 1990b): they also refer to their application without breed distinctions,
sex, color, language, social or national origin, political opinion or any other type and their
articulation with other regulations such as Beijing rules, not being able to
interpreted excluding instruments that address human rights at the level
international.
Despite this, the model does not specify the gender perspective, and in fact, it does not refer
Within its legal framework explicitly to the Bangkok rules (UN, 2010), which precisely
They cover issues inherent to women's treatment, both in private sanctions, and not
deprivative of liberty. Just these rules mention several aspects of interest:
1) While the minimum rules for the treatment of inmates (UN, 1955, 2015) apply to all
And all without discrimination and contemplate the special needs of each person, including the
women,
2) considering that they have been approved in 1955 -and it is not until 2015 that a
Review/updating of them-, arises the need to contemplate these needs with another
emphasis,
3) both in adult women, as adolescents who are fulfilling private sanctions and
Not deprivation of liberty, and from this need, its creation arises. In this sense, it is missing
In the design of the model, a greater emphasis on the intervention approach from a gender approach.
Question 15. Are gender, equity and human rights approaches to the
MSNPL implementation?
The answer to this question is based on the following indicators:
• Existence of accessible spaces by department
• Existence of spaces for individual interviews
• level of treatment and recognition of the human rights of the actors or technicians who execute the
SNPL to adolescents
• Access to basic documentation processing
• Degree of recognition of activities outside the SNLK that the adolescent performs
Finding 15. In the implementation of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions
73
For teenagers in Uruguay, practices that make the recognition of different
human rights of this population as rights to education, participation, identity, good
Treatment, privacy, fair penalties and protection against discrimination, among others. However, I don't know
finds in practice a guideline of human rights actions, no equity, or
gender. In turn, it happens that the population of women fulfilling this type of measures is very small
and it was not possible to recognize a differential approach to sex.
Existence of accessible spaces by department
One of the relevant issues at the time of interventions with various populations and families is
Consider its different realities. Among them to recognize the differences, difficulties and disabilities
since the absence of adequate infrastructure puts in check and violates the rights of whom
It has some type of disability. In this case it was intended to recognize whether there were accessible spaces, which
Not only are they enabled and facilitated displacement of people with disabilities, but also for example
to a pregnant teenager or adult or with a baby in charge. Of interviews with referents do not
They detected or recognized accessible spaces.
On the other hand, in the Survey of officials he asked about this and 43 responses, only 13 pointed out
that their work spaces had spaces with accessibility, while 30 said they did not count or
ignore.
In turn, when it was consulted if these bathrooms were hygienized daily, 34 officials
They responded favorably and 9 said that although they had bathrooms for common use they did not lived
every day. However, of the 43 respondents, 41 claimed to have cleaning products if
You need to maintain the correct space hygiene.
Existence of spaces for individual interviews
Another considerations in human rights issues has to do with the right to privacy
of the people and recognitions of their individuality, so it is important that both the technicians
Like teenagers who meet SNLP they can count on spaces for interviews or meetings
individual and private.
Continuing with the above, of the total of the technicians surveyed, thirty -seven refer to having
spaces for interviewing adolescents and/or their families individually/privately, while
Six cases say they do not count on it. At the infrastructure level, the model includes that they exist
Spaces for carrying out income activities, individualized and collective attention, offices
For professionals, meetings and health rooms. All of these respondents allude to the
presence of heated spaces. Then, in relation to the realization of interviews
initial individual stipulated by the model prior to the beginning of the execution of the measure, fourteen
teenagers said they had an interview in the institution in which he had to meet it, while
that the rest declare not to have had it or not to remember it.
On the other hand, regarding the spaces for collective activities linked to the right to
adolescents participation, in 29 cases the presence of a space for them is relieved, others (15),
They state that they do not have adequate infrastructure or do not perform group interventions.
Level of treatment and recognition of the human rights of the actors or technicians who execute
SNPL to adolescents
74
From the survey of technical staff and references interviews, the vocation of
service and interest in the activity carried out by officials as an element to recognize
His position against the role played. They perceive the importance of their work, contributing to
Strengthening links, social reintegration, responsibility and recognition of rights and
duties by adolescents, which consists of what adolescents generally declare
in the interviews and group instances, about their good relationship and link with the officials-
technicians In the adolescents survey, 100% claim to have a good or very good relationship with their
referring educator, which reinforces the perspective of the model of respecting the interests of the
teenagers. For informants it is essential that the accused is well informed of the
non -deprivation of liberty that must be fulfilled and of the process, valuing the importance of
first contact with the teenager, and promote a bond of trust and empathy, in order to
get the agreements and commitments of the intervention based on an individual project, as is what
Suggest the MSNPL.
At no time do adolescents mention discriminated or stigmatized by
The referral officials of the center in charge of managing the SNPL (educators, psychologists,
social workers), nor for the references of the institutions that receive adolescents in the
Compliance with the measure (Lyceum or pedagogical areas). In turn, teenagers refer to having
received information inherent in compliance with the sanction, its implications and utility and 100% of
The young people consulted know the name and identify their technical referent, manifesting at the same time
Maintain a good relationship with these. In this sense, the proper implementation of the
Model regarding the initial interview planned in the initial care stage that arises in the protocol
and especially regarding the establishment of a bond of trust and respect with the referent.
In accordance with the relevance in the full design and guarantee of rights it is claimed that the forms
They are consistently integrated and inquire about aspects of adolescents' rights.
However, approach areas with gender, equity and inclusion perspectives are not recognized.
Basic documentation process access
Also within human rights is the right to the identity of the person. In that
there are actions that are directed to review that the adolescent has all the documentation of
identification and health certificates, and if they do not have them in order, they are processed with the purpose of
Restore adolescent rights based on accessing public benefits and services, between
others.
To recognize whether technicians take into account the lack of documents, which is vulnerable
For many, he asked in the survey of adolescents if in case he did not have any
Identity or basic documentation to access benefits, they had been assisted to process it.
Of the total adolescents who agreed to respond to the survey, 90% said they have a card of
identity at the time of survey and 79% said they have a physical aptitude or card of
health. While it is true that the vast majority had a current card when asked, 53% declared
that possesses it for the help of referent technicians or educators, which in this case leads to assess
positively the technical approach.
Degree of recognition of activities outside the SNLK that the adolescent performs
75
Within the rights of adolescents to education, personality development, participation
and be in community it was identified that, if the activities carried out within the framework of the measure
They meet expectations and respond to the needs and motivations of adolescents, the
Assessment on it is more favorable than those cases in which not. In fact, 74% of
adolescents surveyed responded to agreed and agreed that the tasks that
They fulfill them is useful in their personal life and the same percentage considers to learn new things inside
of the activities of the measures.
In that sense and reinforcing the perspective of the model of respecting the interests of adolescents,
These highlight as positive the consideration of these, 95% pointed out that their interests were
considered when planning the actions.
Also, at the time of knowing if adolescents carried out other activities at the time of
begin with the non -private measure and if they had to abandon them; 42% responded
To perform sports, music or other recreational compared to 58% who declared not doing any of that. To his
time 42.1% attend formal (secondary) education and 57.9% do not attend an educational institution
of the formal system.
Faced with this reality, only a teenager abandoned some activity to meet the SNL.
This can be considered beneficial for young people in terms of recognition of their integrity
psychosocial and value as good the degree of contemplation to your life outside the SNL
The teenager.
In sum, so far in the implementation of the MSNPL, actions that lead to the
Recognition of the elementary human rights of adolescents. It is true that they exist
shortcomings and difficulties for the proper execution of the measures in some departments of the country,
Because, just as in Montevideo it is where more population resides is where it is concentrated
The greatest infrastructure with response capacity. Anyway, in the different departments
The rest of the country is generally recognized vocation of service and good disposition to work and good
I deal with teenagers who meet alternative measures to deprivation of liberty. In that sense,
The teenagers them positively recognize the treatment and approach of the technicians involved in
the execution of the measures.
8. Conclusions
The following sections detail the conclusions about the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of the
Intervention Model (MSNPL).
8.1 relevance
Conclusion 1 (Based on finding 1): The creation of the Intervention Model for Implementation
of non -deprivation of liberty measures was necessary in order to unify approach criteria, where
guarantee and recognize the rights of children and adolescents in a situation of conflict with the
Criminal Law.
Despite the detection of differences in technical approaches according to the institution and
Organization involved, the positive assessment that adolescents perform on
the same and the fact that their interests are considered when defining the actions of the
plan. It is relevant and of order that the proposals for action respond to the needs of these
76
adolescents in order to contribute positively to their self -esteem, competencies and life skills
In society. In that sense, the model are linked to the adolescents' life project
sanctioned, aims to contribute to the homogenization and improvement of interventions, in
particular with the elaboration of the individual measure of execution of the measure. Creation e
Implementation of this type of instrument is fundamental in Uruguay, where many organisms
or public institutions usually lack information structuring and work processes. By
Ende, the model provides political guarantees and techniques of approach to follow, plausible to
monitoring and systematization.
Conclusion 2 (based on items of findings 2, 3 and 4): the design and adequate applicability of the MSNPL
It necessarily assumes, in addition to the building and technical infrastructure, a reference framework
International and national regulatory that advocates the rights of children and adolescents who are
found in contexts of compliance with private and non -deprivation of liberty sanctions. Between
They are the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the rules of Beijing, Riad, Tokyo and how
National Regulations The Code of Children and Adolescents. Under this reality, it emphasizes the
Importance of incorporating regulations or guidelines that particularly recognize specificities
According to gender, ethnicities, among other characteristics. In turn, there are structural differences between
Montevideo and the rest of the country, being in the capital where more technical are concentrated, with greater
Training, better conditions and spaces for the execution of the measures.
Conclusion 3 (based on finding 3): of documentary exploration and after its triangulation with the
Information that emerges from interviews with qualified informants, ambiguity was detected
in the conceptualization of non -deprivation of liberty sanctions that the CNA provides. Such ambiguity,
It would seem to favor discretion so far detected in the execution of the measures.
This reinforces the relevance of a model that homogrates criteria according to the work and intervention that
correspond.
8.2 Efficacy
Conclusion 4 (based on finding items 5): in the efforts for the guarantee law
of the rights of girls, boys and adolescents, together with the recognition of the importance of decline
of the high prison rates in Uruguay, UNICEF focuses on inter -institutional level to
through the work table and various instances of exchange. Said work and prioritization of the
theme is visualized in the evaluation, where most of the technical staff recognize the model and
Use with him or adolescent as a guide tool for the implementation of non -private sanction.
However, those who recognize it more frequently are technical, officials in general and
institutional references that have participated or have a link close to members of the table of
Inter -institutional work led by UNICEF. It is essential that, for its proper execution,
All institutional actors recognize the MSNPL.
Conclusion 5 (based on items of findings 6): The various institutional actors expressed
that prior to the model there was the need for a guide for professional practice on the
Implementation of non -private liberty sanctions for adolescents in Uruguay. This demand
It arises for different reasons, some of them are: discrepancies between justice staff, approaches
or unequal working methodologies between OSC, INAU and INISA, communications interference between
77
Partial institutions, urgent language common and recognized by all and all involved.
The creation of the model is positively seen at different levels, although as it will be contrasted and
Disadvantages, the actors consulted indicate the bad inter -institutional communication and disarticulation
between the justice system and those who execute the SNPL.
Conclusion 6 (based on finding 7): The processes of records and work procedures planned
In the model, as steps to follow in the implementation of the sanctions activities not
deprivative of liberty of adolescents seem to be subject to discretion of institution
competent or who implements them. From the hand of breach in the procedures, they arise
certain risks on the guarantees of rights that are not being fulfilled. Not having
an electronic or digital support for adolescent information and documentation and interventions
It can be complex and arises as an institutional error or weakness.
CONCLUSION 7 (Based on finding 8): The model supposes how transverse axes of approach the
responsibility, qualification and restitution, however, in professional practice, these are
They develop in different degrees. Although with some weaknesses, the actions related to the
Enabling against responsibility and restitution. The qualification actions are found
directly related to educational proposals from formal education, support
pedagogical, and with non -formal education offers more oriented to insertion into the market of
job. From the institutional it is expected to work responsibility, focusing on the importance of
the citizen participation of adolescents and their consequences.
Finally, restitution develops with the purpose of positively preventing new commissions
criminals, which makes it difficult to judge without before carrying out a longitudinal study of each teenager, without
Measure social reintegration activities or recidivism in the crime.
CONCLUSION 8 (Based on finding 9): From the effective compliance with SNL in adolescents in Uruguay
The positive assessment that adolescents make of these measures is highlighted, since it allows them
Avoid more expensive sanctions such as confinement. Despite this, part of the references consulted
They have low expectations in the success of these measures, differentiating efficacy from the measure according to the
Prevalence of protection or risk factors. In general, it is observed that this population
adolescent does not have great involvement of families in the process of compliance with the
sanction, which in any case hinders the integral approach suggested by the model.
8.3 Sustainability
Conclusion 9 (based on finding 10): Evidence of the presence of multiple discrepancies to arises in
level of operation between institutions that must continue to be reviewed for a job
aligned and homogeneous nationwide. From that place, as long as centralization in
a single institution -with possible annexes -is necessary to deepen agreements that
guarantee compliance with the objectives and procedures provided for in the model throughout the country,
with the need for an improvement in the articulation between the institutions that execute the MSNPL.
Conclusion 10 (based on finding 10): UNICEF's intervention is of special relevance to the
Moment to promote the necessary improvement in the articulation mentioned above. While it is
significant consider the limitations that said entity may have when intervening on
certain institutional aspects, the key role it has in the construction of a fabric is recognized
of work between institutions that are displayed weakened, stigmatized and uncoordinated.
78
Conclusion 11 (based on findings 11 and 12): at the institutional level it has been mentioned through the
Recurrent evaluation, the lack of resources for the implementation of the model, and, in
definitive, of the interventions related to the SNPL. In that sense it is affirmed that the model does not imply
great changes in the distribution of resources, but that it orders, unifies and systematizes the practices that
They were already done. While discursive receptivity was noticed towards the creation of the model, a certain
resistance from human resources in the systematization and monitoring of procedures
paws in it. Additionally, the limitation of technicians and activities planned is highlighted
In the MSNPL, becoming unusable for its application since it raises changes in the form of management
of the records, of the information that should be collected, and of the working time; establishing
tensions between the theory and practice in the territory of the model itself. As for the technicians, although
Professional specialization and update shortcomings are detected, it is important to recognize the good
Initial training with which each one counts.
On the other hand, it is emphasized that the real designation of human resources is not consistent with the proposal
in the model, evidencing that, after the implementation of this, for reasons that are unknown to
moment, exactly the guidelines proposed in the formation of equipment have not been followed
technicians A kind of informational vacuum regarding the management and distribution of resources is evident
that precedes the creation of the model, being that the weaknesses detected would seem to be part
of institutional operation historically.
Conclusion 12 (based on finding 13): although numerous efforts oriented to a
General improvement of system functioning and non -punitive policies, still subtracts
work to be done at the level of elaboration and execution of well -defined strategies both at the level
financial, as of human resources and inter -institutional coordinated work. Of this -among others
things- depends on the permanence and correct adjustment of the model, as well as its eventual update,
contemplating aspects such as the consideration of SCPs, either from their adaptation/inclusion, such as
of its exclusion of the model, but explicitly, avoiding discretionary improvisations in the
procedures The perception of the consulted is that the model comprises an initial kick
promising for the elaboration of other types of documents in the future and has meant an initiative
valuable in a context with multiple gaps and irregularities.
9.4 Incorporation of the gender and human rights approach
CONCLUSION 13 (Based on findings 14 and 15): Although the design of the model fits the
International regulations referring to human rights and from which the approach also follows
of equity, in its implementation a guideline of explicit actions in
Human Rights, Equity, and Gender. A certain gap is evidenced between the theoretical bases of
the proposal and the orientation of its execution explicitly.
In this context, the model comes to respond to demands that are urgent in relation to accompaniment
of public policies directed towards the responsibility, from the qualification to the social insertion and the
Repair from a perspective of rights, community and educational. On the other hand, the model
presents a must in what to the gender approach respects, not being approached with depth or
Explicit way, being fundamental that such perspective is integrated, not only to the
Intervention proposal, but to the regulations under which it is supported. It is considered
insufficient in this sense, to make unique mention to the non -discriminatory reference by sex that
They postulate guidelines and regulations for more than 20 years. Strong work remains regarding the
79
awareness and awareness of the recognition of the rights of children and adolescents in
Conflict with the law from the gender approach.
9. Lessons learned
From the beginning, certain resistance and tensions are visualized in the conjugation of inter -work
and inter -institutional in the context of adolescents with SNL
difficulties in its execution, possibly inherent to the vision and mission differences of entities
whose objectives are dissimilar.
The experience has been enriching fundamentally from the following aspects: (i) the
Unpublished survey of information with a view to the beginning of a systematized and more homogeneous work;
(Ii) the consolidation of a situational diagnosis that is considered of special utility for an improvement

ANNEX 8 - Terms of reference
1. Background
In 2016, within the framework of the Tenus Criminal Justice work program, agreed
Between UNICEF and the Government of Uruguay, an international symposium on Montevideo was carried out in Montevideo
Rights of childhood, citizen security and alternative sanctions to deprivation of liberty
applicable to adolescents in conflict with criminal law, with the aim of contributing to favor their
application.
As a result of the event, concrete recommendations were presented for the achievement of said objective,
among which is the elaboration of a protocol in order to guide the intervention process
Programmatic for compliance with the different sanctioning measures provided for in the legislation
Uruguayan.
From there, a working group coordinated by UNICEF was created and composed of the Judiciary, the
Prosecutor General of the Nation, the National Institute of Adolescent Inclusion (INISA), the Children's Institute
and adolescent of Uruguay (INAU), the National Association of Non -Governmental Organizations
(Anong) (public institutions and private organizations that deal with this matter in the country) and
the Inter -American Child Institute (IIN), to promote the concretion of the recommendations before
mentioned. This group developed a model for the fulfillment of non -private sanctions of
Libertad, which includes an individual plan for the execution of measures (PIEM), a scheme of the
intervention programs and their respective protocols.
The intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions was elaborated between May and
December 2017 and validated and presented in June 2018. Its construction was based on a process
Collective among the organizations of the working group. A unique but flexible model was built,
which is defined as a work protocol for the application of non -deprivation of liberty penalties
For teenagers. Establishes the foundations, objectives, methodology, procedures and techniques that
They will be used by all those who intervene in the execution of non -deprivation of liberty,
provided for in the CNA, in order to allow legal precepts and doctrinal conceptions
They hold it, crystallize in practice.
2. Objective
Evaluate the design of the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty and deployment
of the implementation between the months of June 2018 and December 2019.
To do this, the evaluation must answer at least the following questions:
- Is the model design consistent and applicable?
- Are the institutions that are part of the model ensure the conditions to apply it?
- Are there human and financial capacities to implement the model?
- Has the model been incorporated by the operators that must apply it?
- Does the model apply according to the established?
- What are the factors that affect the achievement of the implementation of the model?
134
- Has the application of the model allowed to improve the treatment of conflict adolescents
With the law?
3. Evaluation characteristics
Scope:
The evaluation must reach the entire national territory identifying strengths and weaknesses to
The application of the model in each of the country's departments.
Methodology:
The evaluation of the model will use a methodological triangulation, which, through the method
systemic aimed at modeling the purpose of work by determining structure and
relational dynamics of the parties involved,
It constitutes a proposal that combines qualitative and quantitative techniques. The first become
a multidisciplinary reading regarding documents and regulatory references, observation,
Interviews with strategic actors and focal groups or Focus Group. While the quantitative technique,
Through the use of pre -established questionnaires, it will allow to show statistical data of
Characterization of the various audiences involved (technical and adolescents served) and
Specificities of the activities and proposals developed.
Among qualitative techniques they stand out:
1. In -depth interview with qualified informants. Encounters will be held where they will be taken to
exploratory interviews, and in depth with the referents of the different institutions
involved (INAU, INISA, IIN, UNICEF, Prosecutor's Office, OSC), in order to know if the model design follows
as established in the intervention model for non -deprivation of liberty sanctions. Know yes
The guidelines and norms of good practices suggested by international organizations are followed, at the same time
that inquire about the type of proposals and activities are carried out, work modalities and
records of the same.
2. Documentary review. Review and analysis of national and international precedents,
Recognition of rules, rules and conventions articulated in the interventions implemented;
Work process plans; existence of valuation reports of the process and participation
of adolescents attended (for example; responsibility (assistance to proposals), work in
team (collaboration and support), autonomy (attend the space voluntarily, work
individually if required), self -esteem (personal care and interpersonal relationship),
Motivation (interests in new learning or activities).
3. Focal groups or Focus Groups: Through a non -probabilistic sampling, they will be selected
adolescents attended who are participating in alternative socio -educational activities to
the deprivation of liberty within the intervention model. In that sense, it will be ensured that
participants are, in relative terms, equitably distributed according to gender (parity between
genres), cover ethnic diversities, disabilities and diversity in the cause (imputed crime) of
income. The realization of three (3) Focus Group, of eight (8) participants each is expected, seeking
saturation in the dimensions to be analyzed. These meetings have specific objectives to know
how they perceive the relationship between the different parts involved; The co -responsibility, so much
135
of their families or support networks as of the services they access. Likewise, your
perspective in relation to the proposals in terms of recognition of activities that
They provide and facilitate new skills and resources, autonomy, improvement in self -esteem, changes in the
perception of criminal activities. At the same time, it will investigate the various modalities
of proposals and activities carried out and concerns towards other innovative.
Quantitative methods:
4. Two types of surveys will be administered, a model aimed at technical personnel and another to
teenagers attended within the model. On the one hand, the surveys to the technical resources that
They work with adolescents will allow to know the assessment about their work and performance,
recognize methodologies and means of work and registration; permanent training. On the other hand, through
From adolescent surveys, participation within the model, existence and satisfaction will be obtained
With your individual plan, activities carried out, assistance to ASSE services or other centers, existence
of support or containment networks, recognition of new skills and resources learned,
Police arrests, recognition of illicit behaviors, assessment of the measure and the process of
job.
Ethical considerations:
The evaluation will have to be aligned with the standards and standards of evaluation of the nations
Joined and will have an external and independent character and will be carried out in an objective way,
impartial, open and participatory, based on empirically verified evidence that is valid and
reliable. The final reports must be strictly in line with the terms of reference and
with UNICEF/UNEG report standards.
The ethical principles that will guide the evaluation are those of independence, impartiality, credibility,
Responsibility, honesty and integrity. It is also essential that the evaluation team
Keep respect for the dignity and diversity of people who are interviewed. It must
preserve the confidentiality of the information and data of those involved respecting the rights of
Provide information confidentially. At this point it is essential that the
Informed consent when information is collected.
In case of developing interviews with adolescents, it is key that the evaluation team refers to
UNICEF's guide in terms of investigation with children. It is also necessary to minimize risks
associated with having negative effects and maximizing the benefits of the main actors providing
unnecessary damages or damage that can be derived from the findings of a negative evaluation or
criticism without compromising the integrity of the evaluation.
The evaluation must also comply with UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research,
Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis and must be reviewed by an external ethical review committee,
given its theme and the possibility of involving adolescents in the survey. The evaluation may not
Proceed with data collection before having the approval of the Committee. If the institution has its
own ethical review mechanisms, they could replace the external committee as long as these
Mechanisms comply with the minimum quality standards established in UNICEF policy.
