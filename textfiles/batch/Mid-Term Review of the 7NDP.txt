Box 4: Projects Implemented to Improve Water Supply and Sanitation
Kafulafuta Water Supply Systems Project: The project was implemented with support from
the Commercial Bank of China, Standard Chartered Bank of China and the Government of
the Republic of Zambia from 2018 and is envisaged to end in 2022. This project involves the
construction of a dam and water supply system in Ndola, Luanshya, Masaiti and Mpongwe
Districts. Approximately 108,000 people will benefit from the project.
Nkana Water Supply Sanitation Project, Phase II: This project is being implemented by the
Government of the Republic of Zambia and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. It started
in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2021 with a total of 750,000 people expected to
benefit from the project. The project involves the construction, rehabilitation and expansion
of water supply and sanitation infrastructure in Kitwe, Kalulushi, and Chambishi Townships.
Lusaka Water Supply Sanitation and Drainage Project: The project was financed by the
Government of the Republic of Zambia and Millennium Challenge Corporation. The project
ended in December 2018 and involved the construction, rehabilitation and expansion of selected
water supply and sanitation infrastructure in the City of Lusaka with a targeted population
of 1.2 million beneficiaries through increased access to clean and safe water and adequate
sanitation.
