Executive Summary
This evaluation assessed a pilot programme for the prevention of bullying in a school setting, launched in 2014
under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak Chairwoman of The General Women’s Union
The Supreme Chairperson of the family Development Foundation, and President of The Supreme Council for
Motherhood and Childhood, and as a collaboration between the UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO) and the Supreme
Council for Motherhood & Childhood (SCMC). The evaluation was conducted to support SCMC and UNICEF work
on child protection in the UAE, specifically case management in schools and the establishment of links to systems
outside schools. The programme was implemented in two phases. In the first phase, which started in 2014, the
programme was rolled out in 14 schools in Abu Dhabi. The second phase was implemented in 64 schools from
2016 to 2017. The programme was expanded to 64 schools, extending from Abu Dhabi to the Northern Emirates.
In 2018, the program was handed over to the Ministry of Education, which in turn, mainstreamed in all schools.
The evaluation assessed the pilot programme using the criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
coherence, and sustainability. The evaluation identified critical lessons learnt, best practices, and key
recommendations.
SCMC and UNICEF GAO initiated The UAE Programme for the Prevention of Bullying in Schools, by carrying out
a preliminary analysis of the school environment in the UAE in order to establish a framework for protection and
safety in schools and a learning environment. The results of the school analysis showed that bullying does occur
in schools, especially among cycle II students. Hence, there was a need to develop a bullying prevention model
suitable for implementation in the UAE.
Initially, more than 15 specialized programs for international best practices in Antibullying were reviewed and 3
programs were selected and presented in a 2-day seminar organized by UNICEF GAO and SCMC in Abu Dhabi
from 21-22 May 2014. The seminar was attended by various education, health and protection authorities and
resulted in forming a national committee to oversee the development of a bullying prevention model suitable
for implementation in UAE schools. During this seminar, experiences from Australia, Finland (KiVa program) and
the United States (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) were presented, and experts shared their research/
school-based models to combat bullying and the methodologies, approaches used, some of their educational
material, lessons learnt and evidence of the effectiveness of these models in their respective countries.
Tailored and comprehensive intervention was programmed through the production of a bullying prevention
training manual based on six methods of intervention: direct sanctions, restorative practice, mediation, support
group, shared concern, and victim empowerment. The programme was implemented in 14 schools in Abu Dhabi
in the first phase and expanded to 64 schools in the second phase – 28 Schools in Abu Dhabi and 36 schools in
Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the programme’s relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coherence, and
sustainability in mitigating bullying in the target schools, and thereby advise how UNICEF can best support the
UAE and balance the government’s objectives and priorities with the UNICEF mandate. The evaluation aims to
assess the pilot phase of the programme, gauge the programme’s accessibility with a focus on equity and gender
equality, support the overall work on child protection in the country, and identify key lessons and best practices
to enrich evidence-based decision-making. The evaluation’s intended primary audiences are UNICEF GAO, the SCMC,
and the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the UAE.
A mixed participatory approach was used in the evaluation. Following a desk review, the evaluator selected a
sample of 12 schools involved in the programme and 2 schools outside the programme. She conducted seven
key informant interviews and ran surveys among nine school principals, 112 parents, 62 social workers and
School Discipline Committee members, and 1,330 students. Additionally, risk mapping was conducted with 93
students. The evaluator presented her preliminary findings for validation.
The evaluation yielded following findings.
Relevance: The evaluation found the programme to be highly relevant to the United Arab Emirates Supreme
Council for Motherhood and Childhood 2017–2021 Strategy and to the Ministry of Education Strategy. The
evaluation concludes that the programme design was based on sound evidence and informed by global best
practices. The programme design contributed to the achievement of the intended results and outcomes via
relevant interventions, including staff training, training materials, and anti-bullying guides in Arabic and English.
Nevertheless, the evaluator notes that the programme did not define the logical framework required for the
programme, the programme’s theory of change, programme outcomes, an activities timeline, or monitoring
plan. The programme was found to be relevant to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. More specifically,
in terms of its non-discrimination principles, the programme effectively worked to eliminate all types of
discriminations. Children’s views and opinions were prioritised at all stages of the programme. Finally, the
evaluation found that the programme was consistent with a human-rights-based approach from the
perspectives of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, equality, universality, and indivisibility.
Coherence: The evaluation concludes that the programme is aligned with relevant school policies and the school
code of conduct. The programme contributed to changes in social behaviour. It promoted the mobilisation of an
anti-bullying and violence mechanism in the pilot schools. While the programme did not offer a case
management structure similar to that of the school code of conduct, the schools used the programme manuals,
training materials, and pre- and post-knowledge assessments. The evaluation found that the pilot programme
and the MOE’s child protection and wellbeing programme complemented each other.
Efficiency: The programme was drawn up and implemented by UNICEF, the SCMC, and the MOE. The MOE
devised a national anti-bullying policy that covered all aspects of the programme. However, this pursuit of this
policy was limited by three factors that affected the programme. First, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, lessons
were halted, and new bullying issues emerged. Secondly, the MOE was split into two entities: the MOE and the
Emirates Schools Establishment. It took time for the programme to be embedded at the MOE after this structural
reform.
UNICEF’s engagement with governments in the Gulf Region is different from the UNICEF work model deployed
in many other UNICEF offices where it is fully dedicated not only to education, but also to management,
reporting, and monitoring. Over time, this lack of involvement may limit UNICEF’s contribution to the
programme. More needs to be done by the government to strengthen UNICEF’s engagement at local level and
throughout the programme’s timeline in order to deepen the impact of the resulting achievements.
Effectiveness: The programme reached the target group at the pilot schools on several levels. Schools drew up
their own annual programmes. Results from the school committee questionnaire showed that the programme
raised awareness among at least 80% of school students each year; more than 90% of school staff and social
workers raised students’ awareness of bullying; 96.4% of them documented incidents of bullying; and 90.5%
planned and participated in the anti-bullying week organised by the MOE. The programme made progress
towards its planned objectives of creating a safe school environment and preventing violence and bullying in
school. One of the programme’s milestones was the production of evidence-based anti-bullying manuals that
are based on global best practices. It was drawn up, distributed, and used for training purposes. Results from
student questionnaires indicated consistently lower bullying rates in the pilot schools compared to the control
group. For example, the likelihood of students becoming victims is significantly lower in the intervention group.
Students in the intervention group are 27.3% less likely to be called names, 41.2% less likely to get picked on by
other students, 35.4% less likely to be made fun of, 46.8% less likely get hit by others, and 73.6% less likely to
receive unpleasant computer, phone, and/or online messages from other students.
Overall, the programme improved the school environment in each of the pilot schools to varying degrees and
offered the whole school community a different level of understanding as regards the prevention of school
violence and bullying. In terms of equity, the programme reached the most vulnerable children. The evaluation
found that school staff and management systematically assess the students’ situation and offer support. Schools
have tailored the programme to students with disabilities. With regard to students facing neglect within the
family, although the number is not high, schools mentioned that these cases were a challenge to manage. Some
students from lone-parent families sometimes act aggressively and their peers are unable to challenge such
behaviour. While aspects like these are not the focus of the programme, this needs to be looked at during the
next phase.
The UAE government’s commitment to recognising and responding to bullying issues, and to engaging in
evidence-based interventions, is a critical factor in the effectiveness of the programme. The programme also
benefited from extensive international experience in the design phase. Schools were willing and eager to benefit
from the training provided. The school trainer provided training on an annual basis, ensuring that the quality of
the trainer training was high and making sure that content was available in both Arabic and English.
Sustainability: The programme established strong buy-in via the training of trainers among national
counterparts as a programme tool. The training of trainers allowed schools to lead the programme as most of
the trainees were school principals and experienced social workers. The training of trainers was a key
implementation mechanism. The evaluation concludes that the programme is legally and institutionally
sustainable, with a component of financial sustainability depending on the situation playing out in the country.
The evaluation suggests the following set of recommendations.
1. Strengthen the service response at national level, continue programme interventions. The government is
recommended to review and support the legal and policy framework for child protection systems. At
national level, the Ministry of Education can partner with other ministries, civil society organisations, etc.
Take evidence-based approaches drawing on comprehensive data and a systematic evaluation of the
existing programmes and their impacts.
2. Encourage pilot schools to continue adopting interventions under the programme. UNICEF, the SCMC, and
the MOE should draw up a plan to ensure continuity in the support of pilot schools in their efforts to
implement the programme. It is recommended that pilot schools’ efforts and contributions to the
programme from 2014 to the present be acknowledged and rewarded.
3. Strengthen the programme manuals. UNICEF and the SCMC should have the programme manuals reviewed
by an expert group to update the content. More examples of situations from school life can be added so that
school staff can easily investigate and verify cases. They should adopt up-to-date and child-friendly training
materials and mainstream gender equality at all programme levels.
4. Update the anti-bullying materials. The materials should be updated to ensure the diversity and localisation
of content. This can be done by adding more modules to meet emerging needs defined by the students
participating in this study and by their parents, and ensuring the localisation of content to reflect cultural
differences and diversity across the Emirates.
5. Develop a results framework for the programme. UNICEF should provide more support to stakeholders
from the SCMC and MOE in taking the lead with national stakeholders to develop a results agenda with clear,
quantified targets. The programme needs to document a theory of change to identify assumptions, risks and
bottlenecks, and develop a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework.
6. Accelerate the implementation of the programme. UNICEF should use a shorter sub-programme timeframe
to regularly capture changes on the ground. A shorter sub-programme can be more easily financed than a
very long programme. The programme should build a strong monitoring system and regularly collect data.
7. Broaden the scope of the programme scope to address topics mentioned in the school code of conduct
and integrate the beneficiaries’ priorities. It is recommended that the existing school code of conduct be
used to scale up the programme, rather than creating a parallel dedicated school anti-bullying structure. The
code of condct needs to be audited from a child protection prespective, and given trainng and social change
materials. The MOE needs to develop a way of detecting and dealing with cases where children’s identities
are kept anonymous.
8. Offer non-school support to regularly bullied students and aggressive students. The UAE already has three
levels of service response: primary, secondary and tertiary. These need to be mainstreamed into the school
system. Students who aggressively bully others may either be given a fail grade or prevented from advancing
to the next year, and placed in another school if there is no sustainable change in his/her behavior.
Additional advanced modules need to be created to support and enhance the life skills of regularly bullied
students with a view to increasing their self-esteem.
9. Develop a capacity-building programme for implementing partners. One important method to keep all
stakeholders on the same path is to engage in strong programme-based capacity building at the beginning
in order to enhance implementers’ skills and share programme experiences among them.
10. Put the SCMC in the position of third-party monitor. It is recommended that the programme build SCMC
capacities to position itself as a third-party monitor conducting cross-cutting research and playing a
monitoring role in multiple child-related areas, including bullying and child protection.
11. Establish a programme dedicated to filling the gap in human resources among social protection specialists
and social workers. This includes gauging and addressing the shortage of human resources among school
social workers and assessing current social workers’ capabilities.
12. Strengthen the UNICEF’s role in the programme to maximise the impacts. The current implementation
model, where UNICEF is engaged in the design and the early stages, with programme implementation then
managed by the national stakeholders, has shown limitations in two important components – systematic
monitoring and learning. A study of the feasibility of various options on how the government and UNICEF
can work together is recommended.
13. Support the scale up. The scale-up phase needs to be discussed with stakeholders to ensure that they are
technically and financially willing and ready for the scale-up, and the programme materials need to be
revised to factor in new developments and the views of schools, parents, students, and principals.
The following findings emerge from the evaluation:
▪ Better coordination between UNICEF, the SCMC, and national and local government stakeholders at all
levels would have helped to better achieve the programme’s goals.
▪ A clear and comprehensive programme document identifying and spelling out the results, programme
components, activities, timeline, key roles and responsibilities, and a monitoring framework would have
facilitated performance tracking. A theory of programme change in response to identified assumptions,
risks and bottlenecks could have helped to achieve the planned results. There is a lack of a programme
monitoring and evaluation plan with tailored data collection benchmarks for learning and monitoring.
▪ Since the MOE took over the implementation of the programme, there is little evidence of data
collection and programme performance monitoring, with the exception of schools’ self-documentation
of cases for internal use, which are not necessarily reported to the MOE.
The evaluation identified the following best practices:
▪ The programme draws on international best practices and successful models. Prior to its
implementation, more than 15 international dedicated anti-bullying programmes were analysed, and
the three best programmes – well-tested in Australia, Finland (the KiVa programme), and the United
States (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program) – were presented to implementers prior to roll-out. Experts
from those three programmes shared their school-based models, educational materials, lessons learnt
and evidence of the effectiveness of these models in their respective countries.
▪ The programme achieved a high level of buy-in among schools by engaging, equipping and empowering
schools so that they have all the support they need to take the lead in the programme. The training of
trainers gave schools guidance on sustaining interventions under the programme. Most of the staff
trained in the trainer training scheme were school principals and experienced social workers. The trained
staff enabled schools to be the key actor in maintaining the programme. Each year, the trained staff
provide refresher training and awareness sessions to other staff at their schools to raise students’ and
parents’ awareness of anti-bullying.
▪ The SCMC Bullying Prevention in Schools Award is a very important tool in identifying and rewarding
the best-performing staff, students, and parents. Schools should award it to students who make positive
changes in their behaviour.
The evaluator noted three schools that had been exceptionally successful in implementing the programme:
a) Hamdan Bin Zayed School: the school committee has been comprehensively organised. In addition to
social workers, they have added music and drama teachers, PE teachers, and other staff. The school
formed a student support group composed of senior students who observe and guide younger students’
behaviour. The school invested heavily in delivering awareness sessions in a child-friendly manner with
drawings and videos. The school has a strong, diversified team.
b) Al Rawafed Private School: the school fully documented all programme activities. It applied all
programme steps on annual basis. The school principal was very engaged in the process.
c) Al Shawamekh School for Girls: the school carefully collected and analysed data on bullying incident
1. Introduction
1-1 Country context
The UAE consists of seven emirates; Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al-Khaimah, Ajman, Umm Al-
Qaiwain, and Al- Fujairah, which were united as a federal state on 2 December 1971. The official
language is Arabic. Among the immigrant population, English, Hindi, Farsi, and Filipino are spoken.
English is the language of commerce and business. Islam dominates all aspects of life. Matters
relating to marriage, divorce, inheritance, economics, politics, and personal conduct are affected
by Sharia (Islamic) law. The Emiratis are tolerant toward other religions, and immigrants of other
faiths are allowed to have their own places of worship.
In 2021, the UAE’s population was estimated at 9,365,145. The population growth (annual %) is
0.8%. The GDP per capita (current US$) was equal to $44,315.6 in 2021. The internet can be used
by 100%1 of the population; the country hosts migrants of multiple nationalities, including Arab
nationalities, e.g. Egyptians, Lebanese, Syrians, Tunisians and Moroccans, Asian nationalities, e.g.
Indians, Philippines and Pakistanis, and African migrants, in addition to western residents from
the USA and Europe.2 The 0-14 year age bracket represents 15% of the population3
The UAE ranked 26th globally and first in the Arab world in the 2021/2022 Human Development
Report. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure for assessing long-term
progress in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to
knowledge, and a decent standard of living.4
According to the SDGs dashboard, the UAE ranked 85th out of 163 among the index countries.
The UAE has already achieved the targets related to goal 1 (no poverty) and goal 4 (quality of
education).5

The quality of education in the UAE performed well globally, being among the top 15 countries
in the PIRLS score (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study). PIRLS is an international
assessment administered every five years to measure trends in reading comprehension at fourth
grade. The assessment is conducted in the language of instruction in public and private schools
and compares the results with the abilities of peers in participating countries.6
The UAE acceded to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 3 January 1997 and the Optional
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution
and child pornography on 2 March 2016.7 Since then, the UAE has made significant progress in
ensuring the compliance of its legal and policy frameworks to protect children from violence and
abuse. Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 concerning children’s rights, also known as Wadeema’s Law,
has been issued to ensure that all children are provided with appropriate living standards, access
to health services, education, and equal opportunities in essential services and facilities without
any kind of discrimination. The law protects children against all forms of negligence, exploitation,
and physical and psychological abuses.
1-2 Education system in the UAE
The current education system in the UAE has been in effect since 1952. In the 1960s and 1970s,
a school building programme expanded the education system. Currently, education at primary
and secondary levels is universal. Public schools are funded by the UAE government, and the
curriculum is created to mirror the UAE’s development goals. The language of instruction in
public schools is Arabic, while a stress is placed on English as a second language. There are many
internationally accredited private schools. Public schools in the country are free for citizens of
the UAE; fees for private schools vary.
The UAE education reform policy focuses on better preparation, greater accountability, higher
standards, and improved professionalism. In addition, rote instruction is being replaced with
more interactive forms of learning. English-language education is being integrated into other
subjects, such as mathematics and science. The Ministry of Education (MOE), the Emirates School
Establishment (ESE), the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK), the
Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) in Dubai, the Sharjah Private Education
Authority (SPEA), and the Sharjah Education Council (SEC) are tasked with education reform that
preserves local traditions, principles, and the cultural identity of the UAE.
Education from primary to secondary level is universal and compulsory up to the twelfth grade.
This education is provided in a four-tier process over 14 years:
▪ 4- to 5-year-olds attend kindergarten (KG1, KG2)

▪ 6- to 11-year-olds attend primary schools (Grades 1-4)
▪ children aged 12 to 14 attend preparatory middle schools (Grades 5-8)
▪ 15- to 17-year-olds attend secondary schools (Grades 9-12)
More than a million students enrolled in pre-university education in the UAE in 2017/2018; an
education service is offered by private and public schools. Public schools admitted 287,700
students in 2017/2018, private schools 793,300 students.8
In 2018/2019, 1,099,331 students enrolled in schools in the country. Private schools admitted
810,537 students, 48.2% female and 51.8% male. Public schools took in 288,794, 52.2% female
and 47.8 male. Girls are more likely to be enrolled in public schools and boys are more likely to
be enrolled in private schools.9

A 2001 cabinet decision excluding expatriate students from government schools was repealed in
2006. Since the 2006/07 academic year, admission for expatriate students has been conditional
on approval, merit, and geographic location, and fees are levied.10
The UAE government allocates a significant share of its federal budget to education; the
education budget has ranged from 13.44% of the UAE federal budget in 2016 to 20.23% in
2018.11 In 2022 the government spent 16.3% of the country’s $16 billion federal budget on
education.12 The UAE has also drawn up a National Education Strategy to equip future
generations of students with the technical and practical skills needed to strengthen the labour
market. The strategy aims to reinforce accreditation standards, set a framework of
qualifications, and further develop the curricula to match international standards and the UAE
education tracks (a general, technical, advanced and elite stream).
1-3 Bullying in schools in the UAE
According to a programme’s situation analysis, bullying in schools is a problem that affects
students in many countries. It can have serious consequences on well-being and mental health.

Bullying may be defined broadly as “the systematic abuse of power in interpersonal relations. It
involves individuals or groups deliberately seeking to dominate and upset those they target
without having any reason to do so. Bullying may be physical, as in hitting or kicking someone, or
verbal, as in using abusive language. It may also be indirect, as in deliberate and unfairly excluding
people or spreading rumours about them that are known to be untrue. In recent years, it has
involved the use of cyber technology to send hurtful messages.”
In 2014, the UNICEF Gulf Area Office (GAO), in cooperation with the Supreme Council for
Motherhood & Childhood (SCMC), carried out a preliminary situation analysis of the school
environment in the UAE to develop a framework for protection and safety in the school and
learning environment. The UNICEF GAO’s experts visited 11 schools (cycles 1 & 2) across different
Emirates to assess the school environment by engaging in general group discussions with the
students, school staff, parents, and school management. Results from the preliminary school
assessment indicated that there is bullying behaviour in schools, especially among cycle 2
students (grades 6-9; aged 11-15 years).
Some of the key findings of the preliminary assessment include:
- students were subjected to bullying by other students;
- students were subjected to bullying by their teachers;
- younger students (11-12 years) were franker about the problems they faced;
- verbal bullying was the most common form of bullying;
- a few teachers reported being subjected to verbal and physical abuse by students;
- students were under constant surveillance by the school staff;
- school staff and parents did not acknowledge the negative impact of bullying on children;
- school staff are not able to identify signs of bullying;
- parents were not actively involved in their children’s school.
1-4 Child protection policy in schools in the UAE
There are several regulations that protect and organise child rights in UAE, including the
compulsory education law, the people with disabilities law, the human resources law, the child
crime law, and the child rights law – Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 (Wadeema). This child rights law
was named after a girl who was tortured and killed by her father and his wife in 2012, an event
which shook the country.
The law has created a comprehensive approach to child protection based on global best
practices. The law stresses that all children must be provided with appropriate living standards,
access to health services, education, equal opportunities in essential services and facilities
without any kind of discrimination. The law protects children against all forms of negligence,
exploitation, physical and psychological abuses. In addition, smoking in public and private
vehicles and indoor facilities where children are present is also prohibited under the law.
Violators are subject to penalties as imposed by the law.
The law allows childcare specialists to remove children from their home against the parents’
wishes and without judicial permission in cases of imminent danger. In less severe cases,
specialists may intervene by visiting the child regularly, providing social services, and mediating
a solution between the family and the child. Parents who put children in danger, abandon them,
neglect them, leave them without supervision, do not enrol them in school or fail to register them
4
upon birth are subject to a prison sentence and/or a fine. The law applies to all children up to the
age of 18.13
At a school level, internal discipline is defined by the school code of conduct issued by Ministerial
Executive Order No. 851 of 2018. The school code of conduct as per the MOE refers to the
regulation of students’ day-to-day issues at schools, from the dress code to bullying. Under the
code of conduct, students’ conduct at school is graded as morals and behaviour and is subject to
a pass/fail grade just like other subjects. Under the code of conduct, education officials are asked
to protect children from neglect, exploitation, bullying and all forms of abuse, and to avoid
disclosing confidential information about students and their families. The code of conduct
includes the prohibition of spreading false news and rumours, and of committing any verbal or
physical violence against students in any circumstances. Additionally, the MOE has joined with
other entities to implement several national strategies and polices, such as the quality-of-life
strategy and school health and safety, in addition to several programmes geared towards child
well-being.
Child protection professionals and advisers work via a child protection unit; they are a bridge
intervening between schools and families. Their numbers are relatively low, at one specialist for
every 10 schools. Their capacities also need to be strengthened in order to meet children’s needs
as indicated by the MOE’s representative.
1-5 UNICEF SCMC programme on the prevention of bullying in schools in the UAE
In 2014, the SCMC and UNICEF conducted an assessment with a view to developing a framework
for protection and safety in schools. This initial assessment indicated that bullying behaviour was
a key challenge.
In response to this assessment, UNICEF and the SCMC formed a national committee of
stakeholders to address the bullying issue. Following discussions and meetings, the committee
decided to draw up an anti-bullying programme in schools in the UAE.
The initial assessment in 2014 was conducted via focus group discussions with students at
schools. Data issued later by the UAE Ministry of Health and MOE within the scope of the Global
School-Based Student Health Survey 2016 showed that the percentage of students bullied on one
or more days during the 30 days before the survey was 27.1% among students aged 13-15 years,
21.2% among students aged 16-17 years, and 24.8% among students aged 13-17 years. This also
confirmed the SCMC and UNICEF assessment that priority should be given to cycle 2 students,
i.e. those aged 13-15 years,14 as this is where bullying rates are highest.
The development of the programme started with a study of global experiences. In this respect,
15 global best practices were carefully reviewed, with three programmes being invited to provide
more information. The three programmes selected were from Finland (KiVa), the United States
(Olweus Bullying Prevention Programme), and Australia.
Afterwards, an international expert in psychology was commissioned to draw up a tailored and
comprehensive intervention programme by producing a training manual based on six methods

of intervention: direct sanctions, restorative practice, mediation, support group, shared concern,
and strengthening of the victim. The training manual was tested and translated and used as a
tool to train trainers from schools so they could transfer this knowledge to school staff.
Prior to the training of trainers, a pre-assessment was conducted to measure the bullying rates
at schools. The training was then provided and delivered from school staff to students via several
delivery methods. The programme schools reported the following strategies to address bullying
issues:
▪ production of a brochure and leaflets to raise awareness of bullying;
▪ awareness-raising among the student body at morning assemblies;
▪ organisation of a play on bullying in schools;
▪ collaboration with community police to hold a workshop on cyber-bullying;
▪ organisation of art activities to express students’ ideas and perspectives on bullying;
▪ contest to come up with a creative design for the bullying prevention project;
▪ parent engagement in discussions on bullying and its consequences at morning
assemblies and school celebrations.15
Another assessment was conducted to measure the effectiveness of the draft programme – a
post assessment – which reported that:
▪ there was a significant reduction in those being bullied;
▪ there was a significant reduction in those doing the bullying.
At this stage, the programme interventions were proved to be effective and phase 2 was rolled
out with the expansion of the programme to 64 schools – 28 schools in Abu Dhabi and 36 schools
in Dubai and the Northern Emirates.
In the absence of a programme theory of change, the evaluator drew up an ex-post illustrative
theory of change (Shape 1).

2. Purpose and Objectives of Evaluation
The purpose is to conduct an independent formative evaluation of the pilot phase of the Anti-
Bullying Programme in 64 schools using OECD DAC criteria to assess the programme relevance,
efficiency, effectiveness, coherence, and sustainability in mitigating the bullying problem in the
schools targeted. It is equally important for the UNICEF GAO to make critical findings and define
best practices for subsequent phases. The formative evaluation also covers relevant auxiliary
services at schools, with a particular focus on school social support services.
The evaluation helps to shed light on how UNICEF can best support the UAE and strike a balance
between government objectives and priorities and the UNICEF mandate. The knowledge
gathered and the specific lessons learnt should inform evidence-based decision-making and
advocacy, and contribute to learning within UNICEF on how to strengthen children’s well-being
in the region and beyond. The evaluation’s recommendations will be reflected in the UNICEF
GAO’s new Area Programme Document and will be of assistance to the UAE government in
scaling up and replicating the programme in schools.
More specifically, the evaluation has the following objectives:
• assess the pilot phase of the programme from the perspective of its relevance, efficiency,
coherence, and sustainability, and its impact on teachers, children, and parents, taking into
account the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and other critical human rights
conventions;
• evaluate the programme’s accessibility with a view to preventing violence in schools and
providing a safer educational environment, with a focus on equity and gender perspectives;
• support overall work on child protection in the UAE in terms of case management in schools,
and links to systems outside schools;
7
• make critical findings, define best practices, draft key recommendations for the smooth
process of formalising and scaling up the tprogramme nationwide to ensure its inclusivity,
sustainability, and efficiency.
The evaluation assessed pilot schools’ relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and coherence. The
formative evaluation also assessed related services, especially social workers and case management.
3. Evaluation Scope, Criteria, and Questions
The evaluation focuses on ongoing efforts at child protection in schools, especially with a focus
on case management that goes beyond schools. It covers 64 pilot schools, where the programme
is implemented with the support of the SCMC and Ministry of Education and will cover the period
from 2014 to the present (March 2023).
The evaluation criteria and questions are listed in the table below.
Table 2. List of evaluation criteria and questions
Criteria Key questions
Relevance To what extent do the programme objectives coincide with beneficiaries’ needs, priorities,
and expectations at all levels?
Assessment questions include:
• To what extent are the programme’s objectives, strategies, activities, etc., realistic,
feasible, and aligned with the relevant government policy’s priorities in terms of
preventing violence in schools?

4. Evaluation Methodology
This evaluation used a mixed-method participatory approach. It was guided by Terms of
Reference (TOR), the Revised Evaluation Policy of UNICEF, Evaluation Norms and Standards of
the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and
Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis, and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report
Standards. Primary data collection was conducted from 12 February 2023 to 2 March 2023.
9
Desk review
Prior to the primary data collection, the evaluator conducted a desk review of existing documents
for purposes of initial analysis. The documents consulted are listed in the annex. The initial desk
review served as a basis for the evaluator drawing up the inception report to detail the evaluation
approach and plan.
The inception report and data collection tools were sent for an external ethical review to ensure
that the processes were effective and that there was accountability for ethical oversight. This is
to ensure that the protection of human subjects, including the protection of and respect for
human and child rights, was incorporated into the evaluation methodology and data collection
processes. The Ethical Review Board granted approval on 12 January 2023 (IRB #1211, IORG #850,
FWA #1102).
Key informant interviews
The primary data collection conducted by the evaluator consists of key informant interviews,
stakeholder surveys, general group discussions and risk map exercises. For key informant
interviews, the evaluator took a purposeful sample of key stakeholders. The list was consulted
and agreed during the inception phase (see Table 3).

Sampling and sample characteristics for stakeholder surveys
The evaluator conducted surveys with various stakeholders. The evaluator applied a control-
intervention method to measure the pilot schools’ performance against other schools where the
programme had not been implemented. Initially, eight and four schools were sampled as the
intervention and control group, respectively. The number of schools in the control group was to
be equivalent to a quarter of the intervention schools sampled. However, the MOE approved
16 Ms Hasa AlMheiri previously worked for the Ministry of Education and provided an insight from that perspective,
as well as from the ESE vantage point.
10
only two schools for the control group. Regarding the intervention group, four private schools
were additionally suggested during the field mission.
Therefore, visits were made to 12 intervention schools and two control (non-programme) from
five Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras El-khiema, and Ajman. The Abu Dhabi sample
includes both public and private schools; the other Emirates comprise public schools only. This
evaluation follows a proportion-to-size sampling method, so the sample mirrors the programme
concept. Public school students account for 78.2% of the interviewed sample, private school
students 21.8%.
Table 4 shows the homogeneity between intervention and control schools by nationality.
Additionally, the control schools were located very close to the intervention schools (i.e. they
were in the same neighbourhood).

The sample distribution among the Emirates is proportional to the number of pilot schools in
each Emirate (see Table 5).

Different survey questionnaires were prepared depending on the type of stakeholders, i.e.
whether they were school principals, school discipline committee members, parents, or students.
17 Arab nationalities include Arab countries in Africa, e.g. Egyptian, Sudanese, Tunisian, and Moroccan, whereas
African nationalities exclude these.
11
In total, nine school principals, 64 school discipline committee members, 114 parents, and 1,330
students participated in the surveys (see Table 6).

▪ Parents ▪ Online questionnaire ▪ 114 (10-12 in each school; 81 females,

For student sampling within schools, the evaluator used the probability-proportional-to-size
(PPS) sampling. PPS is a method of sampling from a finite population, where a size measure is
available for each population unit before sampling, and where the probability of selecting a unit
is proportional to its size. This sample method best suits the programme evaluation. In each
school, a sample of 75-100 students was chosen, with special attention given to male-to-female
representation, disability, and nationality. In each school, four classes were selected, using a
random approach. Each class represents one grade (five to eight).
The average class size within the sampled schools is 23.4 students. Among the 1,330 students
sampled, 527 are males and 803 are females. 745 students are from Abu Dhabi, while 78, 169,
164, and 174 students are from Ajman, Dubai, RAK, and Sharjah, respectively. Only 1.7% of
students reportedly have disabilities.

sampled.

Data collection at school level followed the procedures below:
1- Passive informed consent was sent to the parents a week before the data collection
started. The form was drawn up in Arabic and English. Parents could get in touch with the
school if they had any questions or comments.
2- The school visits started with a meeting with the school management to introduce the
evaluation objectives, procedures, tools, and data needed, and to make sure that the
parent consent forms had been sent.
3- A general group discussion was conducted with the students’ disciplinary committee
about the use of the programme manuals, the quality of the training provided, current
challenges, best practices, and findings emerging from their practices.
4- The student questionnaire was sent to students’ laptops. Students opened it only during
the evaluator’s visit to the class. The class teachers were asked to leave the class during
the collection of the data. The school’s social workers gave an introductory presentation
to the students on the evaluation and then left.
5- The evaluator explained the purpose of the evaluation, the privacy and protection policy,
and the students’ right to skip any question and even not to fill in the questionnaire at all.
The evaluator asked students not to write their name or any personal data (the
questionnaire had no place for any personal data).
6- The evaluator explained each question until the questionnaire was finished.
7- Risk maps were collected only from students whose parents had signed a written parent
consent form. Several students obtained written consent. However, due to the limited
time, only around 8-10 students from each school participated in the exercise. It was
conducted individually rather than as a group as per the ethical review board’s
recommendation.
8- Surveys for principals, committee members and parents were explained to the school
staff and collected online.

Risk map
A risk map is a child friendly tool that uses a simple technique to capture the risks children face in their
surrounding environment.
For example, the moderator shows the student a chart of a school building depicting a classroom, the
grounds, toilets, and labs, and asks them simple questions, such as if they feel comfortable in this place
and, whether they like or don’t like the place. Places that students feel uncomfortable in or don’t like are
usually places where risks are found or where abuses happen. So, the moderator asks why they don’t feel
comfortable in this place, and the students start to express the reasons that can lead to risk factors.
The tool can also capture sexual harassment by showing the student a figure of a person and asking if
he/she was touched or beaten by another person. If so, the student can refer to the touched place so the
moderator can register the case.
Usually, child victims attend the risk map exercise as a group so that they can support each other as they
talk. It should be carried out by a trained person.
For this evaluation, the ethical board approved the implementation of the tool on an individual basis,
subject to written parental consent. There were plans to meet around eight students in each school, but
higher numbers of students brought the written consent and wanted to participate.
Confidentiality and anonymity were assured by not collecting names. Other information was replaced
with encoded identifiers, while the encoding key was kept in a different secure location. Data stored on
paper, such as surveys or notebooks, was kept together in a safe, secure location away from public access.
Stakeholder survey questionnaires
1 – Student questionnaire: the methodology used to calculate the school bullying rates in this
report is the same methodology adopted by the programme in 2016. Findings regarding the
prevalence of school bullying were derived from the responses of students (N = 1,330) in grades
5-8 at 14 schools in five Emirates. Students reported that they (i) bullied other students (ii) were
14
themselves victimised. The frequency at which each of these occurred depended on the nature
of the bullying, gender, and the grade of the student.
In order to determine the impact of the intervention conducted in schools months later,
comparisons were made between the responses to the questionnaires made by students (N =
1,162) in 12 schools who had experienced the intervention (the intervention/pilot group) and
students (N = 151) in two schools who had not received the intervention (the control group). The
intervention group scored lower on reliable measures of victimisation and bullying and reported
feeling less unsafe. In addition, students in the intervention group scored higher when reported
pro-social behaviour was measured.
Questions relating to behaviour comprised five questions about being bullied, four about bullying
others, and four about acting pro-socially. An additional question asked how safe or unsafe
students felt at school. The questions took the form of statements, in response to which students
could indicate “never”, “once in a while”, “a few times a month”, or “a few times a week”.
Examples:
▪ I get called names by others (victimisation)
▪ I like to make others scared of me (bullying)
▪ I enjoy helping others (pro-social)
The questionnaire given to the intervention group contained some additional questions asking
students how helpful the programme activities had been. Prepared statements were provided
for them to indicate whether they strongly agreed, agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed,
disagreed, or strongly disagreed.
The statements were:
▪ The activities were helpful in reducing bullying among students in my school
▪ I learnt certain ways to handle bullying when it happened to me
▪ The activities gave me sufficient knowledge of bullying
▪ Relations with my peers improved after doing these activities
In order to gauge the measures of peer relations, the following multi-item scales were drawn up:
Pro-Social Scale: this consisted of four scores assessing how often a student engaged in pro-social
behaviour, such as sharing things with others. High scores indicated that they were acting pro-
socially relatively often.
Victimisation Scale: this consisted of four scores relating to student reports of being bullied at
school, such as being picked on. These were scored as Never = 1; Once in a while = 2; A few times
a month = 3; A few times a week = 4. High scores indicated that they were being bullied relatively
often.
Bullying Others Scale: this consisted of four scores assessing how often a student engaged in
bullying others, such as “upsetting weak people”. These were scored in the same way as the
Victimisation Scale. High scores indicated they were bullying others relatively often.
15
2 – School Discipline Committee questionnaire: the School Discipline Committee questionnaire
covered two main aspects.
The first aspect is the use of programme interventions and relevant activities, such as attending
a training course, getting the manual and training materials, and participating in committee
activities.
The second aspect is the effectiveness of programme interventions, including the training
manual, based on the six methods for intervention with those involved in bullying: direct
sanctions, restorative practice, mediation, support group, shared concern, and strengthening the
victim.
3 – Parent questionnaire: this questionnaire mainly covers parents’ attendance of awareness-
raising sessions held by schools, receipt of the parent manual, and parents’ views of the
challenges that face their children in schools.
4 – School questionnaire: this questionnaire mainly covers schools’ secondary data on the
number of trained staff, the number of children whose awareness has been raised, and the given
school’s priorities in the next phase of the programme.
Data collection ethics
Informed consent was collected for all participants prior to their participation. Confidentiality
and anonymity were assured by replacing names and other information with encoded identifiers,
with the encoding key kept in a different secure location. No personally identifiable information
was collected from children. To maintain its integrity, whether in written or electronic form, the
data was protected from tampering, loss, theft, or physical damage by limiting access to the data.
Data stored on paper, such as surveys or notebooks, was kept together in a safe, secure location
away from public access and will be disposed of safely after three years.
Rules and procedures were defined for the evaluator in situations where a participant disclosed
information or was suspected to be at risk. The evaluator would report and respond to any
concerns, suspicions, incidents or allegations of actual or potential abuse to a child or young
person in accordance with the engaging office’s applicable procedures. She would fully and
confidentially cooperate in any UNICEF investigation into concerns or allegations of abuse to
children and young people. All charges, convictions, and other outcomes of an offence associated
with exploitation and abuse of a child before/during the evaluation would be immediately
disclosed.
For the risk map, only children who obtained parental consent for it participated in the exercise.
It was initially planned to be a group exercise. However, in keeping with the guidance of the Ethics
Review Board (ERB), the exercise was conducted on an individual basis at a location that could
fully protect the participant’s privacy in view of the potential risks.
The evaluation team completely abided by ERB regulations during the evaluation process.
Limitations
The evaluation had certain limitations. First, there was a high turnover of school social workers
and School Discipline Committee members, as some of the staff trained in the period from 2014
16
to 2016 moved to other schools. To mitigate that, we asked the schools to define and invite staff,
teachers and social workers who were still working at the school and had been involved in the
programme at several stages. Secondly, the control group sample consisted of just two schools,
as the third and fourth schools were not approved by the MOE, so the evaluator did her best to
engage the two available schools’ students, and called them back multiple times to ensure that
the online questionnaires were filled in by the schools, committees, and staff. Thirdly, there were
not enough documents to respond to certain questions related to efficiency in the spending of
programme funds, and whether there was a more cost-effective means of implementation that
would achieve the expected results. Finally, the programme had no programme documents or
monitoring data to capture the progress of implementation or provide an overall programme
description.
Evaluation findings
The findings are presented by evaluation criterion: relevance, coherence, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability.19
5. Relevance
In evaluating relevance, the evaluator captured the extent to which the programme objectives
coincided with beneficiaries’ needs, priorities, and expectations at all levels.
5-1 Programme relevance to the SCMC 2017–2021 strategy
H.H. Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, the President of the SCMC, launched the National Strategy
for Motherhood and Childhood in 2017 with the vision that “all children enjoy all their state-
guaranteed rights, growing up in a healthy, safe and supportive environment that develops
abilities and skills.” A meeting with SCMC representatives highlighted that the programme was
relevant to the SCMC’s 2017–2021 strategy in line with the UAE government’s efforts to
strengthen child protection policy and deliver high-quality education.
An interview with the SCMC’s lead technical adviser showed the level of engagement between
UNICEF and the SCMC under several programmes, including a 1000-day programme on
parenthood skills, a programme on adulthood and adolescence, and the anti-bullying programme
in the UAE. The SCMC’s lead technical adviser indicated that the programme was consistent with
the SCMC’s child protection efforts. He also highlighted the joint efforts behind the anti-bullying
award.
The Council, collaborating with various entities, launched strategies aimed at promoting welfare
and development for mothers and children in all fields and establishing a primary point of
reference to guide professionals and organisations towards continued progress in maternal care
and childcare.20
19 Respondents were identified in the following four categories: School Discipline Committee members (social workers, activities
teachers, and special education teachers), students, parents, and school principals.

5-2 Programme relevance to the MOE strategy
The MOE’s mission is to “develop an innovative education system for a knowledge-based and
global competitive society that embraces all age groups in order to meet future labour-market
demand by ensuring the quality of the Ministry of Education’s outputs, and provide the best
services for internal and external customers.”21 The MOE implemented the programme via the
National Programme for the Prevention of Bullying by establishing a National Commission for the
Prevention of Bullying in the School Environment and a support team for the National Week for
the Prevention of Bullying in Schools, creating an approved training nucleus for bullying,
preparing training workshops for all school staff, and holding the National Week for the
Prevention of Bullying. The evaluation found that the MOE’s National Programme for the
Prevention of Bullying in the School Environment and the Anti-Bullying Programme, the subject
of this evaluation, were complementary and reinforced each other.
5-3 Programme relevance vis-à-vis the Ministry of the Interior
Since the promulgation of the Wadeema Law in 2016, the Ministry of the Interior has played an
important role in investigating Wadeema Law violations and ensuring that the law is enforced,
especially against abusers.22 The evaluation revealed the following active anti-bullying services:
use of the Hemayati app, emails, the ministry website, and a hotline. The ministry also offers
lectures at schools through the community police department. The ministry holds awareness
sessions at school level to explain more about child rights, the protection cycle, and measures
necessary to protect children from being involved in any abuse-related incidents. Cases may be
reported by parents, the school, the ministry, or other parties. The Anti-Bullying Programme,
the subject of this evaluation, was relevant to the reinforcement of the measures pursued by
the Ministry of the Interior.
5-4 Programme relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals
21 Ministry of Education, National Educational System in the United Arab Emirates, 2020/2021,
https://www.moe.gov.ae/En/ImportantLinks/Documents/matrix/MOEducationSystem2020-2021.pdf. In addition, some of the
MOE’s strategic objectives are to deliver inclusive quality education, including pre-school education, achieve excellent leadership
and educational efficiency, and ensure that learning environments are safe, conducive, and challenging.
22 In addition, the ministry has established the Child Protection Centre, with the aim of implementing processes geared towards
the provision of safety, security and protection for all children living in the UAE or coming as visitors.

5-5 To what extent are the programme’s intervention approaches evidence-based?
The evaluation concluded that programme interventions were
Awareness-raising using the
based on sound evidence and well tested. More specifically, in
programme materials at
2014, a situation analysis of the school environment in the UAE
Hamdan Bin Zayed School
was conducted to develop a framework for protection and safety
in the school and learning environment.31 The programme design
was guided by global best practices, specifically those from
Australia, Finland (KiVa) and the United States (Olweus Bullying
Prevention Programme). Experts from such programmes in these
countries shared their experiences with various UAE education,
health and protection authorities. The training manual is based
on six methods for intervention with those involved in bullying:
Direct Sanctions, Restorative Practice, Mediation, Support
Group, Shared Concern, and Strengthening the Victim.
A section on social skills activities was also drawn up, which
compiled different interactive activities to equip students with
adequate social skills. The methodology of the school-based
bullying programme is based on the active involvement of
students and encompasses changes in the attitudes of school
staff, improvements in the social environment in general, and
awareness-raising among parents.
23 By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including,
among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality,
promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s
contribution to sustainable development.
24 Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, nonviolent, inclusive and
effective learning environments for all.
25 By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training
in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing states
26 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual
and other types of exploitation.
27 Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment
of all women and girls at all levels.
28 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race,
ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.
29 End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.
30 Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels. For more information, see UN, Sustainable
Development Goals, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/.
31 This was conducted by way of general group discussions with parents, school staff, social workers and students. The situation
analysis yielded the following results, used to guide programme interventions: students were subjected to bullying by other
students; students were subjected to bullying by their teachers; younger students (11-12 years) were franker about the problems
they faced; verbal bullying was the most common form of bullying; few teachers reported being subjected to verbal and physical
abuse by students; students were under constant surveillance by school staff; school staff and parents did not acknowledge the
negative impact of bullying on children; school staff are not able to identify signs of bullying; parents were not actively involved
in their children’s school.
19
5-6 To what extent did the programme adapt to the new realities triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic?
COVID-19 posed a major challenge to the programme’s implementation. In-person school
attendance ended and online education methods were introduced. Key bullying and child
protection issues engendered by COVID-19 were bullying via text messages and emails. The
programme responded to this type of bullying effectively, with the training manual and the
programme’s relevant interventions covering online bullying such as receiving unpleasant
messages from other students via computer, phone, and/or online. However, four other online
protection challenges emerged with COVID-19. The first was the privacy of families, as students
had their cameras on during classes. Their mothers complained about home privacy. The other
challenges were extensive use of YouTube and social media, the emergence of “being-on-trend
phenomena”,32 and advertisements that ran when online games were played – some of them
had a violent and sexual connotation.
5-7 Programme design and implementation alignment with gender mainstreaming

32 I have used this term to express social media trends (which include repeating certain idioms, selfies, engaging in certain
challenges, wearing certain clothes and haircuts, or acting toward others in a certain manner) that emerge, with children and
young people imitating these trends without taking time to understand their meaning or implications.
33 Possible recommendation: if UNICF and the SCMC are planning to scale up the programme, gender can be mainstreamed at all
programme levels, starting with a definition of gender challenges at the planning phase – set gender-based outcomes and
relevant interventions, and how these interventions will be monitored to deliver specific gender-based outcomes. In addition, a
gender transformative approach can offer options that would support girls’ leadership.
20
5-8 Programme relevance to the human rights-based approach (HRBA)
The integration of human rights into the broad range of all UN activities is at the centre of ongoing
efforts by the UN. The UN’s specialised agencies, programmes, and bodies have repeatedly
shown their commitment to the mainstreaming of human rights in their work; in 2003, they
agreed on a common understanding relating to the content of a human rights-based approach
(HRBA) to programming.34 The HRBA has two objectives: (a) to empower rights-holders in
asserting and exercising their rights; and (b) to strengthen the capacity of duty-bearers, who have
the obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfil human rights.35 These objectives are
pursued through human rights principals, such as participation, accountability,
Shape 2. Human rights-based approach

and non-discrimination. Table 8 summarises how the programme follows human right principles.
The evaluation concludes that the programme is highly relevant in each aspect analysed.
34UNESCO, Human Rights-Based Approach to Programming, https://en.unesco.org/human-rights/hrba
35 Rights-holders are individuals or social groups that have particular entitlements in relation to duty-bearers.
Duty-bearers are state or non-state actors, that have the obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfil human rights of rights-
holders. The HRBA is underpinned by five key human rights principles, also known as PANEL: Participation, Accountability, Non-
discrimination and Equality, Empowerment and Legality.

6. Coherence
In evaluating coherence, the evaluator captured the extent to which relevant interventions
(particularly policies) supported or undermined the programme.
6-1 Programme alignment with relevant school policies
In the first few years, few school polices were in place. However, since 2018, several new polices
have been introduced. Shape 3 summarises schools’ key polices and structures.
The key dominant structure in a school is the School Discipline Committee,36 which encompasses
all student aspects, such as appearance, uniform, attendance, school violence, and bullying – a
fourth-degree violation. To move up to the next grade, students must score 60/100 in their
committee assessment. Students who fail cannot move on to the next grade. Interviews and
group discussions with the School Discipline Committee have indicated that their approaches to
these cases include warning students and their parents several times before deploying the
sanctions mentioned in the code of conduct. Students and their families try to avoid being held
back a grade under the code of conduct. Likewise, social workers do not want children to be held

22
back a grade either. However, there is a gap here as educators and school social workers have
few resources they can use to change students’ aggressive behaviours. The pilot schools have
materials on anti-bullying, but the code of conduct covers a huge number of topics – not only
bullying, but also issues such as appearance, uniform, smoking, drugs, sexual harassment, misuse
of computers and school appliances, taking photos of others without their consent, driving cars
and controlling other vehicles, absence, and being late to school.
The following findings emerged from the key informant interviews and general group discussions:
• The punitive nature of sanctions under the code of conduct are not enough, as restorative
practices are needed;
• Restorative practices and behavioural-change activities are more effective than punitive
sanctions;
• This does not mean detracting from the code of conduct, but complementing it with a
behavioural-change component;
• Awareness-raising is a critically effective method in decreasing the number of cases subject
to sanctions under the code of conduct;
• Several schools have few social workers. Some schools have employed student officers to fill
the social-worker gap. It is also worth mentioning that some schools have employed non-
specialised staff to do social-worker jobs. Also, staff available in the Northern Emirates tended
to lack suitable qualifications and the training needed for their job.

School Discipline Committee members currently employ the same type of activities for all child-
related violations, including discussions with children, plays, and school initiatives. Nonetheless,
there is little evidence that using the same social activities for all violation types is effective. Each
type of abuse/violation needs a commensurate set of interventions. These interventions should
be planned on three levels: first, awareness and prevention; second, behavioural change when
the violation takes place; and third, a dispute settlement process that ensures justice among
students when a violation happens. However, overall, the programme brought about social
behaviour changes reflecting the code of conduct. The MOE representative has highlighted that
that they receive reports about cases and sanctions that have been imposed in response to
student bullying, but the actual reasons behind the aggressive behaviour are not addressed.37
“The Ministry receives reports from schools about bullying cases and sanctions that have been
imposed in response to student bullying, but the actual reasons behind the aggressive behaviour
need to be treated” – child protection unit head, Emirates Establishment for Education
6-2 Programme support of the operationalisation of the anti-bullying and anti-violence mechanism
The MOE issues its anti-bullying policy under Ministerial Decree 645 for 2020. This policy offered
a comprehensive approach to bullying phenomena. The policy drew on the programme’s
concepts and definitions, and international best practices. The policy highlighted the programme
as a preventive mechanism to raise students’ awareness about bullying in schools and provide
behavioural-change support. Unlike the school code of conduct, the programme did not offer a
case management structure. It did, however, offer a reporting system. The ministry initiated the
policy for purposes of prevention rather than case management. The decree also mentioned
other anti-bullying programmes, e.g. the National Pact Initiative, which enhances Emirati
students’ cognitive and personal skills in order to prepare them for the knowledge-based
economy and promote a culture of innovation and leadership. This is in addition to the student
code of conduct monitoring students’ behaviour at school. The decree mentioned the formation
of an anti-bullying committee to pursue a plan that would address anti-bullying, raise awareness,
and report on cases. The programme also mentioned an ethics course to be taught as a class. In
addition, the decree provided monitoring and reporting forms that are to be used by schools to
report cases to the MOE. The national policy acknowledged the UNICEF SCMC Anti-Bullying
Programme by using the programme’s materials to raise awareness and a questionnaire to
monitor and report cases to the MOE. The policy was prepared and issued in 2020, a few weeks
before the COVID-19 outbreak and seven years after the programme started. However, schools
have also been using interventions developed in the early stages of the programme, especially
manuals, training materials, and pre- and post-knowledge questionnaires. The materials on anti-
bullying in schools clearly stemmed primarily from the UNICEF SCMC programme.
6-3 Is there an overlap with MOE interventions?
As mentioned in the last point, the MOE policy referred to three anti-bullying programmes in the
implementation the National Pact and the student code of conduct.
37Possible recommendation: in the scale-up phase, there is an urgent need to cover many important child protection topics that
are interrelated with bullying, to deepen the current anti-bullying interventions in order to capture the huge change in bullying
following COVID-19, and to have a comprehensive approach to cases before, during and after their resolution.
25
However, the evaluation found little evidence of this overlap at school level. These programmes
jointly contribute to the school bullying challenge. A key knowledge material at school level is the
anti-bullying manual developed by the programme. Ministerial Decree 645 for 2020 on the anti-
bullying policy has given impetus to the UNICEF programme and the MOE’s willingness to
cooperate with UNICEF.
The policy drew on the programme’s concepts and definitions, international best practices,
training materials, and the reporting system developed under the UNICEF programme.
The policy highlighted the programme as a preventive mechanism to raise students’ awareness
of bullying in schools and provide behavioural-change activities. Unlike the school code of
conduct, the programme did not offer a case management structure.
The national policy has acknowledged the anti-bullying programme by drawing on the
programme’s materials to raise awareness and the programme questionnaire to monitor and
report cases to the MOE.
The reason why the school code of
Example of the programme materials used in raising
conduct did not overlap with the anti- students’ awareness
bullying programme is that each of them – Al Asyael School for Girls
plays a different role. Also, the anti-
bullying programme pursues behavioural
change.
Some of the best practices under the
programme are as follows:
• the anti-bullying programme has
offered behavioural-change
interventions to support the school
code of conduct and enhance
students’ positive behaviour;
• these interventions offered strong
support for prevention and
awareness;
• the programme can be enhanced by
further supporting interventions in
the dispute settlement process and at punitive stages.
The evaluation concludes that the programme is coherent and aligned with national strategies
and policies.
7. Efficiency
The evaluation looked at how resources/materials (funds, expertise, time, etc.) are

7-1 To what extent have the programme’s funds and resources been utilised efficiently?
The evaluator did not receive the relevant documents. The UNICEF UAE programme associate
reported that most of the programme costs were covered by the government, using their
resources-management systems.38
7-2 How well was the establishment and implementation of the programme planned and managed?39
The programme was developed and implemented by UNICEF, the SCMC and the MOE. The MOE
drew up a national anti-bullying policy that covered all the programme’s aspects, including
definitions of bullying, types of bullying, training materials, and the formation of the School
Discipline Committee.40
Three factors affected programme management:
▪ the Covid-19 outbreak paused education, and new bullying issues emerged;
▪ the MOE split into two entities: the MOE and the Emirates Schools Establishment. It took
time to establish the programme within the MOE after these structural reforms;
▪ follow-ups on the programme’s yearly activities have been limited.
A key highlight is that, after the delivery of programme interventions (training and materials), the
pilot schools themselves take a lead in implementing and sustaining the programme’s activities.
7-3 How often did data collection and monitoring activities impact the results?
The data collection activities benefited the programme’s design and implementation. Data was
collected at several stages of the programme.
38 Possible recommendation for scale-up purposes: the programme needs to enforce clear implementation modalities. UN
organisations have several models of partnership with governments, and a study of the feasibility of the options described below
is recommended. A joint implementation model: this model applies where both parties finance the programme together. They
engage in planning, implementation, and monitoring via a joint implementation unit. In this model, implementation takes place
within the government structure. Each government implementer offers detailed regular reporting to the joint unit. The unit also
has the right to conduct mid-term assessments and third-party monitoring to ensure the quality of the application. A contract-
based implementation model: here, the government finances most or all the programme activities. Under this model, the two
parties sign a contract defining all the programme's aspects, especially the roles of the signatories. The programme is managed
by a programme steering committee, with all relevant stakeholders engaged in the decision-making process. Implementation is
mostly via the donor agency. On the technical side, UNICEF can assess the SCMC’s role within several childhood, motherhood and
education policies to define gaps that can effectively be filled by the SCMC. Since the SCMC is not an executive arm, it can offer
a third-party cross cutting research and monitoring function to several childhood issues, including bullying and child protection.
39 To better manage the programme in the scale-up phase, procedures need to be devised under a results programme where all
parties agree to decrease the current level of bullying. The results programme should have a shorter timeline to capture changes
in the nature of bullying. A strong follow-up monitoring system needs to be built, and data should be collected regularly to ensure
the quality of implementation and enhance learning.
40 The MOE has formed The National Commission for the Prevention of Bullying in the School Environment with the following
partners: the Ministry of Culture; the Ministry of Health and Prevention; the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Community
Development; the Dubai Police; the telecommunications regulation authority; the Sharjah Education Council; the Dubai Health
Authority; the Youth Council; the Community Development Authority; Abu Dhabi Media; Sharjah media cooperation; Dubai media,
including the Department of Education and Knowledge, Social Services Department – Sharjah, the National Programme for
Happiness and Well-being, the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children, Child Safety, Dubai Knowledge, the Supreme Council
of Family Affairs – Sharjah Khalifa Media City.
27
▪ In the early stage of the programme, a situation analysis was conducted to analyse the
bullying situation. The situation analysis was used to define the bullying types and stages of
interventions.
▪ At the capacity-building stage, pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted to
validate the programme interventions. This data was used to test the programme’s key
interventions and ensure its impact.
While the programme was taken up by the MOE, there is little evidence that any data was
collected, except for the schools’ self-monitoring data. Three factors affected the programme
monitoring:
1. the lack of a project document with a clear MOE plan to report data regularly;
2. the lack of regular reporting by schools to the MOE;
3. the lack of regular data collection for monitoring and learning. This was highlighted by the
UNICEF programme associate: “There is a need for a yearly reporting system that offers
data about bullying cases so we can use this data to measure the programme’s
performance. Also, a steering committee that works on these reports and leads discussions
on them among stakeholders”. Some schools use Excel spreadsheets to report cases to the
MOE, but other schools, especially in the Northen Emirates, have little konwldge about the
reporting process using Excel.
Additional data gaps were pinpointed by the MOE. Schools which did not participate in the
programme lack a clear methodology to calculate bullying rates. In the UAE, there is also a need
to support national statistics to calculate the national prevalence of bullying rates.
The evaluation concludes that it was not possible to analyse and present all aspects of efficiency
due to a lack of critical data.
8. Effectiveness
Within the scope of the effectiveness criterion, the evaluation looked into critical positive and
negative short- and long-term consequences spurred by the programme, either directly or
indirectly.
8-1 To what extent have the target groups been reached?
The programme has reached the target groups in the pilot schools effectively. Trainers were
trained once at the beginning of the programme, and schools have since delivered training to
their staff on a yearly basis. Likewise, school staff have raised awareness among children and
their parents. The programme has reached around 80-100 school students each year, with both
female and male students receiving awareness sessions. The average school size is 475 students
according to data reported by schools. The average number of students reached, as estimated
by this evaluation, is 445 students per school. That means 6,230 in the first phase of 14 schools
from 2014–2015, with a total 12,460 students, and for the second phase at 64 schools 28,480
students were reached yearly; 227,840 students were reached in 2016–2023. The total
programme reach is 240,300 students.
28
School staff, teachers and social workers have acknowledged the usefulness of programme
interventions, especially programme manuals and training materials. More than 90% of school
staffs and social workers indicated that they have engaged with the programme by raising
students’ awareness of bullying. 96.4% of them documented bullying cases and 90.5%
participated in the anti-bullying week organised by the MOE. 87% attended the training
programme and 82.1% received the training manuals.
Only 41.7% of School Discipline Committee members/staff participated in the Anti-Bullying
Award. The main reason behind the low participation rate is a lack of awareness about the award.

Also, 85.3% of school staff and social workers reported that bullying rates had decreased after
implementing the programme. 14.7% think the bullying rates are the same or increasing due to
the emergence of online bullying and the effects of social media.
The most commonly used strategies reported by the School Discipline Committee members are
the raising of children’s awareness, the reporting and documenting of bullying cases, and
attendance of training sessions organised within the framework of TOT.

Schools also drew up yearly plans to deal with bullying. These plans contain awareness activities,
such as plays, drawings, student activities, and school competitions. Parents benefited from
attending training and awareness sessions, where they received a parents’ manual and

8-2 Are the programme objectives realistic? To what extent has the programme achieved its planned
goals?
The programme has no programme document or time-bound quantitative targets. Accordingly,
the programme results were assessed in relation to the general objective of reducing bullying in
schools and creating a safe environment. The programme made progress towards the general
objective of creating a safe school environment and preventing school violence and bullying. To
30
measure if the programme had reached its overall goal, a sample of 1,330 students responded to
a questionnaire measuring three behaviours: students’ pro-social behaviour, students reporting
being bullied, and students reporting bullying others. The results are presented in the following
breakdown: control intervention versus intervention group, by Emirate, and Emirate nationals
versus expatriates.
Students from 14 schools participated in this evaluation – 12 intervention/pilot schools and two
control schools. The sample covers boys’ schools, girls’ schools, and mixed schools. There were
11 public schools and three private schools. Both private and public schools have national and
foreign students. The sample selection method is proportion-to-size, meaning that the sample
represents the programme’s pilot school distribution. Since the pilot programme has not been
implemented in all schools, the sample does not represent all schools in the UAE. For further
details, see the methodology section.
Intervention group versus control group41
Students acting pro-socially: students in the intervention group are 8.24% less likely to play
sport, 4.48% less likely to get good marks, and 1.1% more likely to make friends. Bullying
behaviour was sometimes accompanied by pro-social skills. Research noticed, in several
studies, that bullying students are generally social. These studies suggest that most children
and young people who bully others wield considerable power within their peer network and
that high-status perpetrators tend to be perceived by peers as being popular, socially skilled,
and leaders.42

Students being bullied: the evaluation found that there are significant differences between the
control group and intervention group. Students in the intervention group are 27.31% less likely
to be called names, 41.2% less likely to get picked on by other students, 35.37% less likely to be
made fun of, 46.84% less likely to get hit by others, and 73.60% less likely to receive unpleasant
messages from other students via computer, phone, and/or online.
41 The intervention group is the group of sampled schools benefiting from the programme; the control group is a
group of sampled schools that have characteristics similar to the beneficiary schools, but have not benefited from
the programme. For details, please refer to 4. Evaluation Methodology.

Overall, the programme clearly had a positive impact on the school environment in each of the
pilot schools to varying degrees and offered the whole school community a different level of
understanding of the prevention of school violence and bullying.
Emirate nationals versus expatriates
Students acting pro-socially: expatriate students have more social and cooperative skills than
Emiratis. The Emirate national students represent 79.8% of the sample and the expatriate
students 20.2% of the sample.

8-3 Has the programme managed to reach out to the most vulnerable children?
To answer this question, we need to start by explaining the four types of vulnerabilities as defined
by schools: economic vulnerabilities, students with disabilities, parental neglect of children, and
students who live with a single parent (see shape 4).
School staff and management conduct a systemic assessment of the students’ situation and they
offer support when possible. In the Northern Emirates, social workers have records of cases with
relatively large numbers of students. They prefer to channel support via the government, or via
the Shekh Khalifa Foundation or a similar foundation.

Regarding students with disabilities, relatively few cases are identified. Schools have a
programme specifically dedicated to them. Most students showed sympathy and support
towards students with disabilities (“people of determination”, as named by students). Self-
identified cases reported in the student questionnaire came to 2% in the control schools and
1.7% in the intervention schools. The main types of disabilities mentioned are hearing, mobility,
and visual impairments. Other students mentioned learning difficulties and distraction.
The number of cases of family neglect is low. However, schools still find them challenging to
address. Students with single parents have

behaviour is sometimes explained as being associated with psychological illness. However, the
programme generally addresses bullying, including that against vulnerable groups of children.
It is recommended that a special module be introduced to deal not only with bullied students,
but also with students who bully others, in order to integrate them into the school community.
The programme could also devise a vulnerability assessment tool that can assess multi-
dimensional vulnerabilities.
Additionally, both aggressive bullying students and victims have a degree of vulnerability.
Therefore, there is a need to create additional advanced modules to support and enhance the
life skills of regularly bullied students and another module to deal with aggressive students.
They should also be provided with additional support by a support team, including their
parents, teachers, and psychologists. In most cases, the most vulnerable students need
referrals to organisations beyond the education sector, such as child protection authorities and
community-based service providers, which are specialised in working with vulnerable children
and their families.

student knowledge, developing teachers professionally, and helping to create a school-wide
approach to anti-bullying”.
8-5 Level of satisfaction of each beneficiary group?
The level of satisfaction was measured across the evaluation questionnaires. It was linked to the
key benefits they got from the programme (explained in 8-1). It is important to highlight that not
all the interviewed groups received the same benefit. The School Discipline Committee, for
example, is composed of limited number of individuals. The committee should define the
responsibilities of its members so that everyone does not participate in the decision-making
process of the committee, but they contribute to the committee’s work. The anti-bullying award
was not recognised by several social workers and School Discipline Committees.

To measure satisfaction rates across all the programme activities, the evaluation measured
satisfaction among School Discipline Committees, school principals, parents and children. The
results for the School Discipline Committees show that the anti-bullying week received the
highest satisfaction rate among all school activities, as 100% of the School Discipline Committees
are satisfied, followed by the resolution of students’ cases and training materials. The training
materials, for example, got a higher satisfaction rate than the programme’s training manuals.
The programme’s manuals need to be localised rather than translated so that they are easily
understood by any school staff. The manuals should also add more examples and situations from
life so that school staff can easily judge and investigate cases. Investigations also need to be
conducted to verify cases. In addition, terminology needs to be adjusted to meet the local context.

As for students, the
evaluation used a multi-level approach to understand their satisfaction. It started by asking how
they normally act when they face any bullying or abuse. 28% of students responded that they
usually talk to their parents. 24% usually talk to social workers, 23.9% talk to a teacher, and 18.5%
talk to their peers. 3.4% of students responded that they stopped it or took revenge themselves,

Students who face bullying issues were asked if they talked to anyone. Around 14.3% of students
remained silent, around 3.4% stopped the bully either by fighting back or replying to the assault,
and less than 1% talked to the bully.
81.3% of students decided to talk to someone. Those who decided to talk to someone were asked
how bullying cases were handled after they mentioned the case. 79.9% of students responded
that the person they spoke to offered to help them. Among those students, 72.9% indicated that
that action was taken. Only 53.7% of students were satisfied with the proposed solution, 30.03%
were not satisfied with the proposed solution, and 16.28% thought that their complaints were
not addressed. Attention should be paid to the 14.28% students who remained silent about
bullying issues. 20.1% of students who mentioned a bullying case to someone indicated that no

The schools who benefited from the programme devised annual plans to deal with bullying,
encompassing awareness activities, such as plays, drawings, student’s activities, and school
competitions. Parents benefited from attending training and awareness sessions, where they
received the parent manual. They also participated in the anti-bullying week.

The evaluation found that the capacity-building activities were effective for two reasons. First,
they became reference points used by schools to educate and teach staff, students, and
parents about bullying. Secondly, school staff and social workers regularly used the training
materials and programme exercises to improve students’ awareness.
The evaluation tracked the knowledge of school staff and the use of the key trained skills, and
found that the support-group method is the most effective method, followed by restorative
practice. The shared-concern method came third. Direct sanctions were the least effective
method, and strengthening the victim also had little effect, despite its importance. This
information should guide the programme’s upcoming review of the content of training
materials.43

These results were confirmed when school committee members were asked how useful the key
knowledge imparted had been in their experience. They found all the student-support methods
useful, especially the shared-concern method and restorative practice.
8-7 What happens to the cases reported and what are the response mechanisms?
After students complain about bullying, social workers warn the bully. If the bullying stops, then
no case is reported.44 If it is repeated, the school calls the bully’s parents to inform them of the
case, indicating their child’s behaviour and possible sanctions based on the school code of
conduct. If it is repeated for a third time, the parents are expected come to the school and sign
a written commitment form which indicates that the child will not repeat the bullying. If the issue
persists, the school applies the school code of conduct procedures and deducts degrees.
Cases that a school considers to be parental abuses are reported, in accordance with the
Wadeema Law, to the child protection unit at the MOE, which coordinates with the police to
keep the parents accountable.
9. Sustainability
9-1 To what extent have UNICEF, the SCMC, and the MOE promoted a spirit of joint ownership of the
programme?
The programme created strong ownership for pilot schools by delivering programme
interventions to the MOE. The training of trainers gave schools the impetus to sustain the
programme interventions. The majority of the staff trained were school principals and
44 The code of conduct has four degrees of deduction. First-degree violation: 4 points are deducted; second-degree violation: 8
points are deducted; third-degree violation: 12 points are deducted; fourth-degree violation: the student fails the grade. However,
some cases where bullying is accompanied with physical harm or socially unacceptable verbal insults are reported directly without
having to follow these procedures. Extreme cases are either reported to the MOE, which refers them to the police, especially if
there is physical harm, or a student is given a fail mark as per the code of conduct. Some schools prevent students from applying
for the next year if their behaviour has not changed.
As for parents’ or caregivers’ violations against children, the school discusses these with the parents and warns them. If the
students do not improve, they report them to the MOE using an assessment from. If a violation concerns students’ absence and
persistently late homework or other educational issues, the case is referred to the MOE for assessment, and the MOE may turn
to the police for action pursuant to the Wadeema Law. If a case concerns family abuse or violations, schools take the same path
of reporting to the MOE and then the police for an investigation pursuant to the Wadeema Law.
42
experienced social workers. These trained trainers enabled schools to be the key sustainability
actor. Each year, the trained staff at schools conducted refresher training and awareness sessions
for other staff, who raised students’ and parents’ awareness of anti-bullying.
9-2 Have legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms encouraged the programme’s sustainability?
The programme’s sustainability measures are described below.
• The training of trainers is known to be one of the strongest sustainability measures. As per
the data presented in the effectiveness section of this report, every year several training
sessions take place for school staff, teachers, and social workers, in addition to awareness
sessions for parents and students.
• Ministerial Decree 645, issued in 2020, constitutes a legislative sustainability measure. It was
developed seven years after the programme started. However, due to the COVID-19 crisis
and the suspension of in-person education, the anti-bullying committee and the MOE
reporting system have not been fully activated.
• As for institutional sustainability, the programme is currently managed by the MOE. However,
no refresher training has been provided. The reporting of data has been irregular and
inconsistent among schools. This may affect the programme’s long-term sustainability.
• Little information has been registered about financial sustainability.
• When School Discipline Committee members were asked to suggest sustainability measures,
some of them recommended forming and training a new anti-bullying committee. Others
recommended revising the programme with a new implementation framework (including a
full system of training, committee and school reporting to the MOE’s child protection unit,
and the Wadeema Law), devising a plan to avoid staff transfers to new schools, and increasing
the amount of training.

9-3 How sustainable are the results achieved thus far for the broader school community at the 64 pilot
schools?
The programme has been proven to be sustainable from 2014 to the present. School principals
and School Discipline Committee members are planning to continue using the programme
materials. However, the high turnover of school staff and social workers may affect the
programme’s sustainability. In this regard, refresher training is recommended. The school anti-
bullying week initiated by the MOE and the anti-bullying award initiated by the SCMC are planned
to continue being organised by both entities.
For the programme’s scale-up, School Discipline Committee members were asked how the
programme’s interventions could be sustained. They recommended forming an anti-bullying
committee, retraining staff, and devising a plan to deal with high School Discipline Committee
turnover. They also urged more field visits, increased awareness, and improvements in the case
reporting system.

control school had no social worker
and assigned a student affairs officer to fill the position temporarily. The MOE and SCMC could
draw up a one-year programme to train a social worker and equip them with the necessary skills.
Graduates from relevant education institutions could join the programme to fill the gap.
The evaluation concludes that there is a high possibility for the programme to be sustained if
additional technical resources are forthcoming – see the annexes for details.
10. Looking Ahead
The bullying issue will remain a key priority for the programme, as verbal abuse was
reported as a key challenge by 32.2% of schools’ committee members. Relational bullying
was reported by 14.5% of the members. Gestural abuses were reported by 8.1%, and
physical means of abuse were reported by 4.8% of the members.
10-1 Stakeholders’ priorities
Her Highness the Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Motherhood & Childhood,
representing the UAE government, has highlighted the programme’s goals and expressed
her willingness to completely eradicate bullying behaviour among students. This goal is
44
ambitious but not unattainable; it can be divided into sub-targets for careful monitoring
with a dynamic programme concept.
All the stakeholders interviewed expressed a willingness to expand the cooperation to create a
wider child protection umbrella. For example, the lead technical adviser at the SCMC highlighted
the fact that bullying takes many forms and there is a need to include other child protection
challenges in the programme besides bullying. The programme also needs to be adapted to
emerging changes. Furthermore, the government needs to develop these initiatives into
permanent policies so that future generations can benefit from them.
The UNICEF GAO deputy director highlighted the fact that UNICEF is exploring the possibility of
cooperation beyond bullying. She also pointed to the scarcity of data in the region and the need
to carry out more research for evidence-based interventions.

emerging needs
Research has shown that bullying and abuse are by no means standalone factors. Children who
are frequently bullied are nearly three times more likely to feel like an outsider at school and
more than twice as likely to miss school as those who are not frequently bullied. Children who
are bullied have worse educational outcomes than children who do not. They score lower in
mathematics and reading tests. The more often they are bullied, the worse their scores tend to
be. Children who are frequently bullied are also more likely to expect to leave formal education
after finishing secondary school than those children who are not frequently bullied.
School violence and bullying affect the overall attainment of the student population at a school.
Poor discipline and an unsafe school environment are associated with lower academic
achievements. Bullying can have a significant impact on children’s mental health, quality of life,
45
and risk behaviours. Children who are bullied are about twice as likely to feel lonely, have a
sleeping disorder, and have contemplated suicide as those who are not bullied.45
In the following section, different tools were used to obtain the views of various duty-bearers
and rights-holders about the school environment, key challenges, and needs.
10-2 Students’ priorities
Students were asked to assess the school environment by means of two data collection tools: a
student questionnaire and risk maps. The questionnaire results revealed key school-environment
challenges. It was found that 54% of students have complained about the quality of the toilets,
39.5% of students lost belongings in the past month, and 20% of students indicated that teachers
did not allow them to go and get water or go to the toilet during lessontime. 17.8% of students
responded that no drinking water is available, and 11% do not feel safe on the way to school.

For detailed aspects of the school environment, a risk map was used to assess the school-wide
environment. 93 students participated in the risk-map exercise. 56 of them were girls and 37
were boys. The exercise revealed the findings described below.
a. Toilets
55.4% of girls do not feel comfortable using the toilets. They complained about the cleanliness,
water cuts, abusive words written on the walls, and rumours about other students written on
the walls. Additionally, some girls congregate in the toilets to talk or to use phones, which is
disturbing for others.
13.9% of boys were not comfortable about the toilets. Some boys sometimes meet in the toilets to
smoke and hide electronic cigarettes there, use phones, and occasionally fight. Some boys avoid
going to toilet so as not to be bothered by others. Some schools have used surveillance cameras
directed at the toilet door to watch who comes in and out.

b. Canteen
The evaluation found that 32.5% of girls and 31% of boys complained about the canteen. For
example, some schools have created one lane for each grade, which is perceived as insufficient,
given the number of students using the canteen. In some schools, students are not satisfied with
the type or quality of the meals. Sometimes, there is not enough food for all students to buy. In
one of the schools, expired milk was sold to children.
c. Classrooms
35.71% of the interviewed girls and 30.6% of the interviewed boys commented on the classrooms,
despite the investments made and the high quality of the school infrastructure. Some students
face challenges in the classroom, e.g. they did not like the chairs. They dislike sitting in the last
row of the classroom. It was also mentioned that the electric board sometimes stops working.
Finally, air-conditioners are sometimes too cold, too hot, or out of order. It is better for any future
infrastructure development to integrate students’ views into selected materials
d. Drinking water
47
Free drinking-water fountains are found in some schools. In other schools, students bring water
from home, or buy it in the canteen. A key challenge is that some students spend the entire
schoolday with no water if the canteen is crowded.
Other places assessed, such as labs, music rooms, and libraries, are comfortable for students.
They are also satisfied with school fencing and roads.
In some schools, teachers are perceived to be a part of the problem. Anecdotally, a girl was
accused by one teacher of having a crush on a male teacher. While this may be normal in other
countries, it is very sensitive in an Arabic context. In this specific case, the girl and her mother
took action against the teacher. The investigation concluded that the girl had not done anything
wrong. This again highlights the importance of the rights-based approach empowering a victim
to act against such abuses.
The risk maps also highlighted other issues, such as comments about colour, hair, and
clothing. They also indicated discrimination against students from different nationalities, a
factor which has emerged in particular from other school discussions.
10-3 School Discipline Committees’ priorities
Verbal abuse was reported as a key school challenge by 32.2% of schools’ committee
members. Relational bullying was reported by 14.5% of schools’ committee members.
Gestural abuse was reported by 8.1%, and physical abuse by 4.8%.
Broadly, School Discipline Committee staff have defined two key areas of work. First, they
need more support on students’ mental health, learning difficulties, smoking and drugs,
and school violence. In addition, they have defined the following challenges faced by
children at school: study difficulties and stress, girls’ transition to maturity, obesity, school

Girls’ transition to maturity is a critical issue as girls and boys need to learn about the
changes that happen physically and emotionally, and how to handle them. Such awareness-
raising is best target at grade 7 or 8, because those in grade 5 and 6 are still relatively young.
48
In several schools, committee members highlighted the need for more support, including
additional trained social workers, more training sessions, more awareness sessions, and
more materials to meet emerging challenges.

challenges faced by students, such as girls’ transition to maturity, study difficulties, gender
equality, obesity, and school infrastructure.

The key school challenges raised by parents are study difficulties, girls’ transition to
maturity, school violence, and obesity. They also requested support in addressing mental
health, learning difficulties, smoking, and violence. Discussions with the SCMC
representative highlighted the need for smoking, drugs, and addiction centres, where
secondary and territory support can be provided. Families need to have addiction cases
diagnosed and medical support provided so that addicted students can be properly
supported.

9-5 External factors that drive bullying
Finally, as bullying has both internal and external drivers, the questionnaire asked duty-
bearers about factors that drive school bullying. School Discipline Committee members
believe that YouTube and social media drive bullying more than peer behaviour, TV, and
movies.

YouTube, Facebook, and Google have child protection polices, but these do not appear to be
sufficient. Furthermore, new platforms, such as TikTok and snapshot, regulate child protection
issues very poorly. Similarly, online advertisements that appear between games are poorly
regulated. The programme could cooperate with international stakeholders, such as the
International Communication Union, and the UAE Ministry of Communication and Information
Technology to strengthen the relevant online child protection policies.
In addition, UNICEF needs to address the effects that artificial intelligence has on child protection
and on children’s mental and psychological health, and come up with a guideline in response.
Governments and parents could use or limit AI applications according to that guideline.
11. Lessons Learnt and Best Practices
51
11-1 Lessons learnt
The programme has offered learning experiences that could support future programming:
▪ Better coordination between UNICEF, the SCMC, and government stakeholders at all
levels would help to better achieve anti-bullying goals. As several government entities at
national level and Emirate level work on child protection inside and outside schools, these
efforts need to be mapped and coordinated to help citizens benefit more from the
services. Coordination needs to be well maintained between the SCMC, the Child
Protection Unit at the MOE, the Ministry of Community Development, the Child
Protection Committee and Centre at the Ministry of the Interior, the Abu Dhabi Early
Childhood Authority, the Family Care Authority – Abu Dhabi, the Nedaa service
established to find missing children, the Child Safety Department of the Supreme Council
for Family Affairs-Sharjah, the Ministry of Health and Prevention, the Endowment and
Minors’ Trust Foundation in Dubai, the Child Safety Department in Sharjah, the Dubai
Early Childhood Development Centre, the National Child Care Centre Dubai, the child
protection hotline, and the Social Care and Minors’ Affairs Foundation.
▪ A clear and comprehensive programme document with the programme’s intended results,
components, activities, timeline, key roles and responsibilities, and a monitoring
framework to support the programme learning process would facilitate performance
tracking. A theory of programme change with identified assumptions, risks, and
bottlenecks could facilitate the attainment of the planned results. There is no programme
monitoring and evaluation plan with tailored data collection activities for learning and
monitoring.
▪ Since the MOE took over the programme’s implementation, there has been little evidence
of data collection and programme performance monitoring, with the exception of schools’
self-monitoring data.
11-2 Best practices
▪ The programme is based on international best practices and successful models. Prior to
its implementation, more than 15 international dedicated anti-bullying programmes were
analysed. Three well-tested programmes in Australia, Finland (KiVa) and the United States
(Olweus Bullying Prevention Programme) were presented prior to implementation.
Experts from the three programmes shared their school-based models to combat bullying,
educational material, lessons learnt, and evidence of the effectiveness of these models in
their respective countries.
▪ Programme ownership: the programme achieved a high level of programme ownership
by schools through engagement, resourcing, and the empowerment of schools to take a
lead in the programme. The training of trainers gave schools the impetus to sustain the
programme’s interventions. Most of the staff trained in the Training of Trainers system
were school principals and experienced social workers. The trained staff enabled schools
52
to be a key sustainability actor. Each year, the trained staff conduct refresher training and
awareness sessions at their school for other staff, who raise students’ and parents’
awareness of anti-bullying.
▪ Reward system at school level: The Anti-bullying Award is a very important tool in
identifying and rewarding the best performing staff, students, and parents. Schools
present Anti-bullying Awards to students who change their behaviour to a positive model.
11-3 Success stories
The evaluator documented three schools that had been exceptionally successful in implementing
the programme. These schools are in Abu Dhabi:
a) School Hamdan Bin Zayed School: the School Discipline Committee is comprehensively
organised. In addition to social workers, they have added music and theatre teachers,
sports teachers, and other types of teachers. The school formed a students’ support group
composed of senior students, who observe and support younger students’ behaviours.
The school invested heavily in delivering awareness sessions in a child-friendly way
through drawings and videos. The school has a strong, diversified team.
b) Al Rawafed private school: this school has fully documented all programme activities. It
has applied all the programme’s processes on an annual basis. The school principal has
been very engaged in the process.
c) Al Shawaekh School for Girls: this school has collected data and analysed identified cases
of bullying.
12. Conclusions
The conclusions presented below are derived from the findings and are associated with the
programme’s objectives of creating a school-wide approach, fostering a safe school
environment, and preventing school violence and bullying.
▪ The programme is particularly relevant to the UAE SCMC 2017–2021 Strategy, and
relevant to the MOE strategy.
▪ The programme has been found to be relevant to the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. More specifically, when it comes to its principles of non-discrimination, the
programme has effectively worked to eliminate all types of discrimination. Children’s
views and opinions have been prioritised at all the programme’s stages.
▪ The programme was devised on the basis of sound evidence, including the use of pre- and
post-assessments. The programme has also been influenced by global best practices.
▪ The programme’s concept contributed to the attainment of the intended results and
outcomes with relevant interventions, including staff training, training materials, and
anti-bullying guides in Arabic and English.
53
▪ The programme needs a programme document summarising and defining the logical
framework, theory of change, outcomes, activities, timeline, and monitoring plan.
▪ The programme is in line with the human rights-based approach from the perspectives of
participation, accountability, non-discrimination, equality, empowerment, and legality.
▪ The programme is aligned with relevant school policies and the school code of conduct.
The programme served to bring about social behavioural changes. It supported the
operationalisation of the anti-bullying and anti-violence mechanism in pilot schools.
▪ However, the programme did not offer a case management structure similar to that of
the school code of conduct. Even so, schools used the programme manuals, training
materials, and pre- and post-knowledge questionnaire.
▪ The programme made progress toward its planned objectives of creating a safe school
environment and preventing school violence and bullying. One of the programme’s
milestones was to create evidence-based anti-bullying manuals that draw on global best
practices. These were created, distributed and used for training purposes. The results
from students’ questionnaires have shown a significant decrease in bullying rates in the
pilot schools in comparison to the control group.
▪ The bullying rates have decreased, as documented by the comparison between control
schools and intervention schools. For example, students’ likelihood of being victimised is
significantly lower among the interventions group.
▪ The programme had a positive impact on the school environment in each of the pilot
schools to varying degrees and offered the whole school community a different level of
understanding in relation to the prevention of school violence and bullying. When it
comes to equity, the programme reached out to the most vulnerable children, and the
evaluation found that school staff and management systemically assess the students’
situation and offer support. Schools have tailored programmes to students with
disabilities.
▪ The programme fostered strong programme ownership by running the training of trainers
among national counterparts as a programme tool. TOT gave schools the lead, as most of
those trained in the TOT scheme were school principals and experienced social workers.
TOT allowed schools to be a key implementation mechanism. The evaluation concludes
that the programme is sustainable legally, institutionally, with a financial sustainability
component depending on the evolving country context.
13. Recommendations
54
The recommendations below are based on findings, conclusions and lessons learnt from this
evaluation. The recommendations have also been guided by good practices identified during the
evaluation stakeholders’ interviews, school meetings, and data analysis.
The recommendations focus on the process of institutionalising and scaling up the programme
nationally, and on actions that need to be taken to ensure the high-quality and sustainable
implementation of the programme in the future.
13-1 Strengthen the service reponse
For the government to ensure the successful scale-up of the programme to national level, it
needs to consider strengthening the service response as detailed below.
▪ Review and support the legal and policy framework. Investment in policy advocacy and
technical support will lead to a strong legal and regulatory framework for child protection
and the associated systems.
▪ Collaboration and partnerships. At national level, this includes partnerships between the
education and other sectoral ministries, civil society organisations, academic institutions,
professional associations, and the media.
▪ Assessment of reporting by schools in relation to the Wadeema Law. This reporting should
expand types of abuse and vulnerabilities.
▪ Evidence-based approaches, informed by accurate and comprehensive data and
systematic monitoring of the results achieved and impacts made.46, 47
▪ Incentives to encourage schools to report data on child abuse to the MOE.
▪ A safe reporting channel that allows students to report staff abuse.
13-2 Support pilot schools in continuing to adopt programme interventions
▪ UNICEF, the SCMC and the MOE should devise a plan to ensure continuity in the support
provided to pilot schools to implement the programme, particularly those pilot schools
that are committed to strengthening their capacities to implement the programme
effectively. During refresher training, additional copies of the manual and the relevant
training materials should be distributed. The pilot schools should also be supported in
their access to the National Anti-bullying Award.
▪ They also need to recognise and reward pilot schools’ efforts and contributions to the
programme from 2014 to the present, specifically school principals, students, School
Discipline Committee members, and parents.
13-3 Improve the programme manuals
UNICEF and the SCMC should have an expert group review the programme manuals with a view
to adding more modules to meet emerging needs and localise the manuals’ content. This will
consolidate understanding among school staff. Specifically:
46 UNICEF, Child Protection System Strengthening, September 2021.
47 UNESCO, Behind the numbers: Ending school violence and bullying.
55
▪ add more examples and situations from school life so that school staff can easily
investigate and verify cases. In addition, the terminology needs to be revisited and
adapted to the local context;
▪ directly and clearly integrate CRC principles and rights protected by national regulations
into the training materials and awareness sessions. This will help children to learn their
rights.
Mainstream gender equality in all the programme components – define gender
challenges at the planning phase, set gender-based outcomes, and devise the relevant
interventions. There should be monitoring to gauge to what extent these interventions
have contributed to specific gender-based outcomes. In addition, the gender
transformative approach can offer options that will encourage girls’ leadership.
13-4 Update the anti-bullying programme materials
It is recommended that the anti-bullying materials be updated to ensure the diversity
and localisation of the content. This can be done by adding more modules to meet
emerging needs defined by students participing in this study and their parents, and to
ensure the localisation of the content accommodates cross-Emirate cultural differences
and diversity.
▪ Adopt up-to-date and child-friendly training materials. These materials can be drawn up
by children themselves in a competition, or by experts, but then tested and evaluated by
children. These materials might be short videos, logos, and online exercises.
13-5 Develop a results framework for the programme
▪ UNICEF should take the lead in working with national stakeholders to develop a
programme for results, with clear and quantified targets. For instance, the programme
document should clearly identify the programme components, detailed activities,
timeline, key roles and responsibilities.
▪ The programme needs to document theory of change and identify assumptions, risks, and
bottlenecks that may affect the achievement of planned results. It should define
strategies to mitigate the bottlenecks identified.
▪ The programme needs to develop a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework.
The programme lacks a regular reporting system for activities implemented at school level.
Schools do not regularly report their data to the MOE. Likewise, the programme needs to
strengthen regular data collection for learning and monitoring.
▪ Additional support should be provided to the MOE to develop a universal methodology
that can be used to calculate bullying rates at all education cycles/stages. Support should
be also provided to the UAE national statistics office to calculate the national prevalence
of bullying rates per 1,000 students as per the intranational statistical standard.
13-6 Accelerate the programme’s implementation
▪ Stakholders should consider a shorter programme timeframe to regularly capture
changes in the field.
56
▪ Shorter projects can be financed more easily than a very long programme. The
programme can create sub-projects with different stakeholders. This will lead to the
diversity of stakeholders and partners. Stakeholder diversificaiton would be beneficial for
programming and financing.
▪ On the other hand, this type of short project needs an agile repsonse from the
government. Otherwise, it will be challenging to achieve the programme’s intended goals.
13-7 Expand the scope of the programme to deal with the topics mentioned in the school code of conduct,
and integrate the beneficiaries’ priorities
The MOE and the Emirates School Establishment should take the lead in the programme scale-up
phase, taking into account the considerations mentioned below.
▪ As schools already have an active child policy as part of the code of conduct, creating a
parallel school structure dedicated to bullying may not be the best option. Therefore, use
of the current code-of-conduct policy is recommended.
▪ However, the code of conduct needs to be audited from a child-protection prespective
and incorporate training and social-change materials. The process should include, but not
be limited to, increasing children’s knowledge of their rights and providing information
about the support institution.
▪ The current school code of conduct allows students to complain to social workers.
Students perceive them as teachers. There is a parellel online system linked to the
education portal. The evaluation could not test it to see if it offers enough privacy. Usually,
students do not want anyone to know that they have complained about teachers. The
MOE needs to create a pathway for detecting and managing cases that keeps children’s
identities anonymous.
▪ Students tend to have a fear of being known or attacked if they complain about school
staff. Whenever possible, the child protection unit needs to create a trusted pathway and
find a means to keep students’ identities anonymous. They need to keep students’
identity anonymous both during investigations and after decisions have been reached.
This will foster trust, so students will be more open to talking about teacher and staff
abuses. Otherwise, students will remain silent on them.
▪ Some aggressive behaviour reported by students and parents, such as smoking and drugs,
needs to be addressed, because addicted students/smokers may bully other students and
provoke them into engaging in the same behaviour. Girls are susceptible to bullying as
they transition to maturity. For example, they may be accused or bullied for being in love
or in a relationship with someone else, or vice versa.
13-8 Offer non-school support to regularly bullied students and aggressive bullies
▪ The UAE already has three levels of service repsonse: primary, secondary and tertiary.
This needs to be mainstreamed into the school system, especially for students who
aggressively bully others for and regularly bullied students. The reporting channel from
schools to the child protection unit needs to be tested and strengthened.
57
▪ Aggressive bullies and victims alike tend to have a certain degree of vulnerability.
Additional advanced modules need to be created to support and enhance the life skills of
regularly bullied students to increase their self-esteem. Another module or policy to deal
with aggressive students involves identifing these students and having them provided
with additional layers of support by a support team – their parents, teachers, and
psychologists. In most cases, the most vulnerable students need referrals beyond schools,
such as child protection authorities and community-based service providers, which are
specialise in working with vulnerable children and their families.
13-9 Develop a capacity-building programme for implementation partners
An important way of keeping all stakeholders on the same track is to engage in strong
programme-based capacity building for all stakeholders involved in implementation at the
beginning in order to enhance their skills and transfer all programme experience to them.
13-10 Position the SCMC as a third-party monitor
Under the programme, it is recommended that the SCMC’s capacities be built up so that it can
be positioned as a third-party monitor playing a cross-cutting research and monitoring role for
several childhood issues, including bullying and child protection.
13-11 Build the capabilities of social workers and school staff through a dedicated programme to plug the
human-resources gaps among social protection specialists and social workers
The MOE needs to consider plugging the child protection human-resources gap at schools by:
▪ developing a one-year degree in child protection, to be taught as a professional degree
or a joint programme with a higher-education institution;
▪ creating a test and certification centre for social workers and child protection specialists;
▪ conducting a study to project the number of social protection specialists needed in the
next 30 years;
▪ assessing the human-resources gap in school social workers and the capacity of existing
social workers;
▪ studying the attitudes and perceptions of social workers towards bullying issues, especially their
views of media and the effects of social media on children.
13-12 Strengthen the UNICEF’s role in the programme to maximise the impacts
The current Implementation model has exposed limitations in systematic monitoring and
learning. After UNICEF’s involvement in the design and first phase, the programme was managed
by national stakeholders. UNICEF can play a role in strengthening the results-based management
of the programme. Accordingly, national stakeholders and UNICEF should explore alternative
modalities, where UNICEF has a greater role in the programme, as exemplified below.
▪ They could create a special results-based child protection fund for relevant programmes
to receive funding. One advantage of such a fund is that it will strengthen the results-
based programming and improve accountability. This can be an effective tool in tying
funding to the results achieved. This fund will allow UNICEF and relevant donors to
cooperate with local stakeholders from the government, NGOs and the private sector
58
who provide support services at school level. These stakeholders can play a role in
enhancing implementation, monitoring, and learning to maximise the impact.
▪ They could devise a joint implementation model. This model would be used where two
parties finance the programme jointly. They plan, implement, and monitor via a joint
implementation unit. In this model, implementation takes place within the government
structure. Each government implementer regularly reports to the joint unit. The unit
would have the right to conduct mid-term assessments and third-party monitoring to
ensure the quality of the programme.
▪ They could adopt the contractual implementation model. In this model, two parties sign
a contract defining all programme aspects, especially the roles of the signatories. The
programme is managed via a programme steering committee, where all relevant
stakeholders are engaged in the decision-making process. The programme would be
implemented mostly by donor agencies, such as UNICEF.
13-13 Support the scale-up
To scale up the programme nationwide, the SCMC and MOE should consider taking the actions
described below.
▪ Assess stakeholders’ willingness and readiness to scale up the programme technically and
financially.
▪ Assess and plug the human-resources gaps in well-trained social workers and child
protection specialists. The programme can invest in multi-year programmes to qualify
Emirati graduates for such professions.
▪ Review the programme materials so that they are adapted to the latest developments
and reflect the views of schools, parents, students and principals.
▪ Draw up a results-based programme with clear and time-bound objectives and targets.
▪ Create a strong regular data collection process for monitoring and learning.
▪ Conduct a scale-phase costing study. Carrying out a costing analysis or cost comparison
for the programme was beyond the scope of this evaluation.
