INTRODUCTION
1.1. Context and Background of the Evaluation
1.1.1. Socio-economic, Political and Demographic Context
It is reported by UNHCR that the largest influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh was in 2017, when
762,325 people entered the country, now living in 153,9713 households. Fleeing state persecution, the
Rohingyas found refuge among an already vulnerable population in Cox’s Bazar district. As of November
2021, a total of 907,766 people – 52 per cent of whom are children – live in 34 refugee camps in Cox’s
Bazar4.
Cox’s Bazar, where the majority refugee settlements are, is one of the most vulnerable districts of
Bangladesh with the poverty rate far exceeding the national average. Estimates highlight that the daily
wages in the host communities have declined by nearly 24 per cent on an average, whereas the poverty
rates for the hosts have increased by approximately 52 per cent (World Bank, 2019). In addition, nearly
15 per cent of the hosts reported being affected by a rise in food prices.
The sheer density of population of 40,000 people per square-km in the camps makes it one of the most
crowded places in the world5. As a result, the development indicators within these camps have reached
alarming levels within a very short span of time6.
The situation is especially alarming for the vulnerable groups, such as women-headed households, girls,
children, people with disability, and elderly with limited mobility rights beyond the designated area. For
these groups access to services, which are usually located at a distance, becomes challenging - owing to
factors like undulating terrain of the region and safety concerns.
Furthermore, single parents and women or child-headed households struggle to cope, even more so in
the presence of children, people with disability, and pregnant and lactating women. Socio-cultural norms,
such aschild marriage, are particularly detrimental to the mobility as well as overall health and social well-
being of women and girls. These indicators point towards an urgent, complex and multi-sectoral challenge
that needs a multipronged approach to ensure that rights and well-being of even the most at-risk group
are protected and ensured under these extraordinary circumstances7.

High Commissioner for Refugees.
16 Midterm
Evaluation Report
1.1.2. Sectoral Issues, Challenges, and Needs
1.1.2.1. Nutrition
High levels of undernutrition, observed among the refugees and the host communities, are triggered
by vulnerabilities, such as high levels of stunting, food insecurity, inadequate hygiene and sanitation
conditions, limited access to safe water, and poor living conditions, resulting in recurring disease
outbreaks. These vulnerabilities in turn lead to increased risk of negative nutrition outcomes amongst
under-five children, pregnant and lactating women (PLW), adolescents, and other vulnerable groups.
As per the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), the prevalence of wasting
among children under 5 years of age was 8.4 per cent. Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of
Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys, conducted in October 2019, suggest that GAM prevalence
in the Rohingya communities is just below the emergency threshold, suggested by WHO. While the
prevalence of GAM in the camps reduced from 19.3 per cent to 10.9 per cent in 20198, a high prevalence
of anemia among children aged 6-23 months and stunting among children less than 59 months in the
host communities remains a major concern9. The prevalence of anemia in the camps and the host
communities also indicates towards higher micronutrient deficiencies. Infant and Young Child Feeding
(IYCF) practices are not appropriate or adequate, and the IYCF survey data suggests disconcerting rates
of exclusive breastfeeding across the refugee settlements (50 per cent of children under six months are
not exclusively breastfed) and the host communities (45 per cent of children under six months are not
exclusively breastfed10). While the coverage and accessibility of nutrition services improved by 2018,
socio-cultural barriers - as in the case of IYCF practices - are leading to limited utilisation of services
amongst both the Rohingya and the host communities. These socio-cultural barriers include lack of
support from the family, pre-lacteal feeding, and supplementary feeds tradition11. Moreover, the outbreak
of COVID-19 pandemic created an additional impact on food security and livelihood - in the forms of
reduction in food expenditure and limited access to food. Increased access to and coverage of safety net
programmes is critical for improving the nutrition status of the refugee as well as the host communities.
The SMART surveys also reveal that only a small proportion of children (5.6 per cent in Pekua, and 17
per cent in Teknaf) attained minimum acceptable diet. Negative coping mechanisms, including selling
assets, significantly influence household food security. Factors, such asdiarrhoea, poor WASH conditions
and an abnormal monsoon season, further deteriorate the poor nutrition status of vulnerable groups.
1.1.2.2. Education
Despite the significant progress made in ensuring access to safe learning opportunities, more than 40
per cent of the Rohingya children and youth, aged 3-24 years, still do not have access to education. In
addition, an alarming 89 per cent of adolescents and youths, aged 15-24 years, are not accessing any
educational and skill development activities, which can have a significant impact on the development of

local economies in the future12. In case of the host communities, a large proportion of households (30 per
cent as per Joint Multi-sector Need Assessment 2019) reported the presence of at least one primary or
secondary school-aged child in the household, who was not attending any learning opportunities. A Rapid
Education and Risk Analysis in Cox’s Bazar, conducted by USAID in October 2018, revealed that, owing
to the refugee influx, recent gains in the education sector for the host communities are being reversed.
Rising costs of commodities and transportation have adversely impacted the affordability and opportunity
cost of education, and primary and secondary school enrolment rates have been on a decline. Early
marriage has also witnessed an increase, as parents are less able to send their daughters to secondary
schools due to increased poverty.
For the refugee communities, only informal access to education is allowed, which is denied certification
through government or any other formal mechanisms. The children with disabilities encounter additional
barriers to access, including lack of ramps, and steep and rough terrain, as well as unavailability of
inclusive teaching and learning materials.
Informal education provision for the refugees in Cox’s Bazar by the humanitarian agencies uses the
Guidelines for Informal Education Programming (GIEP). However, GIEP has only been approved for Level
I and Level II. Higher levels - targeted towards youth and adolescents - continue to await approvals from
the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) for implementation13. The humanitarian agencies are unable to
provide educational opportunities for the adolescents, aged 15 years and above, as there is no approved
learning framework targeting this group. The children, adolescents and youth are more vulnerable to the
risks of early marriage, child labour, trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, and exploitation and
abuse in absence of education and learning opportunities. The Education Needs Assessment (2019) also
suggests that, uptake might also be hindered by educational lessons not perceived as age-appropriate
or due to the need to help at home. Many families also believe that the girls should be sent to religious
schools to ensure protection from sexual abuse by male adults, and hence they are withdrawn from
schools and learning facilities.
Supply-related challenges are also constraining delivery of quality education in the camps in Cox’s Bazar.
Limited number of available qualified teachers leads to overcrowding of classes. Further, only a few of
the trained teachers are able to speak Burmese or Chittagongian, and even lesser number of them are
female, resulting in lower enrolment and higher dropout rates amongst girl students. Teaching materials
for GIEP levels I and II are still not fully disseminated to facilitators and service providers, and the
materials are often unavailable.
1.1.2.3. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
The massive population increase following the influx of Rohingya refugees into Cox’s Bazar resulted
in significant strain for WASH services in the settlements and the adjacent host communities. These
services lack necessary protection measures, such asgender-segregated facilities and lighting facilities,
and these are difficult to access for vulnerable population groups, especially women and people with
disabilities. The risk and fear of gender-based violence (GBV) while accessing latrines at night have been

Evaluation Report
reported several times across the campsites. In addition, issues like open defecation, higher prevalence
of diarrhoea, and higher rates of malnutrition are also key concerns. The humanitarian response by
the development agencies and the government contributed to 29 per cent of the refugees in the camps
accessing chlorinated water through piped distribution networks14. However, certain regions, particularly
the camps located in Teknaf upazila, continue to face water scarcity during several months of the year
that needs to be addressed immediately.
The Rohingya refugees face a range of problems while accessing WASH facilities. In many cases,
access to the facilities is not guaranteed for the population, even if the standards are met in terms of
the number of facilities. For water points, the key accessibility issues are distance to water points and
their functionality. For latrines and bathing facilities, the major issues are lack of lighting, lack of gender
segregation, and non-functioning facilities. The Joint Multi-Sector Needs Assessment 2020 indicates
23 per cent of the households reporting access to safe and functional latrines as priority needs15. Some
32 per cent of the refugee households reported problems in accessing facilities due to low coverage,
and 14 per cent reported facing the challenge of long distance between latrines and shelters16. These
accessibility issues are further accentuated amongst the people with disabilities and elderly population
groups. In addition, solid waste management is also a critical challenge with lower proportion of the
households, reporting the presence of garbage bins near their houses. The risk behaviour of the
communities (including not washing hands after handling children’s faeces and at other critical times,
inappropriate water handling at household level, and inadequate menstrual hygiene practices), and low
uptake of appropriate hygiene practices are also evident within the communities.
Significant improvements have been made for the host communities with respect to sanitation
services. For instance, gender-sensitive latrines and need-based water sources have been provided
in the ‘Asrayon’ communities in Pekua and Teknaf upazilas. ‘Asrayon’ is a government programme to
support the displaced Bangladeshi communities, who have been pushed from their homes by previous
emergencies, such ascyclones, or by the detrimental effects of climate change that made their original
villages uninhabitable. However, despite improvements, a significant proportion of households in the
host communities report the practice of open defecation by adult members. The Joint Multi-sector Needs
Assessment 2020 indicates 14 per cent of the host community households reporting the practice of open
defecation sometimes by an adult member, and 11 per cent households finding visible waste near their
houses. This can have direct implications on health and hygiene outcomes.
1.1.2.4. Child Protection
Cox’s Bazar is one of the most lagging districts in Bangladesh in terms of key human development
indicators. The massive influx of the Rohingya refugees, who have arrived since 2017, has further
intensified the issue. There are approximately 913,660 Rohingya refugees currently residing in 34 highly
congested camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas of Cox’s Bazar district17 of which 54.2 per cent are
children.

“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
As the refugee crisis enters its fifth year, the protection of girls and boys in both the camps and the host
communities remains a serious concern, with disproportionate risks to women and girls that are further
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Rohingya refugees, including children, are not legally
recognised as refugees by the Government of Bangladesh. The lack of legal recognition as refugees
affects children’s access to justice. There is inadequate coverage of law-enforcement personnel, and lack
of formal justice mechanisms in the camps remains a grave concern. The few police personnel present in
the camps are often male, with only seven police posts having been established across 34 camps.
While there have been many gains in child protection in Cox’s Bazar, the number of children, affected
by violence, abuse and exploitation, is concerning. High levels of gender-based violence (GBV), child
marriage, and child labour persist. The pandemic continues to have an impact on the most vulnerable.
Measures to prevent the virus spread have restricted movement, limited access to services, curtailed
many group and site-based interventions, and reduced the overall humanitarian footfall to the areas that
need it most. The pandemic has exacerbated the pre-existing child protection concerns, from mental
health and psychosocial wellbeing to domestic violence, with a widespread elevation in anxiety reported
alongside an increase in GBV, especially intimate partner violence. The August 2020 analysis report of
the GBV Information Management System showed that intimate partner violence constituted 84.4 per
cent of all reported GBV incidents, compared to 72 per cent before the pandemic. Such dynamics within
the household has a terrible impact on the wellbeing of children and adolescents witnessing the violence.
According to the CPSS ‘Risks assessment report’ in October 2021, the refugee parents and caregivers
are worried about the safety of their children with the major concerns being physical violence (53 per
cent), child marriage (57 per cent), risk of trafficking (32 per cent), and exploitative work/child labour (64
per cent). Caregivers also expressed worries over sexual and GBV (46 per cent), neglect, emotional
or psychological abuse (18 per cent), fear of separation of children (25 per cent), and protection risks
associated with physical and mental disabilities (14 per cent). Five per cent of households in the refugee
communities reported an increase in violence against children with mental health- and psychosocial
distress-related needs having increased, affecting both children and their caregivers. A need to
increase community-based, unstructured and structured psychosocial support was identified, including
establishment of specialised mental health services. Parents and caregivers need guidance on positive
parenting and coping skills at household level and through community-based mechanisms.
Additionally, the Child Protection Sub-Sector presentation on Joint Multisector Needs Assessment
(JMSNA) preliminary findings [1] indicated an increase in child protection issues. The households,
which reported an increase in child protection issues, identified child labour (16 per cent refugee, and
49 per cent host communities), and children going missing (16 per cent refugee, and 2 per cent host
communities) as problems in their communities. Moreover, girls under 18 getting married (9 per cent
refugee, and 20 per cent in host communities), violence against children (5 per cent refugee, and 4 per
cent host communities), and children with psychosocial distress (5 per cent refugee, and 7 per cent host
communities) were also reported as challenges.
While significant progress has been made to address the protection-related issues, there is an urgent
need to scale up structured psychosocial support and access to effective mental health support.
20 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Child marriage with many negative consequences remains a great concern in the camps as per the Joint
Response Plan prepared for 202018. Adolescents and caregivers reported being against child marriage
practices. However, when the perceived wellbeing of female child appears to be at stake, a large
proportion of adolescents and caregivers believe it is acceptable for parents to arrange a marriage for the
child19. In the host communities, findings of the Joint Multi-sector Needs Assessment conducted in 2019
suggest that that 6 per cent households reported the presence of a child in the household, who is already
or is about to get married. In addition, 5 per cent of the households reported the presence of a child (<18
years) in the household working to earn an income. This indicates a pressing concern regarding child
marriage as well as child labour in the host communities.
Domestic violence constitutes 76 per cent of the total reported gender-based violence (GBV) cases.20
Normalisation of certain forms of GBV is omnipresent in the camps and the host community areas.
Evidences suggest that domestic violence is perceived amongst the communities as a “family affair” -
to be solved within the family itself. In addition, the increased fear of adolescent girls being harassed
is less associated with the psychological impact of the victim, but more to the consequences including
social stigma that the family has to undergo, difficulty of girl getting married in future, and economic
consequences21. Although there are services to address GBV in all forms, gaps remain in ensuring
adequate coverage of safe and quality GBV services. Low awareness levels about availability of
services as well as socio-cultural barriers are also key issues that need to be addressed for minimising
the incidence of GBV. Moreover, the services to address GBV are expensive and do not reach enough
people. The gaps in GBV programming are in preventing and risk mitigation, and therefore, more efforts
are required to address the root causes and drivers of gender-based violence.
1.1.3. Vulnerabilities and Risks
Vulnerability and risk in Cox’s Bazar are caused due to both environmental and human-made hazards.
The majority of the camps have been established in largely deforested and hilly areas of the district,
which are exposed to the risks of cyclones, floods and landslides. The higher population density and
associated congestion leads to a lack of shelter and privacy, increased exposure to human-made and
natural disasters, and lack of sufficient space for facilities and services. The shelters located below
sloping hills are vulnerable to landslides, and those on the low grounds to flooding, especially during the
monsoon season. Living at hilltops further increases the barriers to accessing services and assistance
during the monsoon season, as mobility gets restricted and walking-roads get muddy. The cyclone events
disproportionately affect women and children, as they are exposed to higher risks - since the shelters for
cyclones in the refugee camps and the settlements are limited. Excessive and abnormal rainfalls place
all the refugees at risk through contamination caused by sludge mixing with water resources. Waste

from latrines and solid wastes flowing down from hilly terrain heighten the risk of disease outbreaks.
Fire hazards have become another cause of concern in the camps. The increased incidents of fire in
different refugee camps have resulted in death and destruction of shelters and facilities. These incidents
exacerbate the humanitarian needs of the refugees.
Natural disasters are also affecting food security, health, and nutrition status of the communities. Disaster
risk reduction and hazard risk mapping have been recognised as the key priority areas for interventions
under all joint response plans (JRPs)22.
The magnitude of challenges regarding improvements in immediate living conditions and future prospects
for the refugees is huge despite the significant efforts made by the government and development
initiatives. Such challenges force the communities to adopt harmful coping mechanisms, such as
compromising on children’s education or household diet, sale of household assets, early marriage of
children, and child labour.
There is evidence of increased tension in the Rohingya camps, with the refugees who already live in
cramped and overcrowded conditions dealing with the aftermath of fires and floods. Looting of facilities
has occasionally been observed as part of general unrest. The gradual relocation of the refugees from
Cox’s Bazar district to Bhasan Char island continues amidst ongoing concerns around their right to be
involved in decision-making and the overall protection conditions that await them on the island.
While the informal education programmes have undergone through significant improvements, the refugee
children are not entitled to be enrolled in formal educational facilities and not eligible to sit for primary
school certification exams. Access to education has significant potential for building resilience of the
communities as a whole.
The host communities, on the other hand, also face a multitude of challenges. In a situation where
access to public services and infrastructure was already lagging behind the national average, the influx
of the Rohingya refugees has raised further concerns in the host communities about local environmental
degradation as well as falling wages and rising prices. As a result, the estimated dietary diversity remains
poor in the host communities with 32 per cent of households estimated to consume only two food groups
or fewer in any given day23. In addition to this, issues related to access to water and education in the host
communities have also been exacerbated by the refugee crisis. For instance, the overall attendance rates
of children and youth (aged 4-24 years) have significantly decreased in formal education facilities in the
host communities.
1.1.4. COVID-19 Situations and Vulnerabilities
The total confirmed COVID-19 cases in Cox’s Bazar district amongst the host communities and the
Rohingya refugees were 17,311 and 3,084 respectively as of 26 September 202124. The national
healthcare system was already under strain even before the pandemic, and given the highly congested
conditions in Cox’s Bazar, the communities were exposed to higher risks and extreme vulnerabilities. In
order to contain the spread of COVID-19, the government issued directives for closing all non-essential

Evaluation Report
services and introduced mobility restrictions except to meet critical needs. The scope of humanitarian
assistance and COVID-19 emergency response was limited due to the measures taken by the Refugee
Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) to reduce the aid-worker footprint25. Following the
lockdown, close to half of the households in the host communities were not engaged in any livelihood-
generating activities. This significantly affected the food and nutrition security of the host community
households. The per capita food expenditure for the host community households reduced by BDT 521
following the lockdown measures as per the WFP estimates. The Joint Multi-Sectoral Need Assessment
(J-MSNA), conducted in 2020, highlighted a notable decrease in food consumption because of the
COVID-19 pandemic for the host communities. A loss of income, increased transportation costs, and
increase in prices of daily essentials diminished people’s ability to access essential services, such as
health and nutrition. Although, as per the J-MSNA 2021, food consumption scores in the camps slightly
improved again, still, only about half of the households were found to have acceptable food consumption
scores26.
The number of nutrition staff decreased from ten to three per facility, constraining active case findings and
delivery of nutrition services. Some 30 per cent of the refugee community households and 60 per cent
of the host community households, with children aged 6-59 months/pregnant or lactating women (PLW),
reported facing issues in accessing the nutrition-feeding programmes due to various factors, including the
fear of contracting COVID-19. Irregularity of support, relocation of distribution centres, and long waiting
time made accessing nutrition services even more difficult during the lockdown27. The humanitarian
response agencies and organisations shifted from a facility-based approach to house-to-house approach
for nutrition service delivery28.
Safe water availability is essential to support handwashing and hygiene practices to contain spread of
the COVID-19 pandemic in the district. However, the extension of chlorinated water networks is limited
in the camps, and access to adequate sanitation remains a challenge due to limited space for setting up
facilities and need for constant maintenance. To mitigate virus transmissions, handwashing points have
been installed by the development agencies in coordination with the government. However, maintaining
physical distancing at water points is a major concern, and in areas such as the southern camps, where
there is a severe water shortage, the condition is further exacerbated. The pandemic also adversely
affected the access to safe water for the host communities. Some six per cent of households in the host
communities reported a loss or diminished access to clean water and sanitation as an impact of the
COVID-19 outbreak, as per the J-MSNA 2021.
Child protection issues and risks further heightened in the district during the pandemic because of scaled-
back services and reduced humanitarian footprint. Many facilities for children shut down, such as multi-
purpose centres and adolescent centres, making it harder to report issues and to receive necessary
support and care. The J-MSNA 2021 findings highlight that 65 per cent of households in the camps
reported unavailability of service/staff due to COVID-19 as the barrier for accessing protection services,
among households having reported community members not having been able to access protection

services29. The Child Protection Sub-Sector conducted an individualised consultation with children on
impacts of COVID-19 on their lives in May 2020. The Rohingya children raised widespread concerns.
Many are worried about what would happen to them if they are infected by the virus (64 per cent),
and about the closure of child protection facilities and LCs (48 per cent). Some 39 per cent of children
fear losing their lives30. The violence at home against children in the refugee camps increased due to
heightened stress, reduced resources, and lack of supportive services. Information from child protection
community volunteers on the ground revealed that COVID-19 has heightened psychosocial distress
among children and families, many of whom express a sense of fear, loneliness and hopelessness, and
a feeling of a lack of control. Children, especially girls, are at higher risk of GBV due to limited oversight
and reduced avenues to report. The risks of child marriage as well as exposure to child labour and
trafficking increased in the camps along with loss of household income, limited education opportunities
and reduced protection mechanisms in the host communities31.
On 24 March 2020, the Government of Bangladesh and the Refugee Relief and Repatriation
Commissioner (RRRC) categorised education as “non-lifesaving”, reflecting an effort to reduce large
gathering of people. Consequently, more than 6,000 learning centres and facilities in the Rohingya
camps were shut down, and over 325,000 children lost access to learning opportunities. In the host
communities, 27 per cent of households reported a loss or diminished access to education as an impact
of the COVID-19 outbreak32. The distance-learning facilities were limited in the camps, as mobile data
and internet use were restricted for the refugee communities by the government. In Cox’s Bazar, UNICEF
circulated various guidelines for caregivers to ensure that the students continue with learning using the
education materials they have at home. These included guidelines for caregivers of students attending
LCFCs, caregivers of students aged 3-5 years, and adolescent/youth caregivers. In other parts of the
country, UNICEF led initiatives to work with the government for delivering distance-learning programmes
for the children through TV, radio, mobile phones and internet platforms. However, only 38 per cent
children in Bangladesh (aged 5-17 years) have access to internet at home33. Though the education
sector sought additional funding through the COVID-19 response plan for addressing the challenges
during the pandemic, the allocations are constrained by the categorisation of educational services as non-
essential.
The COVID-19 situation has further compounded the difficulties faced by both the Rohingya and the host
communities, and further increased the need to design or tweak a strategic multi-pronged programme.

OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
The influx of above 700,000 Rohingya refugees since the August of 2017 has put immense stress on the
basic services and the already poor and vulnerable host communities of Cox’s Bazar, where people are
found living below the poverty line. The district records an alarming presence of malnutrition, specifically
stunting among children, partly due to inadequate infant and young child feeding practices. Moreover,
access to proper educational opportunities is a challenge for children. Schools also lack adequate
infrastructure and reading materials - needed for an overall impact on children. Further, the threat of child
rights abuse looms large, as many children fall prey to practices like child marriage and child labour that
ultimately results in an increase in school dropouts. The community’s WASH needs are not being met.
They are deprived of safe drinking water and lack well-maintained and functional sanitation facilities, like
-bathing cubicles, latrines, washing stations, basic sanitation, hygiene materials, etc.
Therefore, to address these challenges, UNICEF took this EU-funded project to tackle the underlying
issues to improve service delivery, and consequently improve the quality of life for both the Rohingya
refugees and the Bangladeshi host communities.
2.1. The Scale and Complexity of the Object
2.1.1. Geographic Location
The programme runs within the refugee camps and the host communities having the greatest impact of
the influx. Therefore, to warrant maximum possible multisectoral cooperation, the programme specifically
focuses on two host community upazilas - Pekua and Teknaf. The two defined camps where the
programme operates are Camp 7 and Camp 15.
2.1.2. Timeline
The contribution period of the programme is from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2022. The first year of the
programme implementation witnessed significant progress except for a few difficulties encountered, such
as - delay in approval of the Community-based Nutrition Programme. Such challenges were addressed
through careful mitigation measures and actions by the implementing partners in the camps and GoB
in host communities through ensuring system strengthening. However, the programme interventions,
and therefore the implementation timelines, were significantly affected due to impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. The interventions, aimed at improving access to education, got significantly disrupted due to
the closure of schools and learning centres from March 2020. Similarly, the child protection programming
was stymied, as interventions through site-based facilities were disrupted due to the requirement of
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 25
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
maintaining social-distancing norms. The government closure and restrictions, imposed in response to
the COVID-19 situation, and difficulty in coordinating with the government institutions and stakeholders
hampered the implementation of interventions for enhancing food and nutrition security. In addition, the
implementing partners faced significant challenges to deliver WASH services in the refugee camps due
to lockdown and restrictions, imposed by the government. The programme adapted to the situation by
developing necessary mitigation measures, though some activities have been shifted to be implemented
in third year of the programming.
2.1.3. Budget and Expenditure
Euro 18,000,000 is being allocated for implementation of the programme. As of December 2020, Euro
11,414,303 has been utilised, and a sum of Euro 6,585,607 remains.
Components of the Programme
The programme aims to benefit over 580,000 children and families34 in its three years of functioning.
It adopts an integrated approach to ensure the highest degree of coherence and complementarity,
enhancing synergies and interlinkages between the expected results and main activities within each result
area. The programme has four main components - education, child protection, nutrition, and WASH, and
builds synergies through linkages among different sectors to ensure the greatest benefit for the target
beneficiaries. The programme also has the cross-cutting element of C4D, communication and visibility.
The education component of the programme focuses on ensuring improved access to education and
learning opportunities in pre-school, primary education and non-formal technical education in a protective
environment for the host communities and the Rohingya refugees. A significant proportion of children
and youth in the camps and the host communities are still unable to access safe learning opportunities,
which has a direct impact not only on their wellbeing but also on the development of local economies
in future. Further, the informal education provision for the refugees in Cox’s Bazar faces supply-related
issues, hampering the delivery of quality education in the camps, and depriving children of their right
to education. Learning centres lack trained teachers, who are fluent in Burmese and Chittagongian
languages. Therefore, the programme, through its education component seeks to ensure that children
have access to learning centres and schools, qualified teachers, and availability of applicable curriculum
and learning materials/frameworks. The education programme, through the multi-purpose centres (MPC),
offers integrated vocational and life skills trainings, psychosocial support, numeracy and literacy skills
to adolescents. It targets to build the capacity of teachers in pedagogical skills, psychosocial skills, and
disaster risk reduction (DRR), including teaching and learning strategies that are tailored to the varying
needs of the refugee children and the host communities. This promises an increase in the participation
rates of children in both the camps and the host communities, thus, achieving high learning outcomes for
the children.

26 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Child protection is an essential, lifesaving endeavour that cuts across the entire programme. The issue of
violence against children as well as abuse, exploitation, and neglect of children is an extremely pressing
concern.
The overarching child protection architecture of the government is under pressure from the influx of
refugees, and it is not able meet the needs of either the Bangladeshi or the Rohingya communities
without support. The elements of the child protection system – the legal and regulatory framework and
how it is operationalised, the access of citizens and rights-holders to social welfare and services, and the
social norms and behaviours that influence how children are viewed and protected – remain disjointed
with no meaningful inter-relationship among these. Coordination between the government ministries and
departmental jurisdictions is fragmented, and there are considerable gaps in the technical capacities of
personnel to respond, which means that children rarely benefit from the continuum of care they need.
Lessons learned from the humanitarian response shows that efforts must consider the long-term
development needs of the host communities for both the host and the refugee communities to coexist
peacefully in the longer-term. The Rohingya refugee crisis provides a tremendous opportunity to bridge
the gap between humanitarian response and development. The third component of the programme
addresses the problem of malnutrition in the communities and seeks to improve the nutrition status and
food security of the ultra-poor households. Reports have observed high levels of undernutrition among
the refugees and the host communities, which are sparked by various factors, like poor access to
essential nutrition services, high levels of food insecurity, inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions,
limited access to safe water, and poor living conditions, and are resulting in repeated disease outbreaks.
These vulnerabilities in turn lead to the added risk of negative nutrition outcomes amongst boys and girls
and other vulnerable groups. Children in the camps and the host communities also pose micronutrient
deficiencies. Further, the infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are also not adequate. The
programme, through its nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive activities, aims to tackle undernutrition
and achieve enhanced nutrition outcomes in the targeted areas. It works towards increasing the
knowledge and awareness among people about good food and nutrition intake, dietary diversity, food
preparation practices, and food production. The activities under this component are carefully designed
to increase access to nutrition services, and access to diversified food sources, to ensure sufficient
income for households, sufficient food and nutrition intake, and uptake of immunisation and Vitamin A
supplementation in children below 5 years of age.
The fourth component of the programme is the WASH component. Its purpose is to ensure that there
is the usage of safely-managed sanitation services to see a fall in instances of mortality and morbidity,
caused by WASH-related services. The Rohingya refugees and the host communities suffer from a
lack of access to clean water, proper sanitation, and good hygiene practices. Basic necessities, such
asgender-segregated toilets, are lacking, and this has led to other problems, such as an increase in the
risk of gender-based violence. Many instances of such violence were reported across the campsites, as
women used these latrines at night. There were other problems as well, for example, lack of adequate
toilets often led to open defecation, which in turn led to a high prevalence of health issues, such as
diarrhoea and malnutrition. Unfortunately, the interventions made by the development agencies and
the government did not reach all the refugees, and a significant proportion of the refugee population
has not been able to benefit from them. Therefore, the WASH component of the programme seeks to
overcome these challenges by ensuring access to usable and piped water in public spaces to address
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 27
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
the problem of water scarcity and unsafe drinking water. It focuses on building good and reliable physical
infrastructure for sanitation, keeping access, equity and safety in mind along with establishing knowledge
and awareness of good health and WASH practices in the areas.
The EU-funded programme has C4D, communications and visibility interventions cutting across multiple
sectors. The interventions were designed and implemented based on a specific Communication and
Visibility Plan. The plan was in accordance with the requirements laid out in the Communication and
Visibility Manual for EU External Action. The key objective of the overall plan is to ensure regular,
consistent and effective communication with EU, through its Delegation in Bangladesh as the relevant
stakeholder throughout the period of implementation. Further, the specific communication objectives
are to - (i) highlight EU’s contribution and role, (ii) build public awareness about the Rohingya issues,
in particular their rights to core services, (iii) mobilise and encourage the participation of other relevant
stakeholders in implementation of the programmes, (iv) increase awareness among the Rohingya
and the host communities regarding the core services available to them, and (v) increase access to
basic services by the Rohingya and the host communities. Under the programme, the most common
visibility activities undertaken are - branding of the facilities and supplies in addition to situation reports,
programme-communication pagers, and media coverage of public events and photography of high-profile
EU missions. UNICEF Bangladesh is responsible to implement the general visibility activities of - press
releases, usage of UNICEF social media, usage of UNICEF platform, branding of programme supplies,
banners, presentations and other programme materials, human interest stories, photo essays, and case
studies.
2.1.4. Implementation Status
This section showcases the implementation status of the programme till October 2021 and the
achievements it has made against the targets set for 2019-2021. It provides an update on the key
activities implemented in the targeted areas, i.e., Pekua and Teknaf upazilas as well as the Rohingya
camps 7 and 15. Moreover, in the wake of COVID-19, certain programme interventions underwent
reprogramming to address and respond to people’s needs. Beneficiaries, in both the targeted areas,
were reached with key services, after making adjustments to the modes of implementation to lessen the
COVID-19 risks and impact of other disasters, including monsoon, cyclone and fire, affecting Cox’s Bazar.
Given the situation of lockdowns and restrictions of group activities, UNICEF and its partners changed
their operation style and adopted more individualised delivery modalities and house-to-house visits. They
embraced technology and e-learning, and obtained the support of additional community volunteers, who
spread life-saving messages and essential services to the masses and played an extremely important
role in the pandemic response. UNICEF and its implementing partners continued to deliver a holistic
package of critical services to ensure that the children and their families have access to basic support to
cope with the spilling effects of the pandemic. Six governance meetings of the Programme Management
Committee (PMC) and Programme Implementation Committee (PIC) meetings were held since the
start of the programme in 2019 at technical and strategical levels respectively to review the progress
against the targets, assess the programmatic situation, and repurpose interventions to meet the needs
of the COVID-19 situation. A detailed summary of the implementation status of the programme has been
attached as Annexure 10. Also, the terms of reference (ToR) for the evaluation that describes the broad
contours of the study is attached in Annexure 1.
28 Midterm
Evaluation Report
2.2. Logical Model and the Result Chain
2.2.1. Purpose and Goal of the Object
The programme aims to strengthen the existing local development efforts and reduce the need for
humanitarian assistance in the future. It thus adopts a broader approach to building the resilience of
communities by providing support to withstand and cope with stresses as well as generating opportunities
for transformation through empowerment of vulnerable population, enhanced livelihoods, changing
environments, and social norms and behaviour.
In order to achieve this, over the course of three years, the key strategies adopted by UNICEF in
Cox’s Bazar include - (i) saving lives and protecting children and their families in the refugee camps,
(ii) promoting social cohesion and confidence building, (iii) system strengthening and acceleration of
programme implementation, and (iv) applying the lessons learned to feed into national strategies and
works in other parts of the country.
The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to strengthening the resilience of the Rohingya
refugees and their host communities in an integrated manner in Cox’s Bazar district. Moreover, the
specific objective of the programme is to ensure improved access to effective basic services for the
Rohingya refugees and the host communities.
The basic hypothesis underlying the programme is that by improving access to effective basic services
for the Rohingya refugees and their host communities in an integrated manner, (1) the resilience of
both populations in Cox’s Bazar district would be strengthened in the medium term, (2) social cohesion
would be promoted, and (3) the risk of conflict would be mitigated, as the communities would develop
in the medium term. Reinforcing public systems for the structural service delivery in the district through
development support would also contribute to avoiding protracted humanitarian assistance and ensuring
sustainability.
The programme primarily focuses on the needs of children, adolescents and women, considering their
risks with respect to education, child protection, water and sanitation, nutrition, and overall access to
services. This programme is a multi-sectoral intervention with the rights of the vulnerable groups at
the centre, and it also acknowledges the heterogeneity of the population and specific needs of high-
risk groups, such as children suffering from severe malnutrition, orphaned and/or abandoned children,
women-led households, adolescents - especially girls, etc. The programme, therefore, integrates
diverse and complementing communities, and facility-based services. It also takes an innovative
approach towards integrating services across the programmatic areas of WASH, nutrition, education,
and child protection. Integration is being achieved in two ways: structurally through effective multi-
sectoral coordination and an integrative C4D strategy, and geographically by focusing on specific areas.
Therefore, the programme aims to ensure maximum synergy through linkages among different sectors. It
aims to respond to the needs of vulnerable U-5 children, PLWs, and adolescents holistically in order for
them to reach their full potential. The programme also aims to provide information and communication
directly and indirectly to the communities to support access to other services for the same beneficiaries,
thus ensuring an integrated and multi-sectoral delivery of communication messages.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 29
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The intervention logic of the programme also adopts an integrative approach, providing for linkages
and coordination among frontline workers of all sectors. Lastly, the programme also established a multi-
sectoral Program Management Committee (PMC) to ensure integration of the activities and coordination
of the implementing partners.
2.2.2. Results Framework
The design of the programme can be understood from the logframe (attached in Annexure 3). The
framework provides an understanding of the activities designed and the expected results. It considers the
risks (both internal and external) and the assumptions that may cause the programme to deviate from the
intended path or fall short of achieving the outcomes.
The foundational results are the cornerstone to sustain the programme beyond 2022. The key results
(outputs) of the programme are - (i) improved access to education services and learning opportunities
- pre-school, primary education and non-formal technical education - in a protective environment for the
Rohingya refugees and the host communities, (ii) contribution to enhanced food and nutrition security for
the Rohingya refugees and the host communities, and (iii) improved access to water and overall hygiene
and sanitation conditions for the Rohingya refugees and the host communities. The details of results,
activities, and indicators are captured in the results framework of the programme.
2.2.3. Theory of Change
The theory of change (ToC) of the intervention explains how the activities undertaken by the programme
contribute to a chain of results that leads to the intended or observed impacts. The ToC explains how
actions by UNICEF, EU-INTPA and a broad range of implementation partners and other stakeholders
would lead to an impact for the targeted population by attaining the six long-term outcomes. It also
articulates how these steps contribute to long-term results that, in turn, would improve resilience among
the Rohingya refugees and the host communities in Cox’s Bazar, with a strengthened ability to function
and adapt in a way that supports long-term prospects for sustainable development, peace, scrutiny, and
attainment of human rights. The ToC of the programme is divided into three parts, such as output level,
short- to medium-term outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Annexure 4 provides a one-page schema
of the ToC (retrospectively developed), showing how UNICEF and EU-INTPA would work with the
implementation partners and other stakeholders to convert inputs into impact. It is worth mentioning that
no assumption or analysis of evidence to establish causal linkages has been identified/undertaken.
2.2.4. Stakeholders Intended to be Benefitted/ Influenced
Considering the need for inter-sectoral coordination, the programme has collaborated with the
relevant government ministries/departments and institutions towards maximising the effectiveness and
sustainability of the impact beyond the intervention period. The interventions of the programme for
improved access to education services, quality education and learning opportunities are implemented
primarily in collaboration with the District Primary Education Office (DPEO). Considering the significant
role that the Department of Social Services can play in improving the state of child protection, the
department is recognised by the programme as a key stakeholder for delivering protection, recreation
and referral services for children. The nutrition-specific interventions are aimed at enhancing the
institutional capacities of the National Nutrition Service (NNS), Institute of Public Health Nutrition (IPHN).
30 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Recognising the agri-nutrition linkages, the programme is co-leading the food production and dietary
diversity improvement interventions with the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Ministry of
Agriculture (MoA). The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) and MoHFW are the key
government stakeholders for the programme for interventions - aimed to expand safe water sources and
supply, sustainable access to sanitation infrastructure, hygiene promotion, and behaviour change. In
addition to the described key government partners, the programme also works with the Office of Deputy
Commissioner (DC), the District Information Office, and the upazila administrations to deliver services
around the key areas of interventions.
The host communities in Teknaf and Pekua upazilas of Cox’s Bazar district and the Rohingya refugees
in targeted refugee camps 7 and 15, particularly children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women
and their families, are the key beneficiaries of the programme35. The breakdown of targeted/intended
beneficiaries by age group, sex, disability, and location is provided in Annex 1. In order to strengthen
the health and nutrition service delivery, the community volunteers and frontline workers as well as the
community committees are targeted for capacity enhancement. The community volunteers/social workers
are identified and trained to provide nutrition, child protection, education, and WASH services, and life-
saving messages through various platforms including Mother to Mother Support Groups (M2MSGs),
Adolescent Radio Listeners’ Clubs (ARLCs). These include agricultural extension workers, multi-
purpose health workers, social workers/child protection actors, schools and learning centre management
committees, IFC youth volunteers, and community hygiene promoters. The programme also aims to
enhance capacities of the communities through trainings for SMC/LCMC, CBCPC members, WASH
committees, sensitisation of M2MSGs and role model mothers, vocational and life-skill trainings for
adolescents and youths, nutrition education for small-scale farmers, and so on. The education sector of
the programme is aiming to improve access to learning opportunities for girls and boys from both the host
communities and the refugee camps. Youths, parents and teachers are also stakeholders for targeted
interventions through the programme in order to improve the educational situation of the district.
Other main stakeholders of the programme include international organisations, notably the UN agencies
operating in Cox’s Bazar, and relevant local and international civil society and non-governmental
organisations as well as other development partners assisting the Rohingya refugees and the host
communities. The key stakeholders and their roles in the programme have been attached in Annexure 9.

3 EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES
AND INTENDED USE
3.1. Evaluation Purpose and Objectives
The evaluation for the European Union-funded programme ‘Building Rohingya refugee and host
community resilience in Cox’s Bazar’ is commissioned by UNICEF Country Office Bangladesh (UNICEF-
BCO). Implementation of the first phase of the three-year programme began in January 2019. The
overall objective of the programme was to strengthen the resilience of the Rohingya refugees and their
host communities in an integrated manner in Cox’s Bazar district. The specific objectives of the midterm
evaluation were as follows:
1. Assess the relevance, coherence, and coverage of this programme to the country’s priorities
and context, considering a gender-responsive and a human rights lens, as well as the COVID-19
pandemic and recent natural disasters.
2. Assess the quality and fidelity of implementation of the programme’s activities, including their internal
integration as well as coordination with other agencies.
3. Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme as well as progress towards impact on both
the Rohingya refugees and the host communities, considering differences in gender, age, and ability,
and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters.
4. Identify the programme’s current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the integrated
model of intervention, identifying indications of connectedness, sustainability, and systemic change
for both the Rohingya and host communities.
5. Draw lessons learned and recommendations for further improvement of the programme immediately
and in future phases, as well as for similar contexts in resilience building of the refugee populations.
The programme, given the context-specific vulnerabilities in Cox’s Bazar, was specifically designed to
build the resilience in an integrated manner among the Rohingya refugees in the camps 7 and 15 as
well as across the host communities of Pekua and Teknaf in Cox’s Bazar. The programme also aimed to
promote social cohesion and mitigate the risks of conflicts for the communities in the medium term. The
package of multi-sectoral interventions aimed to allow the communities to prevent, respond and adapt
to shocks over the long-term. Development support provided through the programme reinforced public
systems for structural service delivery that contributed to avoid protracted humanitarian assistance and
ensure sustainability. The programme acknowledged heterogeneity of the population and specific needs
of high-risk groups, such as children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women and their families.
The programme integrated diverse and complementing technical areas within UNICEF across the three
levels of household, community, and facility. The key thematic areas that the programme provided
services include education, WASH, nutrition, and child protection.
32 Midterm
Evaluation Report
The midterm evaluation’s primary purpose was to examine the progress made comprehensively
across the key result areas, as defined within the theory of change (ToC) and logframe, as well as their
implementation integration as defined within the ToC and logframe. The indicator values thus discovered
were useful for assessing the effectiveness of the programme design as well as deploying course
correction mechanisms. Besides, the evaluation helped in identifying early learnings, lessons learned,
and challenges, and accordingly provided realistic recommendations for improving the interventions
to maximise the impact. The evaluation presents the main causes behind any discrepancies, between
results and achievements (including both over- and under-achievements), along with potential solutions
as a way forward to minimise the gaps. In particular, the evaluation assessed the impact of COVID-19
within the context of programme interventions and results achievements, and identified lessons for
the programme from current adaptation measures and recommended ones for future interventions.
An important function that the evaluation performed was to provide directions to UNICEF, EU, and the
implementing partners, including the government and the CSOs, who are the primary audience of the
evaluation on the further actions and required reprogramming.
The evaluation used the criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, impact and
sustainability, and it served the dual purposes of accountability and learning. Hence, a forward-looking
evaluation not only took stock of the implementation efforts, but also learnt from the implementation
experience to drive forward the resilience approach and inform policy dialogues in line with the evolving
country context.
3.2. Evaluation Scope
The evaluation was conducted during the period ranging from January 2021 to March 2022. While there
has already been deemed a second phase of the programme (through 2024) in new locations (three
new camps and two new upazilas) and the activities would overlap, this evaluation only covered Phase
1 activities to date (middle of 2020) from its commencement in 2019, including fund utilisation, expected
outputs, results and outcomes. The evaluation covered all four programmatic areas of child protection,
education, WASH, and nutrition equally with no greater emphasis of one over other. Additionally, C4D,
communication and visibility activities that have played a cross-cutting role in supporting all sections in
community engagement and achieving the outputs and results in all four programmatic areas were also
evaluated.
3.3. Intended Users and Use of the Evaluation
The intended users of the evaluation include the national and local government authorities, such as the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (including the Refugee, Relief and
Repatriation Commissioner), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Institute of Public Health Nutrition,
Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Primary and
Mass Education, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Directorate of Primary Education,
Directorate of Madrassa Education, Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Women
and Children Affairs, Ministry of Social Welfare, and Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
(including the deputy commissioner of Cox’s Bazar district). Other users are the international
organisations, notably the UN agencies operating in Cox’s Bazar, relevant local and international civil
society and non-governmental organisations, as well as any other development partners assisting the
Rohingya refugees and the host communities.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 33
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
It is expected that the findings of this evaluation would be used for identifying early learnings, lessons
learned and challenges, and provide realistic recommendations for betterment of the implementation and
for further revisions, if required, to ensure and optimise the impacts among children, adolescent girls,
women and vulnerable people in the Rohingya camps and the host communities in Cox’s Bazar district.
Moreover, the evaluation would provide directions to both UNICEF, EU, and the implementing partners
including the government and CSOs, which are the primary audience of the evaluation, on further actions
and required reprogramming within the programme result areas of education, child protection, nutrition,
and WASH for the refugees and the people of the host communities in Cox’s Bazar. The refugees and the
host communities are the secondary audience of the evaluation findings, as the further actions resulting
from these findings would benefit both of them.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
4.1. Evaluation Criteria and Framework
The selection of the evaluation criteria was based on the ToR. The programme has been established for
building the resilience of the host communities and the Rohingya refugees in view of the multidimensional
nature of the challenges faced by various groups, integrating diverse components towards achieving
sustainable outcomes. The evaluation investigates factors, specifically UNICEF’s efforts that have led to
building resilience in the refugee and the host populations, and explore elements that may be impeding
resilience - in order to provide appropriate recommendations.
The evaluation approach looked at the multiple sectors and tolls of service delivery (community-level
awareness, capacity building, and infrastructure upgradation) that the programme works on and weighed
it from the lens of the OECD-DAC criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability,
coherence, and impact. Keeping in mind that this is a midterm evaluation, in the case of impact and
sustainability, the evaluation team only considered early signs or indications of change rather than
complete achievements. The approach also ensured that the voices of the primary beneficiaries of the
programme, especially the vulnerable groups, also guided the assessment.
The objective was to enhance the learning and responsiveness of a programme by assessing
its relevance, effectiveness, sustainability, and impact through the beneficiaries’ perspectives
in identifying and analysing programme results (outputs and outcomes). In essence, it helped in
understanding the effectiveness of the programme with an explanation of the beneficiaries’ awareness
and perception about the following:
� Awareness of the various services provided under the programme,
� Equity and gender sensitivity in programme interventions, with a specific focus on people with special
needs,
� Sufficiency, quality and regularity of the services provided:
— Quality of education, behavioural skills – quality of teachers, enrolment, attendance, access to
learning centres, learning materials, life-skill trainings, awareness of key life-saving behaviours,
and development of vocational skills.
— Support through child protection services – recognising and identifying instances of child rights
violations, reporting mechanisms, case management, and referral mechanisms.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 35
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
— Coverage and quality of health system-based essential nutrition services - nutrition counselling,
and micronutrient supplementation.
— WASH - access to safe water and sanitation, waste and faecal sludge management, hygiene
supplies, menstrual hygiene management, and behaviour change communication to promote
good WASH practices,
� Overlapping of the project with any other similar programmes, duplication of services as well as
potential gaps in services that are yet to be addressed.
Given the focus of the programme on issues of equity and inclusion, the evaluation approach aimed to
view the outcomes from the perspectives of gender, ethnicity, disability, vulnerable groups, and those
groups residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas or areas prone to natural disasters.
Towards this, the evaluation adhered to the Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in
Evaluation: Towards UNEG Guidance document36 to ensure responsiveness to the gender, equity and
human rights aspects.
The evaluation also adopted the UN System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the
Empowerment of Women (GEEW)37 framework for assessing the gender-related aspects. Based on
the Addressing Gender in Evaluations Guideline by the GEF-IEO38, the following steps have been
undertaken for the same:
� The evaluation’s scopes of analysis and indicators have been designed in a way that ensures that
GEEW-related data is collected.
� The evaluation criteria and questions specifically address how GEEW has been integrated into
the design, planning and implementation of the interventions. GEEW principles, such as equality,
participation, social transformation, inclusiveness, and empowerment, have been considered.
� It has been ensured that the evaluation methodology and tools as well as data analysis techniques
selected are gender-responsive. Therefore, the tools and data collection methods have been
developed integrating GEEW considerations, so that gender biases and reinforcements of gender
discrimination are avoided. Additionally, triangulation of data was done at analysis stage to ensure
that the voices of women, men, boys and girls are heard and represented.
� Finally, the evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations reflect a gender analysis.
The evaluation team recognises that gender equity is the process of being fair to men, women, boys
and girls. Therefore, across all the stages, the evaluation would ensure a focus on gender and not just
women. The interests, needs and priorities of all would be taken into consideration, recognising the
diversity and heterogeneity of different groups amongst women and men. The evaluation team also
understands the importance of gender equality as well as protection of the human rights of all women and
girls - displaced by crisis or persecution, or on the move in search of new economic opportunities and
horizons, as has also been clearly articulated in the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants

(NYD). The NYD’s annexed Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) took this further
by addressing the rights and needs of women and girl refugees, specifically through their empowerment
and meaningful participation in the decision-making that impacts their lives, and those of their
families and communities. Keeping these aspects in mind, the evaluation tried to understand how the
women (especially in the refugee population) have been impacted by the programme, to ensure - a)
equitable access to education, health and livelihoods opportunities, b) increased self-reliance and equal
and meaningful participation in decision-making processes, and c) early signs of transformative results
that address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and challenges experienced by refugee
women and girls.
The evaluation matrix (EM), developed during the inception phase, was used as a framework to
collect, analyse and assess data and information to answer the evaluation questions. The matrix was
subsequently used by the evaluation team as a tool for systematising the data collection process,
identifying gaps in evidence, and developing clear evaluative assessments.
The main evaluation questions under the evaluation criteria are summarised in the table below, and the
complete EM (sub-questions, information sources, etc.) is included in Annexure 2.

4.2. Evaluation Design and Methods
The evaluation used the OECD-DAC criteria to methodically assess the programme. To do this, the
evaluation used a mixed method approach to answer the key questions, exploring each of the criteria.
This involved primary data collection through quantitative survey, qualitative data collection through key
informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs), and review of available secondary data.
These covered various categories of beneficiaries with the objective of understanding their perception of
the programme activities and utilisation of services.
The primary data helped the evaluation gain insights from the programme stakeholders on the aspects
noted in the desk review. The district-, upazila- and community-level discussions provided a deeper
understanding of the service delivery mechanisms at the last mile.
In addition to the interviews during primary survey, a physical observation of the key service points, such
as learning and multipurpose centres, community clinics, and information and feedback centres, was also
undertaken.

Evaluation Report
4.2.1. Data Collection Methods and Tools
a) Secondary information sources
As stated earlier, a systematic and detailed desk review was carried out using available resources. An
exhaustive list of these resources is attached in Annexure 7.
b) Tools and techniques
The quantitative tools with lactating mothers, mothers of children of 6 months to 14 years, adolescent
boys and girls, discussion guides for FGD, and KII with relevant stakeholders are attached. The FGD
guides have departed from the conventional mode of linear discussions and have used participatory
learning tools. Observation visits were conducted at the facilities, such as MPCs, community clinics, IFCs,
LFCs/schools, integrated nutrition facilities, etc. The objective of observation visits was to understand the
adherence to SOPs and reasons for deviation, if any. Perceptions of beneficiaries (present during the
observation visit) were also captured. A list of sites visited for data collection is attached in Annexure 12.
4.2.2. Data Analysis Methods and Tools
The evaluation team followed a three-step approach to data analysis, which is as follows:
— Step 1: Organising quantitative and qualitative data for analysis;
— Step 2: Describing data, generating findings; and
— Step 3: Interpreting data, assessing findings against the key performance indicators.
Content analysis constituted the core of the qualitative analysis undertaken by the team: documents,
focus group/interview notes and qualitative data emerging from fieldwork, from reconstruction of the
theory of change, and stakeholder analysis were analysed.
Comparative analysis was used to the extent possible, to examine findings across different categories of
stakeholders (comparing understandings and perceptions of different categories of stakeholders on the
relevance, utility, and need of CDPF approaches to capacity development in education), and to identify
best practices and lessons learned.
Quantitative analysis was used to analyse quantitative data available in databases and emerging from the
survey. Questionnaires were processed and data analysed using MS Excel software. The survey results
were further analysed by interpreting and crosschecking statistically relevant differences with interviews
and written sources.
Triangulation of information: Secondary data, collected in the desk review, were validated and
corroborated through interviews, focus group discussions and survey data; whereas data from interviews
and direct observation were analysed in a comparative way, using only the most frequent or common
findings as solid evidence, while also recording divergent views, when and if appropriate. Team
discussions were held regularly to jointly discuss and further triangulate information and validate findings.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 41
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The data from the secondary review and the primary qualitative study were triangulated to assess
the reliability and validity of the data. The evaluation matrix presents the sources from where the data
for the evaluation questions were collected. Triangulation for reliability was mainly undertaken within
methods, where appropriate, by comparison of perspectives of different stakeholders on the same issue.
In some cases, complementary observations and narratives of all stakeholders were also taken into
account to compare with secondary data. The findings were synthesised to document the story of how
the programme has performed on the set criteria, the enabling factors, challenges faced and overcome,
contribution towards the government’s agenda, and innovations and good practices. The list of the
secondary sources and evidences used in this study is attached in Annexure 5.
The analysis of the interventions under the programme was conducted at two levels: a) overall at
programme level, and b) at a disaggregated level. The disaggregation was done along the following
factors:
� Geographical area (including hard-to-reach areas or areas prone to natural disasters)
� Gender (men, women, boys, girls and other genders)
� Ability status (including persons with physical and intellectual/mental disabilities)
� Age (across the life-cycle)
� Community (the host communities and the Rohingya refugee communities).
A comparison of the results at the disaggregated level indicate the extent to which the planning,
implementation and progress as well as monitoring of the programme interventions has been equitable.
The analysis and findings focus on examining the evidence using the conceptual framework to answer the
evaluation questions under the OECD-DAC criteria. The findings focused on gathering evidence that was
evaluated in response to the criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and coherence,
and coordination. The report has collated and integrated findings from both secondary review of
programme documents, quantitative and qualitative discussions highlighting the stakeholders’ perspective
of changes that have been brought in, and their capacity to sustain the change.
The content of the FGDs and IDIs combine the data collected from multiple beneficiaries, the government
officials, UNICEF, the strategic partners, the donors and other stakeholders to understand the
implementation modality of the programme.
The findings also focus on stories of change and the role of change agents along with barriers to
implementation and its resolution. Intended and unintended results (both positive and negative) have
been documented across selected areas as well as at an overall programmatic level. Factors crucial for
the achievement of outcomes have been presented through assessing the contribution of the programme
in enhancing access to aspects such as formal and non-formal education and child protection systems
for the refugee and the host children along with promotion of equity, social cohesion, and resilience.
Additionally, the findings also focus on how the project learnings and best practices can be carried
forward, thereby providing evidence-backed recommendations on informing future programming.

Evaluation Report
4.3. Sampling Strategy
The survey was conducted in two upazilas (Pekua and Teknaf) of Cox’s Bazar and two camps of the
refugees (Camp 7 and Camp 15).
A two-stage cluster sampling method was adopted. The sampling was conducted in two stages:
Stage 1 – Selection of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs): Villages of the host community area and clusters
in the camps were considered as PSUs. In each upazila/camp, five PSUs were selected using simple
random sampling.
Stage 2 – A purposive sampling was undertaken for identification of households.
For each household, the availability of following beneficiaries (in consultation with the frontline workers/
implementing partners) was explored:
1. Lactating women
2. Adolescent boy/girl (equal proportion of the sample allotted to each gender)
3. Mothers of children aged 6 months to 14 years
4. Individuals with special needs.
The above sampling frame was used for drawing samples for both quantitative and qualitative data
collection.
Quantitative Sample and Distribution
Sample size has been calculated at project level, using the ‘differences method’ formula - as indicated
in the RFP. The formula (Cochran’s 1977), has been used for calculating the sample size - as provided
below:
Where:
p = estimated proportion of the population;
q = 1 – p;
z = standard score corresponding to the confidence interval;
d = margin of error;
deff = design effect
The sample has been separately calculated for the various target groups for the quantitative survey using
different indicators as the key characteristics as presented in the table below:

D 7% 7% 7%
Deff 1.1 1.1 1.1
Sample 195 178 212
Rounded off to 200 180 220
The p-values are determined based on the indicators that can ascertain the homogeneity of the
population, from where the sample would be drawn. In the case of lactating women, knowledge and per-
ceptions regarding nutrition of women during their pregnancy and lactating period as well as the nutrition
provided to the neo-natal children and infants would be assessed. Since, stunting is a proxy indicator
for these aforementioned areas, it is used for homogeneity measurement of the population. Similarly,
for children aged 6 months to 14 years as well as adolescents aged 15-18 years, nutrition as well as
education indicators were considered to arrive at the p-value. Since the sample size calculated through
the education indicator (i.e., school enrolment) was found to be larger, it was chosen as the final measure.
The margin of error (D) has been pegged at 7 per cent with an assumption that there would be an
increase in the knowledge and perception by at least 7 per cent.
Thus, the total sample to be covered for the survey was 600 respondents across these three segments,
distributed equally among the two camps and upazilas under the study. The distribution of the sample is
given as follows:

Evaluation Report
The sample is equally divided across the various geographies in order to ensure enough samples in each
geography to capture all nuances. Normalised data weights were applied to have a better representation
of different geographies in the analysis using the following formula:
Proportion of upazila/camp population in universe
Data weights =
Proportion of upazila/camp population in sample
Two sets of data weights were applied: 1) at an overall level (for the programme level indicators), and 2)
at upazila/camp level (for the indicators pertaining to only the host and the refugee communities). If latest
data of the universe for each target audience was available, the data weights were calculated separately
for the different target audiences using the same formula. If not, data weights were calculated using the
total population of the upazila/camp.
Observations were conducted for each of the services being provided under the programme. Observation
of facilities (one per service, each in camp and upazila) from the PSUs identified for the survey was also
conducted.
Qualitative Sample and Distribution
The sampling distribution for qualitative data collection was designed in a manner to capture diverse
perspectives of a range of stakeholders associated with the programme. This helped the evaluation team
establish the relevance of the programme, assessing the effectiveness, coherence, sustainability, and
identifying early signs of change towards building the resilience of the host and the refugee communities.
A total of 24 FGDs were conducted with the stakeholders and primary beneficiaries of the host and the
refugee communities.
The respondents for the FGDs were selected in a manner that there was adequate representation of each
of the subcategories within the respondents. For example, for the FGD with adolescents, it was ensured
that individuals that were a part of adolescent clubs and PWD were included. Similarly, for the FGD with
the community/caregivers, it was ensured that mothers of children aged 6 months to 9 years and 10-14
years, role model mothers, members of mother support groups, and caregivers of persons with disabilities
were included.
The evaluation team interacted with the most vulnerable and target groups of the programme, including
pregnant and lactating women, adolescent boys and girls and community members in the target
geography, and individuals with special needs. The implementing partners helped in the identification of
such individuals. Individuals with physical, mental and intellectual disabilities were included in the sample.
However, the evaluation team was unable to interact with any PWD on the field due to their unavailability.
The implementing partners could not facilitate meetings with PWDs, and hence they could not be included
as part of the FGDs conducted with respondent categories. In order to understand how the programme
is contributing to community system strengthening efforts, FGDs were also conducted with LCMC/SMC
and CPC, which are the key institutions in playing a critical role in ensuring the access to quality and safe
learning environment for children as well as ensuring that their rights are secured. The evaluation team
also interacted with the social workers or community volunteers to understand the contextual issues and
perspectives towards the programme from a service delivery dimension. A snapshot of sampling design
for the FGDs is provided in Table 5.

Evaluation Report
A comprehensive list of evaluation participants mapped with the respective tools is provided in
Annexure 6.
b) Gender and Equity Dimensions of the Evaluation
Given the focus of the programme on issues of equity and inclusion, the evaluation approach aimed to
view the outcomes from the perspectives of gender, ethnicity, disability, vulnerable groups, and those
groups residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas or areas prone to natural disasters. Towards this,
the evaluation adhered to integrate Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation: Towards UNEG
Guidance document42 to ensure responsiveness to the gender, equity and human rights aspects.
The evaluation also adopted the UN System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment
of Women (GEEW)43 framework for assessing the gender-related aspects. Based on the Addressing
Gender in Evaluations guideline by GEF-IEO44, the following steps have been undertaken for the same:
� The evaluation’s scopes of analysis and indicators have been designed in a way that ensures that
GEEW-related data is collected.
� The evaluation criteria and questions specifically address how GEEW has been integrated into
the design, planning and implementation of the interventions. GEEW principles, such as equality,
participation, social transformation, inclusiveness, and empowerment, have been considered.
� It has been ensured that the evaluation methodology and tools as well as data analysis techniques
selected are gender-responsive. Therefore, the tools and data collection methods have been
developed integrating GEEW considerations, so that gender biases and reinforcements of gender
discrimination are avoided. Additionally, triangulation of data was done at the analysis stage to ensure
that the voices of women, men, boys and girls are heard and represented.
� Finally, the evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations reflect a gender analysis.
The evaluation team recognises that gender equity is the process of being fair to men, women, boys
and girls. Therefore, across all the stages, the evaluation ensures a focus on gender, and not just on
women. The interests, needs and priorities of all were taken into consideration, recognising the diversity
and heterogeneity of different groups amongst women and men. The evaluation team also understands
the importance of gender equality, as well as the protection of human rights of all women and girls -
displaced by crisis or persecution, or on the move in search of new economic opportunities and horizons,
as has also been clearly articulated in the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants (NYD).
The NYD’s annexed Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) took this further by
addressing the rights and needs of women and girl refugees, specifically through their empowerment
and meaningful participation in the decision-making that impacts their lives, and those of their families
and communities. Keeping these aspects in mind, the evaluation tried to understand how the women
(especially in the refugee population) have been impacted by the programme to ensure - a) equitable
access to education, health, and livelihoods opportunities, b) increased self-reliance and equal and
meaningful participation in decision-making processes, and c) early signs of transformative results that

Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 49
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and challenges, experienced by the refugee
women and girls.
Essentially, this allowed the evaluation to map existing data and additional data against the programme’s
theory of change (ToC) to produce a performance story highlighting what is working, how it worked, and
why it is working in the programme setting.
With the proposed framework, the documentation not only identifies and describes the best practices
for wider adoption, but also highlights the relevance of extension of the programme towards building
resilience of the target communities through a comprehensive cross-sectoral intervention as well as
provide recommendations to guide future programming for greater impact.
4.5. Ethical Issues and Considerations
NRMC understands that certain populations, such as the Rohingya communities, need particular
protection during data collection and processing of their personal data. Hence, NRMC is committed
to designing its systems and processes with this consideration, from the outset. The evaluation team
understands the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) norms, standards and ethical guidelines,
and aspires to strictly adhere to the same.
Considering that the evaluation engaged adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, in sensitive
settings, special care was sought to ensure ethical behaviour and understanding in data collection. As
advised by UNICEF, an IRB approval (attached in Annexure 13) was sought for the evaluation tools and
methodology. Moreover, for those cases where the evaluation involved interviewing children, the team
abided by the ‘UNICEF procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children’. The children were asked to
participate on a voluntary basis, and their participation was strictly confidential.
The team for this assignment continued to be guided by the UNEG ethical guidance principles, which
ensured that no violation, like collecting data without consent, collecting data not pertaining to this
assignment, accessing areas within the institution premises for which approval has not been taken,
etc., was committed during the data procurement from various institutions. A snapshot of the team
composition, roles of the key members involved and their detailed experience is provided in Annexure 8.
All WHO norms and protocols were followed to ensure that the spread of COVID-19 infection is prevented
to the extent possible. The team was briefed on the updated guidelines at the onset of the fieldwork. The
data collection team from DMA conducted many surveys in the country during COVID-19 without any
instance of a COVID-19 positive case. They were well versed with the required precautions and protocols,
and ensured strict adherence of measures, like wearing mask, hand washing, use of sanitiser, and
maintaining safe distance. The responsibility of NRMC and DMA was to ensure that all precautions were
diligently followed and that all enumerators were equipped with masks, sanitisers and face-shields before
data collection on an everyday basis. Additionally, the team members were required to immediately inform
the supervisor or the team leader on feeling any symptoms of COVID-19. For the interviews, a consent
form was administered to the respondents, which stated to the respondent their voluntary participation
and confidentiality of information being collected.
In order to ensure utmost quality of data collection and analysis, the evaluation team was
responsible for undertaking the evaluation in the camps 7 and 15 as well as the host communities in
50 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Pekua and Teknaf. As part of the suggested team, they deliberately chose individuals, who had prior
experience of working in the Bangladesh context and with sensitive populations.
A gender balance was maintained within the evaluation team as well as the field team to ensure that
the respondents feel comfortable in opening up about sensitive and private issues. This was especially
important when asking questions to pregnant and lactating women and adolescent girls as well as
reporting on results specific to women and their lived experiences. Religious and cultural sensitivity
was also ensured during all interactions with the refugee communities as well as the host communities.
Hence, utmost care was taken to ensure that the respondent feels comfortable during all interactions.
Considering that this research involved engaging with vulnerable communities, special care was sought in
ensuring ethical behaviour and understanding in data collection.
A detailed summary of ethical issues and considerations have been attached as Annexure 11.
4.6. Limitations and Constraints
� Due to frequent transfers of the government representatives at district and upazila levels, the
evaluation was not able to capture their perceptions on the evolution of processes since the
commencement of the programme. The evaluation only captures the perception on the processes
existing at the time of data collection.
� The data collection in the camps was conducted post relaxation in the COVID-19-related restrictions.
The evaluators understand that as a response to COVID-19, the implementation partners were
engaged by the government in mandatory hygiene promotion activities and supporting additional
humanitarian assistance. The response of the beneficiaries on the service delivery may therefore be
biased and may not reflect their perceptions on the delivery mechanisms, specifically adopted under
the programme before the pandemic.
� On account of delays in permission to visit the camps because of the extended COVID-19 lockdowns,
there was a two-month gap between data collection in the host communities and the camps. By
the time field visit was conducted in the camps, the beneficiaries were exposed to additional two
months of implementation. The responses from the beneficiaries on the status of implementation may
therefore have varied between the camps and the host communities.

MAIN EVALUATION FINDINGS
5.1. Relevance
EQ 1. Did the project plan the programme elements with due consideration for the emerging
needs of the humanitarian context and existing development programme - supported by GoB and
other development partners?
Summary of the main findings 5.1.1:
— The programme elements are largely responsive to the growing needs of the refugees as well
as the host communities, and these are appropriate to address the challenges faces by the
communities.
— The programme is well-aligned with Joint Response Plan (JRP) and other national plans and
schemes, like NSSS, NPAN2, PEDP-4, National Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation,
Lactating Mothers Allowance (LMA), and Maternity Allowance (MA).
— The programme is strategically aligned with UNICEF’s revised Core Commitments for
Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs) and broader EU development cooperation with
Bangladesh.
— Beneficiaries’ views informed the programme design.
The programme elements are well planned, keeping in mind the growing needs of the extremely
vulnerable population of Cox’s Bazar and the camps inhabited by the Rohingya refugees. Given their
status of being stateless, the refugees continue to depend highly on external life-saving humanitarian
assistance. Further, their continuous influx in large numbers has created severe pressure on the local
economy as well as on the already sparse local infrastructure. This created a disruption of the WASH,
nutrition, child protection, and education-related services for the Bangladeshi host communities.
Additionally, the delivery system has been incapable of serving the needs of its population. Thus, the
situation continues to remain challenging for both the refugees and the host communities.
As also highlighted in various surveys and reports, the Rohingya refugees and the host communities
face certain common challenges, like access to diversified, nutrient-rich food, lack of formal education,
insufficient health and WASH provisions, and high rates of morbidity. The refugees lack regular income
and livelihood opportunities, which have a direct impact on their aggregate consumption levels. Moreover,
their children are in need of child protection services, as they face severe risks of child marriage, child
labour, trafficking, psychosocial distress, abuse and more. Child marriage serves as a negative coping
mechanism - arising from lack of awareness and insufficient income to support the child’s needs.
52 Midterm
Evaluation Report
The programme aimed to address the aforesaid challenges and improve access to effective basic
services in safe and protective environments through psychosocial support, nutrition security, education
and WASH, for both the Rohingya refugees and the host communities, based on their given needs.
The programme, with its commitment towards promoting positive behaviours and social cohesion,
system strengthening and capacity building activities aimed at supporting public systems for structural
service delivery, is well aligned with the current objectives of the Joint Response Plan (JRP) and GoB.
The programme builds and expands on the JRP, which was developed in close coordination with the
government. The JRP sets out a comprehensive programme shaped around three objectives, i.e., deliver
protection to empower the community and ensure that all aspects of the response contribute to an
enabling environment for the rights and well-being of affected populations, provide lifesaving assistance
to affected populations, and foster social cohesion. Moreover, it shares the same cross-cutting issues of
promoting protection, gender equality, and disaster risk reduction with the JRP.
Furthermore, the programme is tailored to meet other national plans, like National Social Security
Strategy (NSSS), Second National Plan of Action on Nutrition (NPAN2), Fourth Primary Education
Development Programme (PEDP-4), and National Strategy for Water Supply and Sanitation. The NSSS of
Bangladesh largely focuses on reducing poverty, promoting human development, reducing inequality, and
generating employment. Needless to say, this goes in line with the overall objective of the programme.
Nutrition component, in line with the NPAN2, focuses on achieving increased nutrition security for the
refugees and the host communities, with a focus on the adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women,
and the elderly population through a multi-sectoral approach. UNICEF’s lifecycle approach in ensuring
nutrition for all is clearly reflected in the programme document. Moreover, the nutrition-specific activities
of the programme directly contribute to heightening the institutional capacities of the National Nutrition
Services (NNS) to promote good nutritional practices in the host communities and the camps.
UNICEF also joined WFP’s SCOPE digital assistance system to distribute monthly soap supplies to the
refugees in the camps, and thereby is strengthening hygiene practices and helping prevent disease
outbreaks. Further, the programme also seeks linkages with existing platforms, such as Bangladesh’s
existing national social assistance schemes, like lactating mother allowance (LMA) and maternity
allowance (MA), for the benefit of the ultra-poor and most vulnerable pregnant women and mothers with
children less than two years of age. The purpose is to improve access to nutrition support and reduce
mortality amongst poor mothers and children, while also increasing the breastfeeding rate through
providing nutritious food during their pregnancy.
This programme complements the ongoing EU development cooperation with Bangladesh in the 2014-
2020 Multi-Annual Indicative Programme (MIP) priority areas of education and human development, food
and nutrition security, and sustainable development.
The programme is directly aligned with UNICEF’s revised Core Commitments for Children in
Humanitarian Action (CCCs), which form the centre of UNICEF’s policy and framework for humanitarian
action and have upholding of rights of children affected by the humanitarian crisis at its core. The CCCs
are grounded in global humanitarian norms and standards and set commitments and benchmarks against
which UNICEF holds itself accountable for the coverage, quality and equity of its humanitarian action and
advocacy.
In addition, the programme team took the views and perceptions of the targeted beneficiaries into
account while designing the project. The assessments and surveys conducted prior to the programme
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 53
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
that highlighted the issues of poor dietary diversity and food consumption scores, lack of full coverage
of Vitamin A supplementation, poor IYCF practices, lack of latrines and safe drinking water, weak
attendance for primary aged children, lack of available learning centres, etc. informed the design of
the programme. The analysis of discussions with the representatives, GoB (various line departments)
and the implementing partners confirms that the activities supported by the programme are aligned
with the pressing needs of the affected population and hence is relevant in the given context. The
analysis of survey data also indicates that 82 per cent of the respondents (mothers with children aged
less than 6 months) are extremely satisfied with their discussions with the health workers/nutrition
volunteers. Similarly, 89 per cent of the respondents (mothers with children aged from 6 months to 14
years) expressed extreme satisfaction with regard to their discussions with health workers. The reasons
highlighted for high satisfaction levels include trust on the information provided by the health workers,
their timely availability, and adequacy of the information.
EQ 2. Are all the programme components valid and relevant to the emerging needs of the
communities during COVID-19 and natural disasters?
Summary of main findings 5.1.2:
— The programme components are relevant and these have adapted to the emerging needs of
the communities during COVID-19 and natural disasters.
— Digital technology and caregiver-led learning approach were adopted during COVID-19, and
nutrition targets were revised.
— Strategy to disseminate key COVID-19 messages on prevention, mitigation and response
at community and facility levels was incorporated, and frontline workers were trained on
COVID-19.
— The programme is responsive to the strategic priority of the COVID-19 Response Plan
Overview.
— Despite adapting to the situation, there was under achievement of some targets due to
COVID-19-related challenges, fear of community-level contamination by service providers,
and restriction of movement in the field.
Serious child protection issues of early marriage, child labour, violence and abuse are present among
the Rohingya refugees. However, the advent of the pandemic and the consequent closure of support
structures like MPCs made child protection an emerging need of the communities. The camps saw a
rise in early marriage, and violence against children during COVID-19. Moreover, improved hygiene and
sanitation, nutrition, and education were also identified as the emerging needs by the programme team
in the context of the pandemic. Findings from the field show that few parents discontinued their children’s
education after the COVID-19-imposed lockdown was lifted.
The extreme levels of vulnerability among the affected communities make it imperative to continue
with the response for the identified, priority humanitarian needs of the refugees and the Bangladeshi
population, while at the same time, strengthening and complimenting it to address the additional response
requirements from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact.
54 Midterm
Evaluation Report
By the year 2021, the programme achieved good progress with the majority of its targets being on track.
However, the surfacing of COVID-19-related challenges, like fear of community-level contamination by
service providers, and restriction of movement, which have been previous challenges as well, hampered
the implementation of some activities, causing underachievement of some targets. Nevertheless, the
WASH and C4D sectors of UNICEF took on the task of COVID-19 communication and awareness
activities to ensure the smooth functioning of the programme. Given the essential nature of the
programme components, the programme adapted well to the changing needs of the situation
by making adjustments and modifications to its activities. These included creating awareness
on COVID-19 and introducing community-level activities during the pandemic. Moreover, business
continuity plans were developed, where Rohingya volunteers were trained and engaged on operation and
maintenance of WASH facilities including hygiene with remote supervision from the partners during the
lockdown.
UNICEF adopted the use of digital technology, as well as the use of a caregiver-led learning approach,
where Burmese language instructors visit homes of learners to enhance continuity of educational
activities in the camps. Though the learning and multi-purpose centres were closed during the pandemic,
teachers continued to make house visits, created small groups of children, and taught them for an
hour, often in open spaces identified with the help of LCMC, which also simultaneously worked on
raising awareness on COVID-19 in the camps. Even when the lockdown was lifted, the SMC in the host
community went door to door to motivate parents to send their children back to school.
The programme’s operation aligns with the strategic priority of the COVID-19 Response Plan Overview
(addendum to the Joint Multi Response Plan 2020), which aimed towards reducing the spread of the
pandemic as well as decreasing morbidity and mortality among the Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi
men, women, boys and girls in Cox’s Bazar district. Additionally, UNICEF distributed hundreds of
thousands of masks, and prepared a comprehensive communication strategy on COVID-19 to strengthen
and reinforce awareness creation on infection, prevention control and hygiene management practices,
inclusive of promoting the use of masks and washing hands frequently.
All community-level activities, like adolescent group sessions, courtyard sessions, farmer field schools
related to home gardening, etc., were suspended. Instead of group counselling, one-to-one IYCF
counselling was conducted with proper COVID-19 precautions. Community nutrition screening by
frontline workers was discontinued, and instead, mothers/caregivers were trained to use a MUAC tape
for measuring the nutritional status of their children. Dissemination of key COVID-19 messages on
prevention, mitigation, and response at community and facility levels and through audio messaging and
megaphones was incorporated. The community hygiene promoters though had to avoid many physical
visits, keeping in mind the protocols, used video calls and text messaging to complete their activities.
UNICEF’s nutrition sector added a supplementation strategy of conducting Vitamin A supplementation in
the camps and the host communities - since it is one of the life-saving nutrition emergency interventions,
using the door-to-door approach. Keeping in mind the COVID-19 outbreak, the programme also proposed
some nutrition revised target changes, which were made against the targets set in the initial logframe.
Further, frontline workers were provided COVID-19-related training through on-the-job and other training
modalities, including preparedness sessions on other natural disasters during the monsoons. UNICEF, in
collaboration with other UN agencies, has developed an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan
(EPRP) for Cox’s Bazar with the aim of strengthening its preparedness for natural disasters. Given the
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 55
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
susceptibility of the target area to natural disasters, like cyclones, floods, and fire hazards, early warnings
about imminent disasters are also given by the community-based committees, such as LCMCs, CBCPCs,
WASH, C4D volunteers, using handheld loudspeakers. They also hoist flags for disaster signalling and
help people in moving towards the shelters.
The qualitative findings also highlight that the Rohingyas in the camps received information on COVID-19
and the much-needed safety protocols on the same. Although the schools were closed, teachers
continued to make house visits and taught Rohingya children. However, the Rohingya refugees do
believe that the child protection needs were compromised due to the scaled-down services.
UNICEF has been a part of the massive international response in Bangladesh, supporting the installation
of toilets, pipelines for safe water, providing nutrition to build resilience in the communities, and helping
them in withstanding and coping with such stresses.
5.2. Coherence
EQ 3. Do the programme activities/components contribute to the main objectives of the
programme and align with the logframe/theory of change?
Summary of main findings 5.2:
— The programme saw internal and external coherence, along with alignment with the
programme objectives and the logframe/theory of change (ToC).
— Based on primary data, the programme is achieving some of the short to medium-term
outcomes mentioned in the ToC.
— Outputs of the programme are contributing to increasing access to various services and
amenities, thus, contributing towards achieving the programme’s main objectives.
— The ToC complements the strategies, plans, and programmes presented in the JRP, covering
education, child protection, nutrition, and WASH.
— Considering the legal status of the Rohingya refugees, there are limited efforts by GoB
towards mainstreaming of curriculums and learning frameworks/materials. Availability of
applicable curriculums and learning frameworks/materials that is also recognised by GoB (as
highlighted in the ToC) would require substantial advocacy efforts. Therefore, this may be
considered for omission from the ToC.
— Activities under all programme components are responsive to the overall objective.
Nevertheless, increased effort is required to mitigate the existing challenges that women and
especially children are facing with regards to WASH and child protection for further alignment
with the programme’s objective.
— There is complementarity amongst the efforts made by UNICEF, INGOs, GoB and
development agencies, and all of the stakeholders are leveraging each other’s strengths and
resources in the areas of nutrition, WASH, education, and child protection.
56 Midterm
Evaluation Report
The evaluation looked at coherence of the programme - both internally as well as externally. To examine
the internal coherence, the evaluation team looked at the alignment of the programme activities with that
of the overall programme objectives and the outcomes as envisioned in the logframe. With regards to
external coherence, the evaluation team examined the synergies between the programme planning as
well as the implementation strategies with that of the work undertaken by GoB and other development
partners.
The logframe/ theory of change (ToC) helps understand how the programme activities and outputs lead
to the desired results and outcomes. Given that the logframe/ToC of the programme complements the
strategies, plans, and programmes presented in the Joint Response Plan (JRP), covering education,
nutrition, WASH, and child protection sectors, it is coherent with the objectives mentioned in the JRP,
based on the protection framework. The programme covers the integration of services with regard to
education, nutrition, child protection, and WASH, ensuring maximum synergy through linkages among
different sectors. It was found that activities within these sectors are in alignment with the ToC/logframe,
as the primary data suggests that the programme is achieving some of the short to medium-term
outcomes mentioned in the logframe. The outputs of the programme are contributing to increasing access
to various services and amenities, and therefore, contributing towards achievement of the main objectives
of the programme.
The JRP is underpinned by four strategic objectives, of which three objectives are focusing on the
Rohingya refugees and the host communities in Bangladesh; i.e, i) SO1: Strengthen the protection of
the Rohingya refugee women, men, girls and boys, ii) SO2: Deliver quality life-saving assistance to
populations in need, and iii) SO3: Foster the well-being of communities in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas.
All these three objectives focus on but are not limited to education, nutrition, WASH, and child protection
sectors, which are essentially the major four components of the EU-funded programme. The programme
and its logframe align with the strategic objectives of the JRP, and its activities and implementation
strategies reflect the same.
Objectives mentioned in the education sector of the JRP indicate immediate access to equitable learning
opportunities in a safe and protective environment with the provision of quality, inclusive education
to children, and ensuring active participation and engagement in the education of boys and girls. To
achieve the target, the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education and the Refugee Relief and Repatriation
Commissioner (RRRC) together are ensuring uninterrupted education for the Rohingya children using the
Learning Competency Framework and Approach (LCFA) framework that aims to improve the quality of
education through provision of quality instructors and adequate quality teaching and learning materials. In
addition to that, gender-responsive and age-appropriate Early Childhood Development (ECD) content and
materials for three to five-year-old children have also been developed. The IDIs with representatives of
GoB at district and upazila levels highlight that while availability of quality teaching and learning materials
would be ensured, certification of the Rohingya education would be a challenge, as this would require
significant advocacy efforts and technical support.
The inter-sectoral working group utilise an integrated approach - where the members from child
protection, health, nutrition, WASH, and gender hubs work together to address the needs of children.
To complement the activities mentioned in the JRP framework, the programme logframe/ToC highlights
activities to ensure improved quality of learning experience and distribution of learning materials to
the children/teachers. In addition, the teachers and education officials receive training on preparation
on school plans at school level, training on pedagogical skills, such as teaching and learning strategy.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 57
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The programme also provides early childhood educational kits for the children to improve the quality of
education of primary school children.
Activities implemented by the programme on capacity building of the beneficiaries and stakeholders,
training of the beneficiaries and stakeholders (vocational and life-skill training, psychological training),
and infrastructure development, such as establishing learning centres, are contributing to the long-term
outcome of improving access to education services and learning opportunities. Hence, the programme
activities greatly contribute to and align with the programme objectives as well as the logframe and ToC.
The JRP’s sector objectives for nutrition focuses on high-quality life-saving, gender-responsive integrated
nutrition services, access and use of uninterrupted services, and enhancement of capacity of the partners
with the help of MoHFW and RRRC. Contributing to these objectives, the programme delivers nutrition-
sensitive and nutrition-specific services to children with SAM, MAM, PLW and IYCF practices, and
adolescent girls through various training and supportive supervision.
Specific activities under the programme include screening of acute malnutrition, providing basic nutrition
education to the beneficiaries as well as trainers and volunteers, training of health workers, IYCF care
practices, provision of IFA tablet, etc. to improve nutrition outcomes for the Rohingya refugees and the
host communities. The ultimate objective of the nutrition component of the programme works towards
improving nutrition outcomes for children and reducing childhood malnutrition, and its activities contribute
towards generating awareness on importance of accessing essential nutrition services and supplements,
as well as consuming safe and nutritious foods. It also ensures provision of social insurance and
supplying cooking stoves, training on food production, prevention of post-harvest loss, and enhancing
dietary diversity. In addition to the awareness-generation activities and capacity-building support, the
programme also provides MUAC tape to mothers to measure the nutrition status of their children and
builds their capacity to promote community monitoring of malnutrition. This has been a very successful
activity, especially in the context of the pandemic, when it was difficult for the volunteers and the
implementing partners to visit the programme locations. This has led to enhanced ownership amongst
the community with regard to raising the status of nutrition in both the camps and the host communities.
These activities are well aligned with the overall objectives mentioned in the logframe. Given that
these activities contribute to the long-term outcomes of ensuring nutrition security as well as reduction
in childhood malnutrition, as stated in the logframe and ToC, it can be concluded that the programme
components align and are synergistic with the overall objectives of the programme.
The last component of the programme is WASH, which ensures safe and sustainable WASH services.
Provision of training to community members and other stakeholders on various aspects of WASH,
construction of water supply schemes and latrine are the major activities under WASH component.
However, the programme is challenged to provide adequate gender-sensitive and inclusive sanitation
facilities, especially for women, mainly due to lack of space and overcrowded nature of the camps and
the terrain. Women are still struggling to reach the washroom facility at night, because they are worried
about safety. All other activities mentioned in the logframe fit to the programme objectives. Comparing
this EU-funded programme with the JRP, WASH sector of the JRP ensures adequate regular, sufficient,
and equitable access to drinking water, sanitation facilities, and promotion of hygiene practices. Activities
mentioned in the WASH sector explain capacity-building activities and actions to improve water services,
environmental sanitation, and hygiene promotion with the help of DPHE and the WASH sector. The
WASH sector activities undertaken by the programme align with the overall outcome of reducing morbidity
58 Midterm
Evaluation Report
and mortality due to WASH-related illnesses. However, more needs to be done in terms of ensuring
access to safe water and sanitation facilities, especially to women, to achieve the outcomes.
Similarly, the activities under child protection also align with the overall objective. However, primary
data suggests that despite activities, like psycho-social support, community-based child protection
mechanisms, and raising awareness on child rights, a lot more needs to be done for the communities
to be able to identify and report child protection concerns. Despite the coherence of activities with the
overall objectives of the programme, there is a need for efforts to change the perceptions around child
rights issues, so that the community members are able to identify child rights violations, and subsequently
report and take action on the same. This has become even more pertinent in the context of COVID-19,
as the incidences of child marriage and violence against children and adolescents have seen a rise. This
points towards a need for greater engagement between the child protection and C4D sections to design
and disseminate relevant messaging.
Activities under communication for development (C4D) and communication and visibility actions are well
aligned with the overall objective. Various communication channels (radio, mosque announcements by
religious leaders, mobile van loudspeaker) were deployed in promoting integrated package of family
life-saving behavior practices in all four thematic areas and COVID-19 prevention. Moreover, UNICEF
Bangladesh continued to present strong partnership with the European Union on various digital platforms.
Under the communication and visibility component, UNCEF Bangladesh and UNICEF Regional Office
of South Asia have continuously published and promoted success stories via social media posts. This
has resulted in an increase in the reach and engagement of their social media posts. Moreover, UNICEF
continued to ensure donor (EU) branding visibility at the facilities, the supplies, and the presentations and
trainings.
Therefore, it can be concluded that all the programme components that include activities on WASH,
CP, nutrition, education, and cross-cutting components, such as C4D and communication and visibility
actions, are contributing to the overall objectives of the programme and are in alignment with the ToC/
logframe. As mentioned above, there needs to be an increased effort on the ground in order to mitigate
the existing challenges that women and children especially are facing with regard to WASH and child
protection. Such additional efforts would ensure further alignment with the programme objectives, to
achieve the long-term outcomes envisioned as a result of the programme.
It is noteworthy that the evaluation team also found a great extent to which the programme structure
complemented the work of different entities, and its activities were in alignment with the programme
design and implementation mechanisms, which complemented the interventions undertaken by GoB and
other development partners.
In terms of external coherence, the IDIs with UNICEF sections, GoB representatives, and other
development partners indicate that there is complementarity amongst the efforts made by UNICEF,
INGOs, GoB, and the development agencies. All of the stakeholders are leveraging each other’s
strengths and resources in the areas of nutrition, WASH, education, and child protection.
For instance, UNCHR is taking the lead in the protection sector to protect the refugees by ensuring their
basic human rights as per the international standards. The protection sector has two sub-sectors: gender-
based violence, and child protection. The gender-based violence, led by UNFPA, focuses on reproductive
rights for all. It supports access to a wide range of sexual and reproductive health services. UNICEF
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 59
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
leads the child protection sub-sector towards preventing and responding to abuse, neglect, exploitation,
and violence committed against all children of all ages, genders, abilities and disabilities in Bangladesh
– through the provision of effective and timely child protection coordination, contributing towards a more
predictable, accountable, and dignified humanitarian response in Cox’s Bazar.
Such partnerships indicate a strong external coherence, thereby helping create synergy and coordination
with the government efforts and addressing gaps collectively. The evaluation team also found external
coherence with regard to alignment with the programme objectives, as the collective efforts are
contributing to the overall objectives of the programme as well the outcomes mentioned in the logframe.
5.3. Coverage
EQ 4. What is the reach of the key achievements keeping in view the differences among vulnerable
groups, locations, and varying demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, ability, etc.)?
Summary of main findings 5.3:
— The coverage of the programme was effective with many sought targets for 2020
being exceeded by efficient implementation, despite the pandemic creating certain
implementational difficulties.
— The beneficiaries in both the host communities and the camps have been reached with
essential services in all four sectors and cross-cutting elements.
— Targets were met in terms of raising nutritional awareness in adolescents and PLW, and in
Vitamin A supplementation among children aged 6-59 months.
— The targets for circulating hygiene messages were also achieved to the most extent in the
host and refugee communities.
— In terms of gender, both boys and girls, and men and women have been reached.
— Areas requiring further focus and scale-up identification of CP issues and case management.
In the last two years, the programme beneficiaries in both the host communities and the refugee camps
have been reached with essential services in all four relevant sectors as well as cross-cutting elements
(nutrition, education, child protection, WASH, C4D). The nutrition sector of the programme shows
pregnant, lactating women and adolescents have been reached with nutrition awareness, counselling,
and health services. As per the annual progress report 2020, the number of pregnant and lactating
women reached with nutrition awareness (maternal nutrition and IYCF) through increasing use of health
services in the camp was 20,378 (101.8 per cent), against the annual target of 20,000. The number
of adolescents reached with nutrition awareness and counselling through increasing use of nutrition
services in the camps reported 19,995 (99.9 per cent) and the host communities 2,127 (106.3 per cent)
against the second year’s annual target of 20,000 and 2,000 respectively. This means, in the camps,
pregnant, lactating women and adolescents have been reached with nutrition awareness and services
more than the expected target, whereas in the host communities, 99.95 per cent of the target was met
despite the restrictions caused by the pandemic. Timely adoption of innovative approaches and change in
60 Midterm
Evaluation Report
implementation strategies, such as one-to-one counselling instead of group sessions, and a door-to-door
approach, contributed to achieving the programme targets before time.
Likewise, children aged 6-59 months reached with Vitamin A supplementation in the camps and the
host communities shows similar achievement against the targets. Some 103.6 per cent beneficiaries
in the host communities, and 107.4 per cent in the refugee camps were reached with vitamin A
supplementation45. As per the second annual report, the over-reach is due to the actual figures compared
to the target, which was based on UNHCR population figures. The National Vitamin-A Campaign
conducted in the host communities and house-to-house vitamin A campaign conducted in the camps also
contributed to exceeding the targets. Other indicators, such as pregnant and lactating women reached
with IFA tablets, show similar positive trend towards achieving the target. The review of monitoring
reports suggests that only 1 per cent of the targeted vulnerable and ultra-poor households in the host
communities have received training on homestead gardening, prevention of post-harvest losses, and
dietary diversity. The IDIs with the representatives of DAE and UNICEF highlight that although this is a
key activity under the project, due to recurring lockdowns to mitigate COVID-19, this activity was severely
impacted. The discussions further indicate that the identification of remaining beneficiaries of the ultra-
poor households has been completed, but it would require four months to complete the total training
package (consisting of 16 sessions). This is expected to be completed post-relaxation of COVID-19
restrictions.
In the education sector, 197 teachers received training in the camps against 50 teachers mentioned
in the Year-2 target. Reach on adolescents, who received life and occupational skill training, reveals
that all thousand beneficiaries in the host communities benefitted from the service at the initial year
of the programme. In terms of feedback received, which is acted upon through IFCs, showed 20 per
cent increase in the host communities, and a 2 per cent increase in the camps against the baseline
situation. Against the target, the programme has acted upon 84 per cent of the feedback received in the
host communities, and 94.7 per cent in the refugee camps. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and its
associated challenges, the programme has exceeded its target and covered more beneficiaries than as
planned. However, data on children receiving improved quality of learning in learning centres and schools
that receive teaching and learning materials reported low coverage comparing to the other indicators.
Distribution of learning kits reached only 90 per cent of the targeted students (50 per cent girls) in the
host communities, whereas 52 per cent (47 per cent girls) of the beneficiaries in the camps received the
learning materials. The remaining distributions were not completed due to closure of LCs and schools
during the pandemic.
Data on protection and recreational services for the children of the refugee and the host communities
through multipurpose centres and reinforcement of referral services indicate that between the first and
second year of the programme, 6,810 children and adolescents (3,450 girls) have been reached across
the Rohingya and the host communities. Over the two years, 803 children (409 girls) have received
case management with support from EU, which is 80 per cent of the target. Some 92 social workers and
child protection actors have been trained over two years against the target of 100. These social workers
supported case management for 765 children (396 girls), of whom 730 children (379 girls) are in the
refugee camps, and 110 children (59 girls) are children with disabilities. Through one-on-one counselling
and home visits during the pandemic, psychological and recreational services were provided to 2,541
45 Second Annual Report 2020, February 2021
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 61
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
children (1,322 girls, and 12 with disabilities). The programme also provided training to 33 child protection
actors (19 female) on scaling up individualised and house-to-house approaches to facilitate psychosocial
support, supporting adolescents with information and provision of adolescents’ kits, awareness raising on
the impact of negative coping mechanisms, and messages on positive parenting tips during COVID-19.
As per the programme’s second annual report, 91 per cent targeted children reached with psychosocial
support during the pandemic.
To improve WASH conditions for the refugee and the host communities, data on persons who received
hygiene messages revealed that 40,000 people (18,000 females) in the host communities, and 27,051
in the camps were reached with the services against the target of 50,000 and 27,051 in both the host
communities and the refugee camps respectively. People were reached through hygiene promotion
training and messages in the host communities and the camps through Community Approaches to
Sanitation (CATS) approach, community engagement, and other participatory approaches. Among the
reasons for the increased coverage of people, who use WASH facilities, are construction of latrines
in Teknaf and Pekua upazilas, hygiene promotion programme using community engagement and
participatory approaches, provision of training on operation, management and maintenance of WASH
infrastructure, water safety planning, hygiene and implementation of CATS to staff of local government
institutions and NGOs as well as elected local representatives, WatSan committees (teachers, religious
leaders, community volunteers, users, and operation and maintenance committees), and masons within
the communities. In the refugee communities, especially women are engaged in designing and upgrading
WASH facilities, such as toilets, bathing spaces, and water-point collection areas, in line with the WASH
Sector Gender, GBV and Inclusion Road Map. This has contributed to increasing the coverage of WASH
service, mainly due to the refugees starting to take responsibility and maintaining closer connection with
the implementing partners to raise, discuss and resolve breakdowns or challenges.
Communication for development played an important role in promoting essential services in both the
camps and the host communities. In the camps 7 and 15, some 87,057 people (45,207 females) were
reached with life-saving messages, including COVID-19 prevention messages as well as messages on all
four sectors of nutrition, education, protection, and WASH.
Data therefore suggests that the targeted beneficiaries in both the host communities and the refugee
camps have been reached with critical services, by adjusting modalities of implementation to mitigate
COVID-19 challenges. As lockdowns and widespread restrictions on group activities continued through
most of 2020 with the temporary closure of many facilities, UNICEF and its partners concentrated on
more individualised delivery modalities and house-to-house visits, adopting the use of technology, and
enlisting the support of additional community volunteers, who played an increasingly critical role in the
pandemic response to reach critical masses with life-saving messages and essential services.
5.4. Efficiency
EQ 5. Was there clear distribution of roles and responsibilities of the key actors involved,
including programme governance mechanisms, staff, and the implementing partners towards the
achievement of objectives?
62 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Summary of main findings 5.4.1:
— The programme’s efficiency has been generally good with a clear articulation of roles and
responsibilities of the key actors and the respective geographical areas assigned.
— The implementing partners are aware of the programme governance mechanisms and have
been participating in the PMC and PIC meetings regularly during COVID-19, leading to
efficiency in programme response and delivery.
— ‘One Camp One Partner’ approach minimised the chance of duplication of beneficiaries and/
or services offered.
The representatives of the implementing partners across the four components (WASH, nutrition,
education, C4D, and child protection) clearly articulated their roles and responsibilities in the programme.
They were also aware of the roles of other partners and the assigned geographical areas. The
implementing partners for the camps believed that ‘One Camp One Partner’ approach minimised the
chance of duplication of beneficiaries and/or services offered. The orientation of the staff (across various
levels of implementation) for an implementing partner before the commencement of interventions helped
them understand the relevance of programme, its objectives, and implementation strategy. The regular
refreshers’ training, conducted by UNICEF or by the implementing partners, provided an opportunity for
the staff members to talk about their concerns/challenges faced during implementation or highlighting the
changing context (specifically during COVID-19), and seek guidance on the changes that can be brought
in the modalities of implementation.
The implementing partners were also aware of the coordination mechanisms at the sectoral and
programme levels, such as PIC and PMC, and confirmed their regular participation in the meetings.
The implementing partners expressed that these meetings provided them the platform to highlight
achievements of the programme and articulate areas, where they require support from the local
administration and other sectoral leads. The discussions with the government representatives highlighted
that the PMC and PIC meetings helped them track the progress of the programme, and redefine the
priority areas for the implementing partners due to COVID-19. The engagement of the implementing
partners in preparation of micro-plan for conducting Nutritional Awareness Week that clearly defines
preparatory actions, timeline and responsibilities of each stakeholder, is one example that provides
evidence on increased coordination among the government departments and the implementing partners.
EQ 6. Have the resources been requested, allocated, and utilised adequately to implement
the planned activities? To what extent have UNICEF and the implementing partners made
good use of the human, financial and technical resources, and have made appropriate use of
tools (programme and financial management) and approaches to pursue the achievement of
programme results in a cost-effective way?
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 63
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
Summary of main findings 5.4.2:
— The programme funds have been disbursed judiciously and timely as per the implementation
plan.
— Supplies of essential items have reached on time to implement the planned activities.
— Monitoring of results and outcomes was found adequate with regular submission of monthly
and quarterly reports on progress against set targets.
— The programme efficiency was impacted to an extent due to COVID-19. Although, the
pandemic caused certain disruptions in the implementation of planned activities, adequate
measures were taken to minimise the disruptions.
Based on the review of Programmatic Visit Reports46 and discussions with the implementing partners, it
can be inferred that - a) the implementing partners regularly submitted monthly and quarterly reports on
the progress against targets, and b) there was timely disbursement of funds as per the implementation
plan from UNICEF. The review of these reports further suggests that the supplies of items, such as MHM
Kits, deworming syrups, antibiotics, anthropometric kits, ECD kits, school box kits, school bags, and
C4D materials, were timely and adequately provided by UNICEF. The procurement of laptops, printers
and scanners was also timely done. The distribution of these items to the beneficiaries was also done
as per the timeline. The only exception to the timely provisioning of supplies emerged from the review of
RtR programmatic visit report (for the reporting period of August 2019) that highlighted unavailability of
core materials (developed by other LCFA partner), leading to delay in developing supplementary reading
materials and achievement against the target.
With regard to timely achievement of outputs, the advent of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns
during the periods of March-May 2020 and April-August 2021 disrupted the implementation of activities
across the components as per the plan. The restrictions were stricter in case of the camps. As a result,
the project interventions across the host communities and the camps were limited to mandatory and
emergency hygiene promotion activities, such as importance of handwashing, ensuring availability of
handwashing devices and soap, and MHM kits distribution. Similarly, while uninterrupted water supply
in the camps was ensured during the lockdown, restriction on movement of technicians, and closure
of water testing labs resulted in limited testing and monitoring of the quality of water. For RtR, closure
of schools during the lockdowns resulted in rescheduling of follow-up survey on ASER plus. In case of
nutrition, fear of infection restricted families from seeking health and nutrition services, halted household-
level visits for counselling services, and delayed the selection of beneficiaries for the nutrition-sensitive
interventions.
46 Programmatic visits: A component of programme monitoring, visits provide assurance that results reported by the partner are
accurate. The objective of a programmatic visit is to obtain evidence on the status of the implementation of the programme as
well as to review progress towards achievement of planned results, challenges and constraints in implementation, and ways
to address those.
64 Midterm
Evaluation Report
In order to address the challenges due to COVID-19, an Implementation Acceleration Plan for 2020 was
designed. The acceleration plan highlighted achievements till May 2020, the implementation challenges,
and priority measures to overcome challenges. Some of the measures include:
� Capacity building of social workers and child protection actors using digital platform on case
management under COVID-19, providing community-based psychosocial support, conducting regular
follow up, and providing referral services for children.
� Caregiver-led education, provided by Burmese instructors in the camps.
� Creating mother support groups and other community-based platforms that can continue providing
messaging on nutrition. The objective was to continue nutrition counselling and referral of PLWs to
health facilities for nutrition services, which was affected due to restriction of movement of community
nutrition workers. The mothers were also trained on identification of SAM cases and referral to health
facilities.
� Adoption of digital platforms for training of agriculture extension workers on agriculture and nutrition.
The changes in implementation modalities required adjustment of the workplan and budget. The IDIs
with the implementing partners suggest that UNICEF was flexible in accommodating requirement for
additional budget through realignment of unutilised funds within different budget heads. There was timely
submission of proposals by the partners along with approval from UNICEF.
5.5. Effectiveness
EQ 7. How effectively have the results been achieved? Were there any obstacles/bottlenecks/
issues that limited the successful implementation and results achievement of the programme?
Summary of main findings 5.5.1:
— Given that the programme is still in operation, it has overall been effective in achieving the
results across all components.
— The knowledge-generation initiatives have been effective and have resulted in a change in
perceptions among the beneficiaries. However, socio-economic factors are still depriving
children, especially girls, of their rights.
— The beneficiaries and stakeholders are generally satisfied with the outputs and outcomes of the
programme, although as pointed out by them, further strengthening of efforts towards providing
life skills trainings, child protection services, education after Level IV, gender-segregated toilets
and disability-friendly infrastructure is needed.
— The programme, although overall effective, observed constraints in the form of COVID-19-
related restrictions that caused underachievement of some targets, and also gave rise to
problems, like school dropout, child marriage, child labour and violence.
— The development of the ToC in the middle of the programme limited the comprehensive review
of the same.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 65
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
Education
The midline findings indicate that through its programme interventions, UNICEF targeted the capacity
building of teachers, who are central to achieving the objective of improved access to education services
and learning opportunities. A total of 50 education officials in the host communities and 197 teachers
(more than the target of 50) in the camps were trained as per the Year-2 targets laid out in the logframe.
The teachers in the camps reported having received frequent training on psychosocial support (PSS),
DRR, COVID-19 awareness and mental health, refreshers’ training, protection from sexual exploitation
and abuse (PSEA), and pedagogical skills, such as teaching and learning strategies, that are altered to
fit the varying needs of the refugee children. The teachers use innovative and interactive techniques in
their teaching, such as cards, pictures and acting, etc., so that the students can engage with the content
better. They also use Burmese, Rohingya and English languages, so that the students understand the
lessons easily and face no language barrier. This was also seconded by the adolescent boys and girls
in the discussions held with them. Additionally, UNICEF, in 2019, initiated the peer-led Teacher Learning
Circles (TLCs), where the teachers sit together and discuss ideas, issues, experiences, good teaching-
learning practices, and then plan for the next week. The teachers also provide information to the students
on COVID-19, early marriage, climate change, alternate fuels, child labour and child rights, sexual and
reproductive health, risks of trafficking, prevention of GBV, decision-making skills, and building self-
esteem. The interventions in the education sector experienced disruptions due to the pandemic, but
UNICEF adapted to the situation by initiating e-learning platforms for training the teachers and master
trainers. Moreover, the pandemic resulted in the closure of schools, but to continue with the teaching-
learning process, the school adopted a home-based teaching method, where the teachers in the camps
divided the students into small groups, and took classes in the houses of the students or in suitable open
spaces.
As per the logframe, the targets for the rehabilitation and construction of learning centres were met in the
first year of the programme. Mothers of children aged 6-14 years also expressed that facilities like pre
and primary school in the host communities as well as learning centres in the camps exist. Some 81.2 per
cent of mothers in the host communities and 84.1 per cent in the camps also had their children enrolled
in a school/LC. Further, the survey conducted among adolescent boys and girls reveals that 70.9 per cent
of adolescents in the host communities and 66.1 per cent in the camps are currently attending a school/
LC. The remaining 29.1 per cent in the host communities and 33.9 per cent in the camps are still not
attending schools, either because they need to take care of household chores or because their parents
do not think that attending school is important. This lack of awareness about the importance of education
among parents was found higher in the camps as compared to the host communities. Moreover, it was
also observed that over time, the students had to discontinue their education and drop out of schools,
because they needed to work, their family needed them to take care of household chores or as stated
above, their parents/guardians did not think that attending school is important. This was the case in both
the camps and the host communities, and it also resonates with the qualitative data findings - where the
adolescent boys during the FGD in both the camps and the host communities highlighted that dropout
rates are high in their communities due to poor financial conditions. Most of the boys are engaged in
child labour to support their families. This was the case in both the camps and the host communities, and
it also resonates with the qualitative data findings, where the adolescent boys during the FGD in both
the camps and the host communities highlighted that due to poor financial conditions, the dropout rates
are high in their communities. Most of the boys are engaged in child labour to support their families and
work as day-labourers or in salt processing or workshops. They also highlighted that because of the poor
66 Midterm
Evaluation Report
financial conditions, families often give priority to boys’ education, and therefore, girls’ education is not
prioritised - as highlighted in the discussion with boys in Pekua. This was also found in the discussions
with adolescent girls in Camp 7, where they highlighted that they face challenges in attending schools,
and therefore, demand home-school. The findings from the survey also highlight that more girls than
boys in both the camps and the host communities have never attended a school or LC. Moreover, more
adolescents in the camps than in the host communities report of never attending a school/LC. The girls
in the camps also stressed that some parents do not allow adolescent girls to attend schools during
their period. They also expressed their concerns over not having an opportunity to receive any sort of
education after Level 4. Nevertheless, adolescent boys and girls who had to drop out of school expressed
their willingness to resume education, if their families’ financial condition improves or if there is a higher
school or learning centre nearby.
The programme has met the Year-1 and Year-2 targets for establishing/reinforcing MPCs and adolescent
clubs (ACs). The evaluation found 40.9 per cent of adolescent girls and boys in the host communities
and 14.3 per cent in the camps benefitting from the life-skill trainings and knowledge sessions at the
adolescent clubs. The adolescent clubs and vocational training centres are providing the adolescents
with vocational and skill development trainings, like computer repairing services, mobile phone repairing
services, and tailoring. The adolescents have found the trainings very useful. It also noticed that,
the adolescents who completed skill development trainings are now trying to get involved in income-
generating activities, including tailoring (such as production of cloth masks), block and boutique printing,
and mobile phone and computer servicing. However, implementation of such income-generating activities
is in the initial stage, and there is a huge demand for creation of livelihood opportunities in both the camps
and the host communities.
A large proportion of mothers in both the camps and the host communities agree that the schools and
LCs have adequate classrooms (96.6 per cent in the HC, and 100 per cent in the camps), an adequate
number of teachers (96.6 per cent in the HC, and 100 per cent in the camps), proper sitting arrangements
(98.3 per cent in the HC, 100 per cent in the camps), books and reading materials (93.1 per cent in
the HC, and 87.3 per cent in the camps), safe drinking water facilities (93.1 per cent in the HC, and
100 per cent in the camps), and separate toilets for boys and girls (77.6 per cent in the HC, and 100
per cent in the camps). However, as found in the FGDs with adolescent boys in Pekua, the problem of
pure drinking water supply, handwashing zone and toilets still remain a problem in schools, and there is
scope for improvement. Some 37.2 per cent of mothers pointed out that there still exists the problem of
adequate facilities for people with special needs. Schools are also arranging meetings between parents
and teachers, where they exchange their views on a range of things, like their children’s educational
advancement, the support children should get at home, the support their children should get at school/
LC, the behavioural/attitudinal issues about their children and the behavioural/attitudinal issues about
teachers. However, the survey with the mothers shows that a majority of them (50 per cent in the host
communities, and 72.7 per cent in the camps) did not attend these parent-teacher meetings.
The LCMCs in the camps play a significant role in ensuring that parents send their children to schools,
and within two years, they have been able to make the locality aware of the importance of education
and have convinced the parents to send their children (aged 5-14 years) to school. The LCMC members
say that this has successfully contributed to bringing down the cases of child labour. The committee
supervises school-going children based on multiple parameters, like if children regularly attend school,
if teachers teach their classes regularly, if classrooms are ready for proper schooling, and does a follow-
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 67
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
up on both students and teachers. However, the LCMCs contacted by the evaluation team complained
of not receiving any capacity-building training, and hence, demand academic management training in
order to monitor the education in the learning centres efficiently. Further, discussion with the LCMC
members revealed that there is a demand for interesting learning materials for children along with
biscuits, umbrellas, and school dresses. They requested introduction of education above Level 4 in the
learning centres. Similarly, even in the host communities, only the SMC in Teknaf reported receiving
some training from different organisations on teaching, improving lessons, handling weak students,
COVID-19 prevention, cyclone preparedness, etc. The qualitative findings highlight that these trainings
were mostly received by the headmaster and not by all members of the committee. Moreover, some of
the headmasters were dissatisfied with the training and workshops. For instance, a workshop on how
to conduct a quality class with only 20 students was not found useful by them, because the total size of
their class was 250 students, and hence, they felt it was not contextually relevant. More importantly, the
SMCs have not been very active in the communities. Their meetings are not held in a timely manner and
the committee members do not attend the meetings. The SMCs are concerned over the poor quality of
education in children, especially after the COVID-19 lockdown, and therefore want more funds to support
students’ education. After the reopening of schools, the committee members made efforts to go from
house to house and motivate parents to send their children back to school.
Quantitative findings show that 64.3 per cent of mothers in the host communities and 61.8 per cent of
mothers in the camps were aware of these committees. They are extremely satisfied with the committees’
management of the schools/LCs, and half of them even had a chance to interact with the members.
Nutrition
The survey conducted in the host communities and the camps points towards an increase in the degree
of knowledge and awareness of good food/nutrition intake, dietary diversity, and food preparation
practices in the communities. The evaluation found that the Year-2 targets for reaching pregnant and
lactating women with nutrition awareness (IYCF) through increasing use of health services have been
accomplished. The Year-1 target for the host communities, however, could not be achieved due to the late
approval of the community-based nutrition programme (CBNP).
The quantitative survey found that 98.5 per cent of lactating women in the camps and the host
communities know that breastfeeding should start within one hour of birth, which was not the situation
during the baseline (72.2 per cent in the HC, and 76.8 per cent in the camps). Some 86.3 per cent of
mothers (with children aged less than 6 months) in the host communities and 100 per cent of mothers in
the camps reported starting breastfeeding within one hour of birth. This was not the case in the baseline.
During the baseline, only about 50 per cent of the mothers in the host communities initiated breastfeeding
within one hour. Some 96.6 per cent of the mothers also provided their babies with the first breast milk
(colostrum) right after birth. Moreover, 92.2 per cent of lactating women in the host communities and 76.5
per cent in the camps were aware that a child needs to be exclusively breastfed for at least six months.
Mothers are even aware of the benefits of IFA. A total of 19,271 (against 20,000) pregnant and lactating
women in the host communities and 4,676 (against 4,771) in the camps were reached with IFA tablets in
Year 2.
The quantitative survey also found that a high proportion of sampled mothers (with children aged 6
months to 14 years) in both the target areas have also received micronutrients/IFA, but the number is high
68 Midterm
Evaluation Report
for the camps (84 per cent in the camps, and 67 per cent in the host communities). Some 50 per cent of
lactating mothers in the host communities and 72 per cent of lactating mothers in the camps received IFA
every day during their pregnancy, and almost the same number of lactating mothers continued consuming
IFA even after their deliveries. This was also highlighted in the FGDs in the camps and the host
communities, where women and girls reported getting iron tablets. Adolescent girls in both the camps and
the host communities have received information on IFA supplementation (73.2 per cent in the camps, and
55.5 per cent in the HC). The number of adolescent girls receiving IFA tablets has increased (71.3 per
cent of girls in the host communities, and 83.3 per cent in the camps), but they consume it less frequently,
i.e., once in 3-4 days.
Additionally, with regards to Vitamin A supplementation, almost all mothers in the camps (96.7 per cent)
stressed that their children was given Vitamin A supplementation. The numbers were comparatively low
in the host communities (74.5 per cent). Moreover, as per the Cox’s Bazar district National Vitamin A
Campaign (June 2021) report, Vitamin A supplementation coverage was 98.22 per cent (Pekua 97.48 per
cent, and Teknaf 98.96 per cent). It must be noted that the outcomes of the survey, done by the evaluation
team, differ from the NVAC monitoring outcomes.
Mothers in both the camps and the host communities are aware of the information that Vitamin A
supplementation should be provided to children. They know the early signs of malnourishment in a child,
and are aware of the proper time when complementary feeding should be introduced for a child. They are
also aware of what needs to be kept in consideration while preparing and storing foods.
A total of 19,995 adolescent girls in the host communities and 2,127 in the camps were reached with
nutrition awareness and counselling, meeting the Year-2 targets.
As highlighted in the qualitative discussions, the problem of unemployment continues to remain a
challenge in both the host communities and the camps, and women expressed their concerns over
unemployment of and lack of job opportunities for their husbands.
The host communities and the Rohingya refugees have access to primary health centres/community
clinics and tertiary healthcare centres/private hospitals. However, as pointed out in the FGDs in the host
communities, women face challenges in accessing healthcare services. These challenges were identified
as poor transportation services, distance to healthcare facility, and long queues at the facilities. These
challenges make pregnant women particularly vulnerable. Moreover, qualitative findings show that the
community clinics referred their patients to the upazila health complexes because of lack of adequate
facilities to treat major illnesses. However, it is important to note that improving healthcare facilities is not
an objective of the project.
The nutrition volunteers/community health workers, IFC youth volunteers, adolescent clubs, and mother
support groups have largely been responsible for the dissemination of information for awareness
generation. The programme has achieved its target for training and retraining health workers and
community volunteers. The community nutrition volunteers have received a wide range of trainings -
on GMP, SAM, MAM, CMAM, COVID-19, etc. The nutrition volunteers in both the camps and the host
communities make door-to-door visits and screen children under two and five years of age to find out
cases of SAM or MAM. The programme has met its Year-2 target by 100 per cent with regard to the
treatment of children with acute malnutrition. Nutrition volunteers also visited mothers in the camps after
childbirth (94.5 per cent). This number is low for the mothers in the host communities (53.8 per cent).
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 69
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
With regard to mother support groups, 53 per cent of mothers in the host communities and 80.2 per
cent of mothers in the camps were aware of these groups. Some 30.6 per cent of mothers in the host
communities and 80.8 per cent in the camps were even members of the mother support groups, and
had also received training as a part of it. The groups holds meetings, where discussions are held on the
need for consuming IFA tablets, child immunisation, complementary and supplementary feeding, child
screening, hygiene practices, and need for mothers’ vaccination. However, only 44 per cent of mothers
reported receiving information from the mother support groups on child and maternal nutrition. They
consider the community health workers the most trusted source of information (75.3 per cent). A striking
finding made by the evaluation team was that 66 per cent of mothers in the host communities felt that
their needs are neglected because of the Rohingya refugees. Nevertheless, UNICEF provides training on
homestead gardening to the people in the host communities. Along with that, DAE also provides some
training to the farmers on crop cultivation. It advises the farmers on a range of things, like - how to protect
crops during a natural disaster, what pesticide to use for which crop, how and how much pesticide to use
when crops get infected, and what type of paddy to cultivate in which season. However, the programme
is yet to meet its target for training vulnerable and ultra-poor households on food production, prevention
of post-harvest losses, and dietary diversity in the host communities. So far, only 100 farmers from the
demonstration gardens have been trained against the target of 10,000 farmers.
The agriculture extension workers of DAE in Pekua focused on people being aware of the nutritional
needs to remain healthy, and they encouraged homestead gardening among the communities, especially
for nutrition. Moreover, DAE even helped the farmers by providing them with various types of seeds, so
that they could grow various types of crops and vegetables during COVID-19.
WASH
The midline evaluation of the programme found that the Rohingyas and the host communities have
access to toilets. The programme achieved its target of constructing 150 and 50 appropriate accessible
latrines in the host communities and the camps respectively. The primary survey findings show that open
defecation is not practiced among the community people anymore. The information gathered by the
evaluation team found a glaring difference between the host communities and the camps when it came
to having toilets within the household premises. This was common among all adolescents and mothers
interviewed. Where on the one hand, 92.7 per cent of adolescents and 96.7 per cent of mothers with
children aged between 6 months and 14 years in the host communities had toilets within the household
premises, only 8.9 per cent of adolescents and 13.2 per cent mothers in the camps had that facility. The
ones who did have a toilet reported having a pit latrine with a slab. The FGDs with women in Pekua
highlighted that the small percentage, who did not have their own toilets, use open toilets, and they
are the extremely poor households. Further, the camps have community toilets. Some 100 per cent of
adolescents and mothers in the camps reported having access to community toilets, and 66 per cent of
mothers in the host communities also have access to community toilets. However, as pointed out in the
qualitative interviews with adolescent boys and pregnant women of Camp 7, they still face the challenge
of separate toilets for boys and girls. Women and adolescent girls in the FGDs in Camp 15 complained
about not having adequate number of toilets. One toilet is shared by many households. Moreover, the
quantitative findings show that the toilet is either too far or too dirty or does not have water and soap,
limiting its access. The female respondents also highlighted that they fear accessing toilets at night. The
women in the camps complained about not having lights in toilets. Women in Teknaf also highlighted that
they refrain from using toilets at night, as they fear being attacked by the Rohingya refugees residing
70 Midterm
Evaluation Report
nearby. Further, the survey conducted among the three categories of respondents points towards a high
degree of good WASH practices wherein respondents in both the camps and the host communities wash
their hands with soap after defecation, before cooking, before eating, and after handling child faeces.
The community health promoters and volunteers have received training on hygiene promotion and have
been actively performing their roles, and thereby, have helped in bridging information gaps and spreading
awareness. The programme has met its target of reaching people through hygiene promotion training and
messages in the camps (27,051), and it is on track to achieving the target for the host communities.
Adolescents have received information on menstrual hygiene (57.3 per cent in the host communities,
and 69.6 per cent in the camps). Adolescent girls use both cloth and sanitary pads during menstruation.
While 51 per cent of adolescent girls in the host communities and 58 per cent in the camps use cloth
during menstruation, 53 per cent of adolescent girls in the host communities and 94 per cent of girls in the
camps use sanitary napkins. This is a huge change when we compare the data with the baseline figures
(66.6 per cent in the camps used sanitary pads). There exists a difference between the camps and the
host communities with respect to sources of procurement of sanitary pads. Where the majority in the host
communities buy it from a shop (90 per cent), the majority in the camps get them as a part of the dignity
kit (91 per cent). The community lacks knowledge of safe disposal practices. A high proportion of the
adolescents (70 per cent in the HC, and 72 per cent in the camps) believed in burying the pad after use.
Moreover, they also do not have information on throwing the pads (wrapped) in a dustbin. This level of
unawareness is high among the host community (85 per cent in the HC, and 33 per cent in the camps).
Due to unawareness, only 25 per cent of adolescents in the host communities and 50 per cent in the
camps reported throwing pads wrapped in a dustbin. Some 60 per cent of them in the host communities
and 55 per cent of them in the camps still bury those under the soil. The figures have only increased, if
we look at the baseline data (44.7 per cent in the camps, and 34.3 per cent in the HC buried pads under
the soil). A significant proportion of adolescents also throw pads in the latrine pits, which can clog the
toilets. Moreover, the level of awareness on sexual reproductive health is also low since almost half of
the respondents have not received any information on the same. Adolescent girls lack a private place in
their house. Adolescent girls in Camp 15 highlighted the problem of having extremely small houses due to
which they face a challenge in changing the sanitary napkins, as there is no privacy for women and girls.
With respect to WASH facilities in schools/LCs, 87.3 per cent of adolescents in the host communities,
and 93 per cent in the camps reported of having separate toilets in schools. Some 87.3 per cent of
adolescents in the host communities and 95.7 per cent in the camps also reported having safe drinking
water facilities in their schools/LCs.
The programme has achieved the target for construction of a community water supply scheme in the
camps (7 for years 1 and 2), but is yet to meet the target set for the host communities. The survey
findings suggest that tubewell/borehole outside the household premises (for the host communities)
remains as main source of drinking water. For the camps, the main source of drinking water was a public
tap. Adolescents and mothers say that the water generally looks clean and odourless when collected,
and therefore a majority of them do not treat water. This is inconsistent with the baseline figures, where
73.1 per cent in the camps and 10.1 per cent in the HC treated drinking water. Of those little, who did
treat water, the methods used are - water filter, straining water through a cloth, chlorine tablet, and boiling.
However, access to safe water still remains a concern, as was highlighted in the FGDs with women.
Pregnant women in the camps face a problem in fetching water, as the houses are located on highlands.
Even in the host communities, the discussions with the women brought out the problem of having
inadequate sources to get safe water. With regards to awareness, the parents in Camp 15 informed about
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 71
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
receiving information on clean and safe drinking water. The parents know that after collecting water,
they should put a cover/lid on the pitchers or the buckets and keep the water at a height. They are even
practicing this in their lives.
Furthermore, the evaluation found that the faecal sludge management sites have been constructed in
the camps and targets have been achieved (nine in Year 1, and three in Year 2). An analysis of the FGDs
with women in the camps highlights the challenge of treatment of waste. During the discussions with the
implementing partners, they highlighted that the WASH facilities - created by the programme - have been
handed over to the communities. However, an absence of guidelines for operations and maintenance of
community assets and training of the community members, poses a threat to continued usage of such
facilities.
Child Protection
UNICEF has worked in the area of ensuring child protection services to the most vulnerable. The
child protection volunteers and actors in both the camps and the host communities work on identifying
vulnerable and at-risk children. They identify the cases, report it, and even do a follow up on the cases.
The CP volunteers in Camp 15 also highlighted getting tipped by the parents’ groups and youth groups on
case identification. Similarly, the CP volunteers in Camp 7 reported getting the assistance of the majhis
and some local people in doing the same. He also stressed that people have become more aware of child
rights after the formation of CPC, and they have a better life now. The CPA in Teknaf reported conducting
home visits and engaging in discussions with the women in the communities, and conducting group
meetings with parents about child protection issues. The trained volunteers in Camp 7 have also been
providing psychological support services. Moreover, during the pandemic, the volunteers and the CPA in
the camps continued to work and adapted to the situation by working on a roster. They went to the field
once or twice a week, sent messages to the people, and met them outside in open spaces. On the other
days, they used telephonic communication with volunteers, night guards, parents and youth groups. The
parents in the camps and the host communities have also expressed their appreciation for the work of
CPC. The programme has met its Year-2 target of recruitment and training of social workers and child
protection actors as mentioned in the logframe. The Child Protection Committee members, volunteers and
actors have received training from UNICEF, GoB, DRR, World Bank, and BRAC on case management,
child protection, child supervision, child trafficking, child rights, case reference, health and nutrition, and
WASH. However, the evaluation team in the discussion with the CBCPC in Pekua found that the CP actor
was not aware of child rights and its violations. Their understanding of child rights and children at risk
was related to food and nutrition and general health services for children. This points towards a need for
refreshers’ trainings to enhance the understanding of volunteers on child protection issues and violations.
Given the approach of integrated services, it may be important to ensure that sensitive issues, such as -
child protection, do not get diluted as a result of messages and training on other aspects, such as WASH
and nutrition messaging. Moreover, the programme is yet to achieve its Year-2 target of establishing five
community-based child protection committees in the host communities.
The child protection volunteers and other community workers work on raising awareness on abuse of
child rights and simultaneously have helped in reducing the information barriers. The CP volunteer in
Camp 7 informed that the cases of child trafficking have gone down and child marriage has also stopped,
as parents are aware of and following the legal age for marriage. This was also reported by the CBCPC
members in Camp 15, where it was reported that the community members have become more aware
72 Midterm
Evaluation Report
with regard to the protection of children and their rights, and have even started to approach CPAs for
help. Apart from that, adolescents are also receiving information from teachers and adolescent clubs, but
there is a scope of improvement in their reach, as only 53 per cent of adolescents in the host communities
and 85 per cent in the camps have been provided with this information. Moreover, the findings in both
the areas, reflect poorly on the information received - particularly on the risks of child trafficking and on
prevention of gender-based violence. Only 19 per cent of adolescents in the host communities and 21
per cent of adolescents in the camps received information on such issues. More adolescents are aware
of the risks of early marriage (78 per cent in the HC, and 92 per cent in the camps), and the same was
also reflected in the FGDs and KIIs - conducted in the camps and the host communities. The interaction
of the evaluation team with the parents in the camps and the host communities reflected that they have
been made aware of the negative effects of child marriage. However, on seeing a case of violation of child
rights, adolescents (in both the camps and the host communities) preferred contacting the parents of the
children or other members of the children’s families instead of contacting the CPC or the child protection
volunteer. The adolescent girls in Camp 7 also talked about approaching the society for health extension
and development. There were also instances wherein boys in Pekua went to the adolescent clubs to
report such issues. They even reported a case of forced early marriage to the police. As highlighted
in Camp 15, the pandemic also saw a rise in the cases of early marriage and divorce. Moreover, the
problem of child labour still exists in all target areas.
The discussions with representative, DSS-CP also highlighted that while Cox’s Bazar has children’s
courts and Child Welfare Boards (CWBs) at upazilla and district levels, and child desks at upazilla police
stations, these structures often lack sufficient human, technical and financial resources to effectively
function. Lack of sensitisation and training of officials also leads to inadequate provisioning of services,
such as counselling for rescued children.
C4D
The C4D efforts have played a key role in promoting life-saving messages and subsequent positive
behavioural practices in the areas of health and nutrition, WASH, education, child protection, and
COVID-19 prevention in the camps and the host communities. Cross-cutting issues were also
covered, including gender equality, GBV, sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, including PSEA.
The information reached the most vulnerable community through various communication channels,
including inter-personal communication at household and community levels, religious leaders, radio,
announcements in mosques, and mobile van loudspeakers. In response to the pandemic, house-to-
house visits were initiated to disseminate the information. The nutrition volunteers/community health
workers, IFC youth volunteers, adolescents’ clubs, adolescent radio listeners’ clubs (ARLC), mother-to-
mother support groups, and child protection actors have largely been responsible for the dissemination of
information for awareness generation. Moreover, teachers also provide information to students in schools.
Having such varied sources of information disseminating messages in an integrated manner has helped
maintain the progress despite the COVID-19 restrictions.
The community health workers/nutrition volunteers have been actively performing their roles, and thereby,
have helped in bridging information gaps and spreading awareness. Quantitative survey with lactating
women reveals that health workers and nutrition volunteers visit them during their pregnancy period or
after childbirth (64.7 per cent in the host communities, and 82.4 per cent in the camps). The community
health workers are the primary sources of maternal and child nutrition (for 96.1 per cent of lactating
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 73
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
mothers), as mothers trust them. During their interactions, they discuss the need for consuming IFA,
colostrum feeding, exclusive breastfeeding, child immunisation, and nutritional requirements. Moreover,
women find these discussions extremely satisfactory.
The adolescent clubs have also been playing a vital role when it comes to spreading information relevant
to adolescents in the communities. The evaluation team found that 55.6 per cent of the adolescents are
getting information on nutrition and dietary diversity from the adolescents’ clubs. Along with that, the other
areas where the adolescents are receiving information from the adolescents’ clubs are - child labour and
child rights (46.7 per cent), sexual and reproductive health (72.2 per cent), general hygiene practices
(54.1 per cent), risks of child trafficking (50.1 per cent), prevention of gender-based violence (60.6 per
cent), decision-making skills and building self-esteem (65.9 per cent), emergency preparedness (42.9 per
cent), and COVID-19 (56.7 per cent). They also received information on the risks of climate change and
alternative fuels.
The adolescent radio listeners’ club is another important source of information. Some 21 per cent of the
adolescents are getting information on nutrition and dietary diversity through adolescent radio listeners
clubs, information on sexual and reproductive health been received by 26.4 per cent adolescents, and
45.5 per cent of adolescents are getting information on prevention of gender-based violence through
adolescent radio listeners’ clubs. The percentages reflect the top three information sources listed amongst
other sources. During the COVID-19 response, the radio clubs played a vital role in disseminating key life-
saving and protection messages.
Interactions with the IFC volunteers in the host communities highlighted that the community members
were unaware of many things before they started working. However, the awareness levels have risen
among the community people. The IFC volunteer in Pekua reported having provided door-to-door
services and disseminated messages on handwashing, vaccines, mother-to-mother support group,
COVID-19, wearing masks, and ANC and PNC services. The volunteer also coordinated with the CNW/
CNV, and provided relevant nutrition-related information. On identifying a case of malnutrition, it was
referred to the CNW/CNV. Similarly, the IFC volunteer in Teknaf reported providing sessions on similar
areas as mentioned above. The volunteer makes door-to-door visits or holds courtyard meetings, or
group discussions to reach the community members. Moreover, different methods are used while talking
to mothers and adolescents. The language and choice of words are carefully used to ensure suitability
for the group. Every week, a different topic is taken up for discussion, and the following week is spent on
monitoring and checking if the community members are following the advices. Further, the IFC volunteers
also take feedback from people, and believe that the process has helped them undertake their roles and
responsibilities.
With regards to mother-to-mother support groups, 53 per cent of mothers in the host communities and
80.2 per cent of mothers in the camps were aware of these groups. The group holds its meetings, where
discussions are held on the need for consuming IFA tablets, child immunisation, complementary and
supplementary feeding, child screening, hygiene practices, and need for mothers’ vaccination. However,
only 44 per cent of mothers reported receiving information from the mother support groups on child and
maternal nutrition.
C4D has played an important role in bridging information gaps as well as in promoting good and adequate
practices among the communities, causing an increase in the overall level of wellbeing. With continued
efforts and support, the programme interventions would be capable of reaching all its targets.
74 Midterm
Evaluation Report
EQ 8. Was the integration of interventions effectively done? How has the integrated nature of the
model impacted fidelity, quality, and effectiveness of implementation and realisation of current
results? Consider differences among vulnerable groups and varying demographics (gender, age,
ethnicity, ability, etc.)
Summary of main findings 5.5.2:
— Complementarity and synergy between the outcome areas of the programme have been
effective.
— The integrated nature of the programme has also been found effective, as there were
overlapping roles of frontline workers, which helped in strengthening networks and improving
access to utility rates.
— The programme governance structures also adopted an integrated approach covering all four
sectors.
— Inter-sectoral convergence through linkages among the line departments is essential for the
success of the integrated approach, and it was found to be weak.
The programme takes an innovative approach towards integrating services across the programmatic
areas of nutrition, education, child protection, and WASH, achieved through effective multi-sectoral
coordination, an integrated C4D strategy, and by focusing on specific areas (geographically). The
programme aims to ensure maximum synergy through linkages among different sectors and provide
information and communication directly and indirectly to the communities to support the beneficiaries to
reach other services, thus ensuring an integrated and multi-sectoral delivery of communication messages.
The intervention logic of the programme also adopts an integrative approach, providing for linkages and
coordination among frontline workers of all sectors. Lastly, the programme also ensures the integration of
activities and coordination amongst the implementing partners.
Interventions such as the multipurpose centre (MPC), mother-to-mother support group (M2MSG),
information and feedback centre (IFC), programme implementation committee (PIC), programme
management committee (PMC), linkage with food and agriculture for enhanced food and nutrition
security are some of the primary platforms and interventions effectively introduced and used by the
programme to ensure integrated service delivery. Multipurpose centres provide integrated vocational and
life-skill trainings, psychosocial support, case management and referrals, dignity kits and emergency
recreation kits, numeracy and literacy training, parenting sessions, and community-based child protection
meetings to various stakeholders, including adolescents and parents, communities, etc. They act as
vital information hubs. Social workers also organised casework and outreach activities. The qualitative
findings revealed that providing various services at one-stop hubs helps the beneficiaries improve access
and utility rate, convenience, and strengthening networks. Discussion with adolescent girls highlighted
that hygiene materials received with the dignity kits used for menstrual hygiene purposes mainly helped
maintain their enrolment and participation in classes. One finding has been that adolescents felt more
supported after accessing the services in the MPCs.
As a part of sensitising the refugees and the host communities with behavioural lifesaving messages
and communications, the IFCs helped collect complaints, feedback, and queries from various sectors,
ensuring that community concerns were addressed promptly with timely referrals. Findings from a
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 75
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
community accountability survey based on 50 key informant interviews showed that 94 per cent of the
community members had their issues satisfactorily resolved. The quantitative survey with adolescents
suggest that 24.8 per cent of the adolescents received information on nutrition and dietary diversity,
22.5 per cent received on IFA tablets, 34.6 per cent on child rights and child protection, 23.5 per cent on
menstrual hygiene practices, and 37 per cent received information on emergency preparedness from IFC
youth volunteers. Multisectoral information/ feedback provided by IFC is accessible to the communities,
and they are utilising various services in one place.
Social workers/community health workers/community volunteers played a critical role during the
programme period, especially during the pandemic. In addition to that, the partners opted for additional
volunteers to work closely with the social workers during the pandemic. Social workers actively worked
on case management, issues with children with disabilities, psychosocial support, COVID-19 safety
protocols, supporting adolescents with information, adolescents kits, awareness-raising on the impact of
negative coping mechanisms, and positive parenting tips, etc. Health volunteers were actively involved
in messaging on IYCF and care practices as well as maternal nutrition to pregnant and lactating women
during antenatal care, post-natal care, and home visits. Secondary reports specify that the use of
secondary volunteers reduced the workload of nurses, and supported the fieldworker referral system. The
evaluation team found that the active involvement of social workers/community health workers/community
volunteers ensures a safe and enabling environment for children, and acts as a much needed support
system for both the Rohingya communities as well as the host population. The programme has created
a network of community volunteers, including model mothers, youths, community religious facilitators,
community mobilisers, etc., with complementary capabilities, thereby, enhancing the overall effectiveness
of the programme through an integrated service delivery model.
The programme follows the approach of ensuring access to basic services in an integrated manner. While
the integrated approach has been successful through various community-based platforms, successful
implementation of this approach also requires multisectoral coordination and integration between
nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions at district and upazila levels.
The analysis of discussions with representatives of DAE, PHED, DSS-CP and health department
highlights that the coordination among the line departments is - (i) limited to celebration of special days/
month, such as national sanitation month or during specific events/campaigns, such as distribution
of Vitamin A, and (ii) limited to two departments for specific interventions, such as between PHED
and MoPME for construction of toilets in schools, between DAE and health department for training of
farmers on production of nutritious crops. Further it appears that these engagements are driven as a
result of advisory from the head of departments at national level, and are not initiated independently by
department at local level. Evidently, there is limited integration among the line departments at district and
upazila levels.
The programme also established a multi-sectoral Program Management Committee (PMC) and
Programme Implementation Committee (PIC). The PMC comprises UNICEF technical sections and
their respective partners from the government and NGOs to monitor the implementation plan and
measure for results, strengthen convergence, and promote evidence generation. The PIC, chaired
by the deputy commissioner and co-chaired by EU, is responsible for providing oversight functions
and strategic guidance, strategic directions on prioritisation, promoting effective coordination and
reintegration, identifying key bottlenecks, and determining corrective measures to enhance improvement.
The committee members of PMC and PIC are expected to work together towards ensuring that the
programme achieves its overall outcomes.
76 Midterm
Evaluation Report
The analysis further revealed that - (i) participation of all line departments in PMC and PIC meeting
is also not regular, and (ii) the discussions focused more on sector-specific interventions undertaken
by a department rather than cross-sectoral interventions. The discussions with frontline workers also
highlighted lack of adoption of integrated approach for delivery of services. Leveraging of existing
platforms, such as district and upazila nutrition coordination committees for multisectoral coordination,
could not be established.
However, during the pandemic, discussions with GoB representatives at district level revealed that
the PMC/PIC meetings helped in identifying/prioritising cross-cutting issues and finding solutions
accordingly. When COVID-19 and GoB restrictions hampered the implementation of interventions, the
PIC took mitigation measures, such as increased involvement of household members in implementation
activities (screening of malnutrition) and community leaders as a relay. As a result, mothers/caregivers
were trained on using MUAC tapes to identify and self-refer their children, if they became acutely
malnourished. Evidence-based planning, targeting, and implementation measures have been critical for
the programme to achieve the abovementioned results. The platforms like PMC/PIC have played a vital
role in the timely monitoring and review of programme interventions, in improving targeting and service
utilisation during COVID-19. For instance, the PIC provided strategic guidance and oversight functions,
promoted effective coordination and reintegration, identified key bottlenecks, and determined corrective
measures for achievement of desired outcomes. One of the mitigation measures that emerged during
the 4th PMC meeting was about providing flexible arrangements to the IPs to implement their activities -
engagement of community volunteers. As a result, the engagement of community volunteers increased,
especially during the pandemic. They played an increasingly critical role in the pandemic response to
reach the community with critical lifesaving messages and essential services. The presence of community
volunteers during COVID-19 was a great relief for other health workers/volunteers.
EQ 9. Are the implementation strategies for education, child protection, nutrition, livelihoods,
health, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) appropriate, on track, and effective to achieve
the planned objectives and impact?
Summary of main findings 5.5.3:
— The programme is on track to carry out all planned activities and achieve the intended results.
— The education sector strategies, like establishment of LCs, innovative teaching methodologies,
teacher training, awareness generation through various activities/media, etc., have caused
progressive results. However, some challenges, such as incidence of dropouts, need to be
addressed for effective results.
— Hygiene messages, community water supply schemes, sanitation facilities, etc. have contributed
towards realising the programme’s WASH sector objectives. Nevertheless, access to lights in
toilets, water facility in community toilets, and distance to collect water are some of the major
concerns - highlighted by the beneficiaries that need to be addressed for better effectiveness.
— The child protection interventions require further improvement. Increasing awareness about
sensitive issues, while also reinforcing the redressal mechanisms to encourage community
members to report such issues through official channels would strengthen the effectiveness of
the programme.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 77
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
At programme level, the overall findings reflect positively on the achievements of the programme. As
presented in the above sections, the programme is on track to carry out all planned activities and achieve
the intended results. This section mentions those areas and indicators on which additional efforts are
required to achieve the planned objectives and impact.
With regard to achieving the educational outcomes, the progressive results have mainly been achieved
due to establishment of LCs, innovative teaching methodologies, awareness generation through various
activities/media, etc. However, some challenges, such as - incidence of dropouts, need to be addressed
for effective results. Given the closure of schools, it is also important to increase engagement of children
in educational activities through innovative methods so as to ensure achievement of the overall outcomes
of the programme.
Further, the hygiene messages, community water supply schemes, sanitation facilities, etc. have
contributed towards realising programme objectives in WASH sector. Community members have access
to safely-managed sanitation services and good WASH practices. Findings from the qualitative and
quantitative interactions highlight an increase in water and adequate sanitation facilities in schools.
However, awareness and practice regarding disposal of menstrual absorbent among adolescent girls
needs further improvement. Accessing toilets at night, water facility in community toilets, and absence
of lights in toilets are some of the major concerns highlighted by the beneficiaries. Addressing these
concerns would enhance the programme’s achievements further.
While the child protection component of the programme is on track to achieve the programme outcomes,
the sector requires further improvement to meet its targets. The availability of child protection services
and child protection response mechanisms are working towards the protection of children and their
rights. Parents are well aware of and appreciate the work done by child protection committees (CPC).
The CPC members, volunteers and actors have also been trained to work for protection of child rights.
Children are aware of various types of child rights violations; however, the level of awareness differs for
different issues. For instance, more children are aware of the risks of child marriage than that of child
trafficking. The evaluation team found that 25.9 per cent of the adolescents approached CPC when they
came across a case of child rights violation. However, a majority of the respondents approached their
parents and other family members to report a violation of their rights. Strengthening the child protection
interventions and increasing awareness about sensitive issues, like gender-based violence, child labour
and trafficking, while also reinforcing the redressal mechanisms to encourage community members to
report such issues through official channels would lead to greater impact.
Although the programme has been able to make a huge positive impact in addressing various issues, its
progress has been found unsatisfactory in certain areas, as they are sensitive and normatively restricted
within the operating context of the programme. Some of these areas are - sexual and reproductive health
(only 43 per cent of the respondents have received information), gender-based violence (20 per cent),
information on risk of trafficking (44 per cent). These are very critical and relevant areas where significant
information gaps persist, and therefore might require programmatic refinements and development of
necessary platforms and mechanisms.
The government stakeholders and beneficiaries are highly satisfied with the programme activities.
The government’s involvement in the programme, such as linkage with the Department of Agriculture
Extension (DAE), generates an impact on marginal farmers’ lives by providing essential agricultural
inputs to encourage homestead nutrition gardening using their own barren lands near the households.
78 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Beneficiaries are also participating in the programme activities. This intervention in the nutrition sector
succeeded in creating innovative partnerships and resulted in establishment of 100 demonstration
gardens, 400 farmer field schools, and establishment of functional linkage between 10,000 farmer-
beneficiaries and community-based nutrition programme. The government oversees the agricultural
issues and ensures support to farmer groups. Such initiatives showcase the coordination efforts with the
government department towards achieving the programme objectives.
The perceived benefits amongst the key stakeholders, especially the government stakeholders,
as a result of the programme interventions are largely positive. The programme has strengthened
collaborations and partnerships that have significantly contributed to improving the intervention’s overall
effectiveness.
The beneficiaries have varied perceptions on the programme’s effectiveness. Although, these perceptions
are largely positive, there are some areas where the beneficiaries suggest scope for improvement or
further enhancements, like opportunities to learn job skills, more awareness sessions through multimedia
platforms, provisions of vocational training such as mobile servicing, electrical work, and computer
training, 24-hour health service via health centre, and a better healthcare facility and infrastructure in
community clinics.
To summarise, the programme effectively built new partnerships, coordinated with various stakeholders,
provided awareness on various issues, took immediate actions in the context of COVID-19 and prioritised
activities, established new initiatives, and introduced new methodologies for teaching. However, some
areas (e.g., gender-segregated toilets, disability-friendly infrastructure, income-generating opportunities,
child labour to address the problem of school dropouts, linkage with social safety net programmes for
vulnerable PLWs, information on gender-based violence, etc.) need to be prioritised to ensure that the
programme reaches its planned objectives.
5.6. Gender and Human Rights
EQ 10. How well has the programme integrated gender and a human rights lens into the design
and implementation?
Summary of main findings 5.6.1:
— Equity and gender equality were systematically integrated as a cross-cutting dimension in the
programme.
— It pays special attention to the needs of specific vulnerable populations of the marginalised
Rohingya refugees and the impoverished Bangladeshi host communities.
— The programme recognises the challenges that women face in Cox’s Bazar, and addresses
those by working in the sectors of education, child protection, nutrition, and WASH.
— It integrates gender equity and inclusion on the supply side as well, like building capacities of
service providers, and wherever needed, has emphasised equitable representation of genders
amongst the service providers.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 79
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The programme, with the underpinning logic of promoting protection, gender equality and disaster risk
reduction, has integrated gender and humanitarian lens into its design, planning and implementation.
This is reflected through the special attention it pays to the needs of specific vulnerable populations of the
marginalised Rohingya refugees and the impoverished Bangladeshi host communities - adolescent boys
and girls, mothers, pregnant and lactating women and their families as well as persons with disabilities.
The refugee crisis is a humanitarian crisis. It is known that humanitarian crises have unequal effects on
different populations - depending on their gender identity. Although men and women, boys and girls all
suffer in a crisis, women and girls face greater obstacles in reaching their full potential and leading safe,
healthy and dignified lives due to the structural inequalities. Women in Cox’s Bazar have reported poor
dietary diversity, unsafe water and sanitation facilities, low female participation in labour market, and
inaccessibility of health services. Moreover, they have also reported incidents of gender-based violence
(GBV), and many women and girls have been exposed to widespread and severe forms of sexual
violence. Following displacement, they continue being at risk of GBV, including domestic and intimate
partner violence. Lack of income-generating opportunities and transferable skills development has led
to exploitation of women and adolescent girls in the forms of forced marriage, survival sex, trafficking
for commercial sexual exploitation, and forced labour. The programme recognises these varied needs
and addresses the underlying challenges by working in the four sectors of education, child protection,
nutrition, and WASH, while simultaneously maintaining sensitivity to issues of gender, equity, and
inclusion to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalised benefit from the services and information.
The programme’s intervention framework includes a community-led, rights-based and participatory
approach to gender and equity mainstreaming, and therefore, lays a special focus on adolescent girls as
well as pregnant and lactating women.
Further, the programme integrates gender equity and inclusion on the supply side as well, and therefore,
has built capacities of service providers, and wherever needed, has emphasised equitable representation
of genders amongst the service providers, such as in the case of recruiting and training more female
teachers to encourage a higher enrolment amongst girls. New and upgraded safe and protective learning
centres have been established for the Rohingya communities. Moreover, informal technical education has
also been made available for the youth in the host communities, which provides an equal opportunity for
both boys and girls to develop skills and secure livelihood opportunities for themselves.
People (both males and females) in both the camps and the host communities have been reached with
life-saving messages, including COVID-19 prevention messages as well as messages on nutrition,
WASH, health, child protection, education, and emergency preparedness. Worth mentioning is the
inclusion of cross-cutting issues, including gender equality, GBV, sexual exploitation, abuse, and
harassment. Adolescent boys and girls were also engaged through the adolescent radio listeners’
club sessions, where apart from the aforesaid messages, they were made aware of the harmful social
behaviours and norms faced by girls and women. Through such interventions, the programme was able to
overcome information barriers and enable awareness generation amongst boys and girls through key life-
saving messages.
Within both the refugee and the host communities, girls face socio-cultural barriers along with safety
concerns and supply related issues, such as lack of trained female teachers and gender-segregated
latrines. UNICEF, through the programme, prioritised upgrading of latrines and bathing spaces to make
them more accessible and gender-responsive. This was done by making additions in the form of privacy
80 Midterm
Evaluation Report
screens, spaces for menstrual hygiene management and other modifications, which improve the social
architecture - especially for women and people with disabilities. This intervention was also implemented
in schools to enhance access and ensure retention of learners in learning centres, and protect girls from
various forms of violence. Furthermore, the community engagement strategy of the programme has given
special attention to the gender and equity-differentiated needs of households for enrolling and keeping
both girls and boys as well as individuals with special needs in schools.
To ensure the protection of children from all forms of violence, injury, abuse and neglect, child-friendly and
protective environments have been established and strengthened in the form of multipurpose centres.
These multipurpose centres offer safe, protective, enabling and stimulating environments for children,
where they are also provided with psychosocial support to help them with their trauma and bring normalcy
to their daily lives. Moreover, the programme reinforces referral services for children in need of protection,
including support for safe shelters, foster care, particularly for victims of gender-based violence (GBV).
The establishment of adolescent clubs and other activities, which are geared towards adolescent
empowerment through life-skill interventions, has also focused on prevention of violence, particularly
GBV.
UNICEF, through the programme, has ensured equal access to opportunities for both boys and girls.
It is also supporting its implementation partners/organisations in strengthening caregiver capacities
as well as empowering mothers and male heads of households in decision-making on childcare.
Moreover, by integrating gender-specific topics into all of its four components, INTPA has, therefore,
taken the principles of equal participation, social transformation, inclusiveness, and empowerment into
consideration.
EQ 11. Have current achievements or progress been equitably achieved (according to
geographical area/camp, vulnerability, gender, ability status (person with disabilities), age,
refugees vs. host communities, etc.)?
Summary of main findings 5.6.2:
— Current achievements of the programme have more or less been equitably distributed across
all the target geographical areas.
— Substantial changes have occurred in women’s access to basic services and changes in
knowledge and perceptions.
— Both the host communities and the camps have reported achievements in various aspects.
— The programme has given special importance to catering to age-specific needs of the target
population - child education and nutrition.
— Girls and boys have been equally provided with educational opportunities. However, gender
discrimination, lack of awareness on the importance of education, household responsibilities,
etc., remain challenges for girls in certain cases.
— Despite priority to installation of disability-friendly infrastructure in learning centres, there still
exists the problem of adequate facilities in schools for people with special needs.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 81
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The programme has been carefully designed to target the beneficiaries in Cox’s Bazar district. It remains
one of the poorest districts in Bangladesh, and is extremely vulnerable to climatic shocks. Therefore,
the programme interventions, do not only focus on the highly marginalised and persecuted Rohingya
refugees, who perform poorly in all human development indicators, but also on the Bangladeshi host
communities that live under stress and fare poorly. The influx of the refugees has created additional
problems in terms of added strain on Cox’s Bazar district and its communities, leaving them in need of
assistance.
The programme interventions are designed in a manner that they cover two upazilas of Cox’s Bazar
(Pekua and Teknaf) and two camps for the refugees (camps 7 and 15) as well as cater to the needs of the
target group. However, since the programme is still in operation, once scaled up, it would expand to bring
more upazilas and camps under its scope and reach the maximum population. Moreover, the current
achievements of the programme have been equitably distributed across all the target geographical areas
and both the host communities and the camps have reported achievements on various aspects. For
instance, mothers in both the camps and the host communities have their children enrolled in schools/
LCs, mothers in both the camps and the host communities have reached with messages on maternal
and child nutrition. Some 98.5 per cent of lactating women in the camps and the host communities know
that breastfeeding should be started within one hour of birth. The Rohingya and the host communities
have access to toilets, and open defecation is not practiced among the people in the communities.
However, there are certain areas where disparities exist between the progress in the camps and the host
communities. For instance, almost all mothers in the camps (96.7 per cent) stressed that their children
were given Vitamin A supplementation, but the number was slightly low for the host communities (74.5 per
cent). However, as per the June 2021 National Vitamin A Campaign (NVAC) for Cox’s Bazar district, the
coverage for Vitamin A supplementation was 98.22 per cent (97.48 per cent in Pekua, and 98.96 per cent
in Teknaf). Therefore, it must be noted that the outcomes of the survey, done by the evaluation team, may
differ from the NVAC monitoring outcomes.
Moreover, the evaluation team found that 66 per cent of mothers in the host communities felt that
their needs are neglected because of the Rohingya refugees. The programme needs to scale up its
intervention and work towards bridging these differences over the remaining course of the programme.
Furthermore, the programme has also given special importance to catering to age-specific needs of the
target population. It recognises the importance of child education along with maternal and child nutrition.
The evaluation team found that the programme has reached children with education opportunities,
pregnant and lactating women with nutrition awareness, including the importance of IYCF practices,
Vitamin A supplementation campaigns, and coverage of treatment of children with acute malnutrition. The
survey conducted among adolescent boys and girls reveals that 70.9 per cent of adolescents in the host
communities and 66.1 per cent in the camps are currently attending a school/LC. Some 86.3 per cent of
mothers (with children aged less than 6 months) in the host communities and 100 per cent of mothers in
the camps reported starting breastfeeding within one hour of birth. A high percentage of mothers (with
children aged 6 months to 14 years) in both the target areas have also received micronutrients/IFA (84
per cent in the camps, and 67 per cent in the host communities).
Moreover, the programme prioritises maintaining equity, gender sensitivity, and equality in its
programmes. This has been achieved by targeting all children, boys and girls and the often marginalised
group. Women, girls and boys have been equally provided with educational opportunities. However,

factors, like gender discrimination, lack of awareness on importance of education, household
responsibilities, etc., continue to remain challenges in certain cases. Further, women have also been
impacted by the programme. The evaluation team has seen that their perceptions on various aspects
change over the course of time. Women now believe in ensuring special nutrition for pregnant and
lactating women as well as their newborn children. They are aware of the benefits of consuming IFA.
Women consider immunisation a good thing for their children, and they also go for health check-ups
without worrying that their household chores would suffer. However, as stated above, the availability
and utilisation of certain infrastructure and services is a problem. Women and girls have reported lack of
gender-segregated toilets as a challenge that they face. Moreover, toilets are often located outside and
have no provisions for electricity, which make them inaccessible at night.
With regard to enabling social inclusion, the programme has given special attention to ensuring the
inclusion of children with disabilities for the Rohingya communities. This has been achieved by providing
them with assistive devices, learning materials, psychosocial support, cash assistance, and case
management. The programme also gives priority to the installation of disability-friendly infrastructure
in learning centres. However, it needs to be noted that the evaluation team could not corroborate the
same due to their underrepresentation in the sample or unavailability in the field. Some 37.2 per cent
of mothers, however, pointed out that there still exists the problem of adequate facilities in schools for
people with special needs.
Given that the programme is still in operation, it can be concluded that the current achievements of
the programme have been equitable, where the needs of the most vulnerable - children, pregnant and
lactating women, persons with disabilities - have been taken into consideration. However, it needs to
continue working in all identified areas of improvement to leave no one behind and achieve its targets.
5.7. Impact
EQ 12: Is the programme likely to contribute in a long term to the refugees and the host
communities by building resilience of vulnerable families and children in the areas of education,
child protection, nutrition, livelihoods, health, and WASH?
Summary of main findings 5.7:
— The commitment of the EU-funded programme to continue building long-term resilience is
evident.
— Signs of adaptability and transformability amongst the communities in the face of uncertainty
and upheaval.
— There are indications on progress towards impact of the programme interventions on both the
Rohingya refugees and the host communities in the areas of education, nutrition, WASH, and
child protection services.
— Role of C4D to promote life-saving messages in the COVID-19 pandemic kept up the resilience-
building measures and boosted the community to remain hopeful in challenging times.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 83
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The evaluation through the survey and interactions focused on examining the practices and the behaviour
of individuals within the context of their environment and households, and ascertaining whether these
behaviours, reinforce their capacity for resilience when faced with potential processes of transformation.
Alongside a structural/systemic approach to resilience, the evaluation team examined resilience amongst
the communities in terms of human agency that reflects everyday forms of resilience. Some of the main
characteristics, found amongst the members of both the host and the refugee communities, were in terms
of their adaptability and transformability in the face of uncertainty and upheaval. Moreover, as described
below, the bonds and networks formed, the roles taken up and fulfilled by different members of the
communities (mothers, majhis, religious leaders, and adolescents) is also a great indication towards the
creation of adaptive systems leading to resilience.
The programme’s main objective is to strengthen resilience of the Rohingya refugees and the host
communities in an integrated manner in Cox’s Bazar district. Evaluation findings with respect to four major
components, such as nutrition, education, WASH, and child protection, highlighted positive contributions
to the long-term resilience of the Rohingya refugees and the host communities. These were achieved
through:
� Education: To advocate for developing a pathway towards ensuring education for children from the
Rohingya communities, UNICEF and Cambridge International signed an agreement, and started
working on the learning assessment framework for Myanmar Curriculum Pilot (MCP). Physical
interventions, which included establishment and rehabilitation of safe and protective learning
centres and multipurpose centres, establishment of adolescent clubs and CBCPCs, improved
drainage systems to avoid water-logging and reduce future monsoon damage, use of sandbags, and
palisading technology to avoid landslides and soil erosion, ensuring provision of teaching, learning,
and recreational materials for children, were also undertaken to enable educational activities in the
camps as well as the host communities. Training to LCMCs and SMCs on roles and responsibilities,
DDR, disaster management at school level, school governance, and child protection issues were
also undertaken. Introduction of radio programming to prevent transmission of COVID in the refugee
settlements and the host communities, recruitment of teachers and initiation of e-learning platforms
for training teachers and masters trainers and supporting integrated vocational and life-skill trainings,
psychosocial support, and numeracy and literacy training are amongst the other efforts made to
contribute to building resilience amongst the host and the refugee communities. These efforts
were directed towards ensuring that there was access to proper education facilities, so that the
communities could benefit beyond the duration of the programme. Furthermore, C4D and counselling
activities are also likely to contribute to building resilience amongst the host and the refugee
communities. The responses from parents as well as adolescent boys and girls on the importance
and value of education as a result of these activities are also a positive indication. The value seen
in education as a means of overcoming the challenges faced by both the host and the refugee
communities as well as the willingness to take measures, such as continuing education, enrolment in
schools, adolescent clubs, and participation in educational activities, further points towards UNICEF’s
efforts contributing to long-term effects towards building resilience amongst both the refugee and the
host communities.
� Nutrition: As part of institutional capacity strengthening in the host communities, 119 pieces of
equipment for anthropometric measurement (such as weighing scales and height boards) were
distributed to the health facilities for GMP and the identification of children with acute malnutrition.
Training on nutrition provided to the government service providers, formation of mother support
84 Midterm
Evaluation Report
groups in the host communities to share views on and discuss concerns around maternal, infant
and young child nutrition, and courtyard meetings for community leaders, mothers, adolescents,
and religious leaders for meaningful behaviour change with respect to maternal and child nutrition
are some of the activities conducted to promote good nutrition practices. The evaluation team found
evidence that indicates that such community mobilisation activities are some of the indications that
are contributing to building resilience amongst both the host and the Rohingya communities. The IDIs
with the implementing partners as well as the FGDs with mothers and adolescents indicated that the
involvement of decision-makers (within households) and influential members of the communities has
been an enabling factor in ensuring adoption of good health and nutrition practices. The awareness
generation activities, conducted by C4D section, have also had immense influence on busting myths
and misconceptions with regard to infant and maternal health and nutrition. Furthermore, capacity-
building support given to agriculture workers in homestead gardening, identification of small-hold
farmers in the host communities to ensure household-level production of nutritious food are other
such interventions contributing to resilience building in the long term.
� WASH: In order to ensure adequate supply of safe drinking water, as part of the programme,
boreholes, solar power water supply networks and mini water supply networks have been
constructed. In addition, installation of handwashing devices in households and public places,
development of district-level water integrated WASH system and MIS as well as technical support
to the government partners to provide effective WASH services are some of the other activities,
undertaken towards ensuring access to safely managed sanitation services. Interventions also
included constructing latrines, FSM sites, and emptying pit latrines for safe treatment and disposal.
WASH facilities, including appropriate, accessible latrines, drinking water and handwashing facilities,
were constructed in schools. Apart from that, latrine producers in the host communities have been
trained on sanitation marketing, and business development approaches. Mobilisation and training
of community hygiene promoters with key hygiene messages on handwashing, menstrual hygiene,
and safe household water management were conducted in the camps, water safety planning
approach were adopted and water user groups were formed to ensure the provision of safe water and
sanitation facilities. These activities have led to a change in attitudes and practices, enhanced access
to and management of WASH facilities, and, given the community ownership being demonstrated,
is contributing to building long-term resilience amongst the communities. However, a lot more needs
to be done with regard to WASH, as it is a challenging area given the geographical disadvantages
of Cox’s Bazar. Furthermore, a focus on enhancing access to WASH facilities for women would
contribute towards ensuring long-term resilience.
� Child Protection: Introduction of feedback mechanisms at information and feedback centres, case
management for vulnerable and at-risk children, capacity building support provided to social workers
and child protection actors from the refugee community and the Department of Social Services
(DSS) in child protection in emergencies, mentoring and coaching, psychological support provided
to children in need, especially in the context of COVID, are all activities aimed at building resilience
amongst the refugee and the host communities. Finally, with the help of DSS, the programme has
established and strengthened the CBCPCs to monitor the local child protection situation and ensuring
there is follow-up on cases and referrals. Such measures are contributing to building long-term
resilience by tackling child rights violations, such as child labour, child marriage, and violence against
children. However, given the challenging area of work, a lot more community mobilisation is required
around such sensitive issues to build collective resilience in the communities.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 85
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
The interventions mentioned above are helping to improve access to basic services in the camps and
the host communities, improving education, nutrition, WASH, and child protection services at ground
level. However, some of the interventions are at an initial stage, but slowly leading resilience building
amongst the communities. Further, training received by the community participants, especially women
and adolescent girls, is having a positive impact on empowering them and promoting leadership.
The programme is also addressing child protection issues through psychological support to children,
strengthening their overall resilience.
While the outbreak of COVID-19 negatively impacted some of the programme interventions, such as LCs
being closed, halting of services like providing dignity kits to adolescents, affecting provision of vocational
life-skill trainings, and limited face-to-face interactions, the communities have displayed positive signs
towards being resilient in the face of such challenging times. Even in the absence of regular visits by
social workers, community members have taken all measures to protect themselves from the pandemic,
and ensured continued support to their peers. Initiation of e-learning platforms, remote follow-ups, one-
to-one psychological support to children, provision of IFA tablets and other nutrition counselling and
supplements through home visits, cash assistance, radio programming were some of the ways through
which the programme ensured a connect with the communities. Such modifications in the implementation
strategy and an increased role of the C4D section to promote life-saving messages in the pandemic kept
up the resilience building measures and boosted the communities to remain hopeful in challenging times.
5.8. Connectedness and Sustainability
EQ 13. Is the programme (UNICEF and the implementing partners) linked well and in line with
broader development efforts to address systemic changes - required not only to lessen the need
for humanitarian aid in Cox’s Bazar district but also to complement and strengthen the existing
local development efforts?
Summary of main findings 5.8.1:
— Measures taken to ensure joint actions by the programme with other actors, such as WFP’s
interventions under the food security sector of JRP, health interventions of World Health
Organisation (WHO) under JRP with WFP under SCOPE services for non-food items, and
Department of Agriculture Extension and Nutrition sector of UNICEF, were linked and mutually
reinforced in a complementary manner.
— Activities undertaken by different partners have been aligned for reducing duplication of efforts.
— The programme is in-line with the overall development efforts in addressing systemic changes
as well as strengthening and complementing the existing local development efforts and other
humanitarian support, showcasing connectedness amongst sectors and agencies.
Overall, the programme can be best classified as a successful short-term emergency recovery
programme. The evaluation found that the programme has created linkages with the broader
development efforts and frameworks within the operating context, such as Joint Response Plan (JRP),
in a mutually reinforcing and complementary manner. Within the broader humanitarian response
86 Midterm
Evaluation Report
framework of JRP, it is evident that the programme is linked and complementing the efforts of other
sector coordinators in a mutually reinforcing manner that is contributing to the resilience-building
outcomes within the community as well as strengthening local development efforts in Cox’s Bazar. Such
coordination and linkages is also enhancing the utilisation of humanitarian aid in the form of infrastructural
support and services. The evaluation team found various instances within the programme where such
linkages have been established, including the linkages among the programme intervention sectors.
Through its intervention under the education sector, the programme has created an enabling environment
for accessing education services in a protective environment for the Rohingya refugees and the host
communities. Various interventions, such as rehabilitation of learning centres, training and capacity
development of teachers, and provision of teaching and learning materials, have significantly contributed
to achieving this outcome. Creating such an enabling environment through the programme has also
strengthened the service delivery through other development efforts. For instance, WFP’s interventions,
under the food security sector of JRP, were strengthened and mutually reinforced in a complementary
manner. WFP’s interventions, such as school feeding programme in the camps, aim to improve children’s
learning capacity by providing them with essential food supplements, such as fortified food items for
every school attendance day. Contributing to such efforts, the programme interventions are contributing
to increasing access to education and enhancing educational outcomes in both the camps and the host
communities. Such linkages ensure simultaneous access to learning facilities and enhanced learning
capacities for children, which are essential given the contextual vulnerabilities.
Another instance, where the programme has created linkages with other sectors to enable systemic
transitions, is the joint action undertaken by the WASH sectoral interventions within the programme and
health interventions of WHO under JRP. Given that ensuring the safety of accessible drinking water was a
key priority for the programme, through various interventions, such as community water supply schemes,
the programme ensures improved access to water for the Rohingya refugees and the host communities.
Furthermore, the provision of technical support to the government stakeholders was an envisaged
intervention towards achieving this. The programme has leveraged the complementary capabilities of
WHO in order to achieve this objective. In partnership with WHO and DPHE, the programme continues
to support water quality monitoring and surveillance in the camps. The programme also continues to train
laboratory technicians to improve water quality testing laboratory in Cox’s Bazar. The interventions of
WHO and the complementary interventions undertaken by the programme ensure continued technical
and logistical support to the laboratories established, and it also utilises capacity of the Water Quality
Surveillance Programme. Such collaborative linkages and efforts are found to be contributing to achieving
more significant outcomes towards reducing the need for humanitarian aid as well as complement and
strengthen the existing development interventions.
Other collaborative efforts have also led to effective service delivery in the joint actions, undertaken by the
programme with WFP under SCOPE services for non-food items. UNICEF distributed WASH supplies in
the camps, complying with the WASH sector standards, through the programme. The soap distribution
is primarily implemented through the SCOPE system in partnership with WFP. The linkages, such as
SCOPE for delivering non-food items, resulted in increased convenience and choice for the communities,
as found during the midterm evaluation. For example, the beneficiaries can redeem their WFP food and
UNICEF soap entitlements in a single transaction in many outlets. In addition, the e-voucher approach,
jointly being implemented by WFP and UNICEF, from custom trading centres equipped the communities
with improved choices based on their need for that time period.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 87
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
Other evidence of joint action undertaken by the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) and Nutrition
sector of UNICEF was also found. The nutrition component of the programme ensures access to
diversified nutrient-dense food, access to agricultural supports and related services, and sufficient food
and nutrition intakes. It has been observed that UNICEF is supporting DAE’s intervention, impacting
the lives of marginal farmers by providing all the necessary agricultural inputs to encourage homestead
gardening using their own barren lands near the households - to encourage the production and
consumption of locally available nutrient-dense food, towards enhancing nutritional outcomes.
As a part of the local development efforts, BRAC’s Humanitarian Crisis Management programme is
providing community engagement support to improve the quality and inclusiveness of infrastructure and
support social cohesion under the WASH component of the camps and the host communities. Further,
in the education component, BRAC focuses on community engagement through awareness sessions to
sensitise the community on gender, environment, attendance and other issues to reduce socio-cultural
barriers to education. The programme complements these efforts by providing capacity-related support
to the beneficiaries, and both UNICEF and BRAC together contribute to building community engagement
through their interventions. Hence, the programme’s objectives complement local development efforts
like BRAC’s. Therefore, UNICEF’s efforts are responding to and addressing systemic changes as well as
strengthening and complementing other humanitarian supports being provided in the camps and in the
host communities, showcasing connectedness amongst sectors and agencies.
EQ 14. Are there any external factors (including institutional obstacles) to the programme that
have affected successful implementation and results in achievement and prospect for policy
impact and replication? How has COVID-19 impacted progress towards achieving desired results,
and what are the recommendations for interventions in the midst of post-COVID restrictions?
Summary of main findings 5.8.2:
— Unforeseen circumstances, such as – the COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters, affected
the programme implementation and progress on achievement of results.
— Some of the programme activities were delayed/shifted to the next year.
— During the pandemic, issues and new mechanisms created, and the programme activities
were realigned to ensure the changing needs of the affected beneficiaries while carrying out
its regular activities.
Overall, it appears that the programme is well-placed towards achieving its objectives, despite the
disruptions caused by COVID-19. The programme interventions and activities highlighted some positive
changes, but some external factors have affected smooth implementation of the planned activities. More
than 19,000 Rohingya refugees have been moved to Bhasan Char island by GoB47, causing disruption
in the areas of access to education, health facilities, nutrition services, and other critical services. This
has also contributed to growing tensions between the camps and the host communities. Some of the
programme activities were delayed and shifted to the final year, i.e., establishing CBCPCs in partnership

88 Midterm
Evaluation Report
with DSS are delayed due to pending recruitment of additional staff by DSS and that has been proposed
to shift it to Year 3.
Qualitative findings highlight that the programme’s operating environment is often affected by
natural disasters and unforeseen circumstances, which exacerbate humanitarian, life-saving needs.
Circumstances like the pandemic too greatly affected implementation of the programme and caused
delays.
As mentioned in the earlier sections, the COVID-19 pandemic posed numerous challenges that affected
implementation of the programme. The midterm evaluation examined the progress of activities and its
implementation strategy to deliver the programme in the context of COVID-19, assessing the changes
made based on emerging needs and the progress achieved thus far.
Based on the monitoring reports and discussions with the representatives of UNICEF as well as the
implementing partners, it was found that this period, sought with uncertainties, was met with re-alignment
in the programme’s activities, to ensure that the needs of the affected communities were addressed. The
programme also attempted to address the changing needs of the beneficiaries that emerged as a result
of the pandemic while carrying out its regular activities. Wherever feasible, a shift to remote modalities
and direct support to the beneficiaries to deliver the programme activities was made. UNICEF, GoB and
the implementing partners collectively minimised disruption to components, such as education, nutrition,
WASH, and child protection, especially with the help of C4D. Some of the issues and new mechanisms
created and adaptations made to address the challenges associated with COVID-19 have been
mentioned below.
� Nutrition: In the light of the pandemic, all group and community-based activities were put on hold.
Instead of group activities, IYCF counselling was changed to one-to-one counselling only at the
nutrition facilities, school-based adolescent nutrition clubs were suspended, Vitamin A campaign
conducted a month-long house-to-house approach instead of a week-long activity. IFC volunteers
faced challenges in serving the communities, as no one wanted to give them access to their houses.
Mothers of children started using MUAC tape by themselves to determine their children’s malnutrition
status. Further, with the support of DAE, farmers were provided with various types of seeds, so that
they could grow different crops and vegetables during COVID.
� Education: Children targeted for learning activities could not be reached due to the closure of
schools and learning centres. To address the challenge, e-learning platforms for teachers and master
trainers were introduced. Enrolment of children in the academic year 2020 could not be completed
and face-to-face training sessions had to stop. Hence, learning materials were provided, and teachers
began taking classes at household level by dividing children into small groups. While the modification
in implementation strategies helped in ensuring access to education, qualitative discussions with
teachers highlighted a loss of interest in educational activities amongst children as compared to
before the pandemic. They also complained that the lockdown had a destructive impact on children,
especially with regard to their psychological and recreational needs. Parents also complained of
children engaging in games on digital devices rather than partaking in educational activities. Such
lack of interest in education as a result of the closure of schools can have a negative impact on
attaining educational outcomes. There is a need for interventions to enhance the interest of children
in educational activities and address their recreational needs to increase engagement amongst
students.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 89
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
� WASH: At the beginning of the pandemic, UNICEF and its partners developed a business continuity
plan to ensure continued availability of safe water, upkeep sanitation infrastructure, and disseminate
hygiene promotion messages. WASH services in the camps were disrupted due to restrictions on the
implementing partners’ access to the refugee camps. Capacity building and community engagement
activities had to be stalled due to restriction imposed on community gatherings in the camps as
well as in the host communities. Accessing toilets during COVID was a primary concern, especially
for women and adolescent girls. However, the life-saving messages and information disseminated
through radio and miking, with the efforts of C4D section and the implementing partners ensured that
proper hygiene messaging was received by the communities to keep up good hygiene practices.
� Child Protection: Multipurpose child and adolescent centres were closed during the pandemic. It
became difficult for children to report child protection issues and receive necessary support and care.
From the qualitative interactions, it was clear that violence increased against children, especially
due to heightened stress, reduced resources, and lack of support services. Situations like loss of
household income, limited education opportunities, and reduced protection mechanisms increased
the risk of child marriage during COVID-19. Parents and children engaged in casual work to earn
money and feed families. It was also challenging to reach younger children due to limited access
to the camp sites and the host communities. Such challenges and hindrances in implementation of
activities affected the progress towards achieving the desired results. Based on the discussions, need
was felt for age-appropriate messaging, especially for younger children.
EQ 15. To what degree, if any, are there indications of sustainability, systemic change, or
more resilience among the refugee and the host communities in the areas of education, child
protection, nutrition, livelihoods, health, and WASH?
Summary of main findings 5.8.3:
— Best practices, such as creation of community networks and platforms leading to collective
ownership, are evident and indicate towards sustainability.
— The programme supported SMCs, CBCPCs, WatSan committees, courtyard meetings and
community clinics, which are some of the best examples and indications of sustainability, and
these contribute to resilience building among the refugee and the host communities.
— Positive responses with regard to the community platforms and community engagement would
bring about a long-term impact.
Programme interventions, imparted through various activities for the beneficiaries and stakeholders, have
potential for continued benefits - only when there are community ownership and sustained behaviour
change, matched with continued funding and partnerships. Physical facilities provided through the
programme would outlive the programme duration, and learnings from the programme activities and
implementation strategies would be useful for future interventions. However, continued functionality of the
respective programme interventions requires continued support from different stakeholders, so that the
coordinated efforts and its resulting impacts can be sustained.
90 Midterm
Evaluation Report
The evaluation team found the creation of community networks and platforms as a key element that is
likely to contribute to resilience building and thereby ensure sustainability. The positive response with
regard to the functioning of community platforms and the communities’ engagement with those, leading to
collective ownership, is a clear indication towards sustainability.
� The programme supported SMCs that play a vital role in improving host community school
governance to ensure children’s physical, social and emotional safety, and planning and management
of school-level improvement grants. They are an integral part of community engagement in schools,
and bring about changes in the camps and the host communities. During the pandemic, SMCs
received trainings on effective school management, roles and responsibilities, financial management,
DRR and social audits, which are expected to boost their morale and enhance capacity to address
concerns around school management and teacher capacity. Capacity building of SMCs is being
conducted in line with the fourth primary education development programme - mainly to bring about a
long-term impact in school management through community participation.
� Community-based child protection committees (CBCPCs) play a critical role in child protection on
the ground. They monitor the local child protection situation and liaise with social workers on the
follow-up of children, including referrals. CBCPCs work on capacity building, introducing information
and awareness on community-level child protection mechanisms to create and nurture bottom-up
approaches for ensuring protective environment for children. CBCPCs’ members played a remarkable
role during COVID-19. They were upfront to provide child protection and COVID-19 messages to the
communities during the pandemic. The establishment of CBCPCs would definitely serve to empower
the communities to ensure their protection of child rights in the longer term.
� Some of the other successful community support networks were community watsan committees
(WatSan), who are trained in a variety of skills to support sustainable operation and maintenance of
WASH infrastructure. Despite many challenges with regard to community ownership around WASH
infrastructure and maintenance of toilets, as reported by the IPs, there has been growing cooperation
among the communities to collectively maintain the WASH infrastructure. The reduced expectation
from and dependence on the IPs to maintain such infrastructure is also a positive sign that the
programme’s efforts would be sustainable.
� In the camps, courtyard meetings have been one of the most important community engagement
interventions. For a meaningful behaviour change with respect to maternal and child nutrition, the
involvement of key decision-makers in the communities and families not only helps in participation of
pregnant and lactating mothers, but also helps in adopting learnings from the sessions conducted as
part of the courtyard meetings. Community members, leaders, mothers, adolescents, and religious
leaders were part of the courtyard meetings. Such involvement of key stakeholders within the
communities helps create an enabling environment to support change in attitudes, perceptions and
subsequent behaviour change. During the pandemic a house-to-house approach was utilised for
providing iron tablets and nutrition education. It is expected that such changes are enabling resilience
building and paving way for sustainability of the efforts made.
� Nutrition services were delivered through healthcare systems, such as community clinics, upazila
health complexes, supplementation provision through multi-sectoral capacity building and
collaboration, and home visits by community nutrition workers in the host communities. Apart from
that, provision of IYCF counselling and messaging helped delivering prompt nutritional services to the
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 91
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
communities. As a part of institutional capacity strengthening in the host communities, anthropometric
measurement tool were distributed to health facilities for growth monitoring and promotion.
EQ 16. What are the possible sustainability mechanisms (financial and programmatic) for each of
the programme result areas/components (including maintaining the quality of service provision)?
Given the goal of replication for this integrated model of programming, have any programmatic
approaches or results emerged that indicate promising signs for replication and scale-up by
national partners or other actors?
Summary of main findings 5.8.4:
— The promotion of homestead gardening at scale by GoB would ensure access to nutrient-rich
foods - grown locally, leading to increased dietary diversity.
— Extensive social mobilisation efforts undertaken and community engagement models, such
as mother support groups, MHM facilitators groups, and community-based child protection
committees, established under the programme, has the potential of improving coverage of
interventions, building resilience amongst the communities and ensuring sustainability.
The IDI with representative Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) clearly highlights GoB’s
willingness to replicate the homestead gardening model for producing nutritious-dense crops, promoted
through this programme, in all the upazilas in Cox Bazar district. GoB intends to provide financial support
for establishing homestead gardening to 750 farmers in each upazila. The financial support can be utilised
by farmers for procurement of homestead nutrition gardening kit that includes seeds, tools, fertiliser and
fencing. The intent of ownership by GoB towards this intervention is a positive sign towards sustainability.
The promotion of homestead gardening at scale by GoB would also ensure access to nutrient-rich foods -
grown locally, leading to increased dietary diversity.
The commitment demonstrated by the deputy commissioner as the chairperson of PIC in providing
strategic guidance during implementation of programme, strengthening local governance for improved
delivery of services as well as ensuring coordination among the line departments for delivering an
integrated package of services provides an evidence on sustainability of the programme interventions.
Further, engagement between the government and the implementing partners in conducting mandatory
and emergency hygiene promotion activities as a response to challenges posed by COVID-19 highlights
recognition of capabilities of the implementing partners by the government as a critical stakeholder in
supporting its efforts to address development needs of the refugee and the host communities.
The programme has adopted a systems-based approach of engaging with the national systems within
the framework of national sectoral plans, such as Primary Education Development Programme (Phase
4) and multi-sectoral NPAN2, complemented by community-based approach for strengthening delivery of
services. Extensive social mobilisation efforts are undertaken, and community engagement models, such
as mother support groups, MHM facilitators groups, and community-based child protection committees
- established under the programme, have the potential of improving coverage of interventions, building
resilience amongst the communities, and ensuring sustainability.

CONCLUSIONS
The section provides conclusions - based on the survey findings. It also highlights in brief the strengths,
weakness, opportunities, and threats of the integrated model of intervention.
6.1. Relevance
The evaluation team believes that the project has planned the programme elements with due
considerations for the emerging needs of the vulnerable population that fares poorly on various human
development indicators. The programme is based on needs-based planning and has incorporated the
needs of all target groups after carefully conducting various assessments and surveys.
Moreover, the programme is well-aligned with the objectives of the Joint Response Plan (JRP) and also
complements the European Union’s ongoing development cooperation with Bangladesh in the 2014-
2020 Multi-Annual Indicative Programme (MIP) priority areas of education and human development, food
and nutrition security, and sustainable development. The programme is linked with the Government of
Bangladesh’s existing programmes, like NSSS, PAN2, PEDP-4, and other national plans.
The evaluation team found that given that the programme works in four extremely essential areas
of education, nutrition, child protection, and WASH, and that the target population fares poorly in the
indicators associated with these areas. All components are relevant to the needs of the communities, and
have been utilised, even during natural disasters and COVID-19. Therefore, the programme strengthened
itself and adapted to the situation by making certain readjustments to it. Moreover, the field-level workers
(FLWs) and the beneficiaries were made aware of the necessary COVID-19-related information.
6.2. Coherence
The activities on capacity building and infrastructure development implemented by the programme are
contributing towards achieving some of the short-, medium- and long-term outcomes of the programme.
The logframe/theory of change of the programme complements the strategies, plans, and programmes
presented in the JRP, and it is coherent with the objectives mentioned in the JRP,- based on the
protection framework. The evaluation also found a great extent to which the programme strengths have
complemented the work of GoB and other development agencies. However, some additional efforts are
required to ensure achieving the long-term objectives of the programme. The evaluation found that an
increased effort is required to mitigate the existing challenges that women and especially children face
with regard to WASH and child protection. Such additional efforts would ensure further alignment with the
programme objectives to achieve the long-term outcomes, envisioned as a result of the programme.

“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
6.3. Coverage
Overall, the beneficiaries in both the host communities and the refugee camps have been reached with
essential services in nutrition, education, child protection, and WASH sectors. Most of the activities
under the nutrition and education sectors were able to cover more than the expected targets. In the
refugee camps, the involvement of women in designing and introducing various strategies contributed to
increasing the coverage of WASH services. Child protection services were able to reach the beneficiaries,
especially during the pandemic by scaling up individualised and house-to-house approaches.
6.4. Quality and Fidelity
Implementation fidelity refers to the degree to which an intervention or programme is delivered as
intended. With the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19, the programme activities could not be
implemented as planned. The programme deviated from the planned timelines, and had to adapt its
implementation modalities to better suit the changing context and to ensure continuity of the programme
activities.
However, quality and fidelity of a programme are not only measured by its adherence to its plans and
timelines, but also by exposure/dose, participant responsiveness, and programme differentiation.
While evaluating the quality and fidelity of the programme, the evaluation team was also able to identify
essential strengths of the programme that have resulted in significant contributions towards achieving the
intended outcomes. The evaluation team also explored specific interventions that put in place strategies
to optimise the level of fidelity achieved.
Barriers that affected the programme’s fidelity included limited human resources in the field due to
restrictions imposed, especially in the camps, suspension of school-based adolescent clubs and also
closure of important sites, such as MPCs, which were crucial for the delivery of services. This also
affected the delivery of integrated vocational and life-skill trainings, psychosocial support, numeracy and
literacy training. Similarly, the closure of learning centres in the camps caused discontinuation of the
peer-led teacher learning circles (TLC). Adolescent life-skills, structured mental health and psychosocial
support sessions, parenting sessions, and community-based child protection meetings too had to be
suspended to lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Children targeted for learning activities could not
be reached due to the closure of schools and LCs as of March 2020. Furthermore, resource teachers
could not be identified due to school closure, which affected the support and mentoring of teachers at
camp level in line with the teacher professional development framework.
These challenges posed threat to the implementation of project interventions and resulted in a significant
delay in implementation of planned activities as well as timely achievement of targets. For instance, the
utilisation rates for both health and nutrition services dropped significantly in April-June period of 2020 in
both the camps and the host communities, due to movement restrictions on staff and patients as well as
fear of contracting COVID-19. However, communication campaigns on COVID-19, various vaccination
programmes including those on routine immunisation, measles and rubella, nutrition action week, and
Vitamin A supplementation helped sections and sectors achieved targeted goals and results.
As lockdowns and widespread restrictions on group activities continued in most of 2020 with temporary
closure of many facilities, the programme leveraged an opportunity and concentrated on more

Evaluation Report
individualised delivery modalities and house-to-house visits, adopting use of technology and e-learning,
and enlisting the support of additional community volunteers - who played an increasingly critical role in
the pandemic response to reach critical mass with life-saving messages and essential services.
An essential component of the programme that played a critical role in ensuring that community concerns
are addressed in a timely manner was IFCs. The survey data along with the data presented in the Second
Annual Report (95 per cent in the camps, and 84 per cent in the host communities) highlights strengths
of IFCs as an important implementation modality that can help resolve issues within the community
satisfactorily.
UNICEF repurposed and adapted the interventions to meet the emerging needs of target population in the
host communities, brought on by COVID-19, while ensuring continuity of delivery of the package of basic
service to children and their families. This was also enabled by the integrated approach operationalised
on ground through provision of trainings to social workers through DSS, operating integrated one-
stop platforms for vulnerable adolescents to access protection and education services, and supporting
capacity strengthening of workers from DAE for better mainstreaming of nutrition into agricultural
services. Moreover, UNICEF C4D efforts played a critical role in promoting integrated package of
family life-saving behaviours and practices on nutrition, health, education, child protection, WASH, and
COVID-19 prevention in both the camps and the host communities. As COVID-19 made movement in
field challenging, the partners also opted to bring on additional volunteers to work closely with social
workers and staff to ensure the continuation of support to vulnerable children. Additional Rohingya
volunteers were also brought on to work closely with social workers and partner staff to ensure the
continuity of support for children.
The additional flexibility, provided by UNICEF to its partners to implement their activities based on
the latest situation, was one of the contributing factors to ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the
programme were maintained. The online solutions adopted to train partner staff provided an opportunity
to convey relevant messages to the communities and contributed to ensuring continuity of the programme
activities in the midst of COVID-19. However, the support of the community members in both the camps
and the host communities was displayed in the support provided to implement activities, such as mothers
screening their children for malnutrition, which greatly contributed to ensuring that the quality and fidelity
of the programme were not adversely affected. Community engagement, therefore, emerged as the
biggest strength of the programme.
6.5. Efficiency
The evaluation team found that the representatives of the implementing partners across the programme
components were well aware of their assigned roles and responsibilities along with the roles of other
partners and their assigned geographical areas. The implementing partners are cognisant of the
coordination mechanisms at sectoral and programme levels - PIC and PMC. There also has been
increased coordination among the government departments and the implementing partners.
The evaluation team’s reviews found that there was timely disbursement of funds and supplies of items,
like MHM kits, ECD kits, school box kits, C4D materials, etc. With just a few exceptions, all items were
distributed timely among the beneficiaries. However, since the evaluation could not receive information
on the budget and its utilisation, it cannot comment on the appropriate usage of the same. Moreover, due
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 95
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
to the disruptions caused by the advent of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns, the project limited its
interventions to mandatory and emergency hygiene promotion activities. However, an Implementation
Acceleration Plan for 2020 was designed to address the challenges due to COVID-19, where changes
were made in the implementation modalities.
Additionally, proposals were submitted by the partners on time, and were also approved by the UNICEF
timely. UNICEF has also been flexible in accommodating requirements for the additional budget through
the realignment of unutilised funds within different budget heads.
6.6. Effectiveness
The midterm evaluation finds that the results of the programme have been on track to achieve the
planned objectives. It has successfully provided synergies through linkages among the sectors and
frontline workers. Through its integrated approach, the programme has reduced information barriers
for the target population. However, there are areas, like knowledge on gender-based violence, child
trafficking, and safe disposal of menstrual absorbents, where the figures have reportedly been low and
therefore demand extra attention.
Over the course of the programme, the beneficiaries have experienced improved access and utilisation of
services. However, despite the progress that the programme has made, there are certain concerns that
the beneficiaries have raised that need to be addressed. The challenge for gender-segregated toilets, for
instance, still persists in the communities, and there are still children who never went to school. Further,
there is a need to train the FLWs, who have been left out from the process; and refreshers’ training needs
to be continued, as a few workers/volunteers are still unclear about their roles. Additionally, areas, where
the beneficiaries desire further interventions, require attention.
In sum, the programme interventions have contributed immensely in moving towards achieving the overall
objective of the programme. Given that this is a midterm evaluation, the results hint towards a progressive
change in the communities with the exception of a few indicators falling behind the intended targets.
6.7. Gender and Human Rights
Given that women face disproportionate burdens in terms of violence, unemployment, and access to
resources in comparison to men, the programme seeks to address the systemic marginalisation of
women by engaging with the four sectors of the programme, and by addressing constraints that exist
on the supply of social services for the Rohingya communities. The programme activities have led to
significant achievements - there has been a demonstrated increase in information dissemination and
greater access to hygiene and sanitation services among women, even as children’s access to education
has increased, and persons with disabilities have been provided with assistive devices, cash assistance,
and learning materials. The programme efforts coupled with the community mobilisation activities
conducted through community-based platforms, such as mother support groups have led to women
being empowered to seek nutrition services for themselves as well as their children. The involvement of
women in the programme is pushing the regressive social norms existing in the camps, ensuring greater
participation of women in the programme and voicing of their concerns. The involvement of women and
girls in the programme is also leading to shifting of the norms with regard to movement and mobility of
women and girls in both the camps and the host communities.
96 Midterm
Evaluation Report
However, the interventions are weak on certain aspects that can ensure equitable access to infrastructure
and services by the communities - for instance, lack of gender-segregated toilets and availability
of disability-friendly toilets. Additionally, disparities in outcomes between the host and the refugee
communities continue to exist in certain indicators. These outcomes indicate the enduring prevalence of
inequality, requiring the programme to focus on addressing the particular aspects of exclusion that afflict
the women of Cox’s Bazar.
6.8. Impact
The evaluation found that some of the interventions that are at an initial stage are slowly leading to
resilience building amongst the communities. Further, training received by the community participants,
especially women and adolescent girls, is having a positive impact on empowering them and promoting
leadership. The programme is also addressing child protection issues through psychological support
to children, strengthening their overall resilience. While the outbreak of COVID-19 negatively impacted
some of the programme interventions, initiation of e-learning platforms, remote follow-ups, provision
of counselling and supplements through home visits, and radio programming were some of the ways
through which the programme ensured a connect with the communities and kept up the resilience-
building measures.
6.9. Connectedness and Sustainability
The programme’s linkages with broader development efforts, such as JRP, contribute to the resilience-
building outcomes within the communities. The programme has also created community support
networks, playing an important role in developing long-term human resource capacity from both the host
and the Rohingya communities. The extensive social mobilisation efforts and community engagement
models have the potential of improving coverage of interventions, building resilience amongst the
communities, and ensuring sustainability. However, there are external factors that affect the successful
implementation of the programme. Its operating environment is often affected by natural disasters and
unforeseen circumstances, which exacerbate humanitarian needs.

LESSONS LEARNED
The lessons learned have been formulated based on the observations made during the entire evaluation
as well as on the interactions with various stakeholders. Key learnings from the overall functioning of the
programme as well as the evaluation have been articulated to benefit future programmes undertaken by
UNICEF.
Investing in community mobilisation through creation of community networks and platforms is
instrumental in building trust amongst the communities in emergency situations.
One of the key aspects of working in culturally conservative societies is breaking myths and
misconceptions along with shifting community norms. Involvement of influential leaders from within
the communities and collectivisation of people through support networks and platforms can enable
transformative change. The evidence from the midterm evaluation suggests that the programme has
remained on track and been able to exceed its targets despite the challenges associated with COVID-19,
as a result of investment on community mobilisation activities. Empowering individuals to come together
through C4D initiatives, awareness generation, and capacity building activities ensured that the
programme did not lose its progress despite being away from the field for a significant period of time.
Moreover, in the challenging times, the communities displayed strength and resilience by adapting to
the situation and taking ownership of their well-being. Hence, the participation of local communities and
organisations is imperative for successful design and implementation of humanitarian activities.
Capacity building of the partners working closely with the communities contributes to effective
response towards conflict management.
Training local partner organisations for humanitarian assistance early warning can allow the partners to
preposition commodities before an expected disaster. Moreover, management and staff should receive
special training by an expert in conflict resolution/consensus building prior to design of the project. In
situations, such as in the programme context, there may be beneficiaries who may be holding deep-
seated emotions, mutual distrust and animosities towards each other (such as between the host and the
refugee communities). This is far beyond the normal situations in which UNICEF or other implementing
partners attempt to build consensus among a project’s stakeholders. Reducing conflicts and reaching
consensus is a tough job, one for which specialised preparation is needed.
In emergency situations it is imperative to maintain processes that are simple and flexible, while
remaining consistent with good management practices.
A flexible and adjustable design is crucial for maximising assistance effectively for purposes that may
not be originally foreseen in the initial strategy. As was seen in the experience of implementing the
programme, through a challenging time of the pandemic, the programme stakeholders were able to make
adjustments and modifications to ensure continuity of the programme activities and remain responsive to
98 Midterm
Evaluation Report
the changing needs. Furthermore, commodity exchange programmmes can provide a ‘rapid response’
capability, which enables the development agencies to quickly respond to the ever-changing operational
environment of humanitarian crisis.
There is a need for digital transformation to adapt to the changing environment.
The pandemic has changed how the communities live, work and educate their children. As evidenced
in this programme, the evaluation team found digital interventions as a successful medium of ensuring
continuity of interventions in the midst of the pandemic and also as a powerful means of communicating
life-saving messages. Digital technologies can make humanitarian organisations more effective,
but this requires broad acceptance and willingness to learn. It is important to keep in mind that how
effective technologies are for the humanitarian sector depends on how we use those and the quality of
the data that goes into those. In the context of the camps, where network is limited and regulated, the
development agencies may need to think of ways to enable digital transformation to ensure access to
education and other services. Investing in digitisation of content, in addition to physical interventions with
the communities, may be the key to achieving success in an uncertain world, post-pandemic.

RECOMMENDATIONS
This section provides recommendations based on the findings of the evaluation (rationale) and proposed
actions required to implement the recommendations. The recommendations are mapped with the sections
within UNICEF that would be responsible for undertaking the proposed actions within the specified
timeframe and based on priority accorded.
Post data collection and analysis, a multi-stakeholder debriefing and validation workshop was held on
15 December 2021. The main findings and conclusions of the evaluation were presented and discussed
in a mixed participant group, comprising representatives from different sections at UNICEF in Cox’s
Bazar, and the implementing partners. The objective of this workshop was to provide feedback to the
evaluation team in terms of factual corrections with a deep dive focus on the content and prioritisation of
the recommendations. After the presentation on findings and conclusions, the participants discussed the
recommendations in four groups (each group discussed 2-3 recommendations). Each group debated on
the proposed recommendations (recommendation drafting or refining or justification for their exclusion),
priorities that should be accorded from implementation perspective, and timeframe for implementation.
The recommendations were presented to the larger group for discussions.
The recommendations presented below are based on the evaluator’s assessment on the importance and
urgency of actions considering the conclusions presented in the previous section as well as agreement on
the priority accorded by the stakeholders.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL CONTRACT
Title of the assignment Midterm evaluation of the ‘Building Rohingya refugee and host
community resilience in Cox’s Bazar’ Programme
Purpose To evaluate progress to-date and course correct where needed, as
outlined in the EU-funded contract
Location Camps and Host communities in the log frame implementation areas
of Cox’s Bazar District
Estimated Duration November 2020-April 2021 (6 months)
1. Background
Introduction
Cox’s Bazar District is currently hosting 860,0001 Rohingya refugees, nearly all of whom are living in 34
congested camps in the district. This crisis has created a challenging situation for Bangladesh, particularly
for the communities in Cox’s Bazar District, one of the worst-performing in terms of child related development
indicators and vulnerability to natural disasters. While the arrival of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees
since 25th Aug 2017 is not the root cause of the problem, their presence has contributed to a vicious
cycle which will only get worse without actions with a medium to longer-term vision. This provided an
opportunity to practice a new approach to responding to the crisis and the needs of the Cox’s Bazar district
simultaneously. To address these issues, UNICEF, funded by the European Union, started the three-year
programme “Building Rohingya refugee and host community’s resilience in Cox’s Bazar”, to support efforts
to address systemic changes required not only to lessen the need for humanitarian aid in Cox’s Bazar
District, but also to complement and strengthen existing local development efforts. This programme is a
significant investment and has local, national and international implications for UNICEF, the Government of
Bangladesh, and all people living in Cox’s Bazar.
Context in Cox’s Bazar
The latest available data indicated that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, household vulnerability within the
camps was increasing. In October 2019, 37 per cent of refugee households reported that they had incurred
debt in the previous month2. Meanwhile, 95 per cent of households reported spending money on food, 72
per cent on health expenditures, 30 per cent on hygiene items and 25 per cent on education materials. Only
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 107
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
54 per cent of households met an acceptable food consumption score, with dietary diversity a key concern,
tied to the continued serious levels of acute malnutrition among children under 53. Education Sector
estimates indicate that over 375,000 Rohingya children, adolescents and youth are in need education
services in 20204. The majority of these children, especially those aged 4-14 years, have been accessing
learning in over 5,000 temporary learning facilities5 established by various partners across the camps. The
joint multisector needs assessment (MSNA) conducted by the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) in
October 2019 showed that 86 per cent of boys and 89 per cent of girls aged 6-11 years were accessing
education in Learning Centres (LCs) across the camps6. These figures represent considerable progress
made in expanding access to learning for Rohingya refugee children over the past two years. However,
results also show access to learning decreases as children become older, especially for adolescent girls.
For children aged 12 to 14, participation in education drops to 54 per cent for boys and 34 per cent for girls.
Key barriers identified during the assessment include child marriage (36%); cultural reasons (23%); not
finding the education useful (21%); the child being needed at home (20%); and a lack of learning materials
(15%). Only 13 per cent of adolescent girls and 2 per cent of boys aged 15-18 years had access to learning
and skills development opportunities7.
Rohingya girls face significant sociocultural barriers to education. Many families prefer that older girls stay at
home or attend single-sex classes, making it more difficult for them to access informal education organized
by Education Sector partners in the camps. Children with disabilities are less likely to be enrolled. Of the 10
per cent of children aged 6 to 10 with functional difficulties in February-March 2019, only 61 per cent were
attending LCs compared to 73 per cent of children overall in that age range8.
According to the December 2019 learning competency assessment, 40 per cent of children enrolled in
UNICEF-funded LCs and home-based facilities demonstrated Learning Competency Framework and
Approach (LCFA)9 Level 2 competencies while 49 per cent demonstrated Level 1 competencies. 10 per
cent of the children demonstrated Level 3 while only 1 per cent demonstrated Level 4 competencies.
Overall, there is an increased proportion of children who demonstrated learning competencies at Levels
2 and 3 compared with the baseline results from December 2018. The data comparing the LCFA levels in
2019 and 2020 shows that learning activities have led to observable changes since the ASER has been
introduced.
The primary net enrolment rate10 in the host community in Cox’s Bazar District was 79 per cent in 2016,
which is 21 percentage points below the national average of 98 per cent. 40 per cent of boys and 22 per
cent of girls in primary school in the district dropout before completing Grade 5, which is 17 percentage
points higher than the national average. Learning outcomes in Cox’s Bazar are among the worst nationally.
The latest national student assessment11 results from 2017 for Grades 3 and 5 covering Bangla and math
show that the performance of students in Cox’s Bazar is among the lowest compared to students in other
districts nationally. The combined mean score for Cox’s Bazar is 233 points which is the lowest in Chittagong
Division (267 points) and far below the national average of 274 points.
According to the Child Protection Sub Sector (CPSS) Child Protection Information Management System
(CPIMS+), over 23,000 Rohingya children experienced one or more forms of violence or exploitation in 2019
including physical violence, trafficking, neglect, child labour and exposure to harmful cultural social norms
and practices such as early marriage. 5 per cent of girls in the camps are exposed to child marriage, meaning
up to 21,000 girls have been affected12. The 4,982 (2,837 girls and 2,145 boys)13 identified separated and
unaccompanied boys and girls require continued family-based support. Children with disabilities in the
camps14 are often isolated, reducing their social network, inclusion and access to resources.
108 Midterm
Evaluation Report
A joint UNICEF and Government of Bangladesh assessment on basic services15 in 2017 reported that 35
per cent of respondents in the host community believe marriage below 18 is acceptable, slightly higher
than the national average (31%). The prevalence of child marriage in Bangladeshi communities, especially
of girls, remains high at 5 per cent – roughly the same rate as in the camps. The child labour prevalence,
meanwhile, is reported at 9 per cent in the district, affecting 12 per cent of children in Maheshkhali and
11 per cent in Cox’s Bazar Sadar. Close to one third (29%) of parents in Cox’s Bazar use some type of
negative action to correct their children, including corporal and emotional punishment.
After a notable decrease of under-five children malnutrition rates in the Rohingya camps from 2017 to
2018, the situation has stabilized in 2019. The level of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the camps
decreased slightly (from 1.1% in 2018 to 0.9% in 2019) as a result of better treatment of moderate acute
malnutrition, along with an improvement in the coverage of SAM treatment (from 28% in 2018 to 78% in
2019 as per the Nutrition Sector Semi-Quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage assessment) and
a change in the discharge criteria that allows a child with SAM to stay much longer in treatment for better
outcomes. UNICEF administrative data from 2018 to 2020 shows a significant difference in the number
of girls (55%) admitted compared to boys (45%) despite relatively similar levels of screening, indicating a
potential difference in malnutrition rates among girls and boys.
The continuingly high levels of malnutrition16 (especially GAM, stunting and micronutrient deficiencies) are
due in part to an insufficient use of services by beneficiaries in camps, despite improvement in their quality
and coverage. Only 59.3 per cent of children under 5 had received vitamin A supplementation in the 6
months prior to the October 2019 SMART survey, while 60.9 per cent of pregnant women and 15.3 per cent
of adolescent girls received Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) tablets according to guidelines. Underlying causes
of malnutrition also include poor nutrition practices, especially insufficient dietary diversity among infant
and young children. According to SMART survey Round 2 conducted in 201817, only 50 per cent children
under 6 months in the camps were exclusively breastfed. 55 per cent of infants were not introduced to
breastfeeding at birth.
Malnutrition remains a public health problem in Bangladeshi households in Cox’s Bazar. The district is
among the worst performing in terms of nutrition, with stunting and wasting affecting respectively 34.6 per
cent and 9.8 per cent of children under 5 between in 2019, equal to the national average for wasting and
above national prevalence in the case of stunting (28%)18. While wasting occurs as a result of acute factors
and can be treated if the right interventions are implemented in a timely manner, the causes of stunting are
profound, more structural and difficult to avert. Micronutrient deficiencies are also prevalent. These factors
include an insufficient access to and use of nutrition services by vulnerable populations and low levels
of integration of nutrition and health services, as well as poor feeding and hygiene practices resulting in
macro- and micronutrient deficiencies (especially undernutrition).
Food insecurity is a major cause of malnutrition. Socioeconomically vulnerable populations face difficulties
accessing food in the quantity and quality required to meet their dietary energy and nutrient needs, with
families forced to adopt negative coping strategies such as meal skipping and a reduction of meal quantities.
The Refugee Emergency Vulnerable Assessment (REVA) carried out in 2018 revealed that 69 per cent of
refugees were highly vulnerable to food insecurity against 11 per cent in local communities, and 19 per
cent of refugees and 28 per cent of local community households were vulnerable to food insecurity19. In
Bangladeshi communities and in camps, dietary diversity is still low (with low consumption of nutritious
foods such as fresh vegetables and animal-source foods), negatively impacting the nutritional status of
vulnerable populations, especially pregnant, lactating women and young children.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 109
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
All Rohingya refugees report collecting their drinking water from an improved water source – 71 per cent
from hand pumps and 27 per cent from a piped water network (the remainder from protected dug wells
and water tanks)20. In the eight camps under UNICEF’s area of WASH responsibility21, 45 per cent of
the 240,000 refugees are accessing piped networks. The 2018 WASH Sector Water Master Plan aims
to provide all refugees in the camps in Ukhiya upazila22 with safe water from piped networks, including
the two camps included under this evaluation (noting that water scarcity in Teknaf means that alternative
water sources are required). The completion of these networks will reduce the reliance on the 16,500 hand
pumps in the camps, 87 per cent of which are currently functional and half23 of which are showing signs of
contamination.
There are 14,849 latrines in UNICEF’s area of WASH responsibility24, approaching the SPHERE and WASH
Sector standard of 20 people per latrine. Despite this adequate coverage, there are major challenges
in quality and functionality. 78 per cent of latrines across all camps are considered functional25. This
figure drops to 57 per cent when measured against the WASH Sector standard Unified Design, including
construction quality, maintenance and periodic desludging26. Almost half of girls and 40 per cent of women
reported feeling unsafe using latrine facilities. Women and girls are adopting coping mechanisms and using
improvised bathing areas within their living shelters. Many women and girls of reproductive age avoid using
latrines at night and face difficulties managing their menstruation due to the absence of privacy.27
The adoption of appropriate hygiene practices remained low as of 2019. Only a third of households report
washing their hands after handling children’s faeces and 26 per cent of households reported the presence
of human faeces in their vicinity28. This is likely due in part to the lack of safe disposal of faeces of children
under 5 years old, who are also reported as practicing open defecation regularly (46%). 67 per cent of
households reported having soap29.
Cox’s Bazar District has some of the worst water and sanitation indicators in the country according to the
2019 WASH Mapping undertaken by the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) with support
from UNICEF and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. The sector lacks
adequate national budget allocations while the district is regularly affected by cyclones and floods. 76 per
cent of households have a basic water supply but only 18 per cent have access to safely managed water30.
29 per cent of households use safely managed latrines and 47 per cent of households have handwashing
facilities in their premises, where only 33 per cent of households practice handwashing and 28 per cent
households dispose of faeces from children under 5 properly. Women also reported difficulties accessing
MHM materials and 39 per cent of women are able to take up proper menstrual hygiene practices31. The
first case of COVID-19 in the camps was confirmed in the camps in May and by now 64 cases have been
confirmed as of 24th Jul. The level of testing in the camps is very low at 1,722 per million. At the same time,
there is no evidence of mass transmission, clustered cases or excess mortality so far. However, it is unlikely
that transmission has hit its peak. The host communities of Cox’s Bazar District have been more affected,
with 3,143 confirmed cases since the first case in March 2020. The direct and indirect socioeconomic
impacts of COVID-19 in the district are worsening tensions with the host communities. On 24th Mar, the
Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) circulated a letter restricting operations in, and
travel to, the Rohingya refugee camps to essential services only. Access was restricted further on 8th
Apr with the shift to critical services only. All LCs in the camps and schools in the host communities are
closed, with 60 per cent of children in host communities and 77 per cent of children in the camps believed
to be accessing alternative learning modalities during the pandemic. Child Protection services have pivoted
to one-on-one, community-based and remote provision of psychosocial support, case management and
110 Midterm
Evaluation Report
engagement. Meanwhile, access to nutrition services decreased by half in April and May, but by July
had returned to pre-pandemic levels, due to supplementary measures put in place by UNICEF and other
actors. Finally, WASH services have been expanded to ensure a safe and clean environment and allow for
increased handwashing.
Programmatic Design and Response
Due to the context and conditions in Cox’s Bazar outlined above, the European Union funded a programme
specifically designed to build the resilience among Rohingya refugees in Camps 7 and 15 and across
the host communities of Pekua and Teknaf in Cox’s Bazar. In these areas, UNICEF is working to support
children under 5, school-aged children, adolescents and mothers along with the community more broadly.
Particularly vulnerable households, including women-headed households, are among the targeted groups.
Across activities, both frontline workers and beneficiaries are expected to be at least half female, with some
components, including nutrition and livelihoods, focusing specifically on adolescent girls, pregnant and
lactating women and female-headed households.
This programme is referred to in this document as ‘INTPA’. This first phase is a three-year programme which
began implementation in January 2019. Its overall objective to contribute to strengthening the resilience32
of Rohingya refugees and their host communities in an integrated manner in Cox’s Bazar District.
This action is designed to provide vulnerable populations with a package of multisectoral interventions
that allow them to prevent, respond and adapt to shocks over the long-term. This means bringing together
several complementary technical areas within UNICEF across three entry points: household, community
and facility levels. Examples include a multisectoral life skills curriculum for adolescents and common
messaging to be used in household visits across the programme. The full (retrospectively built) Theory of
Change (TOC) for the programme is found on the following page in Figure 1.
It is implemented with a wide range of government and NGO partners including:

2. Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope
Purpose
The overall purpose of this midterm evaluation is to assess the progress of activities and results to-date of
the “Building Rohingya refugee and host community resilience in Cox’s Bazar” programme, considering the
Theory of Change and logframe.
This evaluation, along with focusing progress analysis, will identify early learnings, lessons learned, and
challenges and accordingly will provide realistic recommendations for the betterment of the implementation
and for further revisions if required to ensure and optimize the impacts among children, adolescent girls,
women and vulnerable people at Rohingya camps and host community in Cox’s Bazar district. In addition,
this evaluation will significantly extract discrepancies between expected results of the activities and
actual achievements within the programme, including presenting the main causes behind any identified
discrepancies/under achievements and will propose solutions for a way forward to minimize the gaps.
In particular, the evaluation will assess the impact of COVID-19 on the programme context and results
achievement and identify learnings from the current adaptations as well as recommend further ones for
future activities.
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 113
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
Moreover, the evaluation will provide directions to both UNICEF, EU, and Implementing Partners including
Government and CSOs who are the primary audience of the evaluation, on the further actions and required
reprogramming within the programme results areas of Education, Child Protection, Nutrition and WASH for
refugees and people of the host communities in Cox’s Bazar district. Refugees and host communities are
the secondary audience of the evaluation findings as the further actions resulting these findings will benefit
them overall.
Objectives
The specific objectives of the midterm evaluation are as follows:
• Assess the relevance, coherence, and coverage of this programme to the country’s priorities and
context, considering a gender-responsive and a human rights lens, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic
and recent natural disasters
• Assess the quality and fidelity of implementation of the programme’s activities, including their internal
integration as well as coordination with other agencies
• Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme as well as progress towards impact on both
the Rohingya refugees and the host communities, considering differences in gender, age, and ability,
and the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and natural disasters
• Identify the programme’s current strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities of the integrated
model of intervention, identifying indications of connectedness, sustainability, and systemic change for
both Rohingya and host communities
• Draw lessons learned and recommendations for further improvement of the programme immediately
and in future phases, as well as for similar contexts in resilience building of refugee populations
Scope
The total value of the phase I programme is EURO 18 million, and in accordance with the proposal and
agreement with the EU, is subject to a midterm evaluation. This evaluation is to be conducted during the
period of September 2020-January 2021. While there has already been deemed a phase II extension
(through 2024) and those activities will overlap, this evaluation will only cover phase I activities to date,
from its commencement in 2019 to mid-2020, including fund utilization, expected outputs, results, and
outcomes. The programme includes activities across all four areas of Child Protection, Education, WASH,
and nutrition, all to be implemented in an integrated way, and therefore the evaluation will cover these four
areas equally, with no greater thematic emphasis on one over the others. An endline evaluation will occur
in 2024. The phase I programme covers two upazilas of Cox’s Bazar District (Pekua and Teknaf) and two
camps for refugees (camp 7 and 15), which is the geographic scope of this midterm evaluation.
3. Evaluation Questions
The evaluation will be informed by the OECD-DAC criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and
less so, impact and sustainability, due to the project implementation status (midline), In addition, gender
and human rights will also be addressed, and given the humanitarian context, the evaluation will assess
coherence, coverage, and connectedness of the programme. The evaluation will seek to answer, but not
limited to, the following questions corresponding to the criteria. See the evaluability assessment matrix
114 Midterm
Evaluation Report
in Annex 2 on how each question relates to the criteria and the specific objectives of the evaluation. The
bidding team can suggest changes to the evaluability scoring and evaluation questions, as long as the
original question is captured and reasoning behind changes is included. The contracted evaluation team
will finalize the matrix during the inception phase with a goal to explore other aspects if any, given any
contextual circumstances.
Relevance
• Were the planned activities informed by need assessments or analyses (including a gender analysis)
as well as logical, relevant and strategically optimal for the various stakeholders’ needs (including
Rohingya and host community population sub-groups – marginalized and in hard-to-reach areas)?
Has the programme meaningfully involved relevant stakeholders during the preparation phase through
consultations or information sharing (specifically the target populations and women and girls)?
• Have the programme’s results remained valid and relevant regarding beneficiary needs and government/
partner priorities (pre- and post-COVID-19 and natural disasters)? How well has the programme adapted
to the COVID-19 situation and cyclones, including help to reduce the impact of these on beneficiaries
and shifts to climate-resilient services?
Coherence & Coverage
• Do the main programme activities/components contribute to the main objectives of the programme and
logically interlink and align with the Theory of Change and logframe?
• Is the programme in line with the current objective of Joint Response Plan (JRP)? How is the programme
aligned with JRP and other national plans (such as NSSS, NPAN2, etc.) and sub-national plans like
District Implementation Plan, Five Year Plan, UN Planning and Results Framework (UNDAF, CPD)
at country level? How consistent is the programme with UNICEF’s revised Core Commitments for
Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs)?
• What is the reach of the key achievements (including sub-outcomes)? Consider differences among
vulnerable groups, locations, and varying demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, ability, etc.).
Efficiency
• Was there clear distribution of roles and responsibilities of key actors involved, including programme
governance mechanisms, staff, implementing partners toward the achievement of objectives?
• Have the resources been requested, allocated, and utilized adequately to implement the planned
activities? To what extent have UNICEF and Implementing Partners made good use of the human,
financial and technical resources, and have made appropriate use of tools (programme and financial
management) and approaches to pursue the achievement of programme results in a cost-effective
way?
Effectiveness
• How effectively have the results been achieved, and to what level of quality (analyzed by expected
results and outputs)? Were there any obstacles/bottlenecks/issues on the UNICEF/Government/
Programme partner side that limited the successful implementation and results achievement of the
programme? What are the government stakeholder’s and beneficiaries’ views on services provided?
What are their views on improving services (if need to improve)? Is the programme implemented in a
way to regularly collect these views and adapt the programme to meet them?

ability, etc.).
refugees, collected in Ona forms
• Are the implementation strategies for education, child • Sector data, including 5Ws/sector
protection, nutrition, livelihoods, health, and water, databases
sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) appropriate, on track, and • Joint field visit reports and actions
effective to achieve the planned objectives and impact?
What, if any, alternative strategies would have been more
effective in achieving its objectives? What are findings and lessons from this programme that should
influence ongoing and future interventions for UNICEF and its partners, regarding effectively building
resilience among refugee populations and surrounding host communities (in Cox’s Bazar and in other
similar contexts)? What lessons from the programme management, institutional and implementation
arrangements could be retained for the future interventions? How could the identified positive or
negative external factors be mitigated or exploited further for the next programme phase?
Gender and Human Rights
• How well has the programme integrated gender and a human rights lens into the design and
implementation? What has been the current effects of that integration?
• Have current achievements or progress been equitably achieved (according to geographical area/camp,
vulnerability, gender, ability status, age, time entry into the camps, refugees vs. host communities,
etc.)?
Connectedness, Impact and Sustainability
• Is the programme likely to contribute long term to refugee and host community resilience for vulnerable
families and children in the areas of education, child protection, nutrition, livelihoods, health, and
WASH? What evidence shows indications towards achievement of other sub-outcome or long-term
impacts? Consider direct and indirect contributions and positive and negative intended and unintended
outcomes.
• Is the programme (UNICEF and Implementing Partners) linked well and in line with broader development
efforts to address systemic changes required not only to lessen the need for humanitarian aid in Cox’s
Bazar District, but also to complement and strengthen existing local development efforts?
• Are there any external factors (including institutional obstacles) to the programme that have affected
successful implementation and results achievement, and prospect for policy impact and replication? How
has COVID-19 impacted progress towards achieving desired results and what are the recommendations
for interventions in the midst of and post-COVID restrictions?
• To what degree, if any, are there indications of sustainability, systemic change, or more resilience among
the refugee and host communities in the areas of education, child protection, nutrition, livelihoods,
health, and WASH?
• What are the possible sustainability mechanisms (financial and programmatic) for each of the
programme result areas/ components (including maintaining the quality of service provision)? Given
116 Midterm
Evaluation Report
the goal of replication for this integrated model of programming, have any programmatic approaches or
results emerged that indicate promising signs for replication and scale up by national partners or other
actors? Analyze and comment on any emerging vision, strategy and measures proposed (and being
implemented) for the planned next phase of programming.
4. Evaluation Methodology
A mixed method approach will be followed for this evaluation by combining qualitative and quantitative
components. The evaluation team will conduct a desk review of programme documents (proposal, logframe
– Annex 1, baseline evaluation report, monitoring data and tools, workplans, progress and financial reports,
joint monitoring visits reports, workshop reports, meeting minutes, financial statements, etc.) and country
context-specific documents (such as Joint Response Plan, Rolling work plan, district implementation plan).
This data will be verified with key informant interviews, community-level focus group discussions and field
visits. The survey will assess results (outputs), while coverage of services will be assessed through review
of partner and sector data (taking into consideration that similar interventions are funded through other
agencies). The analysis and synthesis of findings will also be built on triangulating the information from
different stakeholders (implementing partners, government, and programme staff and beneficiaries).
The evaluation team is expected to propose a robust methodology, including sampling plan for each,
tools that will enable collection of relevant information for conclusive learnings and recommendations
while upholding COVID-19-related safety precautions, and analysis methods for both the quantitative and
qualitative collections. To guide the sampling plans development, UNICEF will provide the winning team the
following: 1) A partial list of beneficiaries, corresponding to specific services that have discrete beneficiaries
(i.e. not the whole target population, which is the case for WASH services); 2) A list of phone numbers for
frontline workers, with the exception of Rohingya volunteer teachers; and 3) A list of implementing partners
(location-wise), including how they map to the two camp’s service provision numbers in the logframe. Also,
in general, service provision is divided by sector and one implementing partner is responsible for one
service sector. The two camps are divided in blocks and sub-blocks. To further guide the evaluation team’s
planning, see Table 1.

The evaluation process should be participatory, engaging local government officials, implementing and
donor partners, programme concerns, key stakeholders and a wide cross-section of staff and beneficiaries,
incorporating gender equity. The opinion of partners, donors and key stakeholders will be required
and analyzed. This includes the following, with special consideration for members of the Programme
Management and Programme Implementation Committees:
• Local Government, Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNOs)
• Strategic partners (Strategic Advisory Group members) and donors
• All international and national NGO Partners and other UN agencies
The primary data collection will be conducted remotely and with some safely-managed in-person interactions
through key informant interviews, in-depth interviews and smaller focus group discussions, and a survey.
Voices of vulnerable participants must be included in this evaluation, specifically: adolescent girls, persons
with disabilities, and Rohingya refugees (both children and adults). These groups will be asked about
relevance and appropriateness of the programme, views on the services provided, effectiveness and quality
of the activities, any contributions toward building longer term resilience (connectedness), and COVID-19
impacts and recommendations for future work. Additional methods may include participant observation
and field visits, depending on ability, given the current context. See Table 2 below for more details on
the recommended participants by method. Further safeguarding measures can be proposed to ensure
ethical and safe data collection for both the evaluation participants and data collectors. The data collection
could include the organization of tele-meetings and consultations, establishing a process for verification of
findings with key stakeholders and presentation of preliminary findings and recommendations. To collect
data in the camps, UNICEF will work with local authorities to secure the necessary access. In the host
community, the evaluation will be approved through the Deputy Commissioner’s Office. The evaluability
matrix found in Annex 2 maps the evaluation objectives to questions to methods and data sources. The
bidding team is expected to include more information to demonstrate understanding of and strong capacity
for the evaluation execution.

COVID-19 Considerations
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th Mar 2020 due to
the speed of its spread globally and urged governments to take urgent measures to limit its spread. In
response, the Government of Bangladesh has adopted various measures aimed at controlling the spread of
the disease, with observing general holiday from 25th Mar to 30th May and educational institutions closing
nationwide from 17th Mar. Nationwide general holiday and lockdown slowed down the overall activities and
results of INTPA programme along with other development programmes, particularly affecting the education
sector due to nationwide school closure. The focus has shifted towards a COVID-19 lifesaving response.
The situation remains fluid and while moving forward with planning, it is possible that the evaluation will
not be executed as planned due to access issues with travel and meetings. The evaluation team should
include mitigation strategies for the COVID-19-related restrictions and ethical considerations, incorporating
alternative modalities for interaction with beneficiaries and stakeholders, but also be ready and equipped to
maneuver as needed. Discussions with frontline service providers can be done remotely by phone, however,
beneficiaries will need to be surveyed in-person. For the longer discussions with refugees, these will need
to be done in small groups or as individual interviews. It may also be possible to speak to host community
beneficiaries over the phone, though this may preference better-off beneficiaries. Most importantly, we
want to uphold the “do no harm” principle throughout this evaluation. To this end, the evaluation team will
be required to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for fieldwork in COVID-19 conditions, which
will need to be approved by UNICEF and the relevant government and local authorities.
Quality Assurance and Data Analysis
The agency is required to present a quality assurance plan around each methodology, including design, data
collection, storage, entry, analysis, and synthesis. The agency will also propose a detailed Data Analysis
Plan for the evaluation findings, presented host and refugee communities separately when applicable.
Limitations
The agency will need to take into consideration and/or provide workable solutions to any identified limitations
including the following: COVID-19 conditions may limit the ability of the evaluation agency to interact or
collect data equally and ethically from various stakeholders and beneficiaries.
5. Norms and Standards Guiding the Evaluation
This evaluation will be held to the highest standards employed by UNICEF for the conduct of evaluations
and research. In all duties carried out under this assignment, it is expected that the winning evaluation
team will uphold their obligation toward independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest, and
accountability. This means the winning evaluation will abide by the following:
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 119
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
• United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the UN System, 2016
• Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations
• UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis
• UNICEF Procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children
The final report is expected to meet the UNICEF-adapted UNEG Evaluation reports standards as well
as benchmarks used in UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS). The final
deliverable’s approval will be dependent on the sufficient adherence to these standards.
Ethical considerations
It is expected that the proposal will include a section on the expected ethical challenges and issues that
the evaluation will need to overcome, as well as a description of ethical safeguards for participants. The
institution/consultant will also be responsible for getting IRB ethical clearance. IRB ethical clearance is
needed before quantitative and qualitative data collection, and the proposal should include a clause on
how to deal with interviewing adolescent boys and girls in humanitarian settings as well as how to collect
data effectively and safely in the time of COVID-19. The IRB approval letter will need to be attached in the
annexure of the final report. The proposal will need to spell out how the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical
Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis as well as the UNICEF Procedures for
Ethical Research Involving Children will be followed/met, rather than only mentioning that the evaluation
will abide by them. In the past, the research design and methodology for the baseline and midline were
approved by the IRB.
Gender and Human Rights
Evaluation approach and data collection and analysis methods will be human rights based, including child
rights based and gender sensitive. All data will be disaggregated by refugee/host community, sex, age,
gender and ability level. The agency/institution/consultant is expected to abide by the UNEG Guidance on
Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation, and the UN-SWAP Evaluation Performance
Indicator.
6. Management and Reporting
The study will be managed by the Research & Evaluation Specialist, SPEAR team in Dhaka. SPEAR Section
will provide technical support while UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office will provide coordination support, such
as engagement with sectors to identify areas of study, coordination with the implementing partners, and
updates with field level/camp level to facilitate the evaluation implementation and dissemination of results.
A designated focal point from the sectoral INTPA focal points will be responsible for convening, coordinating
and supporting the study.
A Reference Group comprised of key stakeholders from the government and other partners will be set up
from the onset of the evaluation to provide quality assurance to the deliverables. The Reference Group will
be consulted on each key milestone of the evaluation (i.e., inception report and draft report) and will give
feedback on the deliverables of the evaluation. Evaluation results will also be presented and validated by
the Reference Group. Chief of SPEAR will have the accountability of accepting each deliverable.
After the submission of the Inception Report, brief written reports should be submitted weekly by email to
the Evaluation Manager by the end of each alternate Thursday.

Evaluation Report
Annexure 11: Ethical Issues, Considerations, and Approvals
We understand that such an evaluation required well-trained researchers who are capable of seeing and
interpreting complex social phenomena from the embedded perspectives of the participants and reconciling
the diverse perspectives of these participants, without injecting their personal biases or preconceptions into
their inferences. For this evaluation, we upheld the credibility of research methods by providing evidence
of the researcher’s extended engagement in the field, by demonstrating data triangulation across subjects
or data collection techniques, and by maintaining meticulous data management and analytic procedures,
such as verbatim transcription of interviews, accurate records of contacts and interviews, and clear notes
on theoretical and methodological decisions, that can allow an independent audit of data collection and
analysis if needed.
NRMC limits the access of servers and data to limited staff only to safeguard sensitive data to
guarantee privacy and confidentiality.
NRMC’s Internal Ethics Committee adheres to the following three categories of ethical norms as follows:
The team for this assignment was guided by the UNEG ethical guidance principles throughout, which
ensured that no violations, like collecting data without consent, collecting data not pertaining to this
assignment, accessing areas within the institutional premises for which approval has not been taken etc.,
were committed during the data collection. NRMC believes in respect for dignity and diversity, right to
self-determination, fair representation, compliance with codes for vulnerable groups, adherence to ethical
principles and procedure, do no harm, and confidentiality.The evaluation team as well as the data collection
team adhered to the following ethical norms:
IRB Approval: Given the sensitive nature of the questions, the study tools underwent an ethical review, as
guided by UNICEF. NRMC is aware of the process involved in obtaining IRB approvals for research work.
For this evaluation, we engaged with the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) for the IRB approval.(IRB
approval letter is added below)
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 269
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
IRB Approval Letter
270 Midterm
Evaluation Report
Informed Consent: All interviews were conducted with prior consent of the respondents through a consent
form administered at the start of the interviews. The participants were clearly briefed on the intent of the
discussions and the use of the findings from the interviews towards research purposes. The consent form
highlighted that the participant was free to refuse participation from the on-set or at any point they felt
uncomfortable in the discussion. The respondents had a right to decline their participation in the interview or
not disclose any information that they did not want to reveal. The information provided was verbal and in a
written format which ensured that it is accessible and understandable. Time was provided to the participants
to ask any questions they might have about the research or their involvement. Contact details of NRMC key
personnel were also provided to the respondents for any clarifications at a later stage.
Respect for Persons Treated as Autonomous Agents: Researchers chosen were well experienced in
conducting qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys and did not have any relation with the programme
or community.
Protection of Privacy and Well-Being: It was ensured that personal information of the respondent was not
disclosed and was kept confidential. The respondent was interviewed at a location which was comfortable
for the respondent. Efforts were made to ensure that the interview takes place in private unless objected
by the participant. This ensured that the information exchanged stayed between the respondent and the
researcher and also encouraged the respondent to answer the questions openly and honestly.
Right to Safeguard Integrity: No information obtained from the responses would be made public at any
stage of the surveys and thereafter and strict confidentiality will be maintained. Electronic databases will
not have the name of the respondent or family members. All such information shall be encrypted. Complete
privacy of the respondent will be maintained.
Protection from Physical, Mental and Emotional Harm: NRMC adheres to the principle of “do no harm”
and takes special measures to ensure appropriate sensitization and training on working with vulnerable
and displaced populations amongst its staff, particularly to avoid any form of physical, emotional and
psychological stress. It was strictly ensured that researchers did not ask any question or pose any cross-
questions during the survey, that could cause discomfort to the individual, or that could physically, mentally
or emotionally harm them. It was also ensured that enumerators/researchers did not pose any questions
that forced members of the Rohingya community to relive any trauma that they may have faced. Particularly
in the case of persons with disability, it was ensured that the field team undergoes sensitization on the
ethical protocol of interaction with the PWDs. Special care was taken to accommodate for the challenges
of the respondent. For instance, it was ensured that the venue for the interaction was comfortable and
accessible for the respondent. The quantitative survey questions were also be read out loud, if and
when it is needed. In case respondents are unable to voice themselves, the evaluation team spoke to a
representative nominated by the respondents to speak on their behalf. Researchers were trained to identify
signs of distress and stop activities and terminate the survey/interaction accordingly if a participant seemed
unable or uncomfortable to continue.
Access to Information Regarding Research: Researchers provided all information related to the survey
and its objectives. If the respondent still wanted to seek more information, he/she could contact the senior
team member (from NRMC) for answers.
The research instruments were translated to the local language through the engagement of local experts.
This helped in ensuring that the research instruments accurately reflected the intent of the questions and
Midterm Evaluation of UNICEF’s Programme 271
“Building Rohingya Refugee and Host Community Resilience in Cox’s Bazar”
did not change their original meaning. It was also ensured that the consistency and accuracy of translations
did not vary amongst the researchers.
NRMC ensured that no violations like collecting data without consent, collecting data not pertaining to this
assignment, accessing areas within the institution premises for which approval has not been taken etc.
were committed during the data procurement from various institutions.
Researchers did not provide any form of reward or incentive that could push respondents to solely
participate to obtain the reward.
Researcher as instrument: Researchers are often embedded within the social context that they are
studying, and are considered part of the data collection instrument, in that they must use their observational
skills, their trust with the participants, and their ability to extract the correct information. Further, their
personal insights, knowledge, and experiences of the social context is critical to accurately interpreting the
phenomenon of interest. At the same time, researchers must be fully aware of their personal biases and
preconceptions, and not let such biases interfere with their ability to present a fair and accurate portrayal
of the phenomenon.
NRMC ensures that; the evaluation was grounded, from inception to dissemination in a meaningful
collaboration with community stakeholders whenever possible, the language and framing of questions are
kept conversational. Special care was taken to ensure that the language was non-stigmatising and the
diversity of the community was accurately and sensitively reflected.
