Executive summary.
This document contains the results of the evaluation carried out to the
"Program of Cantones de la Childhood Friends", which aimed to carry out
a balance of the implementation of the CAI program and determine its contribution to
development of childhood and adolescence policies. It also seeks to establish
Recommendations for the improvement of the program and its scaling throughout the country.
In order to meet this objective, the external evaluation is carried out, carried out
by an evaluation team hired and alien to the implementation of the intervention,
covering aspects such as: the relevance of the intervention, the results
that have been generated by the intervention, the program design components
(intervention theory) and its management (consultation of municipalities), likewise,
According to its functionality, it is an evaluation of design, process and results at the level
of products.
In this way, the evaluation has a double, summative and formative character, in
function of being summative, since it seeks to determine to what extent
or not reached the planned results and providing information about the value
of the program to stimulate public policies and initiatives for children and
adolescence. It is also formative, since it seeks to assess the program, to
to be able to establish the achievements and good practices, on the one hand, and on the other hand
They analyze the program improvements areas and aspects that have to be strengthened.
The evaluation process had a national reach, since it covered the 32 cantons
Participants in the first phase of the CAI program and who received their certification.
Cantons were also analyzed that have not participated in the program, to
establish the motivations to participate or not, and be able to compare the situation of
the rights of childhood and adolescence in cantons that participate and cantons that
They do not participate and the added value of the program. All the
Cai program components and its five pillars. It is expected of the evaluation that
Cover the program from its design in 2010-2011 to date, as well as
design and planning processes of the CAI, its normative and programmatic frameworks,
The implementation in the first 32 cantons, the certification of these and the period
Following the certification, until the restructuring of the IFAM.
Therefore, we worked with officials of the municipal and Pani,
minors, authorities from various institutions involved, who
allowed to know the perspectives in relation to the CAI, in order to triangulate the
given responses and the techniques used, to determine the findings, which
allowed to answer the questions that were raised for development
of the evaluation.
Among the results obtained, that for the relevance criteria,
The Cantones Amigos de la Infancy (CAI) program is highly relevant and
responds properly to the country's needs and priorities
of promotion, defense and realization of the rights of childhood and adolescence,
Through the stimulus in the design and implementation of local public policies
1
effective to improve the well -being of the minor population, defending their
rights, promoting their participation and making the cantons more environments
Friendly, positioning, for the first time in history, the incorporation of topics
of childhood and adolescence in Costa Rican local management.
With respect to efficacy, achievements were identified that are especially aligned, with
a pillar, the construction and/or strengthening of the inter -institutional articulation and
Intersectoral. Lower evidence was found for the pillars of the elaboration of a
regulatory framework, the generation of periodic information about NNA, creation of
a municipal instance and in the case of active participation, the situation is
really deficit.
As for the management model with which the CAI program was managed, it is seen by
The people interviewed, as efficient, in the meantime to give it an impulse
significant in the local to the actions that the government came in terms of rights
of the NNA. Situation that is corroborated by the municipalities to express the
importance of the participation of UNICEF, due to the high level of credibility that
It has, which is valued as a plus for the CAI program, and encourages the
participation of municipal mayors in the certification process, without
However, it presents problems of definition in the subject of sustainability of
model.
In the case of efficiency, understood as the extent to which
resources/supplies (funds, specialization, time, equipment, among others.)
Converted into results, weaknesses are observed regarding offices resource
specialized in NNA issues in local governments, since 60% of the total
CAI participating municipalities do not have an instance of this type after
contest. Weaknesses in monitoring systems and
Evaluation for participating cantons that allow accounts of the results
in terms of progress of the rights of the NNA.
A positive finding in terms of efficiency is the availability of resources
economic, human and material from national institutions
belonging to the CAI Secretariat, for the execution of the program, which is
accompanies a regulatory framework, and the prestige of UNICEF, which is
valued very positively by certified municipalities and not
certified. Another aspect is the achievement of the articulation between local actors for
carry out specific NNA actions in the cantons, which allows the
maximization of resources.
To end in sustainability, it is found that in the case of CAI,
They faced serious difficulties for this to happen. Low levels were found
associated with the characteristics of municipal management, to the management of the
political-strategic communication of the Technical Secretariat addressed to the actors
premises throughout the process, to shortcomings in central and local mechanisms
of monitoring of the initiative and the way in which the political-electoral dynamics
It crosses the cantonal life.
2
With the above globally it can be concluded that the CAI program is a
Highly relevant initiative for the current Costa Rican context, with low
levels of efficiency, efficiency and sustainability, since there were important shortcomings in
the consideration of municipal realities, in political communication-
strategic of the central level of coordination of the program, as well as in the weak
National and local monitoring and evaluation culture for initiatives of this
nature.
The recommendations are raised by actors and by deadlines, being the criterion
of sustainability the one that had the most weight in their elaboration, the above by
how much is in the process of launching CAI II.
In general, it is desired to underline that the context of the pandemic by the covid-
19 and the one who comes later, must be considered as a transverse axis that
Define the entire CAI strategy in this second certification, being that people
minors are being one of the groups most hit by this crisis
World Cup, both in terms of the impact on its integral development and in the sphere
of the loss of rights.

Introduction
This corresponds to the final report of the evaluation of the “Cantones Program
Friends of Childhood ”, proposal of UNICEF-Costa Rica inspired and registered in the
International Initiative Friendly cities of childhood.
The friends friends of Childhood (CAI) focus on promoting, promoting and
execute a strategy at the local level of political, technical actions,
administrative and financial that guarantee the full exercise of the rights of the
childhood and adolescence, guide their actions to the fulfillment and application of the
values and principles of: respect, integrity, solidarity, commitment, loyalty and
inclusion. This initiative represents a stimulus to advance protection
Integral of childhood and adolescence at the local level, and offers a strategic route
to local governments to develop the certification process such as CAI that
It works for the well -being and integral development of childhood.
The evaluation was aimed to take a balance of the implementation of the
CAI program and determine its contribution to childhood policies and
adolescence. It was also sought to establish recommendations for the improvement of the
Program and its scaling throughout the country.
Specifically:
► Determine the added value of the program for the cantons and their
Contribution to promote public policies for childhood and adolescence.
► Establish program performance in the 32 cantons, determine your
strengths and weaknesses and eventual areas of improvement.
► Establish good practices and lessons learned from the first phase of the
implementation of the CAI, as well as generate recommendations for a
eventual second phase of the program.
► Determine how the CAI should be incorporated into the new structure of the
Ifam and collect concrete proposals for this incorporation.
It is an external final evaluation, of formative nature, with elements
summatives of qualitative and quantitative processes and results. In addition, a
Starting from the information collected and analyzed, recommendations will be given about
of the logic of the theory of change, the improvement of the management and taking processes of
decisions regarding the implementation and future sustainability of the CAI program.
The main purpose of the evaluation of the Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program
It is learning and knowledge generation. This has been implementing
Since 2012 and 32 cantons have already achieved certification, so it is necessary
Make a balance to establish the achievements and challenges found to date,
and perform a reflexive exercise about its value for the development of childhood policies
and adolescence in the face of possible scaling at 50 missing cantons and
need to achieve sustainability.
4
The evaluation is also timely, since the IFAM has gone through a process
of restructuring and has a new work scheme, and seeks to assess the
programs that are in charge, to establish work priorities. Also
It seeks to establish in which work area (s) of the IFAM the CAI and
that the latter can adapt to the new IFAM scheme.
The CAI program arises on November 1, 2012, when the government
Costa Rican declares the related actions by public interest
With the implementation of the Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program Decree No.
37383. This indicates that “the Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program is a reference
Costa Rican in terms of guarantee of children's and adolescence rights that have
In order to strengthen the participation of local governments and
cantonal actors, in alliance with the national institutions promoting the
rights of childhood and adolescence to generate political conditions,
institutional and actions aimed at the development of a childhood protective environment
and adolescence in communities throughout the country. ”
On this same date, a letter of intentions between UNICEF Costa Rica is signed
and the Ministry of Decentralization and Local Development - Institute of Development and
Municipal Advice (IFAM) to contribute to the development of the joint program
"Cantones friends of childhood", with 4 main objectives:
a) Concert and implement joint action proposals that allow
consolidate in their territories a local governance system committed to the
fulfillment of the rights of childhood and adolescence taking into account the
approach and recommendations issued by the United Nations in the matter of
promotion and defense of human rights.
b) Support the definition and implementation at the local level of public policies
inclusive, relevant, participatory, equitable and with rights approach, which
emphasize vulnerable populations to different forms of violence and
exclusion, such as childhood and adolescence.
c) Contribute to the prevention and reduction of violence, the promotion of peace
and the generation of spaces and conditions that facilitate the organization and
participation for the full exercise of the rights of children and
teenagers.
d) contribute to the search for resources for the effective surveillance and compliance
of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Nations, Standards and
national laws that compromise institutionality and civil society with
The recognition and protection of the rights of children and adolescents.

1. Background and context.
The following section presents the general context of the intervention that
originates and justifies the evaluation of the program, based on the elements of the analysis
of the international, country, institutional context and the regulatory framework.
1.1 Context of the intervention.
The infantilization of poverty, domestic violence, improper relationships,
The abandonment of the educational system is part of the problems that are not,
only a simple statistical issue; It is not about problems resulting from
The use of indicators too sensitive to the subject, nor are they a difficulty
that can be resolved from a set of measures that are instructed to
through a specific program. All these social problems
contemporaries who afflict childhood and adolescence are a manifestation
of the relationships that govern our societies, based on type situations
structural.
Inequality conditions people's access to opportunities and
capacities, therefore, public policies become a tool
fundamental and irreplaceable to reverse these processes, and their actions must
cover people's life cycle. When talking about equality, it refers to
Equality of media, opportunities, capacities and recognition. Within that
life cycle, the centrality of childhood and adolescence is documented and are
known future impacts on investment at that stage. You can't, so
so much, move towards equality without having directed quality policies
To childhood and adolescence, which redistribute resources, enhance options
of acquiring capacities and, ultimately, they improve the well -being of childhood and
adolescence and its future possibilities.
Hence the social transformations faced by countries have
brought changes in the way the states are managed public policy,
making greater awareness that the future of countries is to provide in the
childhood and adolescence development opportunities, which will be
determinant to increase the possibilities of social mobilization, overcoming
poverty and decrease in gender gaps.
Policies and actions in childhood and adolescence specifically
They are one of the greatest bets towards the decrease of social gaps, which
They have made the most developed countries.
7
In the CAI approach as a promoter of Cantonal Public Policies it is
important from the country context where the
program:
Costa Rica, is considered a country of medium high income, which has experienced
a sustained economic growth in the last 25 years. In development issues
Human the country improved its position in the human development index, went from
69 to 63 between 2010 and 2017, product of which it is one of the countries of America
Latin with the highest health indicators; almost universal access to services
health, pension and primary education and low levels of extreme poverty. This
Social progress is the result of the social contract of Costa Rica that dates back to
1940 and that includes a history of social and labor protection.
In population terms, according to data from the Ministry of Health (2019), among the
years 2014 and 2018, the population of Costa Rica increased by approximately
Two hundred thirty thousand people, however, that population increase has gone to a
increasingly slow rhythm, approaching, to a person for one hundred inhabitants. To the
Analyze the trend of the rate of the last twenty years, it is observed how year
For year, there is a slowdown in growth, which is the result of
changes in the components of population dynamics, fertility and
mortality.
“Children and adolescents represent 31% of the total population
of 5 million inhabitants. Of minors, three of each
ten are in the range of 0-5 and 6-12 years, while the remaining 40%
They are between 13 and 17 years old. The country is reaching the end of its dividend
demographic with an increasingly aged population, which will bring a
gradual increase in dependency rates, and thus, greater challenges on the
education and care during childhood and the elderly., Compared
With three decades ago, childhood of the country today enjoys better
opportunities for survival, development and protection as a result
of universal and focused social protection programs "
(UNICEF, 2019, p. 20).
When the population at the most productive ages (between 18 and 45 years) grows more
quickly that the population in dependent ages is known as “bonus
demographic ”, this is reflected as a bulge in the population pyramid between
18 and 45 years.
In social terms Costa Rica, it has been characterized by being a social state of
Law, with high levels of education, being free and mandatory since 1869,
According to data from the 2011 census, the literacy rate is 97.6%, in addition
health services with access and the effective and timely use of them: “in
Comparison with three decades ago, Costa Rican childhood today enjoys today
better opportunities for their survival, development and protection such as
8
result of universal and focused social protection programs "
(UNICEF, 2019, p. 20).
“In 2017, the Government guaranteed high levels of investment in the sector
social, representing about 24% of the total investment
investment and where, approximately 27% of social spending
total public corresponds to the health sector, 32.39% in
education, 29.84% in social protection, 9.56% in housing and
0.87% in recreational, cultural and religious activities. Without
However, the increase in fiscal problems (sector debt
public in 2017 was equivalent to 49% of GDP) and the inefficiencies of the
sector expenditure can affect the country's capacity to
hold their social investment levels ”(UNICEF, 2019, p. 21).
However, challenges persist how to overcome the problem of relative poverty and
inequality. Although the incidence of absolute poverty (measured by
General using a threshold of 1.9- 2.5 or 4 US $ per day) is low. Relative poverty
It has not been reduced despite the solid economic growth of recent years. The
Official poverty rate for 2017, based on an absolute threshold is more or
less than a decade ago, although the available income of the
Households grew almost 60% in the period. Poverty concentrates among families
More numerous, especially those who have boys and girls. Households with
women head of family and older adults also face high
Poverty risks (OECD, 201).
“Despite the important advances registered in the social sector and
the existence of several poverty reduction programs, in the
2018, 20% of the population is still poor. The index is greater
in rural areas (26%) that in urban areas (19%), and according to
an analysis carried out by the State of the Nation in its report of the
2018, if monetary transfers will be eliminated, poverty
Extreme would increase by 4.2 percentage points and total by 2.8. He
34% of total children and adolescents live in poverty
monetary, of which 12% live in extreme poverty, while
that 34.4% suffer multidimensional deprivations related to
Poverty, which raises the challenge of getting any boy or girl
He stays behind, especially those most vulnerable boys and girls
They live in rural areas and in coastal and border communities, and
They belong mainly to indigenous populations,
Afro -descendants and migrants, as well as boys and girls with
Disability ”(UNICEF, 2019, p. 20).
9
Another of the challenges is the development in early childhood is marked by
Socio -economic and cultural variables, at national level 81 % of children and
Girls from 3 to 4 years enjoy an adequate level of physical, emotional and emotional development
intellectual, this percentage increases to 93 % in the richest houses and
decreases to 69 % in the poorest households (UNICEF, 2019, p. 22).
At that level, several strategies have been established, such as the increase in
The registration rate in preschool teaching increased that from 27.2 % in
2002 to 84.5 % in 2018 (UNICEF, 2019). In addition, since 2010, it was established
the National Care
an impulse to municipal cecudis, which have had a disparate development
depending on the effectiveness of the municipalities to administer these spaces.
“Despite the solid performance in primary education that
characterizes the country, the quality of learning processes and
Teaching as such constitute a challenge. In secondary education,
In 2017, 43.3 % of adolescents do not complete the
Secondary education due to elevated abandonment rates
school and repetition, despite infrastructure improvements
Physical, teaching methodologies and curricula. He
educational performance of the most vulnerable boys and girls
It shows the existing challenges in achieving the objective of the
Educational inclusion. According to a study conducted in 2016, by
example, migrant or indigenous children were twice as
probabilities of not being schooled - 24 % and 20 %,
respectively - that non -migrant or non -indigenous children - 12
% for both. Also, the percentage of children with and without
without school disability began to stabilize, with 14 % and
12 %, respectively, compared to 29 % and 19 % of
2000. The percentage of adolescents in rural areas attending
Secondary School (83 %) is less than that of their classmates
Urban (91 %) ”(UNICEF, 2019, p. 23).
On the other hand, the Survey of Women, Children and Adolescents (EMNA), made in
The year 2018 shows challenges in child violence, 49% of people
minors from 1 to 14 years, experienced the use of violent methods, already
either for psychological aggression or physical punishment by people
Caregoras, and 3% experienced severe physical punishment (INEC, 2019).
Although teenage pregnancy has been decreasing and distribution
relative of birth births shows an increase in
births in mothers between 25 and 39 years. Between 1997 and 2017
births of mothers under 20 years decreased by 33.0 %, while
10
that the group of 35 to 39 years was the one that presented the highest percentage of births
(Ministry of Health, 2019).
In relation to other sexual and reproductive health issues, the emna,
He points out that 10% of women aged 15 to 19, are married or in free union,
and 11% reported having sex with a couple 10 years older or more.
In the line of mental health and access to employment by the population
Adolescent, UNICEF's annual report, of 2018, says:
“That suicide in adolescence represents the third cause of
death among adolescents aged 15 to 19, and in communities
Indigenous the quadruplica. To these barriers to development are added
inadequate educational and professional alternatives for
adolescents without schooling, high unemployment rates and
alcohol abuse and other substances (50 % in schools). In it
2017, the population aged 15 to 24 who do not study or work passed
from 20.3 % in 2000 to 15.5 % in 2017, yes, with respect to the
2016, you can see an increase of 1.8 percentage points. The
employment situation of young people is under conditions
precarious in the country. In this population, male unemployment is
of 17.5 % and 31.8 % in the case of women, which entails a
Gender gap about 14.3 %”(UNICEF, 2019, p. 25).
1.2 Situation of childhood and adolescence in
Cai cantons
In the next section a comparison is made between the CAI cantons, from
of the welfare index of childhood and adolescence (Ibina) 2013, made of
Joint form between Mideplan and Unicef, which measures the "well -being" of childhood and
adolescence geographically in the 477 populated districts of the country and
the 81 cantons, from the information of the Population Census of 2011. The
index classifies the districts and cantons of the country in three levels of well -being: greater,
medium and lower, in relation to information process, material conditions and
Home and admission environment.
Figure 1 shows the distribution according to the Ibina of the Cai cantons, in
Where 3% have high well -being, 34% of cantons have well -being
higher, 31% average well -being, 22% minor well -being and 10% low well -being.

As can be noted, the certification process had small municipalities,
medium and large. Differences are determined by development indices
urban and population, economic and social, which show important
asymmetries and gaps among the participating municipalities, for example,
Talamanca with an Ibina of 4.68 upla of 12.89 and La Cruz 19.79, on the other hand,
Bethlehem with 100, Escazú with 92, 28 and Moravia with 91.12.
The analysis of municipal development establishes abysmal inequalities between
some metropolitan urban cantons and others located in the rurality of the country.
The findings of Ibina, in relation to childhood and adolescence, put in
Evidence inequality between the metropolitan world and the periphery. But I know
further disaggregates the analysis, also within urban spaces they are created
ASIMETRÍAS: In the large metropolitan area they border high -rate cantons of ibina
with which it exhibits the most vulnerable conditions, such as Escazú
and Alajuelita. Inequality is also given between rural cantons with each other and even
with relative geographical vicinity: in this regard it is possible to point out the extremes that
They represent in the province of Guanacaste the cantons of Nandayure and La Cruz or
Well in the province of Alajuela the cantons of the Chiles and Alajuela Centro.
"For example, for the canton of Talamanca" according to ministry data
Public education in 2018, Talamanca has 74 centers
primary education educational, 12 educational centers
Secondary Education and 1 Agricultural Technical College located in
Bibri. However, studies conducted suggest that the level
Average schooling does not reach complete primary and only
In the district of Cahuita the primary is to be completed. The case more
critic is the Bratsi district includes a part of communities not
indigenous who could be covering a worse reality in
This population. In these territories illiteracy reaches 30%
in the bribris and in the Cabécar up to 50%. According to studies
made Talamanca is one of the first cantons where
They present the greatest amount of pregnancies in girls or adolescents,
This product of violations according to the idiosyncrasy of the indigenous ”
(Ministry of Public Security, 2019, P10).
Which is highly contrasting with the canton of Bethlehem that for the same year
2018, a 100%primary enrollment rate is presented, in high school
85.5% and global of 89.1% and a literacy rate of 98.7%.
In the Costa Rican legal-administrative system, municipalities have
A relevant role in the management and administration of local interests and services.
In the case of the Costa Rican state, as a unit state, there is an organization
simple territorial, since, it is divided into seven provinces, being that each
14
province is subdivided into cantons and these, in turn, in districts (article 168,
paragraph 1, of the Constitution). In Costa Rica, there is a direct relationship between
canton and municipality, since, for each canton it exists, necessary and
Automatically, a municipality. Currently, they exist in the national territory
eighty -two cantons and, consequently, eighty -two municipalities.
The competence of the territorial nature of the municipalities, by
Consequently, it is the respective canton. The cantons, according to the Constitution only
can be created by means of a reinforced law, approved by two thirds of the
totality of the members of the Legislative Assembly (article 168, paragraph in fine,
of the Constitution). The best criteria to define have not always been used,
Territorially, a canton, on the other hand, in the Costa Rican municipal organization
We found a municipal asymmetry, since there are completely cantons
Spit and, therefore, different municipal governments and administrations.
Which makes the intervention in childhood and adolescence very complex in
The large cantons, which was mentioned in an interview for the order
of social issues in the Municipality of San Carlos, which is the canton of greatest
Extension of the 82, with 3347.98 km, exceeding the provinces of
Carthage and Heredia.
Another example of hires with the cantons of Belén and Talamanca, the first
They have a person exclusively to address the issue of childhood and adolescence,
With an approximate population of 22,530 inhabitants located at 5.201 homes
occupied, versus the second canton, with a population of 42,351habitants, and
where 11 irregular settlements are recorded, and they only have one person
assigned to the Women's Office, and as a surcharge it covers the actions in Children and
adolescence.
The above, raises great challenges for the local development of the country, in terms of
Distribution of resources, local governments require a redefinition of their
role and its competences. Therefore, it must be a parallel process to a policy
Explicit of political and managerial strengthening and of those public instances and
private, community organizations, companies, society organizations
civil at the local level.
Prior to the year of CAI start, the municipalities developed few actions in
matter of childhood and adolescence, for example the Municipal Code, establishes in the
Article 170 and articles 13 subsection c) and article 62, the possibility of granting
municipal scholarships to the students of the territorial jurisdiction of the canton, with
the purpose of supporting the intellectual, social, economic, cultural and spiritual development of the
student, and thus promote the social mobilization that represents the
Education in our Costa Rican society.
15
In addition, article 75 of the Childhood and Adolescence Code establishes that
municipal corporations will establish the necessary policies and execute the
relevant actions to facilitate, to minors, the spaces
appropriate at the community and national level, that allow them to exercise their rights
recreational and cultural. In article 96 it establishes that municipalities
will raise an annual census of minors who work on their own in their
jurisdiction and refer it to the Board of Trustees for its competence, in article 179
The same code is established by the creation of child protection boards and
adolescence, attached to the PANI, but with municipal representation, through the
Article 181 The tutelary committees of the rights of children and the
adolescence as organs of communal development associations.
The antecedent in the field of social policies was the incursion into the issue of
Gender with creation in 1999, of the Municipal Offices of Women (Off),
promoted by the center for the development of women and family (CMF),
which were present in all Cai municipalities.
Since 1999, the (CMF) today INAMU promoted local attention networks and
prevention of violence against women and domestic violence, and that in the
year 2008 by law of the system in its article 13, they are established by law in each
one of the cantons of country in a mandatory way and are made up of
representatives of government institutions that have local presence and,
voluntarily, by representatives of organizations not
governmental and civil actors who wish to integrate. The gender issue
presents a fortress from the municipal code in its article 4, which states that
local public policies must be promoted for the promotion of rights and
Citizenship of women, in favor of equality and gender equity.
Some of the office with the passage of time were transformed into offices of
Social Development or Social Development Management, however, most follow
being unipersonal and assuming more functions in the attention of: people
older adults, disability, street inhabitants, intermediation of
employment and care networks of minors and older adults.
In a special audit made by the CGR in 2017, of the
social programs executed by the municipalities of Alajuela, Carthage,
Curridabat, Escazú, Limón and Santa Ana; for the care of children and adult care
older, employment intermediation, women's care, entrepreneurship,
Student scholarships, among others; which are oriented to populations in
conditions of poverty, vulnerability or social exclusion, it was determined that no

16
precise monitoring and evaluation in order to improve the opportunity and
content of these programs and promote improvements in programs efficiency
In addition, weaknesses in design and conformation were determined
(CGR, 2018).
Hence the urgency from the municipal world to generate adequate governance
that allows citizens to feel well informed, with the ability to demand
accountability, with projects that claim their interests and identities,
with actions that favorably impact the quality of life and that are
effective actions to combat exclusion, inequality and poverty, that is
contributed to governance understood as efficiency, effectiveness and legitimacy
of government action against its citizenship. The critical signaling of
centralism as a limiting should either lead to think that the alternative for
Generating development conditions is exhausted with the strengthening of
Local governments.
This is necessary, but not enough. The matter is not reduced to "municipalization"
of development, it must be considered equally dynamic, active and with
Incidence capacity to other local actors: citizenship and their organizations
and various forms of expression.
It is also urgent, that the CGR, through the area of control of
Services for local development, and the criteria of the integrated system of
Municipal Management (SIIM), can the comptroller of the social programs of the
municipalities, so that human and material resources are assigned, and
In addition to supervising the effective and efficient execution of the programs.
1.3 Regulatory Framework
The Political Constitution of Costa Rica guarantees the right to live free of
discrimination, and is related to the supreme guarantee of equality. Protection
most important of non -discrimination in our legal system is
in constitutional article 33, which reads: “Every person is the same before the law and not
discrimination may be practiced contrary to human dignity ”(article
33, Political Constitution). The Constitutional Chamber has determined that the principle of
equality is a guiding principle of our constitutional democracy and permeates everything
The political and legal system, not only in its subjective, but objective dimension.
The country has distinguished itself by signing and ratifying all agreements and conventions
aimed at recognizing human rights inherent to all people without
distinction of nationality, ethnicity, age, sex, origin, beliefs, opinions,
17
social strata, sexual orientation and gender identity, among others, as
It is recorded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Instruments
international for the advancement of equality.
With the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and
With the entry into force of the Code of Children and Adolescents in 1998,
It may consider that there is their own right for people in the country
minors, which is part of the doctrine of integral protection,
and contemplates an amount of specific rights for minor people from
18 years, in accordance with their status as developing people and as such
holders of special protection.
In that sense, CAI constitutes a program with a global scope that is based,
primarily, in a universal instrument of legal order, which is the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which, in general, being a treaty
international that recognizes the rights of minors,
assumes as subjects of law, promoting rupture with positioning
adultocentrist with which humanity has been operating for thousands of
years. In the world, only the United States and Somalia have not ratified that
Convention. As of 1990 when the Convention was promulgated, various
countries have generated legal instruments to specify compliance.
When Cai enters to work in Costa Rica, the country had a regulatory framework
existing and a governing institution in the matter of childhood and adolescence, which is the
National Childhood Board, created since 1930, so that the theme of
The rights of childhood and adolescence were not oblivious to national discussion,
However, the challenge of compliance in the realities faced by these
Populations is significant, even today.
The responsibility that falls to the State is undeniable, not only of the promotion of
the rights of children and adolescents, but also of protection and
finally the recovery of those who have been mistreated or abandoned, for
which must take the necessary measures, both legislative and
administrative, to the maximum of its budgetary possibilities.
There is a national comprehensive protection system, which is established in the
CNA and that is composed of the National Council of NNA, people from the
civil society, childhood protection boards and guardianship committees.
The National Council of Children and Adolescents, creates in 2008 a commission
Formed by the rectory of the social sector and fight against poverty, Mideplan,
PANI, the Coordinator of Social Organizations for the Defense of Rights of the
Children and adolescents (harodeni), and the central movement of
Costa Rican workers (CMTC), which has the vision support
18
World, Uniprin and Unicef. The National Council of NNA in turn, is attached
To the Executive Power, constituting a space of “deliberation, consultation
Coordination between the Executive Power, the decentralized institutions of the State
and the representative organizations of the community related to the subject "
(National Council of Children and Adolescents, 2009, p. 59). Its primary function
is linked to the guarantee that the public policies that are generated are of
in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive protection system. As I know
warned before, there are also protection boards and local subsystems of
protection.
This commission was given the responsibility of designing the “national policy of
Childhood and adolescence, 2009-2021. ”According to the United Nations Fund for the
Childhood (2009), National Policy for Children and Adolescents proposes:
[…] Guarantee the full exercise of the rights of childhood and
adolescence of the country, in a framework of democratic coexistence,
by creating conditions, mechanisms and opportunities
so that the rights of all children and
adolescents, taking into account the best interest, autonomy
progressive and participation in the different stages of development and
In family, school, community and social environments in which
they develop […]. (p.19)
In February 2006, the National Children's Board of Trustees with the support of the Fund
of the United Nations Childhood (UNICEF), presented a proposal
called “National Policy of Children and Adolescents 2006-2016” (PNNA), the
which had as input the first policy presented by the PANI, in coordination
With the National University in 2005. On September 9, 2009, the
President Oscar Arias Sánchez signs the 2009-2021 policy, defined as the “[…]
long -term political framework, establishes the strategic direction of the State
Costa Rican in the effective promotion, respect and guarantee of human rights
of all children and adolescents […] ”(National Council of Children and
Adolescence, 2009, p.19).
Five instances appear as co -author of this: rectory of the social sector and
fight against poverty (government of Costa Rica); Mideplan, Pani, advice
National Children and Adolescents and UNICEF. Politics is built
Around six strategic axes:
1. Democratic institutionality.
2. Person, family and community.
3. Integral health.
4. Education.
19
5. Culture, game and recreation.
6. Special protection.
The PNNA also establishes six commitments, which are:
1. The immediate and direct application of the Convention in the
Jurisdictional and administrative procedures.
2. The readjustment of the legal framework.
3. The obligation to periodically inform about the situation of
Rights of children and adolescents.
4. The dissemination and promotion of rights (to the community and the
minors, particularly).
5. The active participation of children and adolescents in the
exercise of its citizenship.
6. The definition of specific public policies in this
subject.
Source: National Childhood and Adolescence Policy, 2009, p.17.
Other of the instances that have a fundamental role in achieving
CAI certification is the local protection subsystem that is defined as the level
local or community base of the National System of Comprehensive Protection or Central Level,
which is defined by article 169 of the Code of Children and Adolescents. He
Local protection subsystem is legally supported by the Childhood Code and
adolescence, and also constitutes as a local mechanism for
that the National Council of Children and Adolescence can respond to the
coordination of policies with communal instances (National Council of the
Childhood and adolescence, 2011, p.31).
Next, illustration 1 shows pyramidal levels, in which the state
Costa Rican has given signs of continuous effort for the issue of defense
and the best interests of the rights of childhood and adolescence, considering
different spaces of action: political, institutional and normative. The
need to capture, indeed, a comprehensive protection system that
respond, properly, to the different and heterogeneous needs of the
minors, considering the universality of rights, more
beyond the differences that exist in the economic, social, political, ethnicity, ethnicity,
Age, gender and conceptions about the world and life. In short, difficult task
but indispensable to move towards an appropriate country for boys, girls
and adolescents of the present and future generations.

2.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION
23
The Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program (name with which it is known in
Costa Rica), is an initiative, globally promoted by UNICEF for three
decades, his first steps were taken in 1992 in Dakar, Senegal,
When the rights of boys and girls were incorporated as
Part of the fulfillment of local governments, which was known as “mayors
children's defenders. ”
The above constituted the preamble of what would be in 1996 the emergence of the
Childhood Cities Program during the Nations Conference
Together with human settlements, Habitat II, made in Istanbul, Türkiye,
to transform cities into more habitable places for everyone, and in
particular for children and adolescents. In this conference
They recognized trends such as the rapid transformation and urbanization of
global societies, decentralization contexts and growing importance
of cities in national economic and political systems. In this
context, the conference declared that the well -being of childhood is an indicator
fundamental of a healthy habitat, a democratic society and a good
Government established the “well -being of childhood as an indicator of an environment
Healthy, democratic and with good governance ”(UNICEF, 2018).
UNICEF defines the CAI initiative as a good local system
governance committed to compliance with the rights of
Boy and the girl. A community where voices, needs,
priorities and rights of childhood are an integral part of policies
public, programs and decisions is a city for all (UNICEF,
2019, p.2).
Friendly cities of childhood, was created and led by UNICEF International,
in which national governments, local administrations, NGOs collaborate, between
others. A childhood friendly city has as fundamental pillars the design
of effective public policies that are based on the Convention on Rights
of the child, the promotion of child and adolescent participation and the impulse of
Alliances among all actors related to childhood at the municipal level.
The initiative was born with the following slogan:
The vision of childhood friendly cities is that every boy, girl and
teenager must enjoy her childhood and youth and develop everything
its potential through the equal realization of their rights in
Its cities and communities. In order to realize this vision,
Local governments and their partners identify their goals (results)
In the five spheres of general objectives, which collect the rights
24
contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNICEF,
2018).
In Latin America its adaptation to the context and realities of the countries of the
region dates from ten years ago. Being present in at least six countries
Latin American: Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay and Colombia, according to
UNICEF data, have CAI -based programs and these experiences have been
implemented in territories in which about 50 million children live
and adolescents (UNICEF, 2019). The initiative aims to support
local governments in the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child (CDN), as well as contributing to better coordination and collaboration between
Social actors for adequate attention to childhood needs.
In general, CAI proposes to give recognition or award of a
Seal, to the participating municipalities, on performance indicators in
dimensions related to the situation of childhood or the principles of the
CDN, within the scope of governments or local administrations, which has as a
Key feature Being an initiative for commitment or pact of progress in indicators
related to childhood.
In Costa Rica, the program began with the impulse of recognition for
Cantones of the country that was known as "Cai I recognition", and was conceived
as an instrument to support children's and adolescence policies,
with criteria for participation, planning and management management. It was promoted
as an additional stimulus for the development of initiatives protected in the
process of the cantonal councils of inter -institutional coordination and
Local protection subsystems, both structuring elements of the
Public policies in integral protection of childhood and adolescence and
Strengthening of local governments.
Next, the 4 main objectives of the CAI program are presented in the country
and illustration 2 its 5 pillars:
a) Concert and implement joint action proposals that allow
consolidate in their territories a committed local governance system
with the fulfillment of the rights of childhood and adolescence taking
In mind the approach and recommendations issued by the United Nations
in terms of promotion and defense of human rights.
b) Support the definition and implementation at the local level of public policies
inclusive, relevant, participatory, equitable and with rights approach,
that emphasize vulnerable populations to different forms of
violence and exclusion, such as childhood and adolescence.
25
c) contribute to the prevention and reduction of violence, the promotion of
peace and the generation of spaces and conditions that facilitate the organization and

3. Change theory.
The theory of change or intervention to refer to context (in
terms of the problem that originates a program, as well as the needs and
opportunities), and the situation is intended to be achieved and what to do to
Make the transition between one and the other. Thus, more realistic goals are drawn,
responsibilities are clarified.
The "theory of change" explains how it is understood that activities
produce a series of results that contribute to achieving impacts
planned ends. Can be developed for any level of intervention, already
It is an event, a project, a program, a policy, a
strategy or an organization. It is possible to develop a theory of change:
When the objectives and activities of an intervention can
identify and plan in advance in advance, or when such
intervention adapts to new problems and the decisions of the
Associates and other interested parties (Roogers, 2014, p.1).
Although there was no explicitly raised program theory, without
however there were elements for their construction, the
following inputs: documentary review, workshop with the secretary's people
CAI technique and people who had participated in the execution of the strategy
and interviews with key people.
On a first level according to diagram 2, agents can be identified that
intervene in the process which are located on two levels and under the logic of a
Multi level governance process, where they identify: the national grouped in
The technical secretary which is made up of UNICEF, Ifam, Pani offices
Centrals, Mideplan and Harodeni, and the place where two agents stand out
main that municipalities and local PANI offices, in some
Cantons made alliances with other instance with a less leading role in
The development of the program at the local level.
At first, UNICEF functions were focused on the phase of
design and promotion of the program, later in strengthening coordination
inter -institutional, achieving for the first time establish a dialogue between the IFAM and the
Pani, where the first had competitions at the municipal sphere and the second in
The rectory in childhood and adolescence, once this alliance has been strengthened
they worked in the accompaniment to the municipalities through actions of

training and advice and in a third moment in the evaluation processes and the
Granting of recognition.
The second level functions were focused on premises that where
First instance the alliance in the PANI and the municipalities was strengthened, according to
The interviews conducted during the evaluation exercise can be affirmed that there is
an alliance with a historical coordination work between the two instances,
Through child protection and adolescence boards and local networks
of attention and prevention of domestic violence and towards women, and
They mention that from work in the CAI program, the
actions and the link is strengthened, in order to carry out actions in favor of the
childhood and adolescence.
Diagram 3 shows as determining factors that the country has with a framework
robust regulatory in the field of protection and defense of the population of NNA, by
another part, the conception of the program as a multi -level governance model,
With an important economic contribution from both UNICEF and IFAM in the stage
of design and implementation, which was complemented by the PANI in 2017,
with the financial support to the municipalities in the field of infrastructure,
Childhood and adolescence policies, and citizen participation activities.
Within the obstacles addressed by the program, they can be mentioned:
inequalities of municipalities due to their territory and capacity
Budget, in addition to venturing into little traditional actions
for municipalities, and for which not all had the technical capacity and
human for the work involved in the program.
On the other hand, diagram 4 of the results chain raises the relationship between
Inputs, activities, products and services and effects and impacts. And in case of
CAI program, it can be ensured that it was conceived with a clear logic of
causality, and a clear definition of results, which allowed him to make a
Technical assessment when granting recognition.
In terms of supplies as already mentioned, the strong investment in
Financial resources from IFAM and UNICEF, which was key to the
Program development, started from elements such as diagnosis and baseline, which
They gave him solidity and the indicators to measure, in addition to the framework
robust regulatory, which guarantees a guideline for compliance with the rights of
The minor population.
In the case of activities, both activities were developed at the level of the
national and local, an aspect that all people interviewed indicate
It is the importance of creating articulation spaces between the different
instances, which favors the governance model.
37
It could be verified in the evaluation process the fulfillment of the activities the
which were also developed in three levels of beneficiary population of
part of UNICEF towards state institutions in negotiation processes and
of joint promotion, and strengthening of IFAM on NNA issues,
National institutions towards the strengthening of municipal instances to
the development of work plans in the field of NNA, and finally of the
Municipalities and the Pani at the local level, for the population of children and
teenagers directly and indirectly to parents, mothers and
Teaching staff of educational centers.
During interviews of the evaluation process to municipal and pani personnel
local level and in the workshops with a minor population that I participate in the
Cai activities in each of the cantons, it was determined that the vast majority
of participation actions was focused on the captive population that attended
to diurnal educational centers.
In a general balance of the products obtained, the percentage of cantons that
They finished the process was 86.5%, and the remaining 13.5% according to interviews
made, they failed to present the papers on time and because of that they did not
granted certification.
A positive aspect of the products is the sensitivity of the staff of the
municipalities and the passion with which the subject was assumed, however, a factor
very complex that influenced the achievement of the impact and sustainability of the program
It is the political variable in the IFAM (where from 2017 to 2019
He continued the process) and in some municipalities when changing
Administration The program was lost, not achieving results at the effect of effects and
Impacts.
In terms of the participation of childhood and adolescence in a few cantons
NNA beneficiary population mentioned that they have felt taken into account
In decision -making and rather they participated in specific activities.
Which represents a challenge in matters of the participation pillar.

Within the framework of the development of the intervention theory, the actors are identified,
also called "stakeholders", which have potential interests regarding a subject U

assessment.
The CAI program generates a diversity of actors by having a multilevel scope. In a
first level are institutions and organizations - at the national level - that
They execute the program, UNICEF, IFAM, PANI, Mideplan and organizations interested in
NNA issues as harodeni, which converge in the figure of a secretary
technique (ST-CAI). In the second level are the municipalities where the
program and that interact at the same time with institutions that participate in local management and
Local Pani offices.
There is also the NNA, they are direct beneficiary population of the actions
executed by local governments and other entities participating in the dynamics of
CAI, “although the program is aimed at municipal authorities, the dynamics of the
processes is an extensive participation of institutions of the canton and government
Central ”(Mideplan and Unicef, 2012, p.24). In that sense, the initial approach of
actors supposes of an adaptation of reality in each canton through entities
of local and communal type, sectoral and institutional with political-technical incidence.
The one of Concepción and Management of the program is by UNICEF for the programmatic and
CAI financing, which represents high power of influence and veto.
For its part, IFAM had a budget and had a link role for alliances
private and public private who, although they are in favor of CAI, have
average power for its role as "allies." In that sense, IFAM has high power of
hierarchy and veto, because before the municipalities it appears as rector in training, which
It is both a transcendental component in the CAI model and its institutionality.
Design and financing represent high -importance supplies for putting
Program march, hence the Hierarchy of power of UNICEF and IFAM. Besides,
Operation and politicians are shared among the rest of the actors. By
Example, Pani is a central actor in generating CAI's political interest because it is the institution

veto power. Political interest is reflected in instruments such as Government Decree
About CAI, in addition to availability of other executive institutions such as Mideplan in

a role in policy planning and elaboration of diagnoses as a contribution in the
CAI operational management only. Work that is strengthened from the
Public Finance Strengthening Law (9365), which covers the municipal sector
Regarding fiscal policy and the performance evaluation criteria of the official
municipal public.
Other management resources include availability of training materials and
website that come from ifam and unicef properly. This validates even more the high
power of both institutions, and shared financing causes a veto power
about the program with the rectory that Pani exercises. The actors on this first level
They carry out the activities proposed by the program to meet their objectives.
For example, UNICEF ordered consultants for the preparation of baselines in
municipalities and IFAM in training-recipient for generation of
tools. Pani for its part influences a large part of the state of the NNA in
Relationship with the protection of their rights.
On a second level, the actors that respond to the expected products of the program
They are the municipalities, which interact with organs-institutions for the achievement of
objects raised in the program. In the figure of local governments are
the municipal councils and mayorships with high veto power and interest to participate; without
However, risks and rivalries due to power struggles in political bodies are
identified. On the other hand, boys, girls and adolescents are people
beneficiaries of the products that the municipality has, although with medium power, but

Participant
In relation to the effects expected by the program, actors at a national level
They are the ones who star in an inter -institutional empowerment and articulation in Children and
adolescence. In that sense, Mideplan, Unicef, Pani, Harodeni, and others stand out
in their role as managers to carry out the activities proposed in the theory of the
intervention, being at the same time receivers of a direct effect to achieve objectives on
NNA issues available to CAI. At the local level there are 2 actors at the effect level:
the municipality and childhood and adolescence as beneficiaries of the actions executed
by the municipality. The effect on municipalities is linked to good practices on issues of
NNA and empowerment of providing human rights approach in childhood and
adolescence, in boys and girls greater participation.
Finally, according to the intervention theory the expected impact of the program has
as central actor to the municipalities. While the program has a scope

Multilevel, the reason for being is directed towards local governments because these are the ones who are

4. Purpose of the evaluation
This is an external evaluation, carried out by an evaluation team contracted and alien to
The implementation of the intervention. The evaluation covered the following aspects:
1. The relevance of the intervention
2. The results generated by the intervention
3. The program design components (intervention theory);
4. Benefit management (consultation of municipalities)
Likewise, this evaluation is expected to provide the elements that allow
know the mechanisms that the program has developed to ensure its
Sustainability for a second CAI certification process.
The evaluation has a double, summative and formative character. Summative, since he seeks
determine to what extent the planned results were achieved and provided
Information about the value of the program to stimulate public policies and initiatives
for childhood and adolescence and for the second CAI certification process. Is
also formative, since it seeks to assess the program to establish the achievements and good
practices, on the one hand, and on the other analyze the areas of improvements and aspects that are
What to strengthen.
Both in the formative and in the summative, the evaluation aims to mean for the
municipalities, a link with new initiatives and reinforcement of the mechanisms so far
implemented for the development of effective municipal policies for the development of
childhood and adolescence.
According to its functionality, it is an evaluation of design, processes and results at the level of
products. Taking as reference the stipulated in the evaluation manual for
Public Interventions of Mideplan (2018) The design evaluation aims to analyze the
Coherence of the program design with the need that originates it (theory of the
intervention). Process evaluation allows us to assess the management and implementation of
The intervention identifying strengths and opportunities for improvement. And with the evaluation
results are determined (desired or not) and allows to assess the changes
generated on the direct beneficiary population.

All components of the CAI program and its 5 pillars were reviewed. The evaluation
covered the program from its design in 2010-2011 to date. The evaluation reviewed
the design and planning processes, their normative and programmatic frameworks, the
implementation in the first 32 cantons, their certification and the period of
Certification monitoring, until the restructuring of the IFAM (years 2017).
The evaluation process included all relevant actors for the implementation of the
program, from national authorities (IFAM, PANI, among others) to
local authorities (municipalities, Cantonal Coordination Councils
Interinstitutional (CCCI), local comprehensive protection subsystems), and consulted others
key actors of the evaluation, such as UNICEF, harodeni, communities and
Children and adolescents of the participating cantons.
Since one of the pillars of the CAI program is the participation of childhood and
adolescence, the evaluation ethically integrated the participation of children
and adolescents, in line with their right to participate and express their opinion in
matters that affect them, as guaranteed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

7.2 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
This section describes the methodological design with which this
assessment. The logic followed by the generation of evidence that
allowed to build valuations referring to the established evaluation criteria, thus
as the work procedures implemented, which account for the
quality and rigor of the information obtained and analyzed.
Before starting it must be clarified that this evaluation has been strongly affected
For several factors the first was the municipal elections, which prologues the beginning of the
process to the month of March, coinciding with the Pandemia for the COVID-19, where it was given
a job in the first instance of adaptation to virtuality and on the other hand people
Informants of the municipalities were committed to primary care to the
Food supply.
The affectation in the information collection process and the
field work in general. Which has implied a series of adjustments to the calendar of the
evaluation that have always been agreed with the counterpart of UNICEF, client
of the evaluation, as well as the adaptation that had to be done of the process
Methodological
.
7.3 General aspects of the methodological strategy
According to Bamberger (2012), this evaluation will be based on what is
Know as a mixed method, since it allows the combination of qualitative techniques and
quantitative, both at the level of collection and information analysis, this
how much it is a complex evaluation not only because of its reach, which is national, but
for the multidimensionality in which the program aspired to work.
There are six main reasons for the use of mixed evaluation designs
Greene, (2005), cited in Bamberger, (2012) which were taken as a reference
In the development of the following methodological proposal:
• Allows the triangulation of the evaluation findings, that is, its
credibility or validity, when comparing the information obtained, through different
Data collection techniques.
• It makes it possible to use the results of a method to help develop the sample
or instruments of another.
53
• Increases the exhaustivity of the evaluation findings and deepens the analysis
done.
• generates new appreciations in the findings of the evaluation through the
results of the different methods that diverge and, in this way, require
of a conciliation through additional analysis, reformulations or a change
In perspective.
• Promote greater awareness regarding the dimensions of the
evaluation values.
This data relationship methodology harmonizes the deductive analysis approach, from
of predefined categories, with an inductive one that leaves space to unplanned elements
in the design of the evaluation and that may arise during interviews in the field,
The above allows to perform an analytical integration that becomes valuations of the
Evaluation judgment with solidity and support in empirical evidence.
This evaluation structured the field work in three phases:
1. Documentary review and analysis
2. Realization of sessions of focus groups, semi -structured and
Online surveys; and (they were performed virtually)
3. Validation of results in workshops with the members of the Secretariat
CAI technique.
For the reasons explained above on pandemic, such phases have been altered
both in temporality and in the modality of application.
7.4 Information collection techniques
One of the purposes of the evaluation process is to have reliable and objective information.
To meet this, as noted before, the combination of techniques was used
qualitative and quantitative, which are detailed below:
7.4.1 Documentary review
For this evaluation, a number of documents have been reviewed, both material
generated by UNICEF, about the CAI program, both in Costa Rica and at the level
international as the one produced by the municipalities; the one who contemplates the whole
Costa Rican regulatory and legal framework, among others.
54
7.4.2 Qualitative techniques
They are recognized for their reach in the deep understanding of a phenomenon or by
relevance for exploration. They are characterized by the inductive analytical process,
because they allow to address a non -linear causality and, especially, because they give rise to
The understanding of subjective senses and meanings of the phenomena for people
and social groups. In the evaluation this type of techniques were of great relevance
They allowed to know the valuations of the beneficiaries of the interventions.
A total of 63 semi -structured interviews organized in accordance have been made
with the evaluation matrix that contains the criteria of the distributed evaluation of the
Next form:

7.4.2.1 Focal groups
In this evaluation, 4 focal groups were carried out with the participation of 10 people
officials of local governments who have not participated in the CAI program or not
They managed to achieve certification (Santo Domingo, Sarcero, Heredia, Osa, runners,
San Carlos, Puriscal, Acosta, San Rafael de Heredia, San José).
7.4.2.2 Participatory workshops
A methodological strategy raised before the pandemic process was the
Workshops in the cantons, however, due to coordination problems
of schedules it was not possible to transfer it to the space of the virtual, so they were made
Interviews Before moving the work to the virtual 5 workshops could be held
face -to -face:
56
The first workshop held was on February 12 of this year, it addressed the
Reconstruction of the program theory with members of the Technical Secretariat of
Cai.
Added to the above, and 4 workshops were held with the participation of the
subsystems before the situation of the health crisis occurred: Talamanca,
Alajuelita Esparza and Bethlehem, with the participation of the people of the childhood system
and adolescence.
7.4.3 Quantitative techniques: the survey
Two online surveys were conducted with municipalities with the following participation:
Municipalities Cai Municipalities No Cai
Total: 32 Total: 50
They replied: 31 answered: 35
7.4.4 Consult the beneficiary population of the program:
Workshops and interviews were held to 40 adolescents and young participants
of the CAI program in the cantons of Santa Ana, Escazú, Buenos Aires, Parrita, Pococí,
Alajuela and Naranjo.
And workshops were held with 75 minor people (NNA), who had not
Participated in the CAI program, of the cantons of San Carlos, San José, Aserrí, Pas,
and Heredia.
7.5. Description of data analysis techniques
Once the data has been collected, through the techniques referred to above,
It has proceeded to its ordering and articulation in a logical and systematic way:
Organize, classify, codify, tabulate, summarize and compare results are part of the
usual data treatment. Data emptying matrices have been used that
They imply the categorical construction that allows the grouping and interrelation of the
information, arriving at the generation of complex evaluation conclusions and
Integrated.
57
8. Evaluation limitations
In a forceful way, the advent of the pandemic for COVID-19 constituted the
more significant limiting for the realization of this evaluation. Implied cancellation
Of all the face -to -face field work, both with adult population and with PME,
that delayed and substantially modified the information collection process.
Derived from the above, there is the fact that it was not possible to make the mass consultation
Nna that had originally thought through a quantitative instrument. This
especially for two reasons: 1. The PME were not in educational centers and 2.
There was a difficulty among the members of the Technical Secretariat about the
possibility and relevance to carry out the survey of NNA virtually, due to the
limitations of the national regulatory framework, as well as that, for the obvious reasons, no
There was a pandemic protocol for these cases.
Subsequently, the consultation by virtual roads to NNA was accepted, however,
The reality of the technological gap and the loss of contact of the
municipalities with the PMEs that had participated in CAI. In this sense, and of form
Very unfortunate, it is expressed that this evaluation reveals the findings of Cai with a
Extremely restricted consultation process with the beneficiary population.
Another limitation is given by the modification of field work, when complying with the
sanitary measures dictated by the Ministry of Health, the evaluation team decided
increase the number of consultations through semi -structured interviews for
Ranked the non -realization of some collective techniques. In that line, the amount of
Information was really abundant, which added to the extension of the deadlines.
This is adding the availability of the personnel to be interviewed, especially that of the
municipalities, since on several occasions the date and time of the
interview because the officials were suddenly occupied in attending
The emergence of pandemic in its canton.
A pre-pandemic aspect that also limited the process, was the low capacity of
management and concretion of the basic requirements that the evaluation team required of the
Technical Secretariat to start field work, being that implied a delay
noun of that phase, communication to municipal authorities on the process
evaluative. Situation that joined the municipal election process.
Finally, the weakness found regarding the absence or shortage of documents
or records of what the municipalities that assumed cai, prevented some
Analysis, above all, for the efficiency criteria.
58
The evaluation team wishes to point out that having performed this evaluation in the middle of the
Pandemia crisis was a huge challenge, both in methodological terms and
Ethics
9. Ethical considerations
Regarding this aspect, a confidential protection of information has been made,
This has been communicated through the informed consent document offered
to the participating people and also mentioned in the initial framework of the
Interviews
In the case of the population of NNA it is in the scenario assessment process
and possibilities for consultation, as long as all rights are protected
that protect them in this matter.
59
10. Evaluation findings:
Next, the findings obtained from the evaluation process from
the questions and evaluation criteria. It is remembered that, in the programmatic evaluation,
The results in the various criteria and dimensions of analysis appear in form
interrelated, as it usually happens in real life, so that some of the

sustainability and thus with the other criteria.
The results are presented as follows: 1-Definition of the criteria. 2-
Presentation of the evaluative question. 3-synthesis of the evaluation judgment. 4-Development
Analytical evidence found.
10.1 Relevance criteria
The relevance criteria is understood as the extent to which the expected results
and the intervention axes are congruent with the priorities of the economic context,
Cantonal Political and Social, with the needs of the direct beneficiary population and
indirect of the program and with the commitments emanating from the development agendas
national and international signed by Costa Rica, in public policies
of children's and adolescence rights and sustainable development objectives.
To what extent did the CAI program take into account the needs of the population
beneficiary in its design and is consistent with the regulatory framework in the matter and
local contexts?
The Cantones Amigos de la Infancy (CAI) program is highly relevant and
responds properly to the country's needs and priorities
of promotion, defense and realization of the rights of childhood and adolescence,
Through the stimulus in the design and implementation of local public policies
effective to improve the well -being of the minor population, defending their
rights, promoting their participation and making the cantons more environments
Friendly, positioning, for the first time in history, the incorporation of topics
of childhood and adolescence in Costa Rican local management.
In this question, the relevance on three levels will be analyzed: alignment
With policies, agreements and initiatives at national and international level, adaptation
from the municipal reality program, and the participation of the instances involved to
national and local level in this.
A first level of relevance is in alignment to the international stage,
responding, as the origin of CAI in Europe, to a commitment to the competition of
60
Territorial authorities in promoting strategies, services and actions
aimed at guaranteeing and restoring the rights of childhood and adolescence in the
local.
According to the documentary review, it could be verified that the program, part of a
both international and national regulatory framework. The following illustration summarizes the
Degree of correspondence of the CAI program with priorities at the country level, in matters
of NNA rights.

A second level of relevance is the adequacy of the program to the municipal reality and
The involvement of various actors, which is considered as a success of CAI,

61
This is ratified by the total of the people interviewed by the institutions
public at the central and local level and municipalities, stating that the CAI program,
It was a visionary commitment of UNICEF Costa Rica and the Ministry of Decentralization and
Local development and the Institute of Municipal Development and Advice (IFAM), when the
need to explore the legal and socio -economic conditions of the country in order to
adapt the CAI program to the national context, with the aim of improving the quality of
life of the children. In this regard one of the interviewed people said that “Cai gives him
a cooler image to that institutionality so boring ”(personal communication,
Pani official, May 2020).
Draws attention to the documentary review of the cantonal policies subscribed between
the years from 2014 to 2016, which refers to the decree as support for the
elaboration of these, so that the political support at the national level seems
constitute an aspect of high value in this type of initiatives.
In the last 20 years, following the changes in the Municipal Code, a
series of strengthening processes of the municipal regime, assuming a paper each
more important in compliance with the obligations of the municipality, in front of the
rights of people and trying to provide increasingly integral services.
The new municipal competitions have emerged especially in the area of
infrastructure. The first approach with social issues occurs with inclusion in
in 1995, in the National Plan for Extra-Family Sex
Action Plan (1996-1998), within the framework of the National Care and Prevention System
of violence against women, where it is introduced to encourage the creation of
Municipal Women's Offices (OFIM).
The office served as a platform from the municipalities to develop actions
in matters of childhood and adolescence. According to the interviews conducted in 29
CAI certified municipalities and in 8 unde certified municipalities, from before
The implementation of the program, the municipalities had been doing specific activities
in matters of childhood and adolescence, but they were never integrated into a plan or with
A vision of the rights approach necessarily.
Two background is visualized in the inclusion of childhood and adolescence issues in the
local spaces. The first, the municipal obligation to carry out a population census
working minor, and the second, the creation of the protection boards of
Childhood and adolescence, both stipulated in the Code of Children and Adolescents of 1998,
However, as indicated by two of the people interviewed around
emergence of the CAI, in many cantons these instances were inactive to the
Moment to start the CAI program.
In that sense, the CAI program came to give a boost to the defense of the rights of
the minor population, giving recognition to local governments, which
They bet on assuming greater responsibilities with civil society, in terms of the
fulfillment of its functions to improve the living conditions of the population
under-age.
62
In the 29 interviews with CAI certified municipalities, they all agree that,
While it is true, efforts were being made in favor of the minor population,
The municipalities did not assume a leading role in the activities of the Boards of
Protection of childhood and adolescence, in addition, that the actions were isolated and without
a articulation in the municipal structure.
Therefore, the CAI program came to stimulate a clear commitment from the government
Central, for giving greater prominence to local governments on little issues
traditional The interviewed people coincide 100 % in which the conception
and the conceptualization of the program and its approach in practice was correct,
overcoming healthcare and short -term approaches.
The interviewed staff said, around the conception of the program, that Cai
built thinking of granting a certification that would recognize the progress of
the municipalities in the matter of childhood and adolescence and, therefore, give them greater
prominence and responsibility to local governments, through the following
points:
1. The investment of economic, human and material resources in childhood and
adolescence, in quantity and quality, as a way for the fulfillment of their
rights.
2.
Adolescence goes hand in hand with municipal development
3. That municipalities must have updated information about the
situation of childhood and adolescence, their needs, demands and the state
of compliance or breach of their rights, to make decisions
successful.
4. The participation of childhood and adolescence must be given from their own
interests and their forms of expression.
5. That the specific actions in favor of childhood and adolescence are adequate,
But they are not enough.
6. That to ensure that the shares, investments and decisions
Take be strategic and sustainable, they must be supported in a vision
Long -term municipal on childhood and adolescence, which must be
contained in a municipal childhood and adolescence policy, serving as a framework
of reference for the development of plans, programs, projects and budgets,
short, medium and long term in the municipality.
A third level at which the program gains in relevance is having made a
Diagnosis on the situation of 25 municipalities in the country (province of San José

February 2012. This process had the general objective of initiating a participatory process
of construction of the social municipal policy that recognized the rights of childhood
and adolescence, with self -assessment capacity and link establishment
effective among central government institutions, autonomous institutions and their
local offices or units.
However, it loses relevance, in relation to the involvement of
Municipalities in the conception of the program and the strategies chosen, in the
interviewed only 3 municipalities claim to have been consulted in the process of

Just as communication came directly from the Mayor's Office.
In that sense, the smallest and rural municipalities indicate that they were given the
same treatment of all, which were not considered the differences in resources
economic and human and that they were all requested by the same requirements not taking
in account the diversity of the municipal world, which is important to take into account in
a second implementation phase.

10.2 Efficacy criteria
The efficacy criteria is understood as the extent to which plans and goods and services
generated in the intervention contribute to the scope of the objectives proposed in the
CAI program. Evaluate CAI's efficacy is to understand the complexity of the
institutionality of the country, both in terms of normative and legal frameworks that
They configure the Costa Rican state as to the capacities, resources and practices
related to institutional management and the combination of both axes. Being one one

unravel its operation and scope constituted one of the greatest challenges of
This evaluation.
What is the level of compliance with the planned results of the program?
The results of the CAI program are aligned with their objectives, which, in turn,
contain the CAI pillars in their operational expression: the intersectoral articulation and
Interinstitutional, regulatory framework, information generation and positioning
political, technical, administrative and financial of NNA at the local level with all actions
and strategies that imply.
The highest degree of compliance corresponds to the construction and/or strengthening of the
Inter -institutional and intersectoral articulation. Lower level of achievement was found for

Punctually, the actions and policies, at the technical, administrative and financial level. Of
way that on these axes is that the findings will be valued. It stands out that the
Financial aspect will be approached in efficiency.
The first thing that must be pointed out is that, at a qualitative level, the CAI program was

Lion. In addition, it is indicated that in the 2014-2018 management report of the PANI, it is mentioned
that the institution supported 33 municipalities in the elaboration of its NNA policies,

The information presented above evidence that, although at the autonomous contrast level
With each category of local government (Cai- no Cai), there are more municipalities do not fall
with a child policy that cai; In the case of the first
PANI financing. This finding is extremely relevant and coincides with the
information collected at the qualitative level, in the sense of the emergence of a kind of
particular awareness and awareness in the case of the cantons registered in the contest,
which led to each municipality to manage its own resources to carry out the
policy.
Despite the above, it should be noted that almost 40% of the Cai no municipalities
He achieved, despite all the impulses and supports of the start of the contest, carrying out this
regulations That speaks of a generalized weakness of the Costa Rican municipal regime,
because the 10 cai municipalities that have failed to finish that process have
Different characteristics: There are rural and urban, with large and populous cantons, thus
as small and without so demographic density, with development indicators
High Human, and others. So that failure seems to be located in logic and
municipal operation in itself.
At the other extreme, there are 10 (40%) local governments that could create a policy without
Pani financing and without the CAI framework, that is, autonomously: Alvarado,
25. The remaining 8 are unknown.

Regarding the valuations about having its own regulations in
NNA subject, the total number of people interviewed agreed that it favors
enormously the framework of action from the local in that area, contributing to the
positioning of the issue in municipal political agendas in addition to contributing to
Improvement of management and planning in that work axis, strengthening the fabric
Cantonal Institutional: “The CAI program comes to touch the local government that has never
had in the imaginary that NNA is part of the transverse actions of governments
local ”(Personal communication, Pani official, May, 2020).
Have a local NNA policy contributing to the promotion of integral development
improving the living conditions of that population, since poverty and deficiencies
that are suffered at this stage of life have an impact on adulthood. Consequently, the
social investment aimed at this population group is fundamental from a vision of
Social policy with rights approach and guarantee of common well -being.
With respect to the second level of findings about the policies associated with the
assessment of its content, it was found that the approach of
Intersectionality, in addition, in the middle of you are no action plan, they are
elaborated with a logic of “mold” 4, which does not collect the peculiarities of the canton in
As for NNA, an interesting aspect, since they all made the diagnosis
Initial for the certification that gave account of the peculiarities of each canton.
All policies have a robust framework of the national legal framework in which
register, support and inspire and from which their objectives aligned with the
Compliance with rights. However, they lack articulation with other policies
municipal such as the regulatory plan. It is rescued that, in all cases,
He mentioned the consultation of NNA for its elaboration.
Although 31 municipalities answered the online questionnaire and 26
They indicated that the cantonal development plan integrates children and adolescence actions,
This does not appear so clear in the documentary review carried out. In general, they tell, now
either, with a plan or at least with lines of action, however, not all define
indicators and these are formulated to account for the number of participants in the
Activities, which leaves a void regarding the expected and obtained results.
The above evidences an important failure regarding the elaboration and application of
monitoring and evaluation plans, being a generalized characteristic, both in
municipalities cai as does not fall, as shown in the following figure:

A criterion that prevailed in the interviews regarding this issue is that there is no mandate
indicating that local governments must account for the Comptroller General of
The Republic on NNA issues, an aspect that substantially affects its incorporation and
real monitoring in municipal life.
Finally, in the policies no greater differentiation in terms of actions and
Strategies aimed at childhood and youth and/or adolescence. This constitutes a
central element in any program oriented to these populations, as it is the form
concrete to respond and comply with the principle of fundamental progressive autonomy
within the framework of NNA rights. It is through differentiated initiatives in accordance with
the needs and interests of each population as it is recognized and correct
Vacuum in this area in the concrete lives of people and social groups.
With respect to the pillar of implementation of an “office, department, unit or person
Responsible to address NNA issues in the local government ”(Valverde and Baltonado,
2013, p. 6), the findings show that only 15 municipalities, that is, little less than
half, have managed to enable a specific instance, 14 do not have it and 2 are in
Process of enabling her, 7 indicated that they had a specific person, but they are
Within the 15 that have instance. The complete panorama is shown in the following

In most cases, as will be seen later, the CAI issue constituted a
"Surcharge" of functions for working people who occupy the positions in what
It is usually called “social area” of municipalities and acquires different names of
according to each organizational structure, as a women's office, office
Social promotion, social management, among others. Despite that, a light better is shown
performance in those that are cai of those who are not: more cai they have it and less
They don't have it.
Although the budget allocation was not directly a pillar of CAI, it is
known that in planning and, above all, of public policies, the initiatives that do not
They are endowed with budget content are good intentions. Any execution of
Public incidence actions require resources and budget, especially,
When it comes to opening the way on a subject, with a population and within a context
in which very little or nothing has been done, as is this case. Because of that, I know
He consulted for this aspect in a timely manner.
Of 22, 13 local governments indicated that they do not have that resource, 15 do possess it
in which specific games for scholarships were included and 3 are in process. Without
however, at this point the difference between Cai and not cai cantons is important and
It makes a difference, since the lag of the municipalities is not remarkable

Considering the information shown, it is possible to indicate that the positioning that
He had the issue of NNA in the local governments CAI, he had a positive influence on the
generation of very specific products, which have not found the same frequency
in those who are not cai. Here it should be clarified that all the personnel interviewed, both
Municipalities like Pani, indicated that before CAI, local governments
They allocated some economic and financial resources for NNA, however, no
They were necessarily alienated with the pillars of Cai.
As for the axis of the destination of resources, two aspects that affect it appear:
1- The political-party: which affects two ways. First, for the balance of forces
between mayors and municipal councils. And second, due to weight
significant that has or not to support the Mayor's Office on these issues
NNA, in that sense, 14 of the 25 municipalities responded in the
Survey that had had support from the Mayor's Office, however, in the interviews
They pointed out that once the certification has declined the interest, or with the
Government changes, that support was lost.
2- The failure in terms of the results-based planning approach: same
that obeys, to a large extent to the structural desatino of local governments
in general. In addition to that, as CAI was a strategy, not a
Platform (as are subsystems, for example), a process should be given
of "institutionalization" of the same, which required a constant effort and
dedicated, in which the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are essential,
circumstance that was not obtained once the recognition obtained. This factor will be
resumed in sustainability.
As a summary, the following table that presents the aspects exposed is attached
as efforts aimed at the institutionalization of the CAI program:

In the implementation of CAI they operated, crossed two dimensions of the operation
Municipal: technique and politics, in which the vision of NNA that each actor has.
From the findings it follows that, for the level of the high hierarchies, it implied a
Symbol of status and prestige, while, for technical levels, it represented a
Theme of deep commitment in the progressive transformation of the NNA situation
of the canton.
All the people interviewed, both from the municipalities and the Pani, indicated
The imperative character of having a budget to execute any initiative.
The pillar of the intersectoral and inter -institutional joint constituted the objective with greater
compliance level. Aspects such as an improvement in the channels of
communication between institutions, greater capacity and willingness to coordinate
actions and strategies, a modification of the relationship between the PANI and the
municipalities, as well as a reduction in duplicity of functions.
In relation to the above, it is indicated that this best and greater articulation was associated
to factors such as the establishment and/or strengthening of capacities and competences in the
planning area, as they received training and advice on those issues like this
as in terms of NNA rights, which, in turn, increased the levels of
73
Awareness and expert from the official: “It was somehow CAI
resources external to action, which came and improved, which trained people
And these people who trained ended up making an incidence is totally
Positive ”(Personal communication, municipal official, June 2020).
The number of institutions involved is diverse, they were mentioned with a lot
Frequency, the following: IMAS, MEP, Public Force, Pani, CCSS and Ministry of
Health, in some cases NGOs and private company in Bethlehem, Pérez Zeledón and Poás.
With the exception of two people interviewed by the same canton, the rest informed that
CAI had two relevant results aimed at strengthening public institutions
attending NNA: on the one hand, he pushed the creation of the instances that by law must
exist; And on the other, he strengthened them in those cantons participating in which already
There were: “Because it did not imply anything really new, but enhanced and opened a path
to strengthen what was ”. (Personal communication, workshop, March 2020).
As for the NNA participation pillar, the consultation for the elaboration is mentioned
of politics, or as passive beneficiaries of activities carried out by
municipalities or inter -institutional cantonal networks, but no more actions than
those. The graph that is presented shows the situation:

Although there is a consensus that action was strengthened in terms of rights
NNA: "I would say that minors won first of all"
(Personal communication, Pani official, May 2020), no strategies were evidenced
concrete participatory processes of NNA of the Amigos Cantones
of childhood evaluated. And, as the graph shows, there are not them in the non -cai.
In the consultation with young former participants of CAI, the effects of taking are relieved
awareness that their voices tell and are important, that there were various learning
significant and that was a positive experience: “It is an experience that marked one
for good. ”(Personal communication, former participant of CAI, 18 years, August 2020).
perceived achievements are mostly located in the sphere of the individual: skills to
Life, overcome some personal difficulties, etc. Only the case of a
Interviewed in Pococí also places the scope of the collective as a gain and
learning.
74
From the online survey and interviews, two categories of
direct actions on NNA:
1. Strengthening of the Culture of Rights and
2. Promotion of Integral Infant-Joven Development, highlighting what is related to
parks, recreation, sport, culture, informative workshops, among other actions.
The scope of the efforts aimed at NNA is delimited to the school population.
The other sector, which, in addition, is the most vulnerable in the broad sense of the term, has not
been achieved by the CAI strategy.
Regarding the actions or strategies associated with the Report Generation Pilar
newspapers and data about the condition of NNA of the canton, the results also
They are scarce. The diagnoses requested at the beginning for certification are highlighted.

To what extent is the governance model with which the program was designed
Allows compliance with the objectives?
The management model with which the CAI program was managed, is seen by people
Interviewed, as efficient, in the meantime to give a significant impulse in the local
to the actions that the government came regarding the rights of the children. Situation
which is corroborated by the municipality to express the importance of participation
of UNICEF, due to the high level of credibility it has, which is valued as a
Plus for the CAI program, and encourages the participation of municipal mayors in
The certification process, however, presents problems of definition in the subject
of the sustainability of the model.
In this question, the effectiveness of the governance model will be analyzed
identified in the implementation of the CAI program.
Since its conception, the CAI program was conceived as an effective model of
multilevel governance, which established the coordination between state institutions by
means of the figure of the Technical Secretary (ST), and the work in association between the
different levels of government (community, municipality, regional coordination,
national), additionally a series of principles were applied that should guide a
efficient elaboration of policies, such as participation, cooperation, opening,
transparency, inclusiveness and coherence, all of them essential conditions for
guarantee their success, and the interest of citizenship and especially with the participation of
minors.
Next, the multilevel governance model will be analyzed based on the six
Dimensions defined by Espejo, Cortínez, Leyton, Martínez, Tomaselli and Figueroa
(2016):
1. Political feasibility and/or political support: establishes the need for networks
They have legal and regulatory frameworks, at different levels of operation
(national, subnational, local) and at the transverse level between the institutions that
compose.
In this regard, it was possible to identify a success at the regulatory level there is a regulation
of the contest to opt for the recognition of the Cantones Amigos de la Program
Childhood, which establishes the bases to operate the first contest and define some
functions of the ST CAI, however a weakness is that in practice it does not
I provide sustainability to continue the process, this is seen on a reflected way in
The Ifam, where according to the 29 interviews conducted there is a feeling of
Abandonment, in this regard a municipal official points out “who excited them and then
They left them alone ”(Personal communication, municipal official, July, 2020).
For the purposes of the CAI program formalization, the highest level of
formalization and therefore it is indispensable for you to work
regardless of the changes of the political authorities.
76
Nor was evidence found in the documentary review of a protocol of the
definition of clear roles of each institution participating in it in the ST CAI,
being corroborated in interviews with the people who integrate it.
At the level of the municipal, problems were also given to the continuity of the
Program due to political changes that are typical of the municipal world, and where
not being clearly defined in a regulatory framework, municipal responsibility,
makes Cai, be seen from political authorities as actions to obtain the
certification and, despite the fact that at the beginning it was proposed that the competition would have a character
altruistic, according to the criteria of 26 of the municipalities interviewed, from
The Mayor's Office was seen as an award, and that is why he had no continuity.
2-Descent and importance of the territorial and local: Highlights the space
Local for the articulation of policies in favor of a comprehensive service.
As said in other sections the program clearly raises a model
Decentralized policies in favor of the NNA, which is another success, however,
Due to the great diversity of cantonal realities, actions had to be provided
differentiated with municipalities with less technical and economic resources, in this regard
One of the municipal officials mentions that they would have liked them to be made
Exchanges of experiences for specific issues that affect municipalities
such as migrant child population (personal communication, person
Municipal official, Julio, 2020).
Another aspect that is important to rescue as a positive finding is the case of Pococí
who managed to do a process with the communities and formed a group of young people who
they worked with community diagnoses, in this regard one of the participants that this
moment he is 18 years that Cai made her more sensitive and that thanks to this process
She realized that there were other realities (personal communication, official
Municipal, August, 2020). Hence the importance that Cai promotes the integral of what
communal from the bases of the contest.
3- Intersectoral coordination, conditions and facilitators: in this area,
All authors put the motivation and
commitment of those who compose it, and the quality of their relationships
interpersonal.
This was indicated by 29 of the municipalities interviewed as a positive aspect,
And they mention that, from the local, they have felt an accompaniment process with the
Pani You want to highlight the clear commitment of Ana Teresa's administration
León for making alliances with the municipalities and boosting from there the work with
NNA. Next, an image is presented that illustrates the most mentioned words
for the municipalities in the online survey before the question requested that
They will mention two concrete actions for the product of the coordination as a result of CAI:
77

3- Coordination or articulation can be understood as “a process through
which is generated synergy between the actions and resources of the various
involved in a specific public management field, at the same time as in
This process is being built (or re - defining in case of its preexistence)
a formal and informal game rules system, through which
participating actors find strong incentives to cooperate, beyond their
particular interests and ideologies, usually in conflict with each other ”(Repetto,
2006 in Martínez and Ditzel, 2012, p.46).
Considering that the problems and needs of boys and girls and
teenagers are in themselves multidimensional, their approach must advance
Towards an integral look. Along these lines, childhood investigations validate and stand out
The importance of multidimensional looks, which include from the needs
more basic, even those related to the environment in which they are
Inserts, this is an aspect of agreement the evidence found is not displayed by party
of the ST-CAI, the integration and articulation with other national policies and programs
78
related to the topic such as the ST of the National Network of Care
Integration of the CAI program in the National Development Plan.
4- Financial resources, materials: it is necessary that financing be
broad, that is, not only contemplate the hiring of human resources but also
also the necessary equipment and materials, as well as the hours of
training and expenses associated with that. Also, to be differentiated from
according to the available resources of the municipality (facilities, equipment,
human resource) as to the characteristics of the territory, (vulnerability, quantity
of rural population, extent of the territory).
This is one of the great Achilles heels and where the
commitment to the minor population, most municipalities say
have little or null budget for development action plans, refer
that must be supported with resources from the PANI, which does not allow action
effective and autonomous, being that, although it was one of the requirements of the process of
Certification, it was not a sustainable action.
5- Monitoring and evaluation: Revised studies identify as a problem
the lack of indicators that allow measuring the work of local networks and
Perform an analysis of the needs of the services provided, of the
demands, gaps and improvements that can be achieved through
integration. It is also key to have systems that can monitor the
integrality of services and not replicate stagnant logic. Especially in the
International Literature, people participate as primary appears
users in the monitoring of services and their evaluation.
A positive aspect of the first certification process was the existence of a system
of indicators that allowed measuring the advance of the cantons regarding actions
In children and adolescence, and was devised as a self -assessment process, however,
For 22 of the 29 municipalities consulted in the interviews, the process was not
friendly and it cost them a lot to understand the logic of the filling of the instruments which
qualify as "complicated", in this regard 2 of the municipalities that did not achieve
Culminating the certification process argue that the time that was given to deliver
The documentation was not enough and also that there were many documents.
At the local level according to the evidence located the monitoring systems and
monitoring are a weakness, and conditions for generation should be improved
of indicators and the realization of citizen audits with population participation
under-age.
6- Human Resources: It is identified as a primary problem that is not known
work on a network, they do not have “conceptual and instrumental equipment that allows them
Maximize coordination and articulate a set of diverse agents. ”
One of the risk factors that should be avoided when working on networks such as
St cai, is to have clear way of how the functions will be defined, and the roles of
Each of the instances.
79
10.3 Efficiency criteria:
The efficiency criteria is the extent to which resources/inputs (funds,
Specialization, time, equipment, among others.) They have become results. In this
section, efficiency is analyzed from the following aspects: the analysis of the
economic and financial resources arranged for the program by the various
instances, of the inputs associated with the professional and technical competences of
all key actors in execution and aspects of an intangible nature but that
They have enormous weight in this type of initiatives, such as dynamics and environments
politicians typical of each local government.
To what extent did technical-political, financial, human and material resources with
that are counted and the use made of these, allow the implementation of the program
Cai?
The assessment of this criterion has two clearly delimited phases: 1-during the whole
Contest process and 2- The period after it.
Resources can be divided into three: 1-those that were given by CAI when it starts,
2- Those who were already installed at the cantonal level through institutionality and
local resources present and 3- Those who had the municipalities.
In that sense, input weaknesses are evident, associated with non -consideration
of the diversity and disparity of such resources. Failures are also identified
associated with the political dynamics of each canton.
As positive findings, the general prestige of UNICEF stands out, which added
legitimacy to the program; the inter -institutional capacities installed prior; he
PANI contribution, both financial, economic and technical in the process of
accompaniment and the technical capacities of professional personnel who assumed the
program at the municipal level.
It should be noted that, for matters of access to information in the work process
Field, it was not possible to obtain sufficient evidence to account for an analysis
of cost/benefit of the program. Without that documentary evidence on the amount of
assigned resources of the institutions that make up the technical secretary for
Implement friends friends of childhood is not possible to analyze, in a way
quantifiable, the extent to which these resources allow implementing the program.
Two levels were defined to analyze the use of resources/supplies required by the
CAI program to generate results. The first level is formed by UNICEF, Ifam,
Pani, harodeni and measure in the figure of the ST CAI, which implements the strategy
nationally. And the second, the 32 participating municipalities, which assume a
Portfolio of resources, economic, normative and financial, in addition to humans, to
Participate in the certification process.

Cai's efficiency deserves to be valued at two different times, as its
operation varies:
1. During the entire certification process and
2. When they are certified and corresponds to local governments to assume in a form

A positive finding is evidenced in terms of technical assistance and plans
training, which is mentioned by 31 municipalities interviewed as a
success in terms of the accompaniment that was provided at the beginning of the process of
Certification. In addition to that, assistance and
Technical accompaniment provided by the IFAM and UNICEF at the beginning. The training les
allowed: receive support materials, accompaniment in review of plans with
Recommendations and, conceptualization of indicators, as well as planning issues
strategic.
However, after the contest process, rather it appears as an aspect by
reinforce mentioned by the 31 municipalities interviewed. In this regard, a person
Interviewed refers:
"Cai has to be formulated with a plan at least medium term that
include a strong component of capacities formation to be able to
Sustain but that is again a reason for criticism and demotivation that
It is the main problem "
It is important to clarify that although CAI offered training and assistance opportunity
Technique to "propitiate an environment of continuous improvement" (UNICEF and IFAM, 2012, p. 7),
81
no documentation is presented on the human resource arranged to execute the
Training and Technical Assistance Plans by IFAM and UNICEF after
certification process, which is the great weakness of the program.
The execution of CAI, by its nature, requires certain competences to generate
the products requested in the certification process. In that sense, the
people in charge of municipalities had a professional profile that
It contributed substantially, to the fulfillment of the objectives. It's about officials (already
that almost all are women) with great career on social issues, with knowledge
of the cantonal realities, as well as with sensitivity and appropriation of the approach of
rights.
In addition to that, according to data from the online survey applied to officials
Of the 31 municipalities that responded, it follows that less than 15% of the total
of people have a professional profile in administration and more than 80% come
of the Social Sciences Area, circumstance that facilitates the implementation processes,
since both at the methodological level and of theoretical-conceptual content there is closeness
with the axes and fundamentals of CAI.
In relation to the human and economic resource that Pani has in local offices,
28 of the interviewed municipalities show a direct and positive opinion of the
work that takes between the municipality and said institution within the framework of the program
Cai. On the other hand, the people in charge of the program are aware of
limiting that the institution has for the high amount of processes of which it is part.
An official quotes that: “The contribution is that it has come to articulate all the actions that
They are made in NNA, the pani has articulated, without cai I do not remember an inter -institutional space
To talk about NNA ”(Personal communication, 2020).
Another aspect, already mentioned in efficacy, is the specific financing offered by the
Pani to 8 Cai municipalities to make their cantonal policies. Of those 8, only 5 achieve
do it with that money and three returned it (but one -Jiménez- did carry out the policy
finally). This specific contribution of the PANI is valuable, especially, in the case of
the municipalities that have few resources.

From the perspective of resources and supplies for attention of the CAI program, the data
indicate that:
to. The online survey evidence that more than 80% of municipalities
participants in CAI have integrated NNA actions in the plans of
Cantonal and Mayor's Development. Which is consistent with the process of
interviews that reflect the visibility of NNA from the CAI program in the
Technical and political space of the Municipality.
However, NNA policies do not have budgets integrated
corresponding, so that they are only included in the annual plans
Operations The risk of the foregoing is that what is established in politics is
You can lose, there are also to present accounts before the
Comptroller General of the Republic.
b. In relation to the budget, it is shown that less than 50% of the
participating municipalities have economic resource to carry out
NNA actions, this data has been validated by the work processes of
field with the participating municipalities.
c. Regarding economic resource for personnel in charge of attending
the program as other logistics and operational requirements, the
interviews have reflected that the program is implemented through a surcharge
83
of tasks to municipal official of the municipal offices of women or
of social management areas. So that it adds more work to a burden
work already excessive. This aspect constitutes one of the greatest
Weaknesses of the program, as it remains, substantially, operational capacity and
of concrete incidence in the community of NNA.
The collaboration spaces of municipalities with other entities have been
visible through the CAI program, this because more than 50% of people in charge of the
program indicate an inter -institutional coordination spaces (in
lesser extent a group of municipalities that already had active spaces like JPNA
and SLP before the program). Said benefit has been exposed in interviews and, in the
Online survey, it is reflected that 80% of participating municipalities considered in the
municipal planning inter -institutional coordination to develop
strategies aimed at NNA.
The lack of an office specialized in strategic planning is a factor
recurring in the delay of expected results in actions of NNA or execution of
cantonal policies. A person consulted comments that: “The budget issue is
complicated. Sometimes there was no planning office and that more complicated the matter "
(UNICEF Personal Personal Communication, 2020). In the online survey, it is indicated
that 6 municipalities (from 31 who sent the information) do not have an apartment
of planning that is in charge of annual operational planning. On the other hand, the
Costing systems also represent an analysis limitation, as they do not exist
findings about this resource in the participating municipalities during the work of
field. The above is a weakness that Wild (2012) found and continues to maintain,
“The issue of culture of
planning. This is a weakness that must be overcome ”(p.39).
In relation to the evaluation and monitoring system for the CAI program, it is observed
In the online survey that only 9 municipalities have it, which represents a
Limiting for the elaboration of periodic reports for decision making. It fits
Highlight that, according to the evidence collected, 10 municipalities make reports
newspapers on the NNA, as observed in this graph:

The contrast in this issue with respect to non -CAI municipalities is significant,
It seems that these work more successfully than the CAI.
On political support and commitment, the sources consulted were insistent in
that government changes reflect challenges in the continuity of the initiative,
What happens, among other aspects, by the vision of childhood and adolescence of the administration
incoming, in addition to his approaches and actions from the local, “Nna's vision is
Subjective, from the previous council they are not there today, ”said a commissioned official
of the program in a municipality outside the GAM (personal communication, 2020). Besides,
Also of political interests, an interviewed person expressed in a way
energetic: "It was pure politician ... it was a political banner." (Communication
Personal, Pani official, 2020).
The evidence shows that all municipalities see collaboration opportunities
with other entities within the framework of the CAI program. This collaboration implies a
economic benefit by not duplicating functions and/or carrying out joint activities in
Nna from the local. However, there is no evidence or documented processes that
allow to economically quantify the value of the economic contributions of said
Actions (product of the joint collaboration they represent).
To a little extent, municipalities have a wide collaboration network in the plan
communal, there are cases such as Siquirres, Pococí, Pérez Zeledón, Poás and Santa Ana,
where, in addition to working in an articulated way with public institutions in the canton,
There is high support with development associations, cooperatives and private companies.

10.4 Sustainability Criteria
The sustainability criteria is defined as the extent to which the benefits generated
They can be maintained over time beyond the implementation cycle of a program
o Project, or extent that there are conditions conducive to it and the capacity
of the main interested actors to sustain the benefits of the intervention. The
sustainability of a program is usually linked, practical, to levels of
institutionalization or appropriation that is acquiring as time passes and
They perform systematic actions and strategies.
What factors foster or limit the sustainability of the CAI program?
In this question, sustainability will be analyzed based on the factors that
they encourage or threaten the sustainability of the actions carried by the CAI from the
different institutions according to the assigned role, the analysis of the appropriation of the program
Cai by the municipalities, the IFAM and other public institutions in charge
of the issue of childhood and adolescence and closing with the analysis of the mechanisms of
Planning and participatory monitoring at the municipal level with the community and other actors
relevant, of the CAI program.
In the case of Cai, serious difficulties faced this happened. HE
They found low levels of sustainability associated with management characteristics
municipal, to the management of political-strategic communication of the Technical Secretariat
addressed to local actors throughout the process, to failure in mechanisms
central and local monitoring of the initiative and the way in which dynamics
politician-electoral crosses cantonal life.
Drawing a historical line of Cai, it is possible to locate two moments: the first includes
two phases, the preparation for certification and the municipalities already certified; and
the second, which is the transit post certification, autonomously, implementing
The request. This is mentioned, therefore, the efforts to build sustainability are
dissimilar at each stage.
The multilevel character developed in the governance section is of great importance
for the analysis of sustainability. In the middle of the national and the local level, it appears
From the perspective of the daily implementation of the program, a kind of
"Interzona", where the technical personnel of each level come together. This interzone is
extremely relevant, because it is where the alliances that add or subtract
Execution possibilities at the specific level.
To assess the sustainability of CAI in this first certification, its
operation in both moments and at the three levels mentioned above.
86
In the national field, there are two factors that add sustainability. On the one hand, the
Existence of a robust and solid national regulatory and legal framework in terms of NNA.
And on the other, the fact that a national technical secretariat of CAI has been created with
Participation of various institutions, which allows you to follow up on the program. He
fact that this evaluation has been requested by said instance is an element that,
By itself, add sustainability.
Any initiative registered within the framework of a public policy requires, of entry, of
political support. In this sense, the declaration of national interest on November 1
From 2012 it was a positive input.
At the local level there were also support, 17 of the 29 cai municipalities that completed
The survey indicated that for the CAI period, the issue of NNA was a priority in the
Municipal Agendas: “It has been one of the success factors that cantons have had
Friends of childhood ... because one sells what one believes ”(refers to the mayor)
(Personal communication, Pani official, May 2020).
That support was not always held over time. Even a municipal official
in charge of the issue of NNA indicates that they did the policy but that the Mayor's Office has
prevented from putting it into practice. This, which unfortunately, is an extreme case that
Exemplifies a factor that limits sustainability, reveals, very clearly, the great weight
that has the political and the way in which the power quotas are settled in many
Local governments.
The loss of support of municipal hierarchies appears associated with two elements:
1- Obtaining recognition was assumed only as a kind of “trophy
political ”that added status and prestige of particular management and 2- The issue of childhood and
Adolescence does not constitute a political priority:
The vision of the municipality in what are issues of childhood and adolescence
right now, since they have great ignorance on the issues,
since it is a new government that has just entered and the previous one had
A long time not to participate in these issues. (Personal communication,
Municipal official, May 2020).
In addition to the weight of the municipal councils at the level of political control that they exercise and
that, sometimes, can hinder initiatives.
On the other hand, the political feasibility that emanating from the Technical Secretariat evidenced
shortcomings regarding its role in the specific regulatory framework of Cai operation,
which constituted a factor that limited the sustainability of the program substantively.
In that sense, the regulation of the contest to opt for the recognition of the
Cantones Amigos de la Infancy Program, May 2014, presents serious shortcomings
in terms of sustainability: it is repetitive in indicating that it refers to the process of
CAI contest that first time, although in its article 30 it establishes the possibility of
Renewal without specifying what this process would be, the functions of the
87
institutions within the Secretariat, there is no clarity regarding the forms of
accompaniment to municipalities, being that, due to the dissimilar characteristics of
Local governments, the required accompaniment may vary.
In addition to the above is the weakness when used to communicate, to
political-strategic level, the program route and its operational nature, above all, in
the cantons in which there was already a local subsystem operating: “even, when
We start with CAI has cost us to understand the difference and function ”(Communication
staff, municipal official, July 2020). There is coincidence in people
interviewed that, especially, after certification it was not clear about
Road to follow, the accompaniment was blurred and, suddenly, both UNICEF and Ifam
They stopped communicating and supporting: “At the beginning of the project we do receive
Training by UNICEF, but then we don't receive anymore ”(Communication
staff, municipal official, June 2020). This feeling is shared by the 29
Municipalities participating in the interview process.
Nor was it possible to effectively transmit the added value that would have to be a canton
Cai, which is linked to the confusion of whether it was an award for the
Municipality or for the canton. This is linked to the absence of consultation in the phase of
Design to the actors who had to execute the program. It was a generalized opinion,
especially in the municipalities of rural areas, which was not considered the context
Specific of each canton, a situation that adds difficulty in sustaining it in time,
Because, among other aspects, the technical viability that was
He demanded in his initial proposal.
Finally, another factor derived from the above is that they are not found in the regulation
previously cited or expressed in any interview, actions or
mechanisms for the Technical Secretariat to execute some internal monitoring system
To assume the CAI program.
A fundamental aspect that pays in the sustainability of any intervention and that
It is quite clear in this program, it is the profile, the level of commitment and capabilities
staff assigned for its execution, not only of municipalities, but
of the various institutions that participated in the CAI strategy. They found themselves high
levels of involvement, of awareness of the importance of CAI at the cantonal level, great
sensitivity towards compliance with the rights of NNA, in addition to a great
knowledge of local realities, which allows better to influence design terms
of interventions and technical actions.
The above was increased thanks to the training and technical accompaniment provided
by UNICEF and IFAM during the certification preparation process, which is
Another factor that added sustainability. The positive assessment of the
technical accompaniment provided by both institutions as a mechanism for
compliance with the objectives, which in turn strengthens institutional capacities
at the local level, especially if it is considered that the interviewee personnel in charge of attending
88
The issue of CAI in the municipalities and the PANI has, on average, 10 years of being in
That position.
UNICEF appears as an organization of great prestige and legitimacy against
participating actors, who recognize that, by itself, constituted an incentive for
be interested in certification.
As objective aspects: to have a cantonal policy of NNA, a specific instance,
as well as a budget assigned exclusively there are three factors that foster the
sustainability, because they are more integrated in local government management, that is,
strengthen the route of institutionalization compared to those municipalities
They don't have them. Although it should be clarified that they do not guarantee it for themselves. A
Municipality indicates, in the survey, that the local government does not have the conditions
Policies, operational and logistics assume Cai II even though it has a budget and
Specific instance, as well as Cantonal Policy of NNA since 2014.
In a forceful and unanimous way, the issue of the lack of financial resources was
underpinned as one of the most serious threats to perform any initiative
destined for NNA.
In addition to the above, the absence of a specific indicator of measurement in the Comptroller
General of the Republic for local governments in NNA matters was mentioned
as an aspect that affected the sustainability of CAI and that in general, affects
Maintain and justify comprehensive actions for that population from the municipalities.
The role of Pani is rescued as a very important actor, almost like a "natural ally"
In the cantons in the implementation of the CAI strategy, both in financial support
as in the positioning of a technical and ethical-legal view that helped guide
The work of the CAI work team.
Without a doubt, an Achilles heel in sustainability is always the follow -up systems
and evaluation. Of the triangulated findings of the survey and the interviews was evidenced
that 20 municipalities do not have mechanisms of that order for NNA issues, such and
as shown in graph 11

The above adds the labor overload of the municipal officials and the other
institutions that make up the local protection subsystem and that participate in CAI:
“As you said, I am in charge of the Office of Children and Adolescents and how
It always happens in all local governments, it is always one for everything. ”(Communication
staff, municipal official, May 2020). An idea that was expressed in a way
Reiterate is that: "We have to be to all people in all commissions."
(Personal communication, municipal official, May 2020).
It should be rescued that the interviews were carried out between the months of April and May, when
The pandemic situation began to become more difficult and several times was
necessary to reschedule the interview because the municipal managers are
they were fulfilling intense work days to contribute to the attention of the
Crisis in their cantons: “Sometimes lack of time, hands, heads, then
Ask if I want to do more things, maybe I want, but I don't have time "
(Personal communication, municipal official, May 2020).
So that, despite successful compliance in terms of articulation
inter -institutional and intersectoral, it was not possible
Strengthened subsystems, which are platforms required by law, but not the program
CAI, which was a strategy suggested by invitation.
The citizen participation axis was another sensitive failure that affected sustainability,
both for the low community involvement in general in the CAI program and in
As for the little promotion of active PME participation.
The evidence that municipalities have to generate information
timely about the nna state of the canton and disseminate it, both in the
90
institution as towards the community, constitutes another element that affects the
Sustainability of the CAI program.
In short, in the first moment of CAI indicated at the beginning, important
efforts and sustainability mechanisms, but that were in the incipient process of
strengthening, so that, in the second moment, when the abrupt cut is given, no
It was possible to keep them with the force they brought and hence the weakness to maintain their
lines of action. In that sense, the role of the National Technical Secretariat has a
significant responsibility.
Next, there is a figure with the main factors that added and

11. Conclusions
In this section, the final ideas detailing the evaluation judgments are shared with
Regarding each criteria analyzed.
11.1 of relevance.
To what extent did the CAI program take into account the needs of the population
beneficiary in its design and is consistent with the regulatory framework in the matter and
local contexts?
1 at the conceptual level and from the perspective of the program design, it has a
high degree of relevance with the country context where it arises, due to its
congruence with international agreements, policies and care strategies
Children and adolescents. The program has a clearly defined logic
in its TC, which is also highly relevant with the national regulatory framework
and international.
2 At the country level, the program is aligned with the actions in terms of rights
of childhood and adolescence, also started from an international model and adapt it
to a Costa Rican reality. However, consultation levels must be improved
and validation with the municipalities and take into account the particularities of
each one.
3 There is little level of prominence of the municipal instances in charge of
The issues of NNA, the regulatory framework must be improved, so that they become
In strategic instances with personal and group skills such as leadership
And teamwork, because without them the scope of policy actions
loses its potential.
11.2 of efficiency
What is the level of compliance with the planned results of the program?
4 Cai's contribution regarding the regulatory framework, although he added to the alignment with
National legislation did not strengthen it at the local. Its ability to
integrate local realities with these national legal mandates, through
The cantonal policies of NNA.
5 The greatest achievements are located in terms of the degree of institutionalization through
of specific products such as the generation of policies, which received a strong
impulse and support throughout the certification process. The greatest shortcomings in
which corresponds to the municipal structural, such as construction and application
of evaluation and monitoring systems.
92
6 The actions and initiatives that were expressed in field work show
That a structural approach to the situation of NNA is lacking, the subject remains
circumscribed to the department or official who attends it, but hardly
Cross with the other dependencies of the municipality.
7 The form and content of policies demonstrate an approach based on
needs and not in the gaps, this being an urgent look for the context
country that every time places CR as one of the most unequal in the region. It
above, it has a significant impact on development and promotion of development
Integral de Nna.
8 The contradictory vision that prevailed between the mayors and the technical staff when
CAI was assumed, had an effect on the implementation of the program, which, in many
Cases, gave him potential.
9 The results can be grouped into three large incidence axes:
A. The inter -institutional fabric that addresses the population of NNA in the local,
which was strengthened and expanded. In the municipalities where there was no
actions or incidence strategies for NNA, they were created; where
There were, they were vigorized.
B. The philosophical-politician of the program: which refers to the levels of
incidence in the positioning of the issue of NNA rights in
Public agendas. It was placed directly and, for the first time,
formal mode, the visibility of the issue of childhood and adolescence in the
municipal chief, strengthening the local level on issues not
traditional
C. Institutional-Local, which refers to the improvement of capacities
techniques and professionals of the public official who addresses NNA in
The cantons.
10 The existence, in the country, of a solid institutionality helped the pillar of
The articulation was the one that reached the highest level of compliance.
11 The type of participation found in the implementation of CAI, according to Jaume
Trilla and Ana Novella (UNICEF, 2006) refers to two types: simple participation and
Advisory participation. In that sense, the highest level that is the
Meta participation, which implies that: “The children themselves generate new
spaces and participation mechanisms. The objective is the requirement of the
Participation in certain areas. ”(UNICEF, 2006, p. 17)
12 There are at least four the factors that influenced the low compliance with three
of the five proposed pillars: 1-The inter-institutional articulation that has a
limited coverage, both at geographic and logistical and operational level, 2-lack
93
of financial resources of the municipal instances in charge of the topic, 3- The
political-strategic line dictated by the Mayor's Office and 4-The work overload of the staff
Technician who had to attend the program.
13 The CAI program, has a clearly defined logic in its TC, which also
It is highly relevant with the national and international regulatory framework.
Likewise, an inter -institutional coordination logic is established that responds
To a governance model, however, the
Contribution of the different institutions with said TC.
14 Coordination is not a natural function of individual or organizational action,
It is a collective construction, which must be sustained with instruments
concrete, hence the importance of strengthening it through the
Definition of clearly established roles.
11.3 of efficiency
12 The people interviewed agree to identify the training input
As a strength of CAI, since it provided and strengthened competencies to personnel to
The best performance of the program.
13 There are documentary limitations to determine a cost-benefit ratio of
Human, economic, financial and technical resources at both levels. However,
The findings reveal that the provisions for the program allowed a scope
visible in the results of a regulatory framework in local governments, through
the construction of a public policy in NNA and its local participation in various
spaces.
14 The human resource arranged in the municipalities to assume CAI is
in a condition of labor saturation, which restricts its performance oriented to
CAI's objectives.
15 The financial resource is what generates the most expectation between municipalities and
It is both a limitation to act efficiently in the fulfillment of the
proposed objectives. This due to several reasons. One is that, although they exist
Financial restrictions at the institutional level, the scope of the actions in NNA
It depends on other variables such as PME population size and situations of
special attention that vary in cantons with urban and rural population, as well as
situations of social complexity in high demographic density
specifically. Another is that participatory processes are usually expensive.
16 The evidence shows that it has been allowed to generate job opportunities
set and articulated. It is emphasized that, although transfers have not been counted
direct financial resources for actions in NNA to the municipalities, the
94
UNICEF, PANI and IFAM supports, especially during the process of
Certification, were fundamental for the compliance levels reported.
17 It is in the autonomous operation phase of the process where the main ones are located
weaknesses at the efficiency level.
18 Political support is a factor of enormous weight. The "political rotation" of the
Administrations subject to the electoral cycles of local governments
It constitutes a factor that generates great vulnerability to the program,
especially, for the contribution of resources, as well as support and legitimacy
within the same municipality and out.
11.4 Sustainability
12 The ambiguity of the Contest Regulations to opt for the recognition of the
Cantones Friends of Childhood constitutes an element that threatens
Seriously, the program is effectively sustained over time, that is,
that advances in appropriation, both at the inter -institutional level and in the
intra -institutional, this because the work for the improvement of
NNA living conditions at the local level, it goes so much through technical knowledge,
as for awareness in the subject.
13 Derived from the above, the role of the Technical Secretariat was diluted in the post phase
Certification, generating a feeling of abandonment of the process and orphanhood
technique, which also affected the levels of motivation and credibility towards the
CAI program.
14 The elaboration and implementation of the program with a logic from top to bottom
It is another element that affected sustainability, as the
Real possibilities of execution when not considering the existing conditions of
each municipality in all dimensions required to execute a
initiative like this.
15 The restricted financial resources for lack of political will or for being
Hig as it happens in small municipalities, as well as overload
labor of the person in charge, are two forceful limitations for the
Sustainability of CAI.
16 The low clarity in the definition of the type of participation required by
The various actors involved in CAI at the community level significantly reduces
Your potential to stay. In that sense, according to the findings, a
Concepción very associated with the centralist institutional, fostering the networks little
Autonomous and self -managed communals, which are basic for the support of
initiatives such as these, which point to the cultural transformation of practices and
long -standing beliefs, which are only modified from the daily spaces of
interaction between people and social groups.
95
17 The level of political commitment, the vision of childhood and adolescence, as well as the
broad comprehension of the CAI program by the mayorships constitutes a
factor that affects the support of technical staff to be able to assume Cai de
Successful and over time.
18 The absence of monitoring mechanisms constitutes a failure of management
Municipal in general, the issue of NNA is no exception, this added to the lack
of current generated information, not only quantitatively, but qualitative,
It affects both sustainability and the efficiency and effectiveness of any approach
With population of NNA.
19 elements of organizational order, such as having personnel with skills
Soft and appropriate techniques encourages sustainability, as it contributes to
guarantee quality interventions.
20 The findings in this criterion reiterate that NNA issues require an effort
enormous to position them as relevant, urgent and necessary, as a
Famous African proverb: "A whole town is needed to educate a child."
11.5 Global trial
The CAI program is a highly relevant initiative for the current context
Costa Rican, with low levels of efficacy, efficiency and sustainability, since there were
important shortcomings in the consideration of municipal realities, in the
political-strategic communication of the central level of program coordination, thus
as in the weak culture of national and local monitoring and evaluation for initiatives of
This nature.
96
97
12. Recommendations
Finally, the suggestions for the strengthening and improvement of the CAI program are presented in its second stage
of certification, they detach themselves from the review and deep reflection of the evaluation team from the valuables
Contributions provided by all the people interviewed for this evaluation.
In general, it is desired
considered as a transverse axis that defines the entire CAI strategy in this second certification, being that the
minors are being one of the groups most hit by this world crisis, both in terms of the
Impact on its integral development as in the sphere of loss of rights.
For reasons of organization and better visualization of information, in addition, according to the nature of the

5 and 6-12 years, while the remaining 40% are between 13 and 17 years old. The country is reaching
its demographic dividend with an increasingly aged population, which will bring an increase
gradual of dependency rates, and thus, greater challenges on education and care during
childhood and the elderly. Compared to three decades ago, Costa Rican children enjoy
today of better opportunities for their survival, development and protection as a result
of universal and focused social protection programs.
The country improved its position in the Human Development Index: it went from 69 to 63 between 2010 and
20171. Costa Rica has a robust set of laws, policies and programs in favor of the
protection of childhood rights, including the national policy of children and adolescents and

recreational, cultural and religious. However, the increase in fiscal problems (the debt of the
Public sector in 2017 was equivalent to 49% of GDP) and the inefficiencies of sectoral expenditure can arrive
to affect the country's ability to sustain their levels of social investment2.
Despite the important advances registered in the social sector and the existence of several programs
Of poverty reduction, in 2018, 20% of the population remains poor. The index is greater
in rural areas (26%) that in urban areas (19%), and according to an analysis by the State
of the nation in its 2018 report, if monetary transfers will be eliminated, poverty

Extreme would increase by 4.2 percentage points and total by 2.8. 34% of total children
And adolescents live in monetary poverty, of which 12% live in extreme poverty,
While 34.4% suffer multidimensional deprivations related to poverty3, which
raises the challenge of getting no child behind, especially those more children
vulnerable live in rural areas and in coastal and border communities, and belong
mainly to indigenous, Afro -descendant and migrants populations, as well as children with
Disability4.
The welfare index of childhood and adolescence5 (2013), instrument prepared by
Measure and supported by UNICEF, illustrates the variations in the level of well -being of the
Childhood and adolescence depending on the geographical area in which they live. The cantons with
The highest level of well -being is located in the central region of the country, while those with
lower welfare level are found in the north, caribbean and south areas (map 1) 6.

categorized into three components (home and income environment; training process; and
material conditions) and attributes a value between 0 and 100 points. Higher the score, better is the level
of well -being. Between 0 and 41.55 it is classified as minor well -being; between 41.56 and 58.95 it is considered a
average well -being; and greater than 58.96 is considered as greater well -being.

The establishment of data systems that break down the violations of the rights of children
By gender, geographical zone and family income, among others, it is a priority for analysis and
decision making and better base the policies and programs for full fulfillment and
NNA rights guarantee.
Given this reality, it is essential that each canton of Costa Rica has a childhood policy
and adolescence adapted to the specificities of the child and adolescent population and with its active
Participation, to guarantee the rights of all children and adolescents.

1.2 Background of the Cantones Amigos de la Infancy program (CAI)
To support and contribute to full respect for the rights of children and adolescents through
Of protective environments at the local level, UNICEF has promoted the Cantones Amigos de la Program
Childhood in Costa Rica, a program inspired by UNICEF initiative worldwide “cities
Childhood friends ”(https://childfriendlycities.org).
This initiative was launched in 1996 as part of the resolution approved at the second conference
of the UN on human settlements (habitat II), to transform cities into places
more habitable for everyone, and in particular for children and adolescents10. The
Conference declared that the well -being of childhood is the safest indicator of a healthy habitat,
of a democratic society and good government.
A childhood friendly city has as fundamental pillars the design of public policies
effective that are based on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the promotion of participation
Infant and adolescent and the impulse of alliances among all actors related to childhood to
municipal level.
On November 1, 2012, the Costa Rican government publishes a decree declaring of interest
public the actions related to the implementation of the Cantones Amigos de la Program
Childhood (Decree 37383). The decree indicates that “the Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program is a
Costa Rican referent in the field of guarantee of children's and adolescence rights that have as
purpose the strengthening of the participation of local governments and cantonal actors, in
Alliance with national institutions promoting the rights of childhood and adolescence
to generate political, institutional conditions and actions aimed at the development of a
Protective environment of childhood and adolescence in communities throughout the country ”11.
On this same date, a letter of intentions between UNICEF Costa Rica and the Ministry of
Decentralization and Local Development - Institute for Municipal Development and Advice (IFAM) for
contribute to the development of the joint program "Cantones Amigos de la Infancia", with 4 objectives
Main12:
a) Concert and implement joint action proposals that allow consolidating in
its territories a local governance system committed to compliance with
rights of childhood and adolescence taking into account the approach and
Recommendations issued by the United Nations in Promotion and Defense
of human rights.
b) Support the definition and implementation at the local level of public policies
Inclusive, relevant, participatory, equitable and with rights approach, that they do

About recognition13 to the cantons:
The CAI program offers recognition to municipalities that promised protection
integral of the rights of children and its adolescence and that were reflected through advances and
Improvements in the socio -economic conditions of the canton and in progress and results in five pillars
of the rights of childhood and adolescence.
These five pillars are:
1. Participation of childhood and adolescence.
2. Development of a municipal instance of childhood rights.
3. Impulse to a regulatory and political framework friend of childhood in local governments
and work agenda as precursors and guarantors compliance with the rights of
childhood and adolescence.
4. Periodic report on the state of childhood.
5. Coordination processes and intersectoral articulation that guarantee protection
Integral of childhood and adolescence.
The process that led to recognition is 36 months and an equal rating or
higher than 80% based on compliance with its initial work plan. The municipalities that
They met the requirements, according to the jury's evaluation, made up of the IFAM, UNICEF,
Harodeni (Sector of Non -Governmental Organizations and the Private Sector) received the
Recognition of "Canton Friend of Children." This CAI recognition is valid for 24
months and could be renewed for periods of two years when in the opinion of the qualifying jury
Observe a positive evolution.
The CAI program is not a contest of practices carried out, but an instrument of support to the
development of childhood and adolescence policies, with criteria for participation, planning and management
For results. It is understood as an additional stimulus for the development of covered initiatives
In the process of the cantonal councils of inter -institutional coordination and subsystems
Protection premises, both structuring elements of public policies in protection
Integral of childhood and adolescence and strengthening of local governments. Therefore, with
13 recognition cantons friends of childhood, rights of childhood and adolescence in
the cantonal field (2012); https://www.unicef.org/costarica/files/cr_doc_cai_folleto.pdf
122
Their participation in CAI the municipalities receive training and technical assistance opportunities
that foster a continuous improvement environment.
To take part in the program, municipalities must apply for a preliminary way and
provide several documents, among which is a diagnosis of the situation
Cantonal in relation to the five pillars of the CAI process and an assessment of the desired situation
to 2015.
Once the preliminary postulation process of the cantons has been carried out, their authorities receive the
criteria or guidelines to continue for recognition. From there, the municipalities carry out,
An action plan in favor of childhood and adolescence in the canton. In the plan, they must be recorded
clearly the starting points or baselines to undertake objectives and the goals that are
They intend to achieve for the integral protection of children and adolescents in the canton.
Particular emphasis resides in the system of indicators that must be rigorous scrutiny
by the jury qualifying.
A first cycle of participation and qualification took place between 2015-2017 during which 32
cantons participated in the program and all of these 32 cantons were certified as
"Friends of childhood", reaching about 587,000 boys and girls. The certified cantons are:
Cantones province
Santa Ana, Moravia, Desamparados, Escazú, Goicochea, Pérez Zeledón, Aserrí, Alajuelita
San José (8)
Alajuela (6) Naranjo, Upala, Alajuela, Athens, Palmares, Poás

It is important to mention that after the first cycle, an important restructuring was performed
of the IFAM, with a reorganization of the work areas and changes of officials in charge of the
Coordination of the CAI program. Since 2017 a next call for
The participation of new cantons in the CAI.
123
1.3 Purpose of the evaluation
The main purpose of the evaluation of the Cantones Amigos de la Childhood program is
learning and knowledge generation. The program has been implementing since 2012 and 32
Cantons have already achieved certification, so it is appropriate to take a balance of the program for
establish the achievements and challenges to date, and perform a reflective exercise on the
Program value for the development of childhood and adolescence policies for an eventual
scaling at 50 missing cantons and the need to achieve sustainability.
The evaluation is also timely since IFAM has gone through a restructuring process
And it has a new work scheme, and seeks to assess the programs that are in charge,
To establish work priorities. It is also sought to establish in which work area (s) of the
Ifam the CAI should be located and that the latter can adapt to the new IFAM scheme.
By UNICEF, the evaluation is also conceived as a tool to reactivate the
CAI program, which has been seen in follow -up difficulties for the action plans of the
certified municipalities and the implementation of a second phase, as well as the new
Generation of municipalities interested in participating in this initiative in its first phase. It is expected
that the evaluation generates a new interest in the CAI and that it can provide a space of
Reflection about the program, its achievements and difficulties, and that eventually a
New Phase of the program.
In addition, a robust participation of the cantons in the evaluation is expected, which may
serve both evidence and learning tool and support for the
Planning, monitoring and evaluation of its municipal level policies and programs. Finally, I know
expects the community, especially the children and adolescents of each canton, participate
actively in this evaluation and that their opinions and experiences feed the findings and
evaluation recommendations.
The evaluation has a double, summative and formative character. It is summative, since the evaluation
seek to determine to what extent the planned results were achieved or not
Information on the value of the program to stimulate public policies and initiatives for children and
adolescence. It is also formative, since the evaluation seeks to assess the program, to be able to
Establish the achievements and good practices, on the one hand, and on the other hand the improvements areas are analyzed
of the program and aspects that have to be strengthened. Both in the formative and in the summative,
This evaluation aims to mean for the municipalities, a link with new initiatives and reinforcement
of the mechanisms so far implemented for the development of effective municipal policies
for the development of childhood and adolescence.
1.4 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the evaluation is to take a balance of the implementation of the CAI program
and determine its contribution to the development of childhood and adolescence policies. It is also sought
Establish recommendations for the improvement of the program and its scaling throughout the country.
Specifically, it is sought:
124
► Determine the added value of the program for the cantons and their
Contribution to promote public policies for childhood and adolescence.
► Establish program performance in the 32 cantons, determine your
strengths and weaknesses and eventual areas of improvement.
► Establish good practices and lessons learned from the first phase of the
Implementation of the CAI, as well as generate recommendations for an eventual
Second phase of the program.
► Determine how the CAI should be incorporated into the new structure of the IFAM and
Collect concrete proposals for this incorporation.
1.5 EVALUATION SCOPE
The evaluation will cover a representative sample of the 32 cantons participating in the first phase
of the CAI program and that received their certification, and cantons will also be analyzed that have not
participated in the program, to establish the motivations to participate or not, and be able to compare
the situation of the rights of childhood and adolescence in cantons that participate and cantons that
They do not participate and the added value of the program.
The evaluation will review all the components of the CAI program and its 5 pillars. It is expected of
Evaluation that covers the program from its design in 2010-2011 to date. The evaluation
You must review the design and planning processes of the CAI, its regulatory frameworks and
programmatic, the implementation in the first 32 cantons, the certification of these and the period
Following the certification, until the restructuring of the IFAM.
The evaluation process must include all relevant actors for the implementation of the
Program, from national authorities (IFAM, PANI, etc.) to local authorities
(Municipalities, Cantonal Councils of Interinstitutional Coordination (CCCI), Subsystems
Premises of comprehensive protection), and must consult other key actors of the evaluation, such as
UNICEF, HARDODENI, the private sector, communities and children and adolescents of
The participating cantons.
Since one of the pillars of the CAI program is the participation of childhood and adolescence, the
evaluation must evaluate the most appropriate way to integrate in an ethically the participation of
Children and adolescents in the different phases of the evaluation, in line with their right to
participation and expressing their opinion in matters that affect them, as guaranteed by the Convention
about the rights of the child.
1.6 EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
Evaluation criteria
The evaluation criteria are based on the criteria of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC
for its acronym in English) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) 14, which constitute the frame of reference used by the United Nations System
To conduct evaluations.
14 DAC-OCDE evaluation criteria:
http://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/daccrriteriaForevaluatingdevelopmentassistance.h
TM
125
Since the evaluation focuses on evaluating the value and performance of the CAI program, its strengths
and weaknesses, and its eventual scaling to all cantons of the country, the evaluation criteria
Selected are those of relevance, efficacy and sustainability. To the extent of the information
Available, the efficiency criteria will be reviewed to determine the necessary level of resources to
The implementation of the CAI at the municipal level. The impact criteria will not be evaluated in this
evaluation, given the limited implementation time of the CAI and the fact that it has only been carried out
A certification round, so there is not enough data to make an impact analysis
satisfying.
Transversely, integration into the CAI program of the
human rights approaches (including children's rights), equal
gender and equity. On the other hand, it is essential that the evaluation itself has in each
stage of its development, both in the methodological design, development of questionnaires, analysis
of data, development of recommendations, etc., a strong integration and understanding of
These approaches.
Evaluation questions
For each criterion, a series of questions were developed to be answered by the team of
assessment. These questions are aligned with the purpose and evaluation objectives. It is key that
The evaluation team reviews the relevance and evaluability of each question in the initial part of the
evaluation and that proposes a methodology that allows to analyze in a complete and triangulated way
Each question. The evaluation team must submit an evaluation matrix in the initial report
Complete (see example in Annex 2) indicating how each question will be analyzed and measured,
through what variables, what indicators, with what sources of information and with what methods of
assessment.
The evaluation team can propose changes in additional questions and/or questions,
based on the documentary review and first consultations with key informants, but should
Explain and justify the proposed changes and these must be approved by the Management Committee
of the evaluation.

1.7 Methodological Design
The methodological design of the evaluation will be defined by the evaluation equipment. However,
Given the nature of the object to be evaluated, an approach to mixed methods is recommended. The design
127
Methodological should consider the planned use of the evaluation results and be aligned
to the purpose and evaluation objectives. The selection and adaptation of the object methodology
evaluated must be explained and justified in the initial report. As mentioned above,
An evaluation matrix must be provided that explains how each question will be answered
evaluation. The evaluation equipment must apply the data triangulation principle, to
ensure credibility and validity of the findings.
As mentioned above, the evaluation must analyze both cantons that were part
of the CAI program and that were certified as cantons that did not participate. The evaluation team
must establish and explain the selection of a canton sample that will be objects of the
assessment. The sample should be representative of the diversity of the cantons, in terms of
population size, geographical areas (central region, border areas, coast), urban/rural,
indigenous and Afro -descendant population, as well as well -being levels as indicated in the index
of well -being of childhood and adolescence.
Additionally, the methodology design must be as participatory as possible, feeding
of the perspectives, interests and needs of the relevant actors, both nationally that
local, and must include not only the public sector, but also other sectors involved, with the
Private sector, civil society and community representatives. Above all, the
way to guarantee the participation of children and adolescents, since the implementation of
public children and adolescence policies is an issue that directly impacts them and influences their
well -being and the guarantee of their rights. It is key that the evaluation team perform a mapping of
actors, based on the documentary review and first consultations, to establish the level of interest
and influence of each actor in the CAI program, and determine the main sources of information.
This mapping will guide methodological design and more information collection methods
adequate.
In addition to reviewing documents that will be shared with the evaluation team
(Cai key documents, regulatory frameworks, etc.), the evaluation team is expected to search
Actively other documents from several areas (academic, public, non-guineral, etc.)
national and international in relation to the CAI program and other programs related to
local childhood and adolescence policies. Especially, the evaluation equipment is expected
Compare the experience of Costa Rica with CAI experiences from other countries, to determine the
relevance, efficacy and sustainability of CAI in Costa Rica. This literature review is key to
Build a quality theoretical and methodological framework and propose recommendations and proposals
Evidence based.
As an evaluation instrument, the evaluation team must rebuild the change theory (TDC)
of the CAI program. This exercise will allow to explain the logic behind the CAI, that is how it is understood
that the establishment of the CAI program allows to produce a series of results that contribute
to the development of public policies in favor of the rights of children and adolescents in Costa
Rich The theory of change is a strategic instrument to determine the current situation,
What is the desired situation and what are the changes that have to be made to make the
transition between the two situations15. It is important that change theory reflects the factors
contextuals that allow or prevent change and establish the necessary conditions for their

realization (assumptions). The evaluation team must establish the change theory (TDC) of the
Cai program to guide the evaluation and, on the other hand, it would be important to socialize and validate this TDC
With the actors involved in the evaluation so that an instrument of reflection and
Strategic planning
The methodological design must also contemplate the eventual limitations in the evaluation and
Establish mitigation measures. It is important that the eventual evaluation team
Limitations in ethics and discusses the implications that those can have in the evaluation.
Information sources
The evaluation team must review several sources of information and as mentioned by the team
It must be proactive in the search for documents and review sources from several areas.
A part of the information will provide directly from the actors interviewed, of documents
regulatory and programmatic of the ANNA, of the monitoring reports of the ANNA and other data of
monitoring of different institutions.
As preliminary documents to be reviewed can be mentioned (available documents

1.8 EVALUATION RULES AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The evaluation will have to be aligned with the standards and standards of evaluation of the nations
Joined16 and will have an external and independent character and will be carried out in an objective way,
impartial, transparent and participatory, with integrity and professionalism, based on evidence
Empirically verified that it is valid and reliable.
The ethical principles that will guide the evaluation are those of respect, benefit and justice17. In addition,
It is essential that the evaluation team maintain respect for the dignity and diversity of the
people who are interviewed and who consider in the entire evaluation process respect for
Human rights, equity and gender equality18. The confidentiality of the
information and data of those involved respecting the rights to provide information in a form
confidential. At this point it is essential that the informed consent of the
participants when information is collected, especially when dealing with minors of
age.
The evaluation is expected to integrate the participation of children and adolescents, for which it is
essential that the evaluation team refers to the UNICEF guide in terms of ethical research
with boys and girls19. It is also necessary to minimize the risks associated with having negative effects
and maximize the benefits of the main actors providing unnecessary damages or damages that
They can derive from the findings of a negative or critical evaluation without compromising integrity
of the evaluation.
The evaluation must also comply with the UNICEF procedure in terms of standards
Ethics in research, evaluation, information collection and analysis20 and, according to the methodology
chosen, it must be reviewed by an external ethical review committee (UNICEF has a contract to
global level for external ethical reviews). In the case of interviewing minors, the review
Ethics by an external committee is mandatory and will be coordinated by UNICEF. The evaluation no
may proceed with data collection before having the approval of the Ethical Review Committee.
If the institution has its own ethical review mechanisms, they could replace the committee
external as long as these mechanisms meet the minimum quality standards
established in UNICEF policy. In its methodological proposal, the evaluation team must
Clearly indicate the possible ethical issues and specify the supervision and exam processes
Ethics applicable to the evaluation process. All people participating in the collection of
Information should have minimal ethical training.
Likewise, the evaluation team has the obligation to declare in writing all previous experience
his or his family that could lead to a conflict of interest and honestly treat the
conflicts of interest that could arise during evaluation.

1.9 Dissemination
The evaluation process is expected as participatory as possible, collecting comments and
Perspectives of the different parts throughout the evaluation. Once the report of
evaluation will socialize the main results and recommendations of the evaluation with the
different actors who participated in the evaluation. This socialization will be adapted to
different evaluation audiences.

The construction of the results chain constitutes a tool
research for the evaluation of programs and projects that seeks to improve the
quality of these, facilitating their management through detailed obtaining
Information regarding its activities and products (DNP, 2017).
In that sense, the results chain can be defined such as: “(…) the relationship

In this way, the structure of the results chain is explained in a form
Functionalist: initially there are supplies that through processes
(activities) become products (goods and services), which later
They generate results that help to fully or partially meet the objectives
(Mideplan, 2017).
A chain of results can be addressed by the level of inputs

15.7.2 MAPO OF ACTORS
The mapping of key actors (Mac) is a widely extended tool and
linked to social networks theory. This tool rests on the
assumption that social reality can be seen as if it were made up of
social relations where social actors and institutions participate
(Tapella, 2007).
Understood in this way, the MAC is a type methodological tool
‘Structural’ that basically allows you to quickly access the plot of
Social relations given in a given area. In this sense, it is useful for
address objective aspects (independent of the will of individuals),
expressed in the plot of relationships that are built on a reality
Specific, those that- in some way- configure fields of relationships between
Historically produced positions (Tapella, 2007).
With the mapping of actors, not only have a list of the different actors
who participate in an initiative, but to know their actions and the objectives of their
stake. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that in the mapping of actors
We must identify roles and powers of the most relevant social actors (Tapella,
2007).
193
To understand the concept of Mac it is also necessary to understand the concept
of social actors or "stakeholder" (in this case seen as synonyms). The
social actors can be people, groups or organizations that have interest
in a project or program. Key actors are usually considered as
those that can significantly influence (positively or negatively
intervention) or are very important for a situation to manifest
certain form (Tapella, 2007).
Following a tapella (2007) the steps for the Mac are:
