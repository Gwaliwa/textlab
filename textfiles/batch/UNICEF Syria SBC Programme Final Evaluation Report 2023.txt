RECOMMENDATIONS
Three recommendations are presented in this report.
RECOMMENDATION #1: To broaden synchronised participation and clarify the different roles that each
staff member needs to play within each programme to achieve synergies, it is recommended for the
UNICEF Syria SBC Section to: a) Provide training to increase understanding about SBC for sector-
level stakeholders and to support operations; b) Engage in a process of co-creating guidelines with
a focus on sharing resources for SBC programming; and c) Develop a detailed articulation for how
SBC programming specifically contributes to each sector’s results, thereby reinforcing the
programme’s validity and added value to the CO programme portfolio.
RECOMMENDATION #2: The UNICEF Syria SBC Section should contract a research institution or firm to
undertake broader FGDs with implementing partners to: a) Outline the current inconsistencies in
implementation; and b) Determine the critical levels of human and financial resources required to
deliver systematic approaches over the long-term.
RECOMMENDATION #3: The UNICEF Syria SBC Section should co-create the development of a multi-
sectoral ToC that includes: a) SBC Strategies; b) Outcome statements for each sector; and c) A list
of indicators, linked to and aligned with guidance issued by UNICEF HQ, that could be used to
measure the above and ensure regular follow up.

2. Background
2.1 Introduction
This report presents the formative evaluation of the Social Behaviour Change (SBC) Programme in
the UNICEF Syria Country Office (CO). The figure below shows the structure of the report, including
the background, purpose, objectives and scope, evaluation design and methodology, findings,
conclusions, recommendations, and annexes.
Figure 1: Structure of evaluation report.
The evaluation was undertaken remotely from May through October 2023 with the assistance of
Third-Party Monitors (TPMs), working inside the country.
Though it is recognised that some project activities are still ongoing, this evaluation covers
programme implementation from 2018 through 2022 with an annual Programme Effectiveness
Budget of USD 573,200, which draws from Other Regular Resources and Emergency Resources. This
evaluation report also complies with the UNICEF-Adapted Evaluation Report Standards1.
2.2 Context
2.2.1 Country Context
DEMOGRAPHY
The Syrian Arab Republic (SAR) is a country with a population of 18,276,000 (a 2021 estimate2),
consisting of five major ethnic groups (e.g., Arab 50%, Alawite 15%, Kurd 10%, Levantine 10%, and
other 15%).3 While the official language is predominantly Arabic, the population also speaks Aramaic,
Armenian, Circassian, English, French, and Kurdish. The country is primarily Muslim at 87% (includes

pg. 16
Sunni 74% and Alawi, Ismaili, and Shia 13%), and the remaining proportion of the population is
Christian at 10% (includes Nestorian, Orthodox, and Uniate), and Druze at three per cent.4
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
Due to an 11 year-long humanitarian crisis, Syria has become the largest forced population
displacement situation in the world since World War II. Over half of the country’s population has been
forcibly displaced; 6.9 million (2022) people have been affected by the humanitarian crisis.5 The
return migration has been small (0.56 million) compared with the total numbers of those displaced
(internally).6
For example, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the total
number of Syrians presently registered as refugees outside the country are over five million.7
Table 1: UNHCR Response for Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugee response is:
▪ 660,000 in Jordan,
▪ 805,000 in Lebanon,
▪ 3.36 million in Turkey,
▪ 263,000 in Iraq, and
▪ 45,000 in Egypt.
Syria used to be a lower middle-income country. During the 2000s, poverty rates were low.8
However, the destruction of physical capital, casualties and the breakup of economic markets has
had devastating consequences for Syrian economic activity. The World Bank estimates that the
losses in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2011 and 2016 sum to about four times the size
of the Syrian GDP in 2010.9 Currently, the Syrian economy suffers from two major deficits, including:
(1) depleted foreign exchange reserves; and (2) high public debt. Crisis-related disruptions and
international sanctions reduced Syrian exports by 92% between 2011 and 2015. 10 The current income
poverty rate is 79%.11

RELEVANT POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS
The table below illustrates the institutional frameworks pertaining to children, families, the right to
protection, and child-focused justice. A commissioned report, the National Child Protection System
and Alternative Child Care in Syria, notes that there is no overall Child Law. There are, however, reports
indicating that a Child Rights Law has been drafted and pending adoption since 2006.12 It is also
mentioned that there is an ‘upcoming Child Rights Bill’ issued in January 2019 within the ‘Committee
on the Rights of the Child reviews the situation of Children in Syria’.

In essence, an established policy framework supporting child rights exists, but due to the crisis, it is
not certain of the enforcement available policy instruments.
INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS
The crisis has also damaged the transport infrastructure significantly. The physical impact of the
crisis can be classified into two major categories: (i) damage due to exploding bombs and
ordinances, causing craters and surface depressions; and (ii) collateral damage due to falling debris
from destroyed buildings, road cuts, and checkpoints, making large sections of roads inaccessible
and restricting the movement of people and vehicles.
In addition, hospitals and schools have suffered under the crisis. United Nations organisations and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working inside Syria report an acute shortage of health
professionals. There is an especially acute shortage of female doctors (obstetricians and
gynecologists), which has severely restricted the provision of health care services for women.
As a result of the crisis, one out of three schools were either damaged, destroyed, or used as
collective shelters for internally displaced peoples (IDPs).13 A digital campaign was launched
highlighting UNICEF’s support to more than one million girls, boys, adolescents and young people
with health, nutrition, education, and child protection services. The campaign included the
production of a video, flyer, photos, stories, and news release that were dispatched at local, regional,
and international levels. 14
With declining revenues, the government decided to reduce its expenditures, first by dramatically
decreasing spending on subsidies. This, in turn, led to a significant increase in the prices of basic
food, water access, and fuel. The government also scaled down social security programmes to cope
with fiscal pressures. Access to mental health services were, and continue to be, limited which does
not support an entire generation of children showing signs of “toxic stress.” 15
2.2.2 Social Context16
The latest Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) took place in 2006.17 Given that this data source
is dated, information has been sourced and triangulated from United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, as they provide more recent estimates. A few relevant
indicators linked to UNICEF’s key programming sectors are included in this section, and those
indicators come from UNICEF’s data portal.
INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT OF GENDER EQUALITY
According to UNDP’s Human Development Index (2023), Syria ranks at the 119th with a value of 0.477
on the Gender Social Norms Index.

Women have a Maternal Mortality Ratio of 30 (per 100,000 live births) (Sustainable Development Goal-
SDG 3.1)18, and they share roughly 11% of parliamentary seats (SDG 5.5). The adolescent birthrate is
38.7% (SDG 3.7), and the literacy rate among youth19 (males and females) is 96%. According to UNDP,
approximately 37.1% of women have at least a secondary education20 (SDG 4.4), and only 15.6% of
females (aged 15 and older) participate in the labor force. The proportion of women aged 20-24 years
who were married or in a union before age 18 is 13% (SDG 5.3.1).21 Ninety-four percent of the
population has access to basic drinking water services, and 90% of the population use basic
sanitation services (SDG 1). 22
The table below offers additional data concerning health, nutrition, and immunisations, and this data
was derived from UNICEF’s data portal.23

It should be recognised that the available data may be inaccurate and therefore must be interpreted
with caution. For example, according to the UNICEF portal, there are numerous instances of
“acceleration needed’, especially for stunting, wasting, and immunisations, which simply means that
the data is not confirmed. 25

DISABILITY IN SYRIA
More than one in four individuals (28%) aged two and above have disabilities.26 According to research
on disability in Syria, there is a variance in the rates of persons with disabilities by region. 27 Over a
third of the population (37%) in North East Syria (NES) have disabilities, the highest of all four regions.
North Syria maintains the lowest prevalence of individuals with disabilities (19%), followed by Central
and South Syria (CSS) (27%) and 28% in North-West Syria (NWS). Like most countries, Syrian
households with members with disabilities face disproportionate societal and economic barriers.
Specificities surrounding the sex and age of children with disabilities are particularly relevant. For
example, the same research points to difficulties affecting males in particular in NES. In the NES,
young children (from ages 2 to 4) report higher than average rates of all functional difficulties,
compared to other regions, aside from behaviour control and vision. Likewise for children aged 5-17,
rates of all difficulty domains, except depression are highest in NES. Nearly one in four children (24%)
have difficulty accepting change in NES, compared to the eight percent national average. Similarly,
one in five (or 21 %) have issues related to behaviour control, which is about three times the seven
percent national average. Regional conflict and displacement dynamics, coupled with over a decade
of conflict undermine access to essential services for all households. Limited access to health or
disability-specific assistance has not only undermined the health of all community members, but
also has aggravated existing vulnerabilities.
Although females (aged older than 13) with disabilities represent only 16% of the total population
inside Syria, they comprise the majority (59%) of the widowed population. For example, one in five
females with disabilities above the age of 17 is a widow. 28
2.2.3 Gender Norms, Power, and Human Rights Considerations

the number of female heads of households, and especially “

they are in “dire need of nutritional assistance” and have limited
26 According to Inter-Agency Standing Committee Guidelines, the evolving concept of disability results from the interaction between persons with
impairments and attitudinal, institutional and physical environmental barriers, which hinders an individual from fully and effectively participating in
society on an equal basis with others, Disability domains are disaggregated into three age categories: (1) Adults aged 18 or older: hearing, vision, self-
care, mobility, communication, and cognition (2) Children aged five to 17: hearing, vision, self-care, walking, communication, learning, remembering,
concentrating, accepting change, anxious feelings, behaviour control, making friends, and feelings of hopelessness; and (3) Young children ages two
to four years: hearing, vision, walking, fine motor, communication, learning, playing, and behaviour control.

access to reproductive health care services.30 This group of women face the following pervasive
challenges:
1. early and forced marriages;
2. longstanding legal and customary discrimination challenging women’s access to housing and
inheritance;
3. unable to secure birth registration and nationality for their children;
4. overwhelming economic strife;
5. psychological scarring caused by the loss from the conflict;31
6. sexual and gender-based violence; and
7. increased homelessness and displacement after the 6 February 2023 earthquakes.32
2.3 Country Economic Development Strategies and Priorities
With a shrinking economy, combined with international sanctions, there is limited funding for the
delivery of social services. The negative effects from the crisis, economic deterioration, and the
February 2023 earthquake have also had adverse consequences on children's education and
psychological well-being. A multi-dimensional policy and service-oriented responses were deemed
necessary in 2019, and the Syrian government introduced 2030 Strategic Plan, which appears to be
aligned with the 2030 Agenda. The Plan has four pillars which are: (1) administrative reform and
promoting integrity; (2) growth and development; (3) infrastructure and energy; and (4) human
development.33 Similarly, the United Nation Strategic Framework has four outcomes, the most
relevant of which prioritises “improved, equitable, inclusive and safe access to quality basic
services.”34
2.4 Object of Evaluation
Stigmatisation, discrimination, alienation, among other inequities and deprivations, can have
complex and devastating effects on the health and welfare of children, families, and communities.
SBC and Community Engagement (CE) help to foster positive individual, social, and behaviour
change to improve well-being. UNICEF recognises SBC and CE as powerful tools to bring about
individual or societal change. For example, SBC and CE are featured prominently in UNICEF’s
Strategic Plan, 2022–2025. This strategic plan is a medium-term framework guiding the
organisation’s implementation of its mandate, including the achievement of long-term results in five

sustainable livelihoods, and inclusive and equitable socio-economic recovery; (3) Improved living conditions of displaced people, returnees, and
affected communities; and (4) Vulnerable peoples’ resilience is enhanced through increased institutional responsiveness in planning and providing

interconnected Goal Areas.35 These include that every child, including adolescents: (1) survives and
thrives with access to nutritious diets, quality primary health care, nurturing practices and essential
supplies (Health and Nutrition); (2) learns and acquires skills for the future (Education); (3) is
protected from violence, exploitation, abuse, neglect and harmful practices (Child Protection); (4)
has access to safe and equitable Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services and supplies, and
lives in a safe and sustainable climate and environment (Water and Sanitation); and (5) has access to
inclusive social protection and lives free from poverty (social protection and equity).
It is noted that UNICEF must employ nine different “change strategies” to propel or accelerate
medium-term results (Section B, paras 81-89), including SBC and CE.36 SBC is defined in the
Strategic Plan as “programmatic approaches addressing the cognitive, social, cultural, economic,
and structural determinants of rights violations, inequality, discrimination, mistrust, social divides
and broken social contracts, and harmful social norms and behaviours.” Hence, SBC and CE are the
means through which to contribute to positive social transformation and address challenges that
cut across and go beyond sectoral programming.37
2.4.1 The Beginnings of the UNICEF Syria SBC programme
The UNICEF Syria SBC programme started in 2015 mainly to respond to the polio outbreak and by the
beginning of 2018, the programme transitioned from a small programme focusing on “campaigns to
a fully-fledged programme addressing key priorities for social and behaviour change issues in Syria
in a systematic manner, further evolving into a primary care package, including routine
immunisation”.38 Indeed, the 2022-2024 Country Programme Document (CPD) highlights how SBC is
a “social and behaviour change communication strategy that addresses the interrelated causes of
social norms and practices that are harmful to children’s health, education, development and
participation.”39
2.4.2 Programme Outputs
As SBC is a cross-cutting programme, there is a Result Framework with an overarching goal
statement and corresponding strategies delineated, although the Results Framework follows the "3E
approach" – education, engagement, and empowerment through service.40 It is important to
understand that the UNICEF Syria SBC programme focuses on accelerating the results of the sectors.
When combining all sectors of (1) Routine Immunisations (RI) of children; (2) COVID-19 awareness and
the vaccination; (3) cholera response; (4) Integrated SBC/WASH programming; (5) Child Protection;
(6) Education; and (7) the UNICEF Syria Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) programme, the SBC
programme facilitates effective service delivery to help reach over 15 million people in Syria’s 14
governorates.41
35 E/ICEF/2021/25 of 4 August 2021, UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2022–2025, paras. 42-79.
36 The other change strategies are: (1) Advocacy and communications; (2) Data, research, evaluation, and knowledge management, (3) Digital
Transformation, (4) Gender transformative programming; (5) Innovation; (6) Partnerships and engagement with public and private; (7) Risk-informed
humanitarian and development nexus programming; and (8) Systems strengthening to leave no one behind.

and identify the determinants to effective group participation, management, and achievement of group objectives; and (2) Identifying (at an individual,
household, and community levels) specific social, cultural, and other drivers affecting the adoption of life-saving behaviour; and (3) Identifying areas
needing capacity strengthening; and UNICEF. (2022). Social & Behaviour Change at UNICEF, pg. 3.

The list of activities above is not intended to be exhaustive but simply provides an illustrative view
of how SBC is used to accelerate sector results.
2.4.3 UNICEF Syria SBC programme’s Funding Sources
As SBC is a cross-cutting programme, naturally, funding for activities comes from more than one
financial source, including: (1) within the sector budgets; and (ii) an annual programme effectiveness
budget.
The table below outlines the budgets for SBC within the respective sectors relative to the entire
programme budget from 2018 to 2022. The last column provides an average budget for SBC
activities and for the overall budget of programme activities. For all budget tables, the amounts
presented are in US dollars.

SBC interventions are embedded into the sectors. The figure below presents ten programme
performance indicators from the CO’s Programme Monitoring Framework. Apart from indicator #9,
all indicators have remained consistent from 2018 through 2022. It should be noted that two new
indicators linked to COVID-19 were introduced in 2022 (indicators #4 and #5, respectively).44

2.5 UNICEF Syria SBC programme Results Framework
From the UNICEF Syria SBC programme Strategy Note51, there is a description of the "3E approach"
in spite of not having a comprehensive ToC. This statement is,
“education, engagement, and empowerment (3E approach) through service, media and
community delivery platforms to achieve SBC while employing risk communication and
community engagement (RCCE) approaches and methods to be first, fast, and frequent to
deliver life-saving high impact practices at individual, family, community, organisational and
institutional level.” 52
While there are IF-THEN statements available in the UNICEF Syria SBC Programme Strategy Note,
they are not sufficiently organised into a Theory of Change and therefore omitted from this report.53
The UNICEF Syria SBC Programme Strategy Note also includes a Results Framework, which is
presented in the table below.
This Results Framework presents sector-specific behavioural outcome statements which indicate
expected specific desired attitudinal and behavioural changes after acquiring knowledge from RCCE
and SBC sessions.54 Given the focus on PLWs and the specification that "C4D indicators should be
disaggregated by wealth quintile, residence, age, sex, ethnic, religious, minority background, and
disability status", it appears that issues of equity and reaching vulnerable and most-at-risk children
and populations are also fully considered in the design of SBC programming.55 This observation is
further elaborated under the relevance finding.

3. Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, and Scope
3.1 Purpose73
The purpose of the assignment is to conduct an evaluation of UNICEF SBC programming and its
focus on key strategic priorities for UNICEF Syria which include COVID-19 awareness, routine
immunisation, integrated SBC/WASH programming, IYCF, and the cholera response. Overall, this is
an independent evaluation designed to support: (1) oversight and accountability; and (2)
organisational learning.
Given the multi-sectoral focus of these initiatives, the evaluation will help identify learning for both
individual sectors and cross-cutting approaches to help strengthen programming results for
children in Syria and reflect on those SBC strategies that have helped to accelerate outcomes for
children in Syria. The evaluation comes at an important time to inform the future strategic direction
of the SBC team, especially considering UNICEF Syria’s transition from emergency to post crisis
mode following the earthquake which took place in February 2023 as well as the upcoming Country
Programme Document in 2024. This evaluation reflects on approaches taken to date, their
successes, and identifies opportunities and forward direction.
3.2 Objectives
The objectives74 of the evaluation are to:
6. Review the design evolution and achievements of UNICEF Syria SBC programming by assessing
the relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency of specific approaches, and materials, in particular
community engagement system, and system strengthening;
7. Assess the main enablers and drivers for SBC in Syria as well as bottlenecks and barriers for
behaviour and attitudinal changes at household and community levels and identify
recommendations for programming approaches that are most effective in this context;
8. Identify opportunities for/adjustments needed by programmes and corresponding SBC material
to support the achievement of key results for children in alignment with the UNICEF Syria
Country Programme Document 2022-2024, Programme Strategy Note Communication for
Development (C4D) 2022-2024 and UNICEF Middle East and North Africa SBC-CE Regional
Strategy and Programme Guidance for 2022-2025, including an assessment of the Results
Framework (in particular challenges of measurability and attribution of results);
9. Assess the common understanding of SBC across UNICEF Syria programming, including how
UNICEF teams understand and utilise SBC approaches to achieve results and the added value of
any integrated approaches to date, with a view to identifying areas of good practice and scope
for improvements; and
10. As appropriate, provide real-time reflection on any emergency SBC activities and identify
transferable learning and success factors from recent responses.
73 This section is sourced directly from the Terms of Reference of the evaluation.
74 Ibid. page 3.
pg. 34
In essence, this evaluation is both a reflective exercise on what works in Syria and why, as well as a
forward-look on what are the building blocks for effective SBC, the enabling factors and how they
can deliver future results for children in Syria.
3.3 Scope
3.3.1 Substantive Areas
The scope of the evaluation of UNICEF Syria’s SBC programme covers the period from 2018 to 2022
across the 14 governorates in Syria, where UNICEF operates through six field offices75, and it focuses
on the prioritisation by the UNICEF Syria Country Office of specific thematic areas, including seven
key strategic priorities:
(8) RI of children;
(9) COVID-19 awareness and vaccination;
(10) Cholera response;
(11) Integrated SBC/WASH programming;
(12) Child Protection;
(13) Education; and
(14) IYCF.
Note that the earthquake response falls outside the scope of this evaluation.76
Moreover, according to the ToR, the evaluation will apply the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) evaluation criteria77 of
relevance, effectiveness and impact, efficiency, coherence/coordination, and sustainability (see
Annex 2). UNICEF’s evaluation criteria for compliance with international standards and equity,
human rights, and gender equality were also be applied.78
3.3.2 Expected Users of the Evaluation and Evaluation Dissemination
The expected users of the evaluation are UNICEF at country and regional levels. The evaluation has
a reference group which managed the evaluation process and ensured quality assurance. Also, in
line with the United Nations Evaluation Group Norms and Standards, a management response will be
prepared after this evaluation has been approved to: (i) enhance the use of findings; and (ii) follow-
up with the evaluation recommendations.79 The management response identifies who will be
responsible and what are the action points and specific deadlines. The evaluation findings will be
shared broadly with all stakeholders through UNICEF’s website.
3.3.3 Evaluation Design Approaches Used
To understand how the achievement of the outputs contribute to behavioral objectives and, in turn,
led to corresponding outcomes, the evaluation is theory-based, using a theoretical framework as a
guide. In addition, the evaluation uses a Process Evaluation (PE) approach which focuses on outputs
75 They governorates are: Damascus, Dara'a, As-Sweida, Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, AL Raqqa, DEZ, Homs, Idleb, Lattakia, Rural Damascus, and Tartous. Note
that rights holder data is missing from the Hama governorate.

and targets and especially how the resources from the three different programme components80 are
utilised. Part of this approach is also to understand whether activities were undertaken as planned,
to what extent does the role of coordination plays in implementation, what practical problems were
encountered, and the ways that challenges were resolved. Ultimately, the PE approach was used to
uncover the degree to which: (1) project activities were, and continue to be, implemented; (2)
whether intended beneficiaries are being serviced; and (3) if expected results have been achieved
since 2018.
A final evaluation approach, Utilisation-Focused Evaluation (UFE), appreciates stakeholder
contributions throughout the evaluation process. For example, stakeholders were engaged during
the stakeholder identification process, seeking their contributions, reflections, and substantive
feedback during report submissions and presentations. This information not only contributed to the
evaluation scope but also ensured that the evaluation met stakeholders’ specific needs.
In sum, the application of the Theory-based, PE, and UFE approaches produced a practical and
useful evaluation.
3.3.4 Key Evaluation Questions
In the original ToR, there were a total of 22 Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) categorised under the
six evaluation criteria noted above. See Annex 8.1 for the Terms of Reference for the list of the
original 22 KEQs. However, on 17 July 2023, UNICEF stakeholders met and reduced and revised the
KEQs through a facilitated discussion.81 The list of 12 KEQs (with three sub-questions) are presented
in the table below.

Country Office’s Evaluation Specialist.
82 The KEQ’s original wording included “future attribution”. For a cross-cutting programmatic area such as SBC, attribution is extremely challenging
methodologically. Given the time and resources available, it was not possible to follow a methodology, enabling the Senior Evaluator to attribute

4. Methodology
4.1 Data Sources
With a mixed methods design, the evaluation drew from qualitative and quantitative data from three
major sources: (i) a large number of documents, databases, and secondary data (including budget
data); and (ii) semi-structured interviews with UNICEF stakeholders and service providers; and (3) a
survey and some qualitative interviews with rights holders.
4.1.1 Documents, databases, & secondary data
An extensive list of documents, databases, and secondary data have been reviewed. See annex 8.4
for the list of resources consulted. An abbreviated list of all resources includes:
▪ UNICEF internal and external documents (e.g., AWPs, Country Office Annual Reports (COARs),
CPDs, and Report on Strategic Moment of Reflection-SMR Syria);
▪ UNICEF budget data for all sectors for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022;
▪ UNICEF analytical documents (i.e., Programme Strategy Note on C4D);
▪ Existing UNICEF Monitoring Data, such as:
o Indicator data for all sectors for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 as well as corresponding
targets;
o TPM reports for Health, cholera (including instruments used), and COVID;
o KAP assessments of COVID-19 vaccine (three rounds of data collection with MoH) and;
o cholera response plans.
▪ Major guidance available explaining programme design decisions (e.g., UNICEF SBC-Community
Engagement Strategy and Programme Guidance 2022-2025, Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC)
Field Guide, and 3E approach, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)
guidance);84
▪ Evaluation related guidance (i.e., Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System Handbook and
UNICEF SBC strategy on Inclusion of Children with Disabilities);
▪ Research, relevant evaluations, data, and assessments about the situation in Syria, such as:
o UNDP Arab Human Development Report;
o UNDP’s contributions to People with Disabilities (2021);
o UNICEF Syria Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices assessments for Back to Learning
(2022)
o UNICEF Syria Country Office Strategic Shift Evaluation (2021); and
o UNICEF Syria IYCF Evaluation (2022).

groups in this evaluation, namely (1)
UNICEF staff (at country office and
regional office level), (2) service providers,
and (3) community member rights holders.
The UNICEF office at regional level, or
MENARO, is in Amman Jordan. For the
UNICEF staff within the UNICEF Syria
Country Office, duty bearers, and rights
holders, there are three regions. (See
figure.) Region 1 includes Aleppo, Hama,
Idlib, Latakia, and Tartus. Region 2 entails
Ar-Raqqa, DEZ, and Al Hasaka. Region 3
includes Al-Suwayda, Dara’a, Damascus,
Rural Damascus and Quneitra.85
The UNICEF field office staff worked in the areas of: (1) Immunisations, (2) COVID/cholera/WASH, (5)
Education; (6) Child Protection, and (7) IYCF. The List of Persons Consulted is in Annex 8.5.
4.3 Sampling Strategies
4.3.1 UNICEF staff
The section describes the sampling frame for each stakeholder group, who gathered what data,
rationale for their selection, and number of respondents sampled. As the Senior Evaluator was
unable to travel to Syria, a TPM team was assembled to collect qualitative and quantitative data in
country. The evaluation adopted a multi-stakeholder consultation process by interviewing a total of
22 UNICEF staff remotely from 2 through 24 August 2023 from regional, country office, and field
office levels.
The interviewees included two staff members from MENARO, the former SBC Unit Chief from 2019
to 2022 to ascertain institutional memory context data, six SBC staff, and the remaining 13 UNICEF
staff members from the sectors. The selection strategy was purposive and convenient. With the
aid of the Deputy Representative and the Chief Field Officers (CFOs), the selection process for
participating UNICEF staff members was seamless. The CFOs were asked to nominate three
programme staff from each respective Field Office in the areas of education, H&N/IYCF, child
protection, WASH (COVID-19/cholera), and ADAP.86 As noted in the limitations section, due to human
resources constraints, the number of staff from the DEZ field office is limited. The total number of
remote interviews is 22, averaging between 50 to 60 minutes, and there is a fairly balanced
representation of sectors and gender (see table below).
85 The categorization of governorates into three regions is only for the purpose of this evaluation.
86 There were attempts to interview a staff member in ADAP but were not successful.

4.3.2 Service Providers/Duty Bearers
Data collection for service providers and rights holders (community members) was undertaken in all
three regions, and the TPMs carried out this portion of primary data collection with duty bearers and
rights holders. The TPMs were provided with a sampling strategy for the estimated number of
service providers to interview within each sector87 and each governorate. While the selection
strategy was also purposive and convenient, the gender balance of the sample intended to have an
equal representation of males and females. The overall sample was kept small, intentionally.
The SBC staff members supplied the names and contacts of Service provider organisations, and this
information was, in turn, supplied to the TPMs.88 The organisations from which the TPMs collected
data included: Charity and Social Services Society, Fouadi, Syrian Society for Social Development
(SSSD), and SARC. The geographical areas covered included: Dara'a, As-Sweida, Aleppo, Idleb,
Tartous, Rural Damascus, and Damascus. Ultimately, there were 25 in-person interviews, averaging
between 35 to 60 minutes.

Crescent Society (SARC), and Palestine Red Crescent society (PRCS). Similarly, under Region 1, the duty bearers supporting WASH include Al Zahraa
NGO partners, SARC, and Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch (GOPA).

4.4 Data Collection
4.4.1 Translation, TPM Orientation, & Pre-Testing
With translation support from UNICEF’s PME section, the data collection instruments were
translated and discussed with the TPMs. See Annex 8.6 for all instruments. To further prepare for
the in-country data collection process, an orientation was provided to the TPMs on August 6th and
7th, remotely. A participatory approach was used with PowerPoint slide decks to:
(1) Provide a detailed explanation about qualitative methods and how to carry out basic
techniques;
(2) Review all the quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, which were translated int
Arabic beforehand; and
(3) Give an overview of the ethical protocols which must be effectively carried out.
Shortly after the orientation, the TPMs pretested the instruments and sought feedback from the
Senior Evaluator. The TPM service entered survey questions into KOBO Toolbox. In essence, all
instruments were pre-tested prior to their standardised use.
4.4.2 Ethical Clearence
This evaluation adhered to all relevant ethical principles and the Disability-Inclusive Evaluations
Standards.90 Prior to initiating any data collection, the Senior Evaluator secured Ethical Clearance
from HML IRB Research and Ethics. The Ethical Clearence letter is located in Annex 8.7.
The following principles were upheld:
89 This could include physical, mental, emotional, hearing impaired, deaf, and blindness.

Informed Consent. At the beginning of all instruments, there is a statement about:
1) the purposes of data collection,
2) confidentiality or data privacy and data protection (information not shared with anyone
outside of the TPMs),
3) the information provided would be combined with the data from other stakeholders to
produce findings, conclusions, and recommendations to help UNICEF provide better
services,
4) the fact that there were no right or wrong answers to the questions,
5) participation was completely voluntary and will in no way affect them or their family’s access
to any assistance, and
6) the respondent had the right to stop the interview/FGD at any time.
After the statement, participants were only required to confirm verbally that they understood the
statement and that they were willing to proceed before they could answer any questions.
Health and safety. All TPMs took precaution measures, especially for in-person data collection. The
venues chosen for conducting KIIs and FGDs was safe to access and primarily outside or at a location
with ventilation.
It was mandatory to report abuse of children. If abuses and any other illegal acts were mentioned
in KIIs and FGDs, the TPMs would report them to UNICEF directly and immediately.
Evaluation Design. The design of the evaluation, and corresponding data collection tools, took into
account the rights, welfare and wellbeing of children and adolescents, in that no children or minors
under age 18 were consulted, approached, or interviewed.
Disability-Inclusive Standard. The evaluation design includes participants with disabilities, women,
and other vulnerable groups. Both the duty bearer’s and rights holder’s samples have calculations
for the number of persons with disabilities (PWDs). During data collection, the TPMs offered
accommodations within their capacity.
Data. For community members, no names were noted. All FGD data will be anonymized, and none of
the participants were identifiable. For service providers, however, the Senior Evaluator requested
that names were collected. Any recorded audio information from KIIs (with UNICEF staff) was
deleted at the end of the evaluation process. All data saved and stored in computers and drives was
password-protected.
4.4.3 Data Collection and Entry Process
The data collection process lasted two weeks, after which the survey data (from KOBO Toolbox) was
shared with the Senior Evaluator for data analysis. For qualitative data, the KIIs and FGDs were audio
recorded (using a phone or machine) first, and then the TPMs produced close notes in Arabic.91 An
independent translator, managed by the evaluation, was responsible for translating the qualitative
data.
91 The notes were not verbatim.
pg. 43
4.5 Analysis
As noted above, both quantitative and qualitative data were leveraged for this evaluation. The
qualitative data from remote interviews with UNICEF key informants and the TPM’s in-country
primary data complemented the secondary data. Other evidence included compiled data from TPM’s
reports from 2018 through 2022, budget information, and internal UNICEF documents.
Data analysis includes three different methods, namely:
1. Content Analysis/Qualitative Analysis;
2. Descriptive Statistical Analysis; and
3. Triangulation.
4.5.1 Content and Qualitative Analysis
Content analysis uses stakeholder’s responses from interview guides to identify common trends and
patterns as well as divergences on certain issues. The notations are uploaded into a software
package (QDA Minor) and coded according to the different content areas that are consistent with the
evaluation criteria. After coding the qualitative data, the content analysis: (i) summarised the
process data for SBC work in the governorates; (ii) examined the extent to which activities addressed
needs; (iii) revealed how SBC is perceived by various stakeholders; and (iv) generated a list of
challenges hindering the relevance and effectiveness of SBC activities (or the factors impeding
community member’s ability to proactively taking care of his/her own health and the health of the
child).
4.5.2 Descriptive Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to highlight differences between: (i) targets (number of people
reached or engaged) and (ii) the actual number of people reached. In addition, descriptive statistics
outlined the extent to which the sector budget was allocated to SBC, thereby demonstrating the
proportion of funding sp0ent on SBC-related activities relative to the sector's overall budget
portfolio. This type of analysis underlines the extent to which resources were (or were not) sufficient
for programming.
Descriptive statistics were also used to understand the preferred communication channels and
summarised attitudes about: (1) whether SBC information was used to make a decision about
adopting a health seeking practice; (2) behaviour change among rights holders; and (3) whether a
type of information was adaptable to suit someone with a disability.
4.6 Limitations
The evaluation limitations, and the steps taken to counter their effects, are presented in this section.
• Limited perspectives from SAR stakeholders. In many international evaluations where
participatory approaches are central to the process, the government stakeholders are typically,
but not always systematically, included in the evaluation process.92 Indeed, participatory
approaches were incorporated into this evaluation’s design, data collection, analysis, and
92 Cullen, A. E., Coryn, C. L. S., & Rugh, J. (2011). The politics and consequences of including stakeholders in international development evaluation.
American Journal of Evaluation, 32(3), page 352. This study revealed that government stakeholders typically participate in international development
evaluations 53% of the time.
pg. 44
recommendations co-creation processes, thereby soliciting input from UNICEF staff members,
rights holders, and service providers. However, the contributions of government stakeholders
were not prioritised due to challenges with time required for approvals, which are a key limitation
for evaluative work in Syria. Also, there have not been government partners who have engaged
in SBC programming in a sustained way. This issue is only raised, because the absence of
participation of government stakeholders who are primary duty bearers may be seen as an
evaluation limitation. For example, the UNICEF GEROS Handbook mentions the need for the
evaluation to have a clear and relevant description of the duty bearers (state and non-state
actors with responsibilities regarding the intervention).93 Understandably, this principal is
intended to ensure that power and fairness are equally distributed amongst all relevant
stakeholders.
• Staff absence, high staff turnover, and therefore a lack of data regarding institutional
memory. There were three new staff members who joined the UNICEF Syria SBC programme
team during the evaluation process, and so their experiences of carrying out SBC activities in
their UNICEF staff member roles may have been limited. To counter this limitation, the
evaluation included interview data from two UNICEF staff members who had institutional
knowledge from 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the DEZ field office was also experiencing significant
staff shortages, and so the perspectives of UNICEF staff from this field office are comparably
underrepresented. This constraint was also offset with interview data from staff members who
transferred from DEZ to their new posts within the last six months.
• Security. Some TPMs were unable to travel to certain locations due to security concerns. In
such cases, the interviews and surveys were increased in other locations, ensuring that the
estimated sample needs were met.
• Skewed survey sample. Survey sample represents mainly women. In spite of the specific
sample parameters, necessitating half female and male, the majority (94%) was female, thereby
minimising the views and perspectives of men. A similar issue may be noted for individuals with
disabilities, as there is limited data related to the views and perspectives of those who fall into
this vulnerable group category. Few techniques were available to reduce the effects of these
constraints.
• Limited data on partnerships. It was intended that the IPs would provide data about: (i) how
their partnerships work; (2) the extent to which they contributed to the design and
appropriateness of SBC activities (including messages); and (iii) their perspectives about what
helps and hinders effective partnerships while implementing SBC activities. However, the
qualitative data collected was not sufficient to address comprehensively the sub-question under
KEQ #1 (or KEQ 1.1).94
93 UNICEF. (2020). UNICEF Evaluation Office. Global Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS), page 24.
94 The sub-question was: “How did partnerships contribute to the design and appropriateness of SBC activities?”

5. Findings
This section presents the findings for the evaluation criteria of (1) relevance, (2) effectiveness/
impact, (3) efficiency, (4) coherence/coordination, (5) sustainability; and (6) rights, gender, and
equity.
5.1 Relevance
KEQ 1: How appropriate were the designs, approaches, and targeting of the SBC strategies to
address the needs and priorities of the targeted population(s) and address the desired
social/behaviour change? How did partnerships contribute to the design/appropriateness of SBC
activities?
KEQ 2: How have the UNICEF Syria’s SBC programme strategies been adapted and changed over
time to different contexts within Syria?
Sub Question
KII 1.1: How did partnerships contribute to the design/appropriateness of SBC activities?
This section addresses the KEQ 2 regarding the evolution of SBC programming first and then
elaborates on the importance of SBC designs and approaches. Due to limitations in data availability,
KEQ 1.1 could not be addressed.
Since 2018, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities have been adapted to increase
the effectiveness of multiple sectors within the CO programme, and the 2022-2024
CPD even highlights how the design and approaches of SBC are cross-cutting and
FINDING therefore integrated, thereby adhering to the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025.
The data confirms that the design(s) and implementation of UNICEF Syria SBC
1
programme activities are adequately embedded into sectors and consistent with
UNICEF guidance, although there is a lack of a description, at the strategic level,
outlining exactly the role of SBC within UNICEF programming documents.
Nevertheless, duty bearers and rights holders have positive perceptions about SBC
activities.
5.1.1 How has the UNICEF Syria SBC programme evolved over time?
As mentioned earlier, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme in UNICEF Syria started in 2015 to help
respond to the 2018 polio outbreak and then, the programme was adapted to help with routine
immunisations, especially in the North East. UNICEF Syria’s 2022-2024 CPD includes SBC as a
change strategy, thereby adhering to the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025, which defines SBC as
“programmatic approaches addressing the cognitive, social, cultural, economic, and structural
determinants of rights violations, inequality, discrimination, mistrust, social divides and broken
pg. 47
social contracts, and harmful social norms and behaviors.”95 Evidence and interviews with UNICEF
stakeholders confirm that SBC programming is integrated into different contexts within Syria to:
1. Scale up efforts in RI (including polio) and hygiene promotion (i.e., WASH);
2. Increase awareness about the risks of COVID-19 and identify needs for the distribution of the
COVAX vaccine;
3. Expand the reach of the UNICEF Syria IYCF;
4. Coordinate the cholera response;
5. Support a smaller scale MRE programme; and
6. Execute a national Back to Learning (BTL) campaign.96
All such efforts will be discussed in further detail in this report.
5.1.2 Integrating SBC into the sectors
The UNICEF guidance stresses the importance of: (1) consulting and involving the community to
improve service delivery; and (2) coordinating with partners to maximise impact and minimise
geographical and programmatic duplication.97 Qualitative analysis of interview data from UNICEF
staff members from the SBC programme, health and nutrition, and Education highlights clear steps
undertaken to embed SBC into the sectors, including: (1) assessment; (2) working to produce the
Project Document (PD); (3) coordinating activities; and (4) collecting data for follow up. Each step
includes qualitative statements:98
1. Assessment:
a. “Community engagement, including conducting awareness sessions, especially in
the camps”;
b. “For example, most of the time we build interventions on the data collected by SBC
programmes. This is the first step…. Sometimes the data is so old, then we do an
assessment through door-to-door inquiries. What kind of ECE interventions that
need to happen…. If the child has older brothers and sisters.”
2. Working together to formulate the Project Document (also referred to as the ‘PD’):
a. “preparing a micro-plan” that could include ”capacity building” with, volunteers and
others who are part of the “community network.”
3. Coordinating activities and agreeing on using messages:
a. “We coordinate with “x” SBC Officer – who takes over the part related to SBC – with
volunteers and the assistance from facilitators. We rent a venue to teach the
volunteers how to work with the community. We provide them with a form to collect
data and register the children / students willing to go to the learning center.”

Ministry of Health); KAP assessments for Back to Learning (BTL); and the cholera response plans.

98 It should be noted that UNICEF staff members from the Child Protection and WASH sectors did not contribute to this part of the finding.
pg. 48
b. “This SBC activity is monitored by the SBC – we work with them hand in hand – the
detailed training of the volunteers….We provide them with the messages that should
be used..”
4. Monitoring, data collection, and follow up:
a. “For example….we had a good job with the SBC person. We did a good implementation
with the BTL (close follow up). We had good results. We know from the number of
students who registered our non-formal programme. This means that it was
successful. For example, we worked together; x did the communication part and the
behavioral change part. We did the questionnaire together; x also went with them to
see how the volunteers were doing the activities on the ground.…then there was
follow up..” 99
In sum, the data shows how SBC is integrated into the sectors through assessment, PD formulation,
coordination, data collection, and follow up. It is important to note that all such steps are consistent
with the SBC FIELD OPERATIONS GUIDE, although few stakeholders were aware of their existence. This
issue is further discussed in section 5.4 Coherence/Coordination.100
5.1.3 Limited Documentation of integrating SBC into the sectors
In spite of the focused steps in designing and implementing SBC activities, however, there are few
documents which include descriptions of operational models, staffing, resourcing, and partnerships
involved in SBC programming. “In 2019, the Syria Country Office conducted an internal moment of
reflection called the Programme Planning Meeting (PPM), which was organised with the participation
of Regional Offices and HQ colleagues, to bring together perspectives and reach collective
agreement at all levels on strategies for medium-term country engagement. This was followed by
the development of draft sectoral strategy notes to prompt some initial crystallisation on key
sectoral issues arising from the discussions at the PPM, but also to further reflect on some initial
cross-sectoral themes that the CO felt had to be mainstreamed in a much more thorough way to
respond to the Syrian fluid environments (e.g. youth and adolescents, community participation,
gender, and demand as a crucial side of resilience interventions).”101 In 2022, Programme Notes for
Education, Child Protection, Health, Nutrition, and WASH included language in support of restoring
social services. However, a qualitative review of these documents reveals that with exception of the
Health Programme Note, the role of SBC – using it to increase demand for services or in support
effective service delivery, was virtually absent.102

5.1.4 Positive Perceptions About SBC
Finally, it is evident from the data collected that SBC activities are perceived in a positive way or are
considered relevant. For example, duty bearers consider SBC activities to be very important, as
“people today accept dealing with [health] issues”, and therefore appreciate the messages. It was
also highlighted that the demand for communications-related services is consistent. For example,
a stakeholder reported, “one important thing we noticed is that people keep coming to our
campaigns and awareness sessions”.103 In addition, rights holders are generally satisfied with the
quality of support provided, as presentations in the sessions are “clear”, “understandable”, and the
treatment of the service providers is “excellent”. Even those who’s language is not Arabic (i.e.,
Kurdish), reported that communication was clear.104
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In sum, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities have been adapted to increase the effectiveness
of multiple sectors within the Syria country programme. Not only is SBC described in UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2022-2025 as a “strategic element”, but also it’s appropriately featured the 2022-2024
CPD. SBC programming is integrated into different contexts within Syria, and clear steps are taken
to embed SBC into the sectors, including assessment, producing the PD, coordinating activities, and
collecting data for follow up. However, few documents have descriptions of operational models,
staffing, resourcing, and partnerships involved in SBC programming in spite of conscientious steps
to embed SBC activities in sector-specific programmes. Nonetheless, stakeholders perceive SBC
activities in a positive way.
KEQ 3: Going forward, what are the key approaches and enabling factors for UNICEF SBC to
ensure relevance?
FINDING While the SBC priorities for programming activities are inconsistent or are unclear (as
presented in Finding 1), SBC activities are dutifully executed in a somewhat integrated
2 manner. However, there is mixed data, due to multiple interpretations about how to
carry out SBC activities, and so it is not possible to identify or isolate the key
approaches or promising practices that reinforce programme relevance.
While the uneven programme implementation may be linked to Syria’s diverse working
environments, it is nonetheless not possible to confirm what approaches would reflect the
promising practices that reinforce programme relevance or effectiveness. Such information,

however, is important for the programme’s future strategy, and strategic guidelines could, in turn,
ensure the use of systematic approaches.
Qualitative data from duty bearer service providers indicates there are multiple interpretations
about how to go about organising and implementing UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities. For
example, the frequency and duration of SBC sessions are not standardised, and the integration of
messages is uneven. When rights holders were asked about the frequency of SBC sessions offered
in their communities, responses ranged from “don’t know” to “sessions are not announced’ to “weekly”
to “every fortnight”.105 Similarly, data from KIIs with duty bearers, rights holders, and UNICEF staff
indicate that while it depends on the location, health-related “sessions are held by a mobile medical
team” or “are given to those present at the clinics as they arrive”. In fact, duty bearers reported
“Choosing suitable times to carry out the activities” when they were asked about ways to improve the
effectiveness of sessions. 106
The duration of sessions is also variable. One duty bearer noted that “We provide a daily awareness
and discussion session of no more than 30 minutes and no less than 15 minutes. The sessions are
shortened in terms of time by condensing messages in case the ladies are unable to wait. The session
is similar to a lecture, but the ladies ask questions and express their opinion on a topic”.107
Moreover, while some sectors are fully integrated, including the presentation of health and
“epidemics, hygiene, home sterilisation (for water), and raising family awareness to deal with health
problems”108 other sectors are not. A content analysis indicates that duty bearers reported
combining messages about COVID-19, cholera, hygiene, handwashing, hepatitis, and breastfeeding
in one session. However, child protection duty bearers reported combining topics related to
education, health, and ethics only. In the case of education, the duty bearer only spoke about
education and child protection.109
Regarding enablers for successful integration, SBC grey literature and UNICEF Guidance underscore
the strategic importance of partnerships in SBC programming. Not only are institutional-level
partnerships critical, but also community-level collaboration is useful in ensuring SBC relevance.
For example, UNICEF has a partnership framework with IPs who work with community health
workers, religious leaders, young people, and other influencers advocated the advantages of RI, BTL,
polio vaccinations, and handwashing.110
Apart from partnerships, other enablers include: (1) strong duty bearer capacity; (2) public trust and
acceptance of vaccines; (3) a consistent supply of services, including appropriate infrastructure
(i.e., electricity, water, health services access, and reliable supply chains); (4) adequate funding for
transport, (5) strong coordination among partners and sectors; and (6) effective community

engagement structure and mechanisms. 111 Ensuring relevance also demands a commitment to
monitoring and evaluation, which features systematic monitoring of behavioural drivers (i.e.,
attitudes, norms, beliefs, feelings, and perceptions) and limiting the reliance on formal evaluation
processes to monitor desired behaviour changes.
Concluding Remarks
Indeed, the section presenting findings under relevance has outlined the extent of: (i) internal
consultation within UNICEF to design and implement SBC activities; and (ii) external consultations
with partners and communities to improve the delivery of sector-based services and programmes.
It is evident that there is an appreciation for SBC activities, as noted in the UNICEF Syria’s 2022-2024
CPD and as described by UNICEF staff, duty bearers, and rights holders. However, there ought to be
a detailed articulation for how SBC programming contributes specifically to each sector’s results112,
as the absence of such information could limit the validity or diminish the value of SBC’s contribution
to the overall country programme portfolio. Moreover, there are multiple interpretations about how
to go about organising and implementing UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities, as there is no set
schedule for sessions, the duration of sessions varies, and there is uneven programme integration
within the sectors. Such mixed data in SBC priorities and implementation creates difficulties in
identifying promising practices that reinforce programme relevance. Finally, this section has
extracted from grey literature and presented a list of enablers which UNICEF Syria SBC programme
relevance.
5.2 Effectiveness/Impact
KEQ 4: To what extent did SBC activities achieve the set targets?
Sub Questions
KII 4.1: How effectively do these targets function in terms of reflecting SBC achievements?
KII 4.2: What adjustments can be made to M&E to better support future contribution?
While Finding 5 discusses the extent to which planned targets were reached (due to programme
achievements), this section discusses the extent to which targets were used as management tools
to monitor progress.

There were targets used to monitor progress from 2018 to 2022 for six out of ten
indicators, owing to unforeseen circumstances (i.e., COVID-19 and discontinued
programmes). On the one hand, six (out of ten) indicators included targets which
FINDING
changed relatively consistently from year to year, indicating that they were used to as
management tools.
3
On the other hand, however, three indicators were not adjusted annually to
accommodate changes in the number of persons reached, but they are still set at levels
which effectively measure performance. Ultimately tracking the same indicator over
time is central to understanding overall outreach trends.
When one reviews indicators and corresponding targets, this action is the first step to
understanding implementation progress within a given sector. As noted under the section
Indicators Measuring Progress, there are ten SBC-related indicators used to determine progress
made toward the achievement of planned results within the Country Programme. The purpose of
setting and reporting against target data is to establish a measurable goal, encourage efficiency,
and track any delays. While targets were assigned annually, only seven out of the ten targets
included tracked data for all four years from 2018 to 2022. This is primarily because: (1) two indicators
measured achievements concerning COVID-19, which only began in 2020; and (2) one indicator
focused on the progress of a programme that was discontinued after one year (Indicator #10:
Number of girls, boys, women and men benefitting from child protection. awareness raising and
community events). This section illustrates figures for nine targets with the number of people
reached from 2018 to 2022. All data is from the UNICEF Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.

promotion messages
For indicators #1 and #2 (see above), the targets are set at effective levels, as the number of people
reached with immunisation messages or through polio campaigns or is either slightly above or below
the target. The targets for all indicators reviewed appear to be relevant and realistic. For Indicator
#3 (see table below), the targets appear to be adjusted annually, as they are very close to the number
of PLWs reached.

For the indicators referring to COVID-19 interventions, the targets are only tracked from 2020 to
2022, which is logical. The targets are somewhat constant for 2020 and 2021, but in 2022, the
estimated number of people targeted and reached for number of people engaged on COVID-19
through RCCE actions (Indicator #4) rises steeply due to the cholera epidemic. This trend shows that
there were likely regular data consultations and reviews regarding progress made towards goals.
The target estimates for Indicator #5, the number of people reached on COVID-19 through messaging
on prevention and access to services, indicates an extensive outreach, ranging from 13.9 million to
14.6 million. The indicator used to measure messaging for the prevention of COVID19 was likely used
for external reporting rather than for internal monitoring.

The targets developed for indicators #6 and #7 appear to be close to the number of those people
reached and therefore were tools to proactively monitor progress and achievements over time. As
for Indicator #8, the target was adjusted each year to accommodate changes in the number of
people reached with MRE activities. For 2022, the distance between the projected target and the
actual reach is the smallest. Finally, indicators #8 and #9 are unique, in that they include

disaggregated data for “women, men, boys, and girls.”113 However, targets are only monitored for the
total number of people reached.
The target for Indicator #9 (child protection interventions) was another example, wherein it was not
adjusted to accommodate changes in the number of persons reached. The target stayed within the
range of 350,000 to 375,000.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The evaluation reviewed targets used to monitor progress from 2018 to 2022, and most indicators
(six out of ten) included targets that were most likely used to as management tools. A small number
of indicators (three out of ten) remained relatively unchanged over the years. The practice of
tracking indicators with the same variable(s) is a standard practice that ought to be continued, as
ultimately this simplifies one’s ability to undertake a trends analysis. This is key to understanding
trends in SBC outreach.
FINDING While there is a Results Framework for the UNICEF Syria SBC programme, the lack of a
comprehensive ToC presents challenges in: (i) monitoring the carefully formulated
4
efforts invested into the programme activities; and (ii) communicating programme
progress and results in a cohesive manner.
In the relevance section, it is highlighted that having a detailed articulation for how SBC
programming contributes specifically to each sector’s results could advance the relevance of SBC
within the Syria country programme portfolio. It was also noted under the section 2.5 Results
Framework that while there is an overarching statement that follows the "3E approach" – education,
engagement, and empowerment through service, there is no ToC which combines SBC
programmatic strategies and then links them to expected changes in knowledge, attitudes, self-
efficacy, and expected behaviour change.
While the Results Framework includes qualitative indicators for expected knowledge and behaviour
change for rights holders and duty bearers, these indicators are not used to track progress in a
comprehensive manner. Nonetheless, not only would having a ToC better support the UNICEF Syria
SBC programme’s future contribution to the CO’s programme portfolio, but a participatory process,
involving the UNICEF sector staff in the development of the ToC, would support progress monitoring,
management of expenditures, and evaluative efforts. Therefore, the SBC unit should formulate a
ToC that adequately reflects strong programme efforts in a cohesive manner.
KEQ 5: To what extent did the SBC strategy contribute to the achievements of country
programme results?
Recall that SBC programming is integrated into different programmatic contexts, namely:
113 The indicators were Number 8 “Number of girls, boys, women and men reached with [Mine] Risk Education activities.” And Number 9 “Number of
women, men, girls and boys reached by behaviour change. communication interventions for child protection issues.”

• upscaling efforts in RI (including polio) and hygiene promotion (i.e., WASH);
• increasing awareness about the risks of COVID-19 and identifying needs for the distribution of
the COVAX vaccine;
• expanding the outreach of IYCF;
• coordinating the cholera response;
• supporting the MRE programme; and
• administrating the BTL.
The UNICEF Syria SBC programme ’s contribution to each sector is discussed in this section;
Additionally, this report uses the following analytical framework to present the extent to which the
UNICEF Syria SBC programme contributed to sector-specific achievements:
1. Outreach of SBC activities: This includes the number of people reached or engaged, as per the
indicator data available (see Section 2.4.2 Programme Outputs);
2. Knowledge: This includes independent information from the evaluation about the degree to
which rights holders have increased their knowledge in a sector (if available); and
3. Behaviour change: This includes independent information about the degree to which positive
behaviours are practiced by rights holders as a result of engaging in the programme (if available).
Where noted, some sectors do not have sufficient information available to comprehensively
demonstrate programme results.
10.2.1 Polio, Routine Immunisations, & WASH
As mentioned earlier, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme began as a polio eradication intervention.
In 2019, the DEZ governorate114 received the second largest number of internally displaced persons
(IDPs) returnees, the majority of whom were from Al Hasaka governorate, making this area one of
UNICEF’s priorities.
UNICEF implemented a then called, “Communication for Development (C4D) Initiative” which had
three phases (a first phase in November and December 2018, a second one in January and February
2019 and a third one in March and April 2019). The aim of this inter-sectoral programme was to: (i)
identify children who dropped out or missed immunisations and refer them to the nearest health
center (with referral cards given to the families); (ii) identify children out of schools and refer them
to an education pathway; and (iii) carry out a comprehensive integrated community awareness
[campaign] about issues related to Health (immunisation), Nutrition (IYCF), Education (BTL); and (iv)
support WASH (hygiene promotion); and MRE.115
The implementation modality included door-to-door visits, awareness sessions in schools and
mosques, meeting with key influencers and community leaders, and the distribution of Information,
Education and Communication (ICE) materials.
114 Locations within the Deir-Ez-Zor Governorate included Tabia, Khusham, Mazlom, Marrat, Hatla, Husainiyah, Al Asharra, Mayadi, and Abu Kamal.

Syria, page 2; and UNICEF. (2019). Country Office Annual Report 2018: Syria, page 2.
pg. 57
Internal documents and data from stakeholder interviews indicate that the community engagement
activities helped to identify “children who are either dropped out or at risk of dropping out of schools”
to then provide them with information which best suits education needs. Such information included
options such as curriculum B116, non-formal learning, and self-learning accelerated courses.117 As an
example of SBC work, one of the Annual Reports reported that “achievements from integrating the
“C4D campaign” to support behaviour change and mobilise communities– especially in North Eastern
Syria – was deemed “successful in reaching more than 600,000 households.”118 Morevoer, it was within
this context that over 2.6 million children (50% girls) received the polio vaccine with integrated
provision of Vitamin A, through the national immunisation days.119
Trend analyses from 2018 to 2022 reveal that SBC programming has acquired strong
gains in all sectors, reaching, and sometimes exceeding some the targets, where they
were tracked.
FINDING
There is only one SBC indicator for WASH, and it is not reflected in the CO Results
Framework, and was therefore not tracked from 2018 to 2022.
5
There appears to be some awareness about the need for RI, and polio ranks the highest
as needing a vaccine on a regular basis. SBC information and messages not only helped
rights holders to increase their knowledge about RI, but also such activities supported
them in making the decision to seek RI and oriented them about where to take their
children.
PROGRAMME OUTREACH
In referring to the SBC Results Framework, the indicator used to measure progress was/is: a
“Proportion of the population who have been reached with information (via media and IPC,
community engagement platforms) on relevant health and nutrition services (i.e., breastfeeding,
IYCF, IR, etc).” While evidence shows that the aim of immunising 2.4 million children against polio
was exceeded from 2019 to 2021, the number of children immunised in 2022 fell below the target at
2.33 million. (SeeTable 13).
Regarding WASH, the SBC Results Framework included an indicator to measure progress in this
sector which was, the “Proportion of community members who have been reached with information
(via media and WASH campaigns, community engagement platforms) on positive social behaviours
with focus on hand washing with soap, water management and use.”120 However, two indicators are
116 “Curriculum B is an accelerated programme for children who dropped out and remained out of school for few years. The programme enables them
to graduate to the normal curriculum in a specified period of time, based on the number of years they have not been in school.”, UNICEF. (2018).

120 It should be highlighted that the SBC Results Framework also has two highly relevant knowledge and behaviour change indicators for WASH, although
this information was not tracked. The two indicators are: (1) Proportion of population who have knowledge and understanding on the cost and value

used instead, and they are: (1) “number of caregivers reached with health promotion, including
immunisation messages”; and (2) “number of people reached with hygiene promotion interventions”.
(See Tables 13 and 15, respectively). Overall, the performance of reaching caregivers with health
promotion messages and interventions was either above or below the planned targets. Nonetheless,
part of SBC’s effectiveness may be linked to this partial reach.

providers, followed by “other121” (20%), tv/radio

data indicates while there is an awareness
about the need for routine immunisations (at
4%), polio, however, ranks among the highest,
compared to the others.122 (See figure to left.)123
The Results Framework has a knowledge-
based outcome for immunisations, including
polio, which is that there is a “proportion of
population124 who have knowledge and
Source: Evaluation survey. understanding on value of the health seeking
and care practices”.
While most surveyed know there are risks invovled with refraining from immunising their children,
there is a small proportion (6%, n=4) which reported “don’t know”. The results from a qualitative
inquiry may shed light on this. The findings indicate that many residents in several governorates may
not know about the campaigns, “because there was no clear and adequate prior notice, leading to
delay or loss of the chance in the vaccine.” Other obstacles included: (i) that vaccination centers are
far, especially in the eastern governorates, (ii) perceived complications and adverse reactions, (iii)
perceived lack of care for children (i.e., long waiting periods), and (iv) rumors about vaccine source
(limited trust in its effectiveness).125
Moreover, those surveyed in the evaluation also reported that if RI were not undertaken, then the
child could develop a physical disability (47%), his/her immunity against disease would weaken
of the positive WASH practices; (2) Proportion of the population who: (i) demonstrate support to deliver good quality WASH services; and (ii) claim
practicing WASH behaviours. This indicator is under Output 1.3: Parents and other caregivers have the required knowledge and are motivated to seek

(29%), or he/she could die (18%), thereby reinforcing the finding that SBC activities have contributed
to gains in this area.
Finally, in adhering to the SBC Results Framework’s behaviour-related indicator, “Proportion of
general population who claim health seeking and care practices”, the results from the survey affirm
that SBC’s efforts can be linked to behaviour change in this area. For example:
• 100% of those sampled reported having immunised their child/children.
• 97% agreed/strongly agreed to the statement “I used information that I heard about
immunisations to decide to immunise my child/children.”
• 99% agreed/strongly agreed to the statement “I used information about immunisations to
find out where to go to immunise my child/children.”
Therefore, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme’s contributions to the RI’s programme success are
unambiguous.
5.2.2 UNICEF Syria SBC Programme Response to COVID-19 and the COVAX rollout
FINDING
The response to COVID-19 and the rollout of COVAX is an excellent example of how
6 UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities were designed and implemented based on
real-time analyses of vaccine access, process, and supply.
The CO had a two-pronged response to COVID-19 in 2021, including: (1) creating messages focused
on COVID-19’s transmission; and (2) where to access psychosocial support. As the response effort
continued, however, messaging began to address alternatives to education, health seeking
behaviours, and the use of alternative child protection services.126 Studies showed that in 2021, 35%
of the respondents in all groups responded that Ministry of Health is their most preferred source of
information (35%), followed by information from health leaders (14%), community health workers
(10%), and TV (10%). 127 Not only did UNICEF leverage a wide range of media to launch far-reaching
RCCE campaigns, including the use of social and mass media, but the CO also reinforced its
partnerships with imams and religious authorities to include RCCE messaging in Friday prayer
sermons.
PROGRAMME OUTREACH
While the outreach data for COVID-19 is limited to 2022, the figures below for men, women, boys, and
girls show that the areas with the highest outreach were Aleppo followed by Rural Damascus, and
Al-Hasakeh ranked third for women and men (see figure below).128

EVIDENCE OF SBC’S CONTRIBUTIONS TO INCREASED KNOWLEDGE & BEHAVIOUR CHANGE
Data also confirms that the CO adapted RCCE messages regularly based on increasingly available
information, including several rounds of rapid Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys.129
For example, 99% of respondents had heard about the COVID-19 vaccine, similar to the result of
round 1 of the survey. However, it is slightly less for people above 55, illiterate, and in Dara' a
governorate.
In reference to the SBC Results Framework, the behaviour-related indicator is “Proportion of general
population who claim health seeking and care practices”, which would include health care providers,
teachers, and caregivers being fully immunised against COVID-19. The first round of data collection
in 2021 from the KAP study showed that approximately 51% of the respondents had received the
vaccine, although 58% of them were health workers and 50% were the general population.130 In 2022,
a second round of data collection took place, indicating that 61% respondents had received the
COVAX vaccine.131 Data from stakeholder KIIs iterates the importance of using evidence to guide the
overall SBC strategy by examining “vaccine access, process, and supply”. This analysis, in turn, was
reflected into the government’s micro-plans.132
129 Data collection period was from 22 March to 2 April 2022. The total number of filled in surveys was 19,641 (38% in health facilities, 22% in religious
places, 27% in schools, and 13% in universities). The response rate was 99.3%, and 56% of the respondents were females, and 44% were males.
The survey was conducted in 13 out of 14 governorates of Syria, excluding Ar-Raqqa (due to logistical challenges). There were also two sets of
questionnaires; one for health workers working in facilities, and the other for the general population. Apart from the health facilities, the survey
scope was expanded to reach people regardless of their ability to access health services. This included religious places, schools, and universities.

The evaluation survey results were somewhat less positive. While 97% had heard messages about
COVID-19, a small number (7 out of 83) did not believe that it was preventable. Moreover, 66% (or 49
out of 74) had not been vaccinated, and 42% of the sample (31 out of 74) reported having contracted
COVID-19 in the past. Hence, SBC-related interventions can be associated with some gains as it
relates to reducing the risks of COVID-19 and encouraging people to seek positive health behaviours
(getting the COVAX vaccine). Limited vaccinations could also be linked to supply-related obstacles,
such as restricted access to health-care facilities (including mobile health services), “unpredictable
security” situations, rumours that the vaccination influences fertility, and perceptions that the risks
are only for vulnerable people such as older adults.133
Finally, regional level evaluations note that it took time to set up international and national
coordination mechanisms for the implementation of COVAX distribution, among other supply-side-
related services, UNICEF’s third phase of the COVID-19 response included “projects supporting cold
chains.” There were also minor delays experienced minor delays linked to mobility restrictions.134
Nonetheless, UNICEF’s response is a good example of UNICEF Syria SBC programme design and
implementation. It was recognised at an early stage that the data from the two SBC indicators135
would not likely produce the necessary situational analysis needed to support UNICEF’s response to
COVID-19. Therefore, “the roll out of the COVAX vaccine was done through the development of data-
driven profile of individuals least likely to get vaccinated and evidence-informed planning
processes”. 136
5.2.3 Response to cholera Outbreaks in Syria
The cholera outbreak was first declared in Syria on 10 September 2022, where there were over
50,000 suspected in Idleb and Aleppo.137 An inter-agency response, including UNICEF, the World
Health Organisation (WHO), and the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, supported
the cholera outbreak, as it quickly spread to in DEZ, Aleppo, and Ar-Raqqa.138
It is recognised that this response is still being implemented currently, and so response activities
may still be on going. UNICEF’s WASH (hygiene promotion) and SBC teams have been working
together since 2022 to distribute aqua tabs and hygiene supplies, and, with IPs139, engage rights

Indeed, the evaluation’s data also indicates that 40% heard about cholera from a health professional,
followed by television/radio and “Other”142. However, a devastating earthquake in February 2023 had
a significant impact on the cholera response operations. The earthquake affected access to
services, as some health facilities had to suspend their operations and diverted already limited funds
available to emergency efforts. 143

Like the outreach data for COVID-19, the cholera outreach data is limited to 2022, and although there
are two indicators, this report only presents the data for one.144

(5) None of the above; and (6) Don’t know.
146 This could have included the use of an aqua tab to purify water or boiling water for two minutes.

Therefore, given the above evidence, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme ’s contributions to the
cholera prevention response appear to be beneficial, despite the impact of the earthquake.
5.2.4 Nutrition & Infant Feeding
FINDING UNICEF IYCF programme is a human rights-based programme and is relevant to the
context of Syria. However, the data is mixed about how much knowledge lactating
7 mothers actually have about breastfeeding as a result of UNICEF SBC efforts, although
the willingness to practice breastfeeding is evident, suggesting that knowledge can be
built upon or some beneficial effect of UNICEF efforts.
In 2018, “UNICEF focused on preventive interventions, through infant and young child feeding and
micronutrient supplementation across 13 governorates (Damascus; Aleppo; Rural Damascus; Homs;
Hama; Lattakia; Al-Hasakeh; DEZ; Tartous; Ar-Raqqa; Dar'a; As-Sweida; and Quneitra). The Country
Office Annual Report 2018 stipulates that a total of 1,736,456 women and children were reached with
micronutrient supplements (which was 79% of the goal), and 418,275 caregivers were reached with
messages on optimal feeding practices.”147 The evaluation of UNICEF IYCF programme (2019 – 2020)
also affirms that “the [IYCF] programme is viewed as important and relevant to the context of Syria.
It is a human rights-based programme that encompasses the direct provision of services for
vulnerable women and children.” The programme has been implemented in 13 of the 14 governorates,
and its coverage at the sub-district levels is expanding.148
PROGRAMME OUTREACH
While the CO Results Framework only has the indicator, “Number of caregivers reached with health
promotion, including immunisation messages”, the main indicator used to measure progress in this
area was the “Number of Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLWs) counselled on appropriate IYCF.” A
summary of this data indicates that men and boys, and girls are also part of the audience in
Damascus, Dar'a, Al-Hasakeh, and Ar-Raqqa (see figure below). Indeed, the evaluation survey shows
that the majority, 54%, of the programme participants indicated that they received information
about breastfeeding from a health care service provider, followed by “Other”149 (29%), and volunteer
(25%).

However, 15% of the survey sample (or 7 out of 48), reported "no" for breastfeeding immediately
following childbirth. The majority (73%), however, know that a baby is exclusively breastfed for up to
two years, (the correct answer), but approximately 17%150 do not have knowledge about
breastfeeding, including its benefits.
However, 92% “Strongly agreed” or “Agreed” with the statement “I used information (that I heard about
breastfeeding) to decide to breastfeed my child/children”, and 96% “Strongly agreed” and “Agreed”
with “I used information about breastfeeding from my family.” Such findings are somewhat mixed,
Overall, however, it is clear that SBC has contributed to programme results in this sector. An
explanation for the mixed data, however, could be linked to a conclusion from the evaluation of the
UNICEF IYCF programme, highlighting that “that awareness activities have not worked optimally,
possibly due to contextual reasons – generating confidence in mothers affected by the ongoing crisis
to attend counseling, limited outreach as also constraints related to distance to access services.”151
150 This is amounts to 8 (out of 43) women surveyed. The sample is small because out of 83 participants, only 50 mothers had children under age five,
and of those 50, two women had not seen or heard any messages about breastfeeding (reducing the sample to 48).

5.2.5 Mine Risk Education (MRE)
An estimated 8.2 million people (3.3 million

children) were living in contaminated areas in
ordinances.
2018, and based on a needs assessment, UNICEF
decided to focus its mine-risk education efforts
in the North East.152 As noted earlier, UNICEF
used an integrated approach in the North east,
involving child protection, education, and health.
UNICEF and implementing partners delivered
risk education at child-friendly spaces, schools,
camps and reception centres for IDPs…to ensure
the sustainability of mine-risk education
programme and achieve behaviour change.” 153
PROGRAMME OUTREACH
The Results Framework did not include any
knowledge or behaviour-related indicators to
measure progress in MRE. However, in reporting
on the indicator “Number of girls, boys, women,
and men reached with [Mine] Risk Education
activities, it is demonstrated in figure that
UNICEF engaged boys and girls specifically while
delivering messages about mine risk education.

KNOWLEDGE & BEHAVIOUR CHANGE
Given the limited data, however, it is uncertain about the extent to which SBC contributed toward
promoting successful behaviour change (self- protection). Similar observations are made for the
two other indicators which fall under Child Protection.154 Like the indicator above, the available
trends data shows that UNICEF focused on children, but there is no disaggregated data for the four
categories (male, female, men, and women) for the years 2020 and 2021.

5.2.6 Education
FINDING
The Back to Learning (BTL) interventions focused on pursuading caregivers and
8 children to return to school, but the economic situation (and need for child labour) has
hindered programme gains.
The UNICEF BTL programme was a short-term initiative conceptualised in 2013 to respond to “unsafe
and unconducive learning environments”, and from 2018 to 2021, the programme evolved into a
nationwide programme reaching 3,421,584 people with messages and engaged 59,552 teachers and
children (27,394 male) with door-to-door visits and community dialogues.155 The initial programme
design aimed to increase access to education for children in the lower primary school grades (grades
1-4) in all 14 governorates through a combination of community mobilisation and provision of
education supplies. This eventually grew into a multi-donor funded, multi-sectoral programme that
included SBC, support for the rehabilitation of schools, the provision of school supplies (i.e., school
bags, stationery, pens), and Early Childhood Education (ECE) kits.
UNICEF worked with IPs to conduct BTL campaigns, including door-to-door visits as well as phone
calls with beneficiaries. Through these activities, UNICEF: (i) raised awareness on the importance of
education; (ii) informed parents and caregivers about opportunities for education; and (iii) collected
information about out of school children. 156 The SBC component had a foundational role in this
programme, including messages via radio, TV, SMS, and billboards, as well as community
mobilisation to raise awareness on school registration and timely enrollment.

barriers preventing children from returning to school. Chief among them are: economic:157 and child
labour.158 Additional reasons included: early marriage (1,292), violence by school staff (972),
exposure to some type of discrimination at school (963), the child was harassed by other children
(926), followed by no need for education (education is not a priority).159 See figures below.

Figure data sources: 2020 C4D Survey.
Given the foundational role that SBC played in BTL, it is clear that the UNICEF Syria SBC programme
activities made strong contributions to BTL’s achievements. 160 However, the BTL evaluation did not
link SBC’s role to programme successes, yet it called for the need to refocus the messaging of the
community mobilisation and the communication campaign and prioritise emerging challenges such
as non-formal education and the prevention of dropouts. 161 Efforts in education are currently
focused on OOSC, engaging caregivers and children so that they understand that there are non-
formal education opportunities available to explore.162 In this case, the contributions of SBC ought
to be highlighted in this new programmatic strategy.

KEQ 6: What can be learned about the most effective SBC interventions for the achievement of
results in terms of design, implementation, targeting? What are the most effective activities for
driving change?
FINDING
Notable promising practices from the UNICEF Syria SBC Programme which helped to
drive change include: (i) multi-sectoral interventions; (ii) the use of multi-media; and
8
(iii) evidence-informed planning, targeting, and monitoring.
First, a multi-sectoral approach is key to an effective SBC intervention.163 UNICEF Syria’s SBC
programme included activities that drew from multiple sectors, including, for example, the BTL and
the response to the cholera epidemic. BTL was first developed to raise awareness about returning
to school, and so the programme targeted parents and caregivers about the importance of
education. In addition, however, the programme minimised potential bottlenecks that would prevent
children from attending school by investing in school reconstruction, and the provision of school
supplies and ECE toolkits.164 Similarly, the SBC programme activities raised awareness about the
risks of cholera by delivering messages about purifying water along with the provision of hand
sanitiser and aquatabs.165
Additionally, SBC activities which are equally effective include the use of multiple media outlets to
engage communities.166 BTL used radio and television forums, short films, community consultation
mechanisms, and social media platforms to stimulate interest in sending the children back to
school.167
Finally, UNICEF guidance notes that rigorous research should be used to both understand challenges
and to monitor and evaluate outcomes.168 In fact, evidence generation guided the COVAX rollout,
thereby minimising the impact of COVID-19. As noted earlier, the steps undertaken to generate
evidence while planning and implementing the COVAX roll out offer strong lessons about how best to
raise awareness and promote behaviour change especially for targeting a specific group of
vulnerable rights holders. Similar actions were carried out for BTL and cholera prevention efforts.169

KEQ 7: What were the major/critical factors that hindered or contributed to achievement of SBC
results?
FACTORS HINDERING PROGRAMME ACHIEVEMENTS
It is important to note that with the multiple interpretations about how to design, organise, and
implement programme activities, specific key approaches that support or hinder behaviour change
at the community and household levels could not be validated. However, there are numerous factors
hindering the effects of SBC’s activities at the policy and institutional levels. Data from interviews
from UNICEF staff and duty bearers all point to the most significant bottleneck, which is that the
economic situation and the overall crisis are detriments to positive results.170 Another element
hindering results for SBC in the child protection sector are work restrictions in specific geographic
areas, which prevents UNICEF from systematically investing in communities.171 Other key factors
diminishing the effects of SBC include:
• Restrictions on primary data collection among the population and in the field, which means that
it is a challenge to “[re]calibrate and adapt interventions”; 172
• Limitations in capacity development at multiple levels within the social services system. For
example, at the community level, there are few volunteers who may receive training in SBC
techniques and practices who are then willing to stay and support the community. Most
individuals wish to leave Syria;173
• Media resources are also limited, especially in hard-to-reach areas, and so this is a medium that
has limited utility in some parts of the country;174
• Inconsistent electricity and water supply. The lack of supply of certain key services prevents
SBC from being an effective tool;175
• Limited access to health facilities. Many rights holders reside far from health facilities, thereby
preventing them from immunising themselves or their children from deadly diseases, although
mobile health teams have helped to ease this burden;176
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO SBC ACHIEVEMENTS
The key components contributing to UNICEF Syria’s SBC programme results are that:
• SBC is valued in UNICEF’s Strategic Plan, 2022–2025, which indicates that there is strategic,
institutional support for SBC;177
• Core resources dedicated to SBC have been steady over the years. In the efficiency section, the
amount of core resources is presented, showing that there are few fluctuations.

• SBC interventions are used to prevent and address violent and harmful practices, often linked to
social norms, intentionally targeting those who are most vulnerable (i.e., children, adolescents,
widows, the elderly, and persons with disabilities).178 Performing this effectively requires
gathering evidence to identify the needs of those marginalised, and such steps were undertaken
for the roll out of COVAX;179
• Programming models have been simple and flexible when accommodate Syria’s varying
contexts;180 and
• The operational modality leans on partnerships at every level, including with the United Nations
partners, Syrian Arab Republic partners, IPs, and communities.181
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The beginning of this section provided an overview about the use of monitoring data and targets,
where targets were used to monitor progress from 2018 to 2022 for six out of ten indicators, and six
(out of ten) indicators included targets which changed relatively consistently from year to year.
These findings implied that targets were in fact used as management tools. Moreover, the UNICEF
Syria SBC programme Results Framework, another management tool, includes notable indicators
for expected knowledge and behaviour change for rights holders and duty bearers, but these
indicators are not used to track progress in a comprehensive way.
In addition, this section describes the degree to which the SBC Strategy contributed to CO
programme results, including raising awareness about: (1) RI (including polio) and hygiene promotion
(or WASH); (2) the risks of COVID-19 and support the distribution of the COVAX vaccine; (3) IYCF; (4)
cholera; (5) the MRE programme; and (6) BTL. The analytical framework used to evidence the
contributions of the UNICEF Syria SBC programme is based identified changes in rights holder’s (1)
knowledge about messages in a given sector; and (2) positive behaviours practiced as a result of
engaging in programme activities.
First, trend analyses from 2018 to 2022 reveal that SBC programming has acquired strong gains in all
sectors. Second, there appears to be some awareness about the need for RI, but polio ranks as the
highest in increased awareness. SBC information and messages have also supported programme
participants to make decisions about seeking RI. All rights holders sampled in the evaluation
reported having immunised their child/ren. The programme ’s contributions to WASH could not be
tracked due to limited data. Third, the response to COVID-19 and the rollout of COVAX is an excellent
example of how the UNICEF Syria SBC programme activities were designed and implemented based

on real-time analyses of vaccine access, process, and supply. Most (97%) of the evaluation sample
had heard messages about COVID-19, although 66% (or 49 out of 74) had not been vaccinated.
Fourth, SBC had a foundational role in UNICEF’s response to Syria’s cholera outbreak, which included
engaging rights holders in awareness sessions about how to prevent cholera combined with the
supply of water, soap, and hand sanitizer. In fact, the evaluation’s data revealed that 40% of sampled
rights holders had heard about cholera from a health professional. In spite of these successes,
however, the devastating earthquake in February 2023 had a detrimental impact on the cholera
response. Nonetheless, the contributions to the prevention response are notable.
Fifth, the data available shows that UNICEF engaged children specifically while delivering messages
about MRE, but the results are inconclusive about the extent to which the programme contributed
to their behaviour change. Finally, the evidence is clear about the extent to which the BTL raised
awareness among caregivers about the importance of education. However, the economic situation,
child labour, and early marriage present significant barriers that prevent children from returning to
school.
Ultimately, evidence-informed planning and targeting helped to drive change in raising awareness
about COVID-19 and during the roll out of COVAX. This section closes with a presentation of the major
factors hindering and accelerating SBC achievements. Plainly put, the most significant element
constricting positive results is the economic situation and the overall humanitarian crisis; However,
as SBC is a highly valued, cross-cutting programmatic approach (as articulated in UNICEF’s Strategic
Plan, 2022–2025), it benefits from an institutional architecture which includes the allocation of
steady, annual core resources.
5.3 Efficiency
KEQ 8: How efficiently were resources (funds, expertise, time) used to achieve the objectives of
SBC strategies in a timely way?
As noted earlier, there are two sets of funding sources which cover the SBC programming
expenditures: (1) inside the sector’s budget; and (2) under a cross-cutting programme source called
programme effect. The extent to which each sector’s budget and human resources are used is
assessed in this section.
FINDING There is a stable level of planned annual expenditures for SBC under programme effect,
which appear to be fully utilised. However, the proportion of sector budgets allocated
9
to SBC is inconsistent across the entire CO programme portfolio. As the annual
allotment of each sector’s budgets fluctuates, this limits long-term planning.
pg. 73
The CO consistently allocated resources for Figure 15: Funding spike for SBC budget in 2019.

USD 495,000. In 2019, however, there was a
spike in annual spending to USD 1.13 million, 2019
primarily attributed to carrying out a $1,135,000
baseline and additional monitoring activities
(see figure to right).182 The annual budget

and six SBC Field Officers. Source: CO AWPs.
KEQ 9: Were the resources allocated to the programme implementation team and IPs appropriate
to implement the activities and achieve change either in terms of behavioural or social change as
part of programme effectiveness?
On the one hand, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme effectiveness budget is expected to support the
SBC team, the monitoring work executed by TPMs, formative assessments, among other monitoring
and evaluation efforts, and data from interviewed stakeholders indicates that this budget is
limited.183 On the other hand, however, the sector budgets are comparably larger than SBC’s total
level of investment. It should be highlighted, however, that each sector’s budget reflects consistent
integrated programming for SBC activities; For example, each sector budget has annual earmarked
funding available for:
(1) Programme cooperation agreements for IP’s;
(2) Formative assessments;
(3) Monitoring (field visits);
(4) Capacity strengthening for all stakeholders (including government, IPs, and volunteers);
(5) IEC materials and other supplies used for demonstrations; and
(6) Other resources required for implementation (i.e., transportation, fuel). 184
An analysis of each sector’s investment in SBC indicates that there are sufficient resources available
for SBC programming. Although these funds appear to be fully utilised, the proportion allocated to
SBC-related activities, as a fraction of the entire budget, is inconsistent across the CO programme
portfolio. In specific, from 2018 to 2022, the highest average amount of funding for SBC was in Health
and Nutrition which had an average total budget of approximately USD 54.5 million (See table 5),
followed by WASH with USD 45.5 million, education with USD 38.8 million, and child protection with
USD 16 million. When accounting for the proportion of funding invested in SBC activities, it ranges

between 0% to 23% of the overall individual sector budgets. While the child protection budget
dedicates the highest relative share of its budget to SBC activities (at an average of 20%), WASH has
the lowest (at an average of 4%).
Figure 16: Allocation of SBC within each sector's budget.
Source: UNICEF AWPs for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.
In spite of these relatively large (and small) proportions of sector budgets investing in SBC-related
activities, the nominal amount used for SBC programming varies greatly. Naturally, since Health and
Nutrition has the highest average budget at approximately USD 54.5 million, the investment in SBC-
related activities is USD 3.7 million. It should be noted that the reliance on the health sector risks
SBC being overly focused on the promotion of health-related programmes. Similarly, child
protection’s average investment in SBC is USD 3.2 million, followed by WASH with USD 2 million, and
education with USD 1.9 million.
Apart from child protection, there were strong fluctuations in sector budgets, causing some sectors
not to allocate any investments in SBC. The UNICEF Formative Evaluation of the Strategic Shift in
Syria also highlighted that “financial resources [were] becoming scarcer and less predictable.”185 For
example, in the education sector, there were no SBC funds in 2018 and 2020.186 There were also
drastic fluctuations in SBC funding in Health and Nutrition between 2018 and 2020, whereas SBC
funding in the WASH sector has consistently stayed within the 3% to 5% range, in spite of its USD 10
million surplus in 2021 (most likely linked to budget expansions for the prevention of COVID-19).
Finally, with the annual variations in each sector’s total budget allocations, one could surmise that
such fluctuations would make planning (and budgeting) for longer-term SBC interventions very
challenging. Indeed, the Formative Evaluation of the Strategic Shift in Syria also notes, “Most of the
current funding and budgeting cycle is from year to year which limits opportunities for medium and
185 GIST Research Ltd. (2022). UNICEF Formative Evaluation of the Strategic Shift in Syria: Final Report, page 35.

long-term projections....”187 To limit the effects of this challenge, there ought to be a minimum
amount of investment made available for SBC within each sector, when mobilising future funding
from donors. The extent to which SBC staff expertise is used to achieve the objectives of SBC
strategies in a timely way will be examined under the Coherence/Coordination section of this report.
KEQ 10: What examples of cost-effectiveness of specific SBC activities or strategies can be
identified for replication and / or scale up?
FINDING
Cross-sectional programmes are perceived to be most cost-effective, and especially
10 when SBC messages are combined with necessary supplies.
UNICEF sector staff mention several examples of promising practices, most of which include the
application of a multisectoral or “holistic” approach.188 The data from numerous staff interviews
highlighted their experiences from pilot endeavors which included an SBC component. For example,
in education, an intervention which showed promise was described to have leveraged five specific
SBC messages in RI, WASH, BTL, minors’ education, and IYCF, and then “after corona hit, the
volunteers were trained to deliver these messages..We reached so many people about these messages,
and we engaged with them. We have strong memories of this time….this project had a big impact on
the ground. Many people (15 K children) were engaged. They [the children then] visited the health
facilities by themselves.”189 To sum, this example shows that an inter-sectoral initiative is perceived
to have strong results.
Further, data from other UNICEF staff members highlights the recruitment of younger community
members to carry out programme activities, noting that ADAP volunteers “are just a bit older, and
they can gain their [the children’s] trust” and students in university, working as volunteers can
effectively convey the SBC messages to their families and friends. It was also mentioned that role
playing and using puppets (for child protection interventions) is an easy way to interact with the
communities, especially when raising awareness about mental health issues. Finally, an innovative SBC
approach described included the use of some Qur’anic versus to convince the families to accept to
send their children in the school, especially in the camps.190
As illustrated under the relevance section (Section 5.14), there is general satisfaction among rights
holders with the quality of support provided; information is “clear”, and there are opportunities
during demonstrations to raise questions in the event that a message is unclear.191 When rights
holders were asked to recall specific activities, almost all mentioned activities which combined the
delivery of messages with a demonstration. For example, one stakeholder mentioned “the correct

stages and positions [to hold a baby for breastfeeding] were demonstrated with a doll used as a baby”
to further emphasise the correct positions for breastfeeding followed by a brochure.192 Others
mentioned combining water and soap to demonstrate handwashing193, and both duty bearers and
rights holders talked about using water supply with water tablets to explain how to perform the
purification process.194
Moreover, duty bearers noted that SBC activities are more effective if sessions include supplies that
the rights holder does not have. For example, one stakeholder noted that “To increase the
effectiveness of the programme, it is necessary to provide them with aid tools, such as detergents
and sanitary pads, nutrients for children before they reach malnutrition.”195 Other examples raised
about how to increase the cost-effectiveness of SBC activities included: (1) the need for topics which
provide “continuous motivation for beneficiaries to attend activities”, (2) a suitable location for
sessions which is “quieter” and “safe for children”; and (3) having access to evaluative information to
“understand work results” and the “impact of sessions”.196 In sum, both rights holders and duty
bearers have identified multiple activities which ought to be considered for further scale up.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In essence, this section has presented an analysis of the extent to which resources dedicated to SBC
have been used to accelerate sector- specific achievements. There are two levels of funding for
which finance the overall UNICEF Syria SBC programme, including the programme effectiveness
budget and inside each sector’s budget. The programme effectiveness budget is small compared to
the sector budgets. However, from 2018 to 2022, overall programme funding appears to be less
predictable with strong annual fluctuations in education, H&N, and WASH. Finally, the last section
presents specific examples of cost-effective SBC activities identified from the UNICEF staff, rights
holders and duty bearers.
5.4 Coherence/Coordination
KEQ 11: What are some examples of SBC activities where there is integration between sectors?
FINDING
While several good practices were identified, there is a further opportunity to
strengthen understanding about how SBC and different sector programmes

should work together (related to the concept of SBC and programme
implementation).

To recall, the SBC team is comprised of eleven staff members,197 However, almost half of the SBC
Unit’s posts were vacant for over nine months (since December 2022), and many SBC Officer posts
were filled only after the earthquake which took place in February 2023. In specific, the Chief was
recently recruited in February 2023, and three SBC Officers (in Aleppo and DEZ) were hired in June
2023, and one SBC Officer in Tartous was hired in July 2023.198 The SBC Unit also engaged two “SBC
Facilitators” in DEZ one in Damascus (a Monitoring and Evaluation consultant).199 The SBC Unit
experienced delays in recruiting posts for an extended period of time, which in turn, led to the sector
staff to undertake SBC activities on their own.
While SBC was firmly integrated into the sectors with committed financial resources, there was,
however, a continuum of staff perspectives about how well SBC is understood. For example, on the
one hand, there is a clear understanding of the role of the SBC Unit, the expertise that the unit brings
to the sector’s work, and the need to monitor SBC’s efforts, separate from the sector’s achievements
(although there is some overlap). For example, some quotes from UNICEF stakeholders are:

197 The team includes a Chief with a team of three staff members (two SBC Officers, one SBC Specialist, and one Programme Associate whose post
has been vacant) and six SBC Officers, one located in each Field Office (i.e., Aleppo, Homs, Tartus, Qamishli and DEZ, and Damascus Rural).
198 Reviewers’ input from November 2023 notes that it is important to clarify the following summaries about SBC national officer posts’ recruitment
processes: 1. Aleppo's SBC National Officer, categorised as ‘NOA’ [a level with one year of relevant professional work experience] was created as
part of Country Programme Management Plan of 2022-2024 but was classified by Human Resources and management as a second priority hiring and
was only approved to proceed for recruitment after the February 2023 earthquake; 2. In Tartous, the SBC officer post was a newly created Temporary
Assignment post with a duration of only six months, and was also approved for recruitment following the February 2023 earthquake; 3. In DEZ, the
SBC officer post was a newly created Temporary Assignment post with a duration of only six months, and was also approved for recruitment following
the cholera epidemic and other security risks; and 4. The SBC officer post with a P3 level was also a Temporary Assignment created due to a donor
request to provide more focus on gender as part of immunisation agenda.

• “ We are all on the UNICEF team.” 200
On the other hand, however, there is a need for clarity in how the SBC and sectors’ activities ought to
work together, and there are UNICEF staff member perceptions that some sector’s SBC budget
should not be shared with the SBC unit. In an SBC Unit meeting on 11 September 2023, this theme
was confirmed and also labeled a “blurred line” of operating. For example,
• “The technical part should come WASH • “It is not clear relationship between the

already exists but is not used; If a new guideline were produced, however, one stakeholder points out
that, “If some people ask for more clarity, this is a good idea. Sometimes if you do the guidelines,
however, on the paper it can be clear, but on the ground it is not clear…..”202 Therefore, there is a
need for co-created operational guidelines.
Data from stakeholder interviews also indicates that while there is an institutional mandate
necessitating funds be made available for SBC, from both the programme effectiveness budget as
well as from the sector budgets, the procedural components for budget sharing with the SBC Unit
are less clear. The Formative Evaluation of the Strategic Shift in Syria also notes that “programme
budgets were often designed separately” in spite of some stakeholders “request[ing] more
opportunities and incentives to work on identifying synergies for resource sharing.”203 Themes from
the KII refer to misunderstandings about the budget, where one stakeholder admitted that “When
[SBC staff] approach me for money…they ask for some money to do some kind of joint programme
with SBC and WASH. I hesitate. I do not have a comprehensive idea about SBC”. Another notable
theme observed was linked to monitoring SBC efforts and having to “share data” and achievements.

pg. 79
For example, one stakeholder noted, “Why does SBC get this [credit] for work progress? Why do we
have two different programmes share the same indicator? I do not agree with this.”
Indeed, there is an opportunity to increase UNICEF staff’s understanding about the added value of
SBC, why it ought to be valued, what contributions in terms of expertise that the SBC Unit brings to
the process of community engagement, and what tools are available to help accelerate results
(including behavioural change) within the sectors.
Moreover, apart from guidance, stakeholders recommended a form of basic training to address the
conceptual and operational gaps identified, and that this training ought to be extended to UNICEF
stakeholders, implementing partners, and government stakeholders. For example, one stakeholder
highlighted the need for some guidance about how SBC is used in social media.204 Some stakeholders
also emphasised the importance that “We also need to engage our stakeholders. Sometimes it is not
the beneficiaries – the implementing partners also need to know [about SBC]. After the contractors
implement their work, it is the part of the government that also has to get involved. So, they too must
be trained in SBC.205 Hence, training ought to be provided to address the conceptual gaps, and
guidelines ought to be further developed to deal with the operational inefficiencies. Both
recommended activities ought to be co-created jointly to ensure that the training and guidelines are
appropriate and focus on the specific needs of all relevant stakeholders. Further training with
implementing partners and government stakeholders also should be considered.
5.5 Sustainability
KEQ 12: What factors need to be in place for sustainability of key SBC messages/interventions in
Syria context?
The UNICEF Syria SBC programme is already programmatically and financially integrated into the CO
Programme portfolio, which in turn, enhances its operational sustainability. One main factor which
ought to be in place to ensure programme sustainability is the resolution or reduction of the “blurred
lines” between SBC and the sectors (Finding 11). Indeed, when the conceptual and operational lines
between SBC and the sectors becomes clarified, several desired effects may be expected, including:
• leveraged synergies in expertise and interlinkages between sectors, which in turn, reduce the
possibilities for inefficiencies;
• pooled financial and human resources, ensuring that efforts are not duplicated or interrupted,
thereby enhancing the potential for sustainability; and
• knowledge sharing benefits, including lessons learned, among different Field Offices, and such
evidence, in turn, could contribute to regional dialogues with other UNICEF offices in the MENA
region about most effective SBC programme activities.
204 UNICEF01; UNICEF13; UNICEF14; UNICEF15; and UNICEF21.
205 UNICEF13; and UNICEF14.
pg. 80
In addition, the government’s support for SBC activities and their engagement in the formulation of
key messages, particularly in the WASH sector, are key to the sustainability of SBC programming.
Finally, evidence-driven adaptive programming approach are also critical to ensuring that
interventions stay relevant and effective.206
5.6 Child Rights, Gender, and Equity
KEQ 13: To what extent did SBC messages and engagement modalities address the challenges of
the targeted groups, including marginalised and vulnerable groups?
“LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND” is a fundamental principle driving the work of UNICEF and a critical element of
achieving the SDGs. Child rights, gender equality, and equity are at the core of the UNICEF Syria SBC
programme, and this section presents findings in this substantive area.
In general, it was already noted in the relevance section that SBC’s evidence generation strategies
(i.e., formative and quantitative assessments for COVID-19 and cholera and BTL quiz) were designed
to identify the profile of marginalised groups. Once vulnerable groups were identified, then SBC
activities were used to prioritise the distribution of the COVAX vaccine for the elderly, widows, and
PLWs.207 This shows the extent to which SBC approaches have helped to reduce persistent burdens
that vulnerable groups experience, and, as a consequence, advance UNICEF’s mandate.
5.6.1 Child Rights
Article 6 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is also relevant to this
evaluation. It includes: 6.1: States Parties recognise that every child has the inherent right to life;
and 6.2: States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development
of the child.208 Awareness raising activities directly addressed the pervasive effects of land mines,
cholera, and COVID-19 by providing messages about the risks of mines, RI, COVID-19, cholera, and
WASH. Moreover, SBC activities in IYCF and BTL reinforced right holder’s survival and development.
As an example, during BTL campaigns, SBC activities helped in the identification of at-risk, OOSC
who were then tracked to confirm if they had benefitted (or not) from education programming
efforts.209
5.6.2 Gender Equality
As already mentioned in the presentation of the Results Framework, the UNICEF Syria SBC
programme design has logic which fully considers both gender equality and human rights concerns.
That is, from the onset, both problems and challenges experienced by vulnerable groups (i.e.,
women, children, adolescents who are at risk of early marriage, the elderly, among others who
experience forms of discrimination) are primarily targeted for almost all of the SBC interventions.
Such efforts fully support the principles of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

pg. 81
At the implementation levels throughout Syria’s governorates, SBC programme activities may be
characterised as gender sensitive and gender responsive. In fact, this report has included evidence
that SBC programming takes place in isolated, rural areas, targeting women and children (girls and
boys) who have low participation rates in education and who are therefore, considered vulnerable.
As already noted, during the response to COVID-19 and subsequent rollout of the COVAX vaccine, it
is noted in Finding 6 that real-time analyses determined that individuals above age 55 and illiterate
were least likely to seek the vaccine. This data-driven profile of individuals ensured that those most
vulnerable were targeted for COVAX. Moreover, the contributions of the UNICEF Syria SBC
programme to the IYCF programme (through the engagement of PLWs and caregivers about
breastfeeding and health promotion of the child) support the CEDAW principle of safeguarding
women's reproductive role (by being good mothers). This is also in alignment with Goal Area 1 of the
UNICEF Gender Action Plan 2023-2025210 which focuses on Maternal health and nutrition and
Adolescent girls’ health and nutrition.
Finally, the results tracked for UNICEF Syria’s SBC programme outreach are/were disaggregated by
gender, age, and governorate (to a limited extent), which has been key to understanding progress
and trends in SBC outreach. It is important to highlight that not all programmes or evaluations
integrate such tools to undertake intersectional analyses to, in turn, ensure gender equality
programming.211
5.6.3 Equity and Inclusion
With regards to children with disabilities, UNCRC Article 23.1 states that States Parties recognise
that a mentally or physically disabled child should enjoy a full and decent life, in conditions which
ensure dignity, promote self-reliance and facilitate the child's active participation in the community.
The UNICEF Syria SBC programme has shown some beneficial contributions to children with
disabilities (CWD), despite its uneven implementation. SBC is integrated into the PD Support
education of blind visually impaired children.212 SBC activities also played a pivotal role in advertising
the need for families with children with disabilities to overcome their concerns about enrolling their
children in school.
In sum, this section has presented an analysis of the extent to SBC messages and activities have
addressed the challenges of those marginalised and the most vulnerable. The UNICEF Syria SBC
programme design has logic which fully considers child rights, gender equality, and equity concerns.
This section provides numerous examples in the COVID-19 and cholera responses, education, child
protection, RI, and WASH. Finally, SBC programme has shown some beneficial contributions to
children with disabilities (CWD), despite its uneven implementation.

6. Conclusions
The findings from this evaluation include a review of the design evolution and achievements of
UNICEF Syria SBC programming. The UNICEF Syria SBC programme is a relevant programme; it
encompasses a set of activities, administered in a timely fashion, which have accelerated the effects
of sector programmes. It has been evidenced that the UNICEF Syria SBC programme was first
adapted to help with polio and RI primarily in the North east and then was later extended to: (1)
expand efforts in RI and hygiene promotion (i.e., WASH); (2) increase awareness about the risks of
COVID-19 and later identify needs for the distribution of the COVAX vaccine; (3) expand the outreach
of IYCF; (4) help to coordinate cholera response; (5) support a smaller scale MRE programme; and (6)
execute a national BTL campaign. Clearly, SBC activities are embedded in the sector’s programme
activities as well as their budgets. Moreover, the UNICEF Syria SBC programme has its own budget
with planned annual expenditures under the programme effectiveness budget.
A core part of this report is the trend analyses from 2018 to 2022, summarising SBC’s strong
contributions to sector-specific achievements. One of the most effective SBC interventions was the
use of evidence-informed planning and targeting to help raise awareness about the risks of COVID-
19 and identify vulnerable groups to support the roll out of the COVAX vaccine.
As there are multiple interpretations about how to go about organising and implementing
programme activities, it was not possible to validate specific key approaches that support SBC
programme relevance and effectiveness. Subsequently, it was also not feasible to produce a
detailed assessment of the main enablers and drivers for behaviour and attitudinal changes at
household and community levels. However, at the policy level, the most significant bottleneck is the
economic situation and the overall crisis.
There are two levels of funding for which finance the overall UNICEF Syria SBC programme, including
the programme effectiveness budget and inside each sector’s budget. The programme
effectiveness budget is small compared to the sector budgets. However, from 2018 to 2022, overall
programme funding appears to be less predictable with strong annual fluctuations in education,
H&N, and WASH. This report has shown that there are annual variations in each sector’s total budget
allocations, making planning (and budgeting) for longer-term SBC interventions very challenging.
Therefore, there ought to be a minimum amount of investment made available for SBC within each
sector, when mobilising future funding from donors.
To further advance key results for Syria’s children, it is also necessary to resolve or reduce the SBC
conceptual and operational “blurred lines” between the SBC Unit and the sectors. This report
outlines the need for strengthening the understanding of UNICEF staff about how SBC and sector
programmes ought to draw from its programmatic synergies and pool both human and financial
resources. This is particularly important, given: (i) the overall economic crisis in Syria; and (ii) that
funding for the CO’s programme portfolio is not predictable with major annual fluctuations identified
in education, Health and Nutrition, and WASH.
In closing, Child rights, gender equality, and equity are at the core of the UNICEF Syria SBC
programme, and this report has drawn attention to how SBC programming is in alignment with the
UNCRC.

7. Recommendations
The recommendations presented in this report have three categories, and they are presented in
order of priority: Category 1: one recommendation addressing UNICEF operations; Category 2: one
recommendation aimed at ensuring an improved programme design and implementation for the
future; and Category 3: one recommendation designed to improve future monitoring and evaluation
work.
CATEGORY 1: BUILDING SYNERGIES AND REDUCING INEFFICIENCIES
Increasing the understanding of SBC concepts and operations
RECOMMENDATION #1. Evaluation findings 1 and 11 drew attention to absence of a document
outlining the UNICEF Syria SBC programme ’s contributing role in the sector, UNICEF stakeholder’s
fragmented understanding about SBC, and lack of clarity around roles played to maximise gains.
In the adjustments in the programme in 2023, UNICEF’s SBC Unit and the staff from the sectors need
to ensure that SBC is clearer conceptually and operationally. To broaden synchronised participation
and clarify the different roles that each staff member needs to play within each programme to
achieve synergies, it is recommended for the UNICEF Syria SBC Unit to:
• Provide training or orientation for a critical mass of sector-level stakeholders to facilitate
understanding about SBC and to support operations;
• Engage in a process of co-creating guidelines that can be used to confirm staff roles in SBC
with focus on sharing human and financial investments committed to SBC programming.
This could include a consensus about how indicators detailing progress and achievement
ought to be interpreted, and sharing information about promising practices observed during
the day-to-day operations (i.e., joint monitoring field trips); and
• Develop a detailed articulation for how SBC programming specifically contributes to each
sector’s results, thereby reinforcing the programme’s validity and added value to the CO
programme portfolio. Such documents could define the ways in which SBC increases
demand for sector-specific services and how specific SBC activities (i.e., CE, capacity
strengthening, evidence generation, information sessions) render service delivery more
effective.
Given the participatory nature of these exercises and potential need for securing supplemental
resources to convene and engage UNICEF stakeholders, these activities ought to commence in
January 2024. The Regional Office could also support the implementation of this recommendation
by sharing existing guidance support.
CATEGORY 2: ENSURING IMPROVED SBC PROGRAMME DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Addressing uneven implementation
RECOMMENDATION #2. Evaluation finding #2 indicates that programme implementation was
uneven, including approaches used to facilitate discussion with rights holders (i.e., community
influencers, parents, caregivers, and out of school children), the duration of sessions, and various
pg. 85
levels of intersectoral integration. The UNICEF Syria SBC Unit should contract a research institution
or firm to undertake broader FGDs with the IPs to:
(a) Outline the current inconsistencies in implementation; and
(b) Determine the critical levels of human and financial resources required to deliver systematic
approaches over the long-term throughout the UNICEF Syria SBC programme.
To build on the momentum of this evaluation, both exercises should be initiated by November 2023.
CATEGORY 3: ADDRESSING THE LACK OF A TOC
RECOMMENDATION #3. Evaluation findings 2, 3, and 4 indicate that while there is a Results
Framework, there is no clear ToC available, which in turn has contributed to the misunderstandings
related to SBC’s role and contributions to the sectors, especially at the strategic level.
Indeed, tracking accurate attitudinal and behavioural change requires a robust ToC; Having this tool
will enable the SBC Unit to validate the extent to which an SBC strategy is effectively accelerating
change within a given sector.
The UNICEF Syria SBC Unit should co-create the development of a multi-sectoral ToC that includes:
(a) SBC Strategies;
(b) Outcome statements for each sector which feature: (i) expected changes in knowledge; and
(ii) expected changes in behaviour or practices; and (iii) for whom; and
(c) A list of indicators, linked to and aligned with guidance issued by UNICEF HQ, that could be
used to measure the above and ensure regular follow up.

TERMS OF REFERENCE/ADVERTISEMENT FORM
TITLE OF THE CONTRACT: International Consultant to conduct Evaluation of UNICEF Syria Social and
Behaviour Change (SBC)
SECTION IN CHARGE: Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, UNICEF Syria Country Office
BACKGROUND (RATIONALE AND CONTEXT):
Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) is a framework that uses the strategies of advocacy, behaviour change
communication and community mobilization to influence both individual and societal change. SBC focuses
on the relationship between the individual, the community and society, with individuals at the heart of the
changes to be promoted. By involving individuals, it seeks to inform them to be able to analyse their own
situation to mobilise knowledge to find out solutions and to make the necessary changes.
SBC is one of 11 Change Strategies for accelerating programme outcomes for children in the Middle East
and North Africa region, in alignment with the UNICEF Global Strategic Plan (SP) 2022-25: a social and
behaviour change communication strategy that addresses the interrelated causes of social norms and
practices that are harmful to children’s health, education, development and participation. SBC is a key
change strategy in the UNICEF Syria Country Programme: ‘a social norms and behavioural change
communication strategy that targets inter-related causes of sub-optimal norms and practices for
children’213, which includes including risk communication and community engagement activities across
sectors.
Consistent with global and regional trends, the use of SBC in support of UNICEF Syria’s work has been
increasing, ranging from routine programmed activities to the emergency response to infectious disease.
SBC activities in Syria span life-saving and protective behaviours, aim to address harmful social practices
as well as build capacity of partners and communities and works with programmes to accelerate results
and create demand for services for children. UNICEF Syria SBC follows the 3E approach – education,
engagement and empowerment through service, media and community delivery platforms to achieve social
and behaviour change while employing risk communication and community engagement approaches and
methods to be first, fast and frequent to deliver life-saving high impact practices at individual, family,
community, organizational and institutional level.
The SBC programme in UNICEF Syria started in 2015 mainly to respond to the polio outbreak and by the
beginning of 2018 the programme transitioned from a small programme focusing on campaigns to a fully-
fledged programme addressing key priorities for social and behavior change issues in Syria in a systematic
manner and integration into primary care package, including routine immunization. SBC and Risk
Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) was a key aspect of the UNICEF Syria COVID-19
response, which since early 2020 brought major opportunities and achievements in new partnerships, more
meaningful engagement with the Ministry of Health (MoH), additional resources (financial and technical),
and social listening platforms. UNICEF Syria has a dedicated SBC (formerly C4D) team consisting of six
SBC staff members in 2021. Demand for SBCC has been increasing since 2015, which also reflects the

recent public health emergencies (COVID-19 in 2020 and cholera in 2022), with SBC expenditures
increasing, with total expenditure in 2022 of approximately $3.9 million.
Relevant country programme outputs:
As a crosscutting function, SBC activities are integrated within sector specific plans and coded in UNICEF
internal reporting systems under programme effectiveness: “SBC activities integrated in all programme
components of the Country Programme and are inclusive of research, capacity building, community
engagement, media and innovation”.
Indicators proposed in the UNICEF Syria SBC Programme Strategy Note 2022-2024 (November 2021) are:

UNICEF Syria SBC Research, Monitoring and Evaluation framework (under development) proposes that
results are determined by measuring the following:
1. improved knowledge, attitudes and practices of caregivers (behaviour change)
2. changed group norms and practices, community engagement and empowerment (social
change).
3. increased demand and utilization for services (uptake).
4. increased community member participation in decision-making, community engagement and
empowerment at local, state and national levels (governance).
5. increased number of civil societies, private sector, community-based organisations, partners and
community leaders that contribute to community engagement and national mobilization
(partnerships).
OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTRACT (PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT): The purpose of the assignment is
to conduct an evaluation of UNICEF Social and Behaviour Change programming214 from 2018 to 2022 and
its focus on key strategic priorities for UNICEF Syria which include Covid-19 awareness and vaccination,
infant and young child feeding, routine vaccination of children, integrated SBC/WASH programming, and
cholera response.
Given the multi-sectoral focus of these initiatives, the evaluation will help identify learning for both individual
sectors and cross-cutting approaches to help strengthen programming results for children in Syria, and
reflect on those SBC strategies that have helped to accelerate outcomes for children in Syria. The evaluation
214 SBC programmes were formerly known as Communication for Development – C4D – in UNICEF.
pg. 89
comes at an important time to inform the future strategic direction of the SBC team and should reflect on
approaches taken to date, their successes and identify opportunities and forward direction.
The objectives of the evaluation are to:
i. Review the design and achievements of UNICEF Syria SBC programming by assessing the
relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of specific approaches & materials, in particular community
engagement system & system strengthening215;
ii. Assess the main enablers and drivers for SBC in Syria as well as bottlenecks and barriers for
behaviour and attitudinal changes at household and community levels and identify
recommendations for programming approaches that are most effective in this context;
iii. Identify opportunities for/adjustments needed by programmes and corresponding SBC material to
support the achievement of key results for children in alignment with UNICEF Syria Country
Programme Document 2022-2024, Programme Strategy Note Communication for Development
(C4D) 2022-2024 and UNICEF MENA SBC-CE Regional Strategy and Programme Guidance for
2022-25, including an assessment of the results framework (in particular challenges of
measurability and attribution of results);
iv. Assess the common understanding of SBC across UNICEF Syria programming, including how
UNICEF teams understand and utilise SBC approaches to achieve results and the added value of
any integrated approaches to date, with a view to identifying areas of good practice and scope for
improvements;
v. (as appropriate, provide real-time reflection on any emergency SBC activities and identify
transferable learning and success factors from recent responses).
Scope:
The evaluation will assess both i) the selection/prioritisation by UNICEF Syria Country Office of specific
thematic areas to be the focus of significant SBC activities well as ii) the success and appropriateness of
specific SBC modalities (system strengthening, community engagement). It is both a reflective exercise on
what works in Syria and why, as well as a forward-look on what are the building blocks for effective SBC,
the enabling factors and how they can deliver future results for children in Syria.
The time period that this evaluation will cover is from 2018 – 2022, for activities across the 13 governorates
in Syria where UNICEF operates through 6 field offices.
The evaluation will use the existing data and evidence compiled from field monitoring visits, surveys,
trainings, community engagement, risk communication, awareness-raising materials, social and media
platforms, and reports and monitoring mechanisms. Qualitative data collection for the evaluation will also
be possible through remote interviews with key informants and use of UNICEF Syria Third Party Monitors
for in-country data collection (e.g. focus group discussions).
215 The UNICEF MENA SBC-CE Regional Strategy and Programme Guidance for 2022-25 assessed Syria as being ‘largely on track to realising the
potential of applying SBC-CE approaches and capacity to improve results’. Articulation of results was highlighted as an area for improvement for
UNICEF Syria.
pg. 90
The following draft evaluation questions indicate the main areas of interest and to guide the focus of the
evaluation, but it is expected that these will be discussed and refined with the evaluation consultant during
the evaluation design phase:
Relevance:
1. How appropriate were the designs, approaches and targeting of the SBC strategies to address the
needs and priorities of the targeted population(s) and address the desired social/behaviour
change?
2. To what extent were the activities and expected results of the SBC strategy consistent with the
overall purpose and the attainment of its objectives and those of individual UNICEF
programmes/sectors and the country programme?
3. How have SBC strategies been adapted and changed over time to different contexts within Syria?
4. Going forward, what are the key approaches and enabling factors for UNICEF SBC to ensure
relevance?
Efficiency
1. How efficiently were resources (funds, expertise, time) used to achieve the objectives of SBC
strategies in a timely way? How did SBC activities in Syria compare with other countries in MENA
(where comparators are possible)?
2. Were the resources allocated to the programme implementation team and implementing partners
appropriate to implement the activities and achieve change either in terms of behavioural or social
change as part of programme effectiveness?
3. For emergency public health responses, to what extent were the SBC activities timely in terms of
design and implementation?
4. What examples of cost-effectiveness of specific SBC activities or strategies can be identified for
replication and / or scale up, and what are the core aspects of SBC in emergencies to be utilized
for future responses?
5. What were the different leadership roles and coordination models taken by UNICEF in SBC activities
and what are UNICEF strengths and weaknesses in these roles?
Effectiveness/Impact
10. To what extent did SBC activities achieve the set targets including community perception of risk;

in terms of reflecting SBC achievements?
11. To what extent did the SBC strategy contribute to the achievements of country programme results?
12. To what extent is it possible to determine achievement of SBC programming objectives in terms
of attribution of results to UNICEF Syria (given the mainstreaming of SBC); what adjustments can
be made to M&E to better support future attribution?
13. What can be learned about the most effective SBC interventions for the achievement of results in
terms of design, implementation, targeting; what are the most effective activities for driving
change?
14. What were the major/critical factors that contributed to or hindered achievement of SBC results?
Coherence/Coordination
15. To what extent were SBC activities designed with a focus on coherence across relevant sectors to
maximize synergies and complementarities, and what form did this take (within UNICEF and
externally)?

Methodology
This evaluation will be conducted in accordance to the 2016 United Nations Evaluation Group Norms and
Standards for Evaluation216 and the UNICEF Evaluation Policy (2018)217.
The methodology of the evaluation, and related deliverables, should consist of:
a) Document review of strategy and programme documentation, monitoring data and reports218;
b) Mapping and assessment of data availability, both internal and external sources to identify
evidence gaps;
c) Stakeholder mapping and interviews with key internal and external stakeholders, including UNICEF
Syria programme staff and senior management; UNICEF MENARO SBC staff; Government of Syria
counterparts; implementing partners
d) Data triangulation & analysis
It is not anticipated that the evaluation will involve quantitative primary data collection with beneficiaries or
communities due to availability of existing internal monitoring and reporting data. Primary data collection
should instead focus on qualitative data collection to complement existing data and reflect on SBC design
and strategy.
Risks and limitations
A key risk is that programme planning, monitoring and reporting data may be incomplete or not have
generated enough information to undertake a meaningful assessment of programming design,
implementation or results. Where this is the case, the consultant should document the gaps, identify any
possible proxies, and recommend how to improve in future.
Another risk is related to engaging with communities in Syria, such as accessing individuals outside of
UNICEF-supported facilities. Any engagement with communities for data collection or access to personal
and identifiable information during the evaluation will be subject to UNICEF and UNEG ethical standards
and would require ethical approval.
It is important that the evaluation is timely in terms of the needs of the SBC programme and the recruited
consultant will need to ensure adherence to workplan.

8.3 Analytical Framework from C4D Programme Note
The IF-THEN statements are presented below.
UNICEF staff work with service provider duty bearers to implement SBC activities with the
community member rights holders. The IF-THEN statements are:
IF:
• parents and caretakers know and understand the value of adoption and maintenance of life
saving high impact behaviours at individual and family level,
• parents demonstrate intention and are able to practice, adopt and maintain life-saving
high impact behaviours at individual and family level,
• formal and non-formal community institutions, including traditional, religious and local
government are empowered with knowledge and skill and support positive behaviours,
practices and social norms in the best interest of a child at family and community level,
• duty bearers (government officials at central and local levels), academic education and
research institutions, traditional authorities, CSO/CBOs, mass media have increased
institutional capacity and capability to support and facilitate positive behaviour and social
change at community, organisational and institutional levels,
• duty bearers (male and female service providers) have empowered with knowledge and
skills (e.g., IPC through offline/online and digital knowledge delivery platforms) and ability to
deliver quality health services and perform prescriptive behaviours at facility, community
and family level,
• duty bearers (government officials, managers) feel accountable, demonstrate commitment
and are able to create enabling environment considering cost effective and efficient use
of institutional mechanism and structures for promotion, adoption and maintenance of life
saving high impact behaviours to improve service delivery at organisational and institutional
level,
• mass media (print, broadcast, digital and social) promotes and facilitates the adoption and
maintenance of life-saving practices at service, community and media delivery platforms,
and
• individuals, households and communities are able to take action to scale up positive
behaviour and norms,
THEN,
• right holders (parents, caretakers and communities) will be able to practice positive
behaviours and norms in the best interest of a child.
• right holders will demand life-saving high impact positive behaviours and norms and the
delivery of quality and resilient services at facility level
• demand will be increased for and utilization of quality and inclusive services in the best
interest of mother and child.
