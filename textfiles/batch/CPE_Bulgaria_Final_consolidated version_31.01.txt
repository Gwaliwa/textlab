Executive summary
This report presents the findings, conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations of the evaluation
of the UNICEF Bulgaria Country Programme (CP) 2018-2022. The evaluation is part of the Multi-country
Programme Evaluation, commissioned by UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, covering
UNICEF programmes in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine, with a focus on relevance,
coherence, and impact.
Overview of the Country Programme 2018 – 2022
The overall goal of the UNICEF CP 2018-2022 is to assist Bulgaria to “ensure that all of its children and
adolescents, particularly the most disadvantaged, enjoy their rights and develop to their full potential
in an inclusive and protective society that respects their voice”.1
The CP has four mutually reinforcing core Outcomes: 1) Early Childhood Development (ECD) and child
care, 2) Inclusive education and early learning, 3) Prevention of violence, protection of victims and the
promotion of access to justice for all children and 4) Partnerships for child rights.
Outcome 1 focuses on: the development of child-focused policies and programmes for family support
and social inclusion; the improvement of national policies for ECD; the improvement of coordination
between the health, social and child protection sectors on ECD; and increased access to quality and
holistic services. Outcome 2 aims to increase access to better quality and inclusive education services.
Outcome 3 aims to decrease social tolerance for violence against children; strengthen the commitment
of Bulgaria’s Government and Parliament to legislative reform on children in conflict with the law, child
victims and witnesses of violence and crime; and strengthen the prevention systems for violence against
children. Outcome 4 supports the generation and use of evidence to promote child rights; the
strengthening of partnerships among key stakeholders; and raising awareness about the situation of
children in Bulgaria, with a firm focus on reaching the most vulnerable groups and reducing the
discrimination, stigmatization and negative social norms that often shape their lives.
The CP Updated Strategy Note 2020 places more emphasis on emphasizes the most disadvantaged and
marginalized children and on closing existing gaps in child rights realization. The document emphasizes
the importance of Communication for Behavioural and Social Change (C4BSC) to promote solidarity and
to counter the impact of discriminatory public attitudes, public hate speech and anti-human rights
movements, and mobilize public and private support.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UNICEF Bulgaria Country Office (CO) has added five new
COVID-19-related indicators to outputs in three areas: support for ECD; support to reduce school
dropout; and support for the prevention of (and response to) violence against children and gender-
based violence.2
Purpose of the evaluation and its audience
This strategic evaluation aims to support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme
Document (CPD) by understanding the strategies used by the CO to drive changes for children,
particularly those who are the most vulnerable. It draws lessons from the activities undertaken in order
to enhance results in the future. At the same time, the evaluation aims to strengthen UNICEF’s
accountability to its national stakeholders.
The primary users of this evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF Country and Regional Offices.
Secondary users are the Government of Bulgaria, UN agencies and development partners with a
presence in Bulgaria. The evaluation builds on the agreements made among these partners and aims to
assist the establishment of strategies for their future collaboration, as the parties move together into the
next planning and programme cycle.
Evaluation context
The evaluation was conducted in a context marked by a complex political context, as a result of political
instability (with three parliamentary and one presidential elections held in 2021), and also movements

opposing to human rights. In addition, the country had to contend with the impact of the global COVID-
19 pandemic, which reduced access to education for many children, including the most marginalized,
increased domestic violence and triggered an economic crisis.
This challenging context added to an already difficult situation for many children in Bulgaria. In 2019,
38.6 per cent of Bulgarian children were at risk of poverty before social transfers, and 27.5 per cent after
transfers3 (close to half a million children). Every fifth Bulgarian child lives in severe material
deprivation (close to 250,000 children).4
In the recent years, the anti-human and anti-child rights narrative of some political parties and extremist
groups, gained strong momentum in Bulgaria, impeding key children-related strategic and legislative
changes, including adoption of the UNICEF-supported National Strategy for the Child 2019-2030.
Moreover, in the context of Covid19 crises, anti-Roma public and politic rhetoric increased, in some
cases even officials being engaged in this kind of discriminatory acts.
While the regulatory framework for children has been through significant reforms in recent years, the
necessary enforcement is lacking. In line with this, the low enforcement of children rights has been
recognized by some stakeholders as a serious challenge to Bulgaria’s overall regulatory stability. As
confirmed by the Situation Analysis of Children’s Rights in Bulgaria conducted in 2020, in the area of
Justice for Children, the low level of enforcement is inconsistent, because the authorities adopt a
discriminatory approach towards crimes with a gender element, including domestic violence or rape,
leading to biased prosecutions. Moreover, in the case of the Social Services Act adoption many
interviewed stakeholders expressed their concern regarding the extent to which its implementation will
be effective (taking into consideration the political will, the administrative capacity of responsible
bodies and the available specialized human resources).
There are also regional disparities – and particularly at municipal level – in the provision of services to
address vulnerability, minimize dependency, and prevent the intergenerational cycle of poverty and
social exclusion, both in terms of the types of services available and capacity for service provision
Bulgaria’s social protection system in the country remains fragmented with considerable gaps in
coverage, especially for people in the bottom 20 per cent in terms of their income. Many families are not
accessing the services and benefits that are available or the support they are offered may not meet their
needs. 5
Evaluation methodology
The Terms of Reference proposed a theory-based approach, based on the CP Theory of Change (ToC)
developed by the UNICEF Bulgaria CO. The evaluation questions are structured around the OECD DAC6
criteria of relevance, coherence and impact. The evaluation criterion of sustainability is also covered to
a certain extent by the evaluation, under the wider impact criterion. An Evaluation Matrix was
developed during the inception phase to map out evaluation questions and sub-questions, judgement
criteria, data collection methods and data sources.
An in-depth impact assessment was undertaken for three selected areas: early childhood development,
inclusive education for children with disabilities, and violence against children, to provide lessons on
UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for children at scale. Other important evaluation
methods utilized for the evaluation include a stakeholder analysis and a social network analysis. The
evaluation also uses systems-based evaluation principles.
Data collection methods were mainly qualitative, requiring a wide-ranging document review and
consultations with 24 key informant interviewees at national, regional and local level. The CO supported
the identification of respondents who were consulted using semi-structured interviews. They included
interviewees from UNICEF, government entities, UN agencies and other development agencies, and civil

society organizations (CSOs). In addition, UNICEF CO staff completed a questionnaire for the social
network analysis.
The evaluation methodology fully considered the ethical obligations of evaluators. Child rights, equity
and gender were key issues throughout the evaluation process.
Key findings
Relevance
The analysis shows that UNICEF has been relevant in addressing the changing needs of the most
vulnerable children in Bulgaria throughout the implementation of its CP, and that the equity focus of the
programme is being well defined and applied. The evaluation finds that the Country Programme
Document (CPD) is fully aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the observations of
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018–2021) and the Council of
Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2016–2021).
First, the CP targets vulnerable groups through the models or pilots envisaged, and their
implementation has generated observable results for the most marginalized, hard-to-reach families and
children. Second, the CO has prioritized the generation of evidence on child rights realization in Bulgaria,
with technical support to ministries and advocacy activities based on the studies that have been
developed.
Third, UNICEF adjusted its activities to ensure a timely respond to the challenges caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic. The CO has conducted studies and analyses on the impact of the pandemic on children’s
lives and has supported the government, local public actors and other stakeholders in providing access
for children and their families to relevant information and vital services, including health and education.
UNICEF also adjusted its strategies to respond to the growth in anti-human rights movement and
discriminatory public narratives. The aim has been to achieve further results for the most marginalized
children, but the response has been cautious rather than proactive, in the sense that the CO used several
entry-points (such as domestic violence policy and practice opportunities) as to be able to promote child
rights realization, being careful regarding the generalized negative perspective) on social protection
services, promoting rights of children from Roma communities or on early childhood development legal
framework. The evaluation found that this approach provided UNICEF Bulgaria CO the opportunity to
maintain and strengthen their partnership with the government and also, maintain its status at national
level as a key actor promoting child-rights realization.
UNICEF addresses gender equality to some extent in all aspects of its programming and implementation.
While some planned actions address specific gender-related needs (such as the prevention of child
marriages in Roma communities, and gender-sensitive statistics on violence against children), there are
CP areas where the gender equality principle is not explicit in the programming or design phases (such
as ECD).
Coherence
The UNICEF Bulgaria CPD remains true to its mandate to ensure the rights of all children to survival,
development, protection and participation and has been prepared and implemented in line with
UNICEF’s global and regional strategies.
The evaluation finds that UNICEF has strong credibility among all CP stakeholders and is well-
acknowledged as the primary defender of child rights in Bulgaria. UNICEF – with its accumulated
knowledge, experience and expertise at the global, regional and national level – has gained the trust of
all social and economic actors as a facilitator for policy dialogue across the public, private and civil
sectors. UNICEF is perceived as a reliable partner that supports the government and strengthens its role
in the fields of health, education and protection.
The overall partnership network developed by UNICEF Bulgaria CO can be defined as a relatively strong
community, with various connections with actors from different sectors, such us governmental bodies,
public agencies and institutes, CSOs, local authorities, and UN agencies and other international
organizations. According to the data collected through interviews and the findings of the social network
5
analysis, the most stable and strong type of partnership is the one established with governmental
bodies, followed by the partnerships with CSOs. Building strong partnerships, it has translated into
programmatic work that allow the CO to provide technical support to governmental bodies and other
implementing partners, conduct evidence-based advocacy, and develop and demonstrative models to
be brought to scale.
UNICEF has commissioned or supported the collection of evidence through numerous research and
studies, including research to inform the design of activities under outcome areas and generate valuable
data on vulnerable and marginalized children. The UNICEF CO has used the evidence gathered to review
and revise its strategic partnerships with a view to: 1) engage more academia in partnerships; 2)
enhance collaboration with the regional or local service units that are gaining importance and focus on
special groups (such as children from Roma community); 3) strengthen partnerships with the media for
fundraising campaigns and to advance the application of the C4BSC approach; and 4) develop strategic
partnerships to engage the private sector in common projects and leverage resources for children.
Impact
UNICEF actions have generated changes in the legislative framework for ECD, child protection and
justice for children. The adoption of the New Social Act, for example, represents significant progress at
the national level on the promotion and realization of child rights in social protection and justice for
children.
Other legislative improvements that have been achieved with UNICEF’s contribution include: the
development of the National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020;
the adoption of the National Strategy for Promoting Equality between Women and Men for the period
2021-2030; the adoption of the amendments of the Law on Asylum and Refugees and the amendments
of the Regulations and the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria.
While UNICEF has also helped to enhance cross-sectoral cooperation, the impact remains limited to the
tested models, such as the Home-Visiting Service (HVS) or Child Advocacy Centers models. There are
also concerns about the continuation of such cooperation after the end of the projects. However, the
models developed and implemented by UNICEF have proven to be very effective in improving the
quality of integrated support services provided for children and their families in all CP areas. They have
also helped to change the attitudes and behaviors of parents (in terms of the child care provided) and
teachers (contributing to a more inclusive school environment). Through the Family Consultative
Centers and HVS models, UNICEF has provided effective alternative care and support solutions to
support the deinstitutionalization process in Bulgaria. But, without the national expansion of such pilots,
their limited impact in terms of the numbers of people who benefit cannot generate a significant at-scale
change in the lives of children in Bulgaria.
Data and other information collected by the evaluation team demonstrate that the CP and its
implementation took into account the specific needs of different groups of children. Although most of
the interventions are designed to provide universal impact for all children, in practice they tend to target
and offer support for the most marginalized children. They achieve results, mainly, for these groups.
The CP documents include strategies to address the most critical bottlenecks. Comprehensive situation
and needs assessments, surveys and evaluation studies suggest that UNICEF Bulgaria take a proactive
approach to the identification of risks at different stages of the interventions, and uses different
monitoring mechanisms to revisit these risks and identify mitigation measures.
Nevertheless, the bottlenecks that were initially identified have persisted over time and some have
become serious threats to the efforts of the CO to achieve results at scale. Therefore, the sustainability
of many CP outcomes is highly dependent on political will, existing institutional arrangements, and
capacities at national and local level. As noted, UNICEF Bulgaria collaborates successfully with different
government bodies. However, the prospects for the sustainability of the results achieved to date are
uncertain. given the current political instability, strong opposition to human rights, constant changes in
the policy agenda on children rights, weak cross-sectoral cooperation, fragmented institutional
practices and limited capacities (especially at local level).
6
The evaluation found that CPD logic of the intervention lacks in coherence. While, many outcomes and
outputs indicators define impacts rather than results, the causal links between outcome level and output
level is week. Thus, in some cases, the expected outputs could not significantly contribute to the related
outcome.
Conclusions
The evaluation finds that UNICEF is well-positioned to assume a pivotal role in persuading actors from
different sectors to engage in concerted efforts to produce results for children. Building on this strength,
the CO has widened the scope and content of its partnerships when faced with political resistance to
child rights, to ensure the continued promotion of these rights without compromising its strategic
partnerships with the Government of Bulgaria and line ministries at the central and local level.
In this context, the evaluation shows that the CO has successfully addressed important and pressing
needs of children in the country, especially for groups of vulnerable children, and has supported policy
and institutional development for their benefit. UNICEF’s efforts to improve the situation for the most
marginalized children is well documented, with most CPD outputs focusing on specific groups of
disadvantaged children, such us children in residential care; children living in poverty; Roma children;
children with disabilities and/or at risk of developmental difficulties; child victims of violence; children
in conflict with the law; and refugee and migrant children.
An important contribution identified by the evaluation has been the CO’s provision of effective technical
support for the development of the legislative framework in all areas of the CP. The available evidence
shows important progress in the realization of child rights in most areas where the CO works.
UNICEF has, for example, made significant contributions to the process of deinstitutionalization and
solutions for alternative care, as well as support and counselling for parents from disadvantaged and
vulnerable groups. Its contribution to improving the legislative framework for child rights realization in
Bulgaria is well documented. Nevertheless, UNICEF should pursue its work in this area and provide
direct support for implementation through its available means. The process is long-term and the
changes that should be generated at-scale at the level of children’s lives will only be observable in time
(see Recommendation 1).
The evidence collected for the evaluation shows that the modeling components of the CP have been very
effective. The projects implemented have strengthened cooperation between duty bearers, and have
improved the quality of services for children in marginalized areas or children in precarious living
situations, in the areas of social protection, health and education. They have also increased access to
proper educational services for children with special educational needs and have improved the
knowledge, attitudes and practices of parents, especially those from the most remote and marginalized
settings. Additionally, these models have improved access to justice for children in contact with the law,
as well as access to specialized case-tailored services for child victims of neglect, abuse and violence or
for children at risk.
UNICEF has also contributed to the development of human resource capacity (such as social workers,
teachers and prosecutors) at the level of local public authorities and other public bodies involved in pilot
initiatives. As noted, the impact of UNICEF’s work can be observed mainly among disadvantaged
children, and analysis of the results at-scale of UNICEF CO Bulgaria in the period of 2018 – 2020/2021
indicates that the effects do go (to a limited extent) beyond the geographic areas where the pilot
programmes are implemented.
Nevertheless, there has been less progress on the objective of scaling up these pilots, and their impact
remains limited to the geographic areas where they are implemented. Most of these interventions
remain rather small in scale and local in scope. The data collected indicate that the provision of
integration could not be delivered to the same level of quality or intensity without the support of UNICEF
because of an ongoing lack of institutional capacity, and long-term impact is limited by the unclear
strategy to engage the government in the scaling-up of pilot projects (see Recommendations 3, 5 and
7).
7
A shift towards a more preventive approach and “positive messaging on child well-being and good
practice of the realization of children’s rights” was taken. However, there is room of improvement as
regards CO involvement in better addressing public prejudices and to tackle both the strong anti-child
propaganda and violation of child-rights. While UNICEF Bulgaria CO managed to generate results for
children’s lives (through the demonstrative models developed and regulatory and legislative changes
supported), the extent to which the new adopted legislation will be enforced or the current legislative
framework will be further improved depends also on the evolution of this movement. (see
Recommendations 2 and 3).
The evaluation found that the overall programming approach demonstrates gender sensitivity, with two
gender-related interventions: (1) prevention of child marriages in some of the most vulnerable Roma
communities and activities to empower the girls at risk; (2) interventions on violence against children.
In addition, gender responsiveness and gender mainstreaming are incorporated into the
implementation of other CP components (such as the HVS, parenting support programmes and the
capacity building of frontline workers on ECD). However, UNICEF’s gender priorities are insufficiently
clear and most stakeholders do not distinguish the gender equality aspect of its work. One serious
limitation is the lack of disaggregated data by gender in all cases; there are few gender-sensitive
indicators within UNICEF’s monitoring system (see Recommendation 6).
In addition to the gaps identified in the evidence to support UNICEF’s contributions to changes at
national level, the evaluation identified a series of inconsistencies in the CP logic of intervention, as well
as gaps in the CP performance framework (see Recommendations 8).
Lessons learned
UNICEF has adjusted its strategies to continue its work, despite the negative public discourse and
movements that affect the realization of human and child rights in Bulgaria. As a result, the CO learned
that there should be a balance between the extent to which its shifts its strategy to address the needs of
most vulnerable children and the expected results. UNICEF have used several entry-points to promote
the realization of child rights, being cautious in the face of negative perspectives, disseminated by
Bulgaria’s media, on social protection, on the rights of children from Roma communities, and the legal
framework for ECD. As a lesson learned, UNICEF has understood that a more proactive approach is
needed to advance its work. It has, for example, tried to find sources of funding through which to target
the Roma population directly and has, therefore, managed to advance its work through the European
Union Child Guarantee programme.
Perhaps the most important lesson learned by the CO is the need for more efforts on in the scale-up of
models. Without the development of a scaling-up strategy, agreed with all duty bearers in the early
stages of the project, the prospects of public institutions taking up the intervention remain unclear,
mainly due to a lack of public financial resources. Experience has revealed the challenges to the pilot
model used by UNICEF, and the CO needs to address sustainability from the outset.
As a result of the first three years of the CP implementation, the CO has realized that it should do more
to build upon the status of Bulgaria as a EU Member State and align more closely with EU priorities, to
position itself as a strategic partner for the government in using EU funds to improve the situation of
children in Bulgaria. UNICEF has worked to support the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee in
Bulgaria, and to leverage the available funds to improve access for the most disadvantaged and
marginalized children to quality, integrated services.
Another lesson learned relates to the strategy adopted by the CO when developing partnership with the
business sector. Experience has shown that UNICEF’s usual approach to the fundraising component of
the CP does not achieve the same impact when engaging with the private sector. In addition, the CO aims
to create partnerships beyond fundraising and to engage the business community in a more strategic
way, with interventions developed together and resources leverages on a more sustainable basis. There
is, therefore, a need for a more structured and focused strategy on the development of partnerships with
the business sector.
UNICEF has reacted in a timely and effective way to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, with support
to the government to contain the impact on children’s lives. UNICEF provided support that
complemented the work of the government, as seen in pre-school education, where UNICEF has
8
provided technical and IT support for children and teachers to help them continue the educational
process. Nevertheless, as the CO observed, there is still a pressing need to improve the quality and
coverage of data on the effects of the crisis on the most disadvantaged children. The inconsistency of the
national monitoring system on child rights has influenced the capacity of public institutions and UNICEF
to addresses the specific needs of the most marginalized children in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. Therefore, the improvement of the monitoring system remains a priority for the
development of well-grounded and effective policies.
Recommendations
The evaluation team formulated eight recommendations based on the findings and conclusions of the
evaluation report. These cover four main areas of action: policy advocacy (from a sustainability
perspective); partnership building and cross-sectoral cooperation; programming; and monitoring.
The team has developed a set of indicative measures (institutional, programmatic and operational), that
can be used by the CO to guide the effective implementation of these recommendations, which are
presented in the main report.
Policy advocacy
Recommendation 1. Continue to conduct advocacy activities and provide technical assistance to
improve the legal framework, support the development of law enforcement documents and continue to
follow-up on their implementation.
Partnership building and inter-sectoral cooperation
Recommendation 2. Continue to strengthen partnerships with both the government and key
stakeholders in the country and develop partnerships with other international organizations and other
UN agencies in a more strategic way.
Recommendation 3. Continue to support and facilitate the development of cross-sectoral cooperation at
all levels and all areas addressed by the CPD.
Programming
Recommendation 4. Prioritize specific objectives under each area of the CPD to focus more resources on
one single aim and to develop more coherent strategies for actions (this recommendation should be
considered together with recommendation 5).
Recommendation 5. For results-at-scale, plan comprehensive activities that combine advocacy
activities, technical assistance for improved financing/budgeting and support for capacity building
(training, leadership development, procedures, and development of IT capacity)
Recommendation 6. Integrate equity and gender equality into all CP outcomes (where relevant).
Recommendation 7. Embed sustainability into the design of pilot interventions, including follow-up
plans, handover and exit strategies, and arrangements for scaling-up.
Monitoring
Recommendation 8. Define the indicator framework of the CPD and the monitoring process to better
record the actions and the results of the UNICEF CO.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of the UNICEF Bulgaria Country Programme (CP)
2018-2022. The evaluation was commissioned by the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (ECARO)
of UNICEF and is part of the Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE), covering country
programmes evaluations in Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine and including a synthesis report.
The evaluation was carried out between February and September 2021 and covers the entire UNICEF
portfolio during the first three and a half years of the five-year programme. In addition, the evaluation
considers previous activities that have been continued and contributed to UNICEF impact, taking into
account UNICEF’s global strategic plan 2018-2022. This is a strategic evaluation that complements the
many sectoral evaluations and specialized studies that have been carried out by UNICEF and external
experts during this period. The evaluation report is also drafted in order to complement the 2020/2021
Situational Analysis (SitAn) and is intended to inform, together with SitAn, the decisions for the next
Country Programme of UNICEF Bulgaria CO.
The CP 2018–2022 had an initial budget of USD 4.2 million from regular resources and USD 11.5 million
in other resources and aimed to reach all children and young people across the whole of Bulgaria
through national level policy change and service improvements at all levels (national, provincial and
district levels)7. The Country Programme is structured following four core outcomes focusing on early
childhood development (Outcome 1), inclusive education (Outcome 2), child protection and justice
(Outcome 3), promotion of child rights (Outcome 4).
Due to the focus on policy, many of UNICEF Bulgaria CO’s partners were government ministries,
agencies and departments at national level, but a number of programmes also targeted institutional
strengthening at regional or district level. The evaluation assesses the CP’s collaboration not just with
government structures, but also with UN agencies and other development partners, as well as the civil
society organisations (CSO) participating to CP implementation as implementing partners or joining
efforts with UNICEF for advocacy.
Chapter 1 (the introduction) of this report describes the aims, objectives and scope of the evaluation,
the context within which the CO has been operating, and the overall shape and content of the CP itself.
Chapter 2 explains the methodology of the evaluation including ethics issues. Its findings are presented
in Chapter 3, organized according to the main evaluation criteria of this specific evaluation (relevance,
coherence and impact) and the evaluation questions set by the CO. Based on the findings, Chapter 4
presents conclusions, lessons learned, and recommendations.
1.1. Brief description of the context and current situation
Bulgaria is an upper-middle-income country and a member state of the European Union (EU) since
2007. Its population is 6,862,0008 of which children are around 17% (i.e., close to 2 million children
aged 0-17). Bulgaria is the country in the EU with highest shares of children at risk of poverty and social
exclusion. In 2019, 38.6% of Bulgarian children were at risk of poverty before social transfers, and
27.5% after transfers9 (i.e., close to half a million children). Every fifth Bulgarian child lives in severe
material deprivation (i.e., close to 250,000 children)10. Poverty and deprivation are more prevalent
among Roma families living in marginalized communities: about half of Roma children live in
households in the lowest decile of the income distribution, compared to fewer than one in ten Bulgarian
non-Roma children. Roma families also tend to have less access to basic social services, and face
exclusion and discrimination in education, employment and housing.11
7 At the level of year 2019, the total budget expenditure was 3,717,781 USD from all sources of funding (RR/OR/BMA and
ORE). There are no available data for the year 2020.

There is no complete data on the actual number of children with disabilities in the country, but the
estimated number is about 32,000. With respect to the number of children in institutional care, it has
dropped from 7,587 in 2010 to 495 in 2019 (93%)12. At the end of 2019, the number of children in
residential care was 3,095 and 45 % of them (or 1,415 children) were placed in family-type placement
centers for children and young people with disabilities13. The number of social services for children and
families has almost tripled - from 241 in 2010 to 620 in 201814. Despite this progress, the number of children
who are separated from their families has not dropped and, annually, some 2,000 children continue to be
separated and placed in alternative care.
Although still small as a share of GDP, the public expenses for education and healthcare are gradually
increasing in recent years. The period between 2015 and 2021 was marked by an unfavourable political
context, defined by strong opposition made by religious fundamentalist, anti-rights movements and
constant conflicts within the governing coalition (this period culminated with the 3 parliamentary
elections from 2021). In the recent years, the anti-human and anti-child rights narrative of some political
parties and extremist groups such as The Bulgarian National Movement, gained strong momentum in
Bulgaria, impeding key children-related strategic and legislative changes, including adoption of the
UNICEF-supported National Strategy for the Child 2019-2030. Moreover, in the context of Covid19
crises, anti-Roma public and politic rhetoric increased, in some cases even officials being engaged in this
kind of discriminatory acts. This came in the context of a legislative framework that, in some cases,
affects the realization of child and human rights. An example in this regard can be the criminal code in
regards with domestic violence, which is very lax when it comes to the classification of acts of violence.
Only acts committed in a context of “systemic violence” were punishable15. Moreover, the measures
enforced in the Covid 19 context have been applied to different extents to the population of Bulgaria.
According to the available information16, in some localities where quarantine was imposed (such us:
Sofia, Sliven, Nova Zagora) these measures were enforced in a discriminatory manner, with a focus on
Roma communities. Also, officials and representatives of the nationalistic political parties have
promoted hate speech models.
The regulatory framework has been significantly reformed in recent years, but with rather low overall
level of enforcement. In line with this, low enforcement of children rights has been recognised by some
of the stakeholders as a serious challenge to the overall regulatory stability in the country. As confirmed
by the Situation Analysis of Children’s Rights in Bulgaria 2021, in the area of Justice for Children, the low
enforcement is inconsistent, because the authorities adopt a discriminatory approach towards crimes
with a gender element, including domestic violence or rape, leading to biased prosecutions. Moreover,
in the case of the Social Services Act adoption many interviewed stakeholders expressed their concern
regarding the extent to which its implementation will be effective (taking into consideration the political
will, the administrative capacity of responsible bodies and the available specialized human resources).
In addition, the country’s weak administrative capacity could be considered as one of the main obstacles
towards the achievement of child-related policies.
The social protection system in the country remains fragmented with considerable gaps in coverage,
especially for the bottom 20% of the population (income-related). Many families are not accessing
available services and benefits or the support they are offered is not necessarily adequate to their needs.
About 75,000 households belonging to the poorest 20% of the population receive no social benefits at
all. More than half of the children from the poorest 20% of the households receive no formal or informal

care (provided by community members in an unregulated setting such as kindergartens).17 As a result,
the contribution of services and benefits to reduce poverty and social exclusion is lower compared to
other EU countries.
There are regional disparities in the provision of services, both in terms of the types of available services
and available capacity, especially at municipal level, to mitigate risks of vulnerability, minimize
dependency, and avoid falling into the intergenerational cycle of poverty and social exclusion. The Social
Services Act adopted in 2019, aimed at improving the quality, effectiveness, financing and monitoring
of social services and delivery mechanisms, addresses some of these challenges. The effective
implementation of the Act was postponed to July 2020 and implementation started in August 2020.
Bulgaria is one of the EU Member states where the newly introduced EU Child Guarantee is tested18 .
Existing social services have not been developed systematically, and some municipalities and
settlements are unable to provide adequate support. There is a considerable number of medium and
small size municipalities without any services for people with disabilities, and in many cases, support is
limited to residential type care with no option for day care or consultation services. In other localities,
available capacity is lower than demand, and long waiting periods may be common before users receive
any kind of service. The quality and inclusiveness of the education system continue to be challenging,
despite on-going reforms. This poses challenges for disadvantaged groups, such as Roma and children
in rural areas or in vulnerable situations. Persistently high rates of early leavers (age 18-24), though
displaying a decreasing tendency is higher (12.7%) than the EU average (10.6%) as of 201819.
Regarding the educational system, Bulgaria has been confronted in the past 7 years with a negative
trend in pre-school and school-aged children rate of enrolment. This is a major a point of concern.
According to the data presented in UNICEF Bulgaria CO SitAn 2021, “children and adolescents are kept
out-of-school for a range of complex and overlapping forms of exclusion, disparities and inequalities”.
One of the most important factors that cause low levels of school participation is poverty or material
deprivation. This can be observed with a much more prevalence in Roma communities20.
Moreover, low educational performance is a major weakness. The rate of under achievement in PISA
2018 is 41.5% in reading as opposed to EU average of 19.7%; 42.1% in maths as opposed to EU average
of 22.2%; and 37.9% in science as opposed to EU average of 20.6%21.
Good quality early childhood education and care plays a key role in creating equal opportunities,
improving cognitive skills and reducing early school leaving and the risk of under-achievement at later
stage. In Bulgaria, the enrolment rate of children aged less than 3 years of age in formal care is much
lower than the EU average (16.2% vs. EU average 33.2%), particularly in some regions and among
vulnerable children. Even if the maternity leave in Bulgaria is one of the longest in EU, consisting of 410
days from which 45 being used before the birth of the child, the lack of facilities is limiting participation,
especially in large cities22.
The reform of vocational education and training (VET) continues, but the employment rate of VET
graduates is still below the EU average. Tertiary educational attainment is still below the Europe 2020
target, and the provision of higher education is only partially aligned with the needs of the labour
market. The rate of participation in adult learning is one of the lowest in the EU23.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, the UNICEF CO in Bulgaria is monitoring
closely the situation of children and their families and is working with the Bulgarian Government, UN
Agencies, municipalities, service providers, civil society, corporate partners and other partners to help
prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, strengthen national response capacities and keep children and
their families safe with a special focus on the most vulnerable. The CO is providing timely
communication on the best means of preparedness and prevention, including special guidelines and
advice for parents, schools, health and other professionals, children and young people, through
community-based communication, mass media and social media.
In terms of changes developed at the level of programme structure, CO of Bulgaria has added in total 5
new Covid19 related indicators under the following outputs: Support for ECD, Support for reducing
school dropout and Prevention and response to VAC & GBV24.
1.2. Country Programme components and goals
The overall goal of the UNICEF country programme 2018-2022 is to assist Bulgaria to “ensure that all
of its children and adolescents, particularly the most disadvantaged, enjoy their rights and
develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective society that respects their voice”.25
The CP contributes to meeting 10 Sustainment Development Goals (SDGs) in Bulgaria, as presented in
the report, under the cohesion chapter, which focuses on the extent to which the programme addresses
the global goals and priorities.
Bulgaria Country Programme is organised around four outcomes:
Outcome 1: The CP aims to support the development of child-focused policies and programmes
for family support and social inclusion, the improvement of the national policies in the ECD area
as to better address the most disadvantaged children, the improvement of cross-coordination
between health, social and child protection sectors in the ECD area and the increase in access to
support quality and holistic services regarding nurturing care and child protection. The
outcome formulated to reach this objective is: “by 2022, boys and girls, especially those who are
most disadvantaged, benefit from effective national and local policies that support a nurturing
family and social environment to attain a high level of development, health, learning and
wellbeing”.
Outcome 2: The CP aims to contribute to the increase in access to better quality and inclusive
education services. The outcome that measures the objectives of UNICEF Bulgaria in the area of
inclusive education and early learning is formulated as it follows: “by 2022, boys and girls,
especially the most disadvantaged, are in school and benefit from improved inclusive, gender-
responsive educational policies and practices”.
Outcome 3: The CP aims to contribute to the decrease in social tolerance on violence against
children, to a strengthened commitment of Government and Parliament to the legislative reform
on children in conflict with the law and child victims and witnesses of violence and crime, to a
strengthened prevention system and to the decrease of the number of children being victims or
being at risk. The outcome that measures the objective of UNICEF Bulgaria in the area of child
protection and access to violence is formulated as it follows: by 2022, the social services, the child
protection system and the administration of justice prevent violence more effectively, protect child
victims and ensure access to timely remedy for child participants in judicial procedures, including
in humanitarian situations.

Outcome 4: The CP aims to contribute to evidence on children rights realization generation and
promoting, to partnerships among key stakeholders strengthening and to awareness raising
regarding the situation of children in Bulgaria, focusing on the most vulnerable groups and to
reducing discrimination, stigmatization and negative social norm towards children. The
outcome that addresses this area is formulated as it follows: by 2022 child rights are monitored,
communicated and promoted through the strong engagement of state institutions, civil society,
academia, media, private sector, children and adolescents and parents.

20
Stakeholders play an important role in ensuring that the country programme planning and
implementation will fit into the international and national planning/programming hierarchy while
ensuring cohesion with public/private/civil stakeholders and the international and national community
to foster effective alliances to drive change, as expected.
According to the stakeholder analysis conducted by the evaluation team, primary stakeholders include
the following:
• State Bodies as UNICEF’s main Government partners.
• Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), as implementing partners and in relation to piloting of CP
activities
• The academia as collaborators in the CP implementation with a range of academic institutions.
• Donors, multilateral and bilateral donors, have a direct stake in the evaluation findings as these
will account for their contribution to UNICEF’s performance, without which the CP would not be
possible
• UN agencies that are partners of the current the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework, and bi-lateral donors (USAID, DFID, SIDA, among others), and international finance
institutions including the World Bank, and other IFIs are significant stakeholders in terms of
policy framework, technical
Secondary Stakeholders refer to rights holders and duty bearers who benefit from the contributions of
the CP, and organizations with which UNICEF does not have any formal partnership but that work with
similar programmes and on child rights issues for which lessons and good practices drawn from the CPE
may be relevant.
Finally, stakeholders inside UNICEF who have a particular interest in the MCPE include: Staff in
UNICEF’s Cos, the Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (ECARO), and senior management in
UNICEF who can draw upon the evaluation findings for regional and corporate learning and
accountability purposes.
Below we present the results of stakeholder analysis in regards with the key identified stokeholds of the
CP, their level of interest and power in regards with the aims of the programme.
21
Figure 1. Stakeholders position in Bulgaria
This analysis was further undertaken under the “coherence” criterion, from the perspective of the level
of effectiveness of partnerships built by UNICEF Bulgaria CO with key stakeholders (see section 3.2.2).
1.3. Purpose, objectives and scope of the evaluation
The objective of the Multi-Country programme Evaluation (MCPE) is to conduct a formative multi-
country evaluation serving both accountability and learning purposes. This MCPE aims to look back
and assess the relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the
country programmes (CPs) in the four countries (Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine) to
22
identify good practices, and draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the
2023-27 CP planning process, which already commenced or will commence soon in all four countries.
In line with the ToR, the objectives of the MCPE are to:
- Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s
contribution to the results for children at scale especially for the most vulnerable in Bulgaria,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine.
- Support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by
understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies, through which the
Country Programme is delivered to better understand the added value of UNICEF in each
country context;
- Draw lessons from the previous CPD implementation in order to make the best use of UNICEF’s
change strategies in each country covered by the evaluation and in the region as a whole, while
considering current circumstances.
In order to be able to produce the information and data to allow the assessment of the above stated
factors, the evaluation, assesses:
- the linkages between international, regional, national and institutional strategies to bring about
overall improvement in the status of children with a view to clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of national stakeholders and how UNICEF interventions can add value and
contribute to policy development for systemic improvements;
- the extent to which interventions focus and deliver results for most vulnerable categories of
children, in each of the 4 countries;
- the performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF level, the quality of
indicators and their capacity to estimate their capacity to measure and communicate results,
including the measurement of horizontal issues measured (gender, participation, equity, most
vulnerable).
The geographical coverage of the MCPE is Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine. The geographical
scope of the evaluation covers the whole of the countries, even in cases where the initiatives have started
as pilots, because they are implemented with the intention to scale-nationally.
The evaluation is built on evidence collected from interventions implemented in the countries especially
in the last 3 years and a half (under the current CPDs), but also, to a more limited extent, in the years
before. Specific activities carried out to set aside the negative consequences of the current pandemic
crisis were taken into account to the extent they are part of the results chains in areas selected.
Therefore, the scope of this Country Programme Evaluation is the following:26
- Temporal scope: 2018-June 2021, meaning it covers the current Country Programme (2018-
2022) to date. However, when relevant to the observed impact, the temporal scope of the
evaluation is extended to the previous years and the previous CPD.
- Geographical scope: All areas in Bulgaria where UNICEF works
- Portfolio scope: All of the portfolio components, cross-cutting issues such as gender, and inter-
sectoral support involving gender and communication.
- Organizational scope: The CO and wider provision of technical support and oversight from
UNICEF’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, when relevant, UNICEF’s headquarters.
- Excluded: The evaluation will not provide a detailed assessment of all CP components. However,
in order to provide lessons learned and UNICEF practices and strategies in achieving impact for
children at scale, a more in-depth impact assessment has been undertaken for three selected
areas: early childhood education, inclusive education, protection form violence against children.
26 According to the ToR.
23
The primary users of this Country Programme Evaluation are intended to be the UNICEF CO and ECARO.
Secondary users of the evaluation are the Government of Bulgaria, UN agencies and development
partners present in Bulgaria. The evaluation report aims to build on the agreements made between them
and to assist prioritization and establishing strategies for the future, as the parties move together into
the next planning and programme cycle.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Evaluation framework: criteria and questions
The Evaluation Matrix was developed (Annex 1) during the Inception Phase, as the core analytical
framework against which data was gathered and analysed. All evaluation questions were assigned to a
specific evaluation criterion: relevance, coherence and impact. For each evaluation question, related
indicators/descriptors, sources of information and data collection methods were specified in the matrix.
The indicators and methods were based on the preliminary documentary review done at the Inception
Phase of the evaluation.
The evaluation criteria and questions in the evaluation matrix are provided in the ToR and indicated to
be final and not subject to change. Although the ToR provided the opportunity to each CO to add up to
two questions, no additional evaluation questions were proposed by the COs during the Inception Phase.
The evaluation matrix is built on an overall approach linking evaluation criteria and level of assessment.
On one side, analyses and findings on “Relevance” and “Coherence” (assessed across the entire CP) are
to be taken into account under “Impact” due to the fact that, on one side, in order to determine a positive
change, UNICEF Bulgaria CO’s interventions have to be relevant for those addressed by the CP. On the
other side, CO’s impact - its contribution to an observed change - might be determined by other
interventions, too, implemented by, e.g. other donors, and CO’s added value in this context is particularly
important. Evaluation of impact is to be undertaken for the entire CP. In order to provide lessons on
UNICEF Bulgaria CO practices and strategies in achieving results for children at scale, a more in-depth
impact assessment, by using the process tracing method, has been undertaken for three selected areas,
which were the subject of three case studies: early childhood education, inclusive education for children
with disabilities, and protection from violence against children. The assessments at result area level
contributed to findings and conclusions, as examples (case studies) of results-at-scale achieved (or
not/less than expected). The result areas have been selected based on an initial analysis of the
evaluation team and in consultation with the CO. The evaluation questions related to how UNICEF
Bulgaria CO contributed to change for children at scale can be best answered using specific theory-based
impact evaluation methods, as described below. Nevertheless, these methods are best applied to
selected case, rather than to very complex and heterogenous programmes. In this regard, the 3 areas,
where the in-depth analysis has been focused, have been selected to represent different types of results
achieved by the CO, with different levels of change for children at scale generated by UNICEF Bulgaria
CO to be analysed.
The evaluation utilized a formative approach to the evaluation to look back and assess the relevance,
coherence and impact achieved throughout implementation of the Country Programme in the country,
to identify good practices, and draw lessons and forward-looking recommendations that can inform the
2023-2027 CP planning process, which will commence during the last quarter of 2021. As the current
Country Programme Evaluation is meant to inform the next UNICEF Bulgaria programmatic cycle, the
evaluation team adopted a utilization-focused approach27.
The CPE involved three phases: (1) inception; (2) data collection; and (3) analysis and reporting. The
methodology used a mixed methods approach involving qualitative data collection methods as well as
quantitative methods. To improve the reliability and to validate the findings, information from different
lines of inquiry was triangulated.

2.2. Data collection and analysis methods
The team engaged with UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF Bulgaria CO, government authorities, public
institutions, civil society partners and other development agencies to ensure that the evaluation
responds to the needs and priorities of the users.
The evaluation used the following methods of data collection: (a) document review (Annex 7); (b) key
stakeholder interviews, and a survey for the social network analysis for the assessment of the coherence
of the CP and UNICEF Bulgaria CO partnerships.
Semi-structured interviews were the main tool used with national partners, the interview guidelines
reflecting the upstream nature of the programme and the status of the respondents. Primary data was
collected from a variety of stakeholders, including government officials, UNICEF Bulgaria CO staff, civil
society organizations and development partners (see the list of interviewed stakeholders in Annex 6).
In total, 24 individual interviews were conducted largely remotely due to COVID-19 restrictions. 5
interviews took place in a face-to-face format. The interviews have been conducted by the international
and national consultants, working in pairs or individually. The interviews were guided by checklists to
support consistency of data collection across the team and varied stakeholders. But for each interview
the questions have been tailored as appropriate to valorise best the position and knowledge of the
interviewee. In line with the ethical consideration presented below the evaluation team ensures the
confidentiality of the interviewees, without connecting the evidence and opinions expressed during
meetings with the identity of the stakeholder
The selection of the key informants followed a dedicated sampling strategy, agreed with the ECARO and
CO at the end of the inception stage. The aim of the sampling strategy was to cover the country
programme in a general manner and the three selected impact areas and to include different types of
key informants (UNICEF Bulgaria CO staff, representatives of the government, representatives of
UNICEF agencies and other development agencies, representatives of academia, services providers and
implementing partners) in the list of interviewees for each area. Following from the programme design
and focus of its activities, it was decided to spend the majority of the time with stakeholders at national
level, because so many of the planned results are at policy level.
As per ToRs of this evaluation, children and adolescents have not been interviewed or consulted directly
in any way. The evaluation team decided instead to rely on sectoral evaluations and studies that have
presented the perspectives of these groups more thoroughly than would have been possible during this
evaluation. The evaluation team instead met representatives of intermediary groups that work closely
with vulnerable children.
Three participatory online workshops have been organised with CO staff. The workshops aimed at (1)
familiarizing the evaluation team with the CP and identifying and selecting the impact areas to be
assessed more in-depth, (2) presenting the inception report, discussing key issues to be addressed by
the evaluation and planning data collection in cooperation with the CO and (3) presenting and validating
findings and discussing preliminary recommendations. The evaluation report will be also presented and
discussed in the Evaluation Reference Group, as part of the dissemination phase of the evaluation
findings and conclusions.
The analysis methods are presented in the evaluation matrix. A theory-based approach was applied
for the Country Programme Evaluation (CPE), based on the explicit sectoral theories of change (ToCs)
developed by the UNICEF Bulgaria CO (and reconstructed by the evaluation team) for the CP and
selected impact areas. A brief presentation of the methodology for Process Tracing and Contribution
Analysis methodologies used for the selected areas are presented in Annex 3. Another essential analysis
method was the Realist Evaluation. According to Westhorp (2014) realist approaches “assume that
nothing works everywhere or for everyone, and that context really does make a difference to
programme outcomes”. Therefore, the Realist Evaluation focuses on how, why and in what contexts an
intervention leads to particular outcome.
26
Finally, other important evaluation methods utilized for the evaluation are stakeholders analysis and
social network analysis for evaluation of UNICEF Bulgaria CO coherence, added value and cooperation
with stakeholders in order to enhance the results pursued; systems-based evaluation principles:
holism, non-summativity, participation of stakeholders, equifinality and multifinality approaches were
used through the evaluation, as UNICEF’s interventions are not evaluated in a vacuum, but in a complex
context that have been taken into account.
The recommendations were developed by the evaluation team, based on in-country consultations on
the early draft findings, and the later analysis of the data, findings and conclusions. The specific wording
of the recommendations was developed in consultation with the Country Office which provided
feedback, comments and questions through the report drafting process.
2.3. Ethical issues and considerations of child rights, equity and gender
The evaluation team adhered to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical guidelines and code
of conduct. This means that the evaluation team upheld the appropriate obligations of evaluators,
including maintaining the independence, impartiality, credibility and accountability of the individual
team members and the evaluation process as a whole. The evaluation team was not subject to any
conflicts of interest and confirmed that they were able to carry out the evaluation without any undue
interference. Along the data collection, analysis and reporting, in order to ensure the integrity of
evaluation, special attention was paid by evaluators towards respecting the ethical standards of UNICEF,
as presented in the “UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data
Collection and Analysis” (April 2015), particularly as concerns: the harms and benefits, informed
consent, privacy and confidentiality, payment and compensation, conflict of interests.
The main ethical issue that emerged during planning the evaluation was the need for anonymity and
confidentiality for government officials interviewed. The evaluation team ensured the consent of key
informants to be interviewed and give the experts conducting interviews gave formal assurance that
comments made during interviews would be anonymous. Hence none of the statements mentioned in
this report are attributable to individuals or particular government departments. On the other hand, as
no children have been directly involved in the evaluation, no formal letter of consent on the collected
data was needed.
2.4. Limitations
The main challenge facing the evaluation arose from the spread and complexity of the CO’s objectives
and its strategies in Bulgaria during a period of political instability. Overall, the changes that UNICEF
seeks to make are mostly long-term and countrywide. Moreover, the evaluated period overlapped with
the COVID-19 pandemic (since March 2020). In this context the sustainability of UNICEF Bulgaria CO
results, as assessed in this report, is endangered and the evaluation team is not able to confidently or
clearly predict to what extent the strategies of upstream policy work will ultimately benefit children in
the country, or the benefits already achieved will last given the social and economic crisis generated by
the pandemic.
The evaluation ToR emphasized its strategic nature and the evaluation team focused on the main overall
and long-term questions as it saw them; it was not able to analyse each of the different programme
components in detail, nor did it set out to speak with the programme’s planned or actual end-
beneficiaries.
Assessing UNICEF Bulgaria CO’s contribution to results at outcome or output level was another difficult
area. The evaluation has devoted considerable attention to the question of causality, in other words,
who or what is responsible for changes at different levels of policymaking or implementation of new
policy. In many cases not only UNICEF but also several other organisations or development agencies
have played a significant role in supporting the Government.
27
The evaluation team faced a few limitations at the design and evaluation phase of the Country
Programme.
- Non-systematic documentation of the theory of change for some programme areas which was
addressed by development, testing and validation of an indicative ToC to serve as framework
for evaluation. However, in the case of Process Tracing, not all desirable evidence was available.
- As the data collection phase was delivered in July and August 2021, during the holidays season,
not all key informants were available or reachable at the time of evaluation, however a
sufficiently high number of interviews have been conducted.
- Some indicators (particularly for outcome) are not monitored (i.e., values are not inserted in
RAM 2020). The targets for the indicators are set for 2022 and their values are not collected and
reported annually.
To maximize the reliability and validity of evidence used, the team triangulated the available
information as much as possible, and tested consistency of the evidence within different claims using
also the case-specific expertise of the evaluators and their good knowledge of the context. Also, a clear
distinction between “absence of evidence” (which has little inferential power), and “evidence of absence”
has been made, as the latter can strongly challenge the causal mechanism investigated.
2.5. Management of the evaluation
Alongside UNICEF evaluation managers at ECARO, the evaluation team maintained close contact with
the CO representatives and staff and UNICEF Regional Advisors. The interviews with ECARO advisors
greatly helped the evaluation team develop its analysis.

3. MAIN EVALUATION FINDINGS
3.1. RELEVANCE
3.1.1. To what extent has UNICEF responded to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable throughout the programme implementation
UNICEF Bulgaria CO responded very well to the (changing) needs of the most vulnerable children
throughout the programme implementation. First of all, the CP addresses the most vulnerable
groups and the tested models that have proven this focus by generating observable results
mainly at the level of most marginalized, hard-to-reach families and children. Second off all, the
CO have put great efforts in evidence generating in regards with child rights realization in
Bulgaria. In this context, the technical support provided to the ministries and the conducted
advocacy activities were based on the developed studies and analysis. Finally, the CO have
adjusted its work by focusing on the stringent needs of children in the context of the negative
effects generated by the Covid 19 crises on children’s lives.
The review of existing documents, reports, evaluations and studies provided by UNICEF Bulgaria CO for
the purpose of this evaluation suggests a strong evidence-based approach to UNICEF-supported
interventions. Findings from the Mid-term review of 2015 and from the 2017 Situation Analysis are well
incorporated in UNICEF Bulgaria CO programming to prioritize the CP components and to align them
with the national needs and priorities. Several studies have been used to provide updated information
on changing national needs and to inform appropriate adjustments in the strategies used by UNICEF
Bulgaria CO. Only in 2020, three situation analyses studies have been produced and used for mid-term
strategy adjustment (i.e., update of Alfa SitAn, Public Finance Management for Children SitAn and
Business for Result SitAn). This resulted in adaptation of the CP to strengthen the focus on closing
disparities for the most disadvantaged and hardest-to-reach children (i.e., children in residential care;
children living in poverty; Roma children; children with disabilities and/or at risk of developmental
difficulties; child victims of violence; children in conflict with the law, and refugee and migrant children).
It also has led to additional programing shifts aiming at pro-active participation in Covid-19 pandemic
recovery and resilience building and strengthening partnership engagement with business.
There is a strong consensus among the stakeholders interviewed that child poverty was one of the
biggest challenges for Bulgaria upon entry into the pandemic-induced crisis. According to the NSI data,
more than one third of children aged 0-17 years in Bulgaria were at-risk-of-poverty in 202028. At the
same time, despite the significant progress in limiting child mortality, there are still places and
vulnerable Roma communities where children die in unacceptably high numbers.29
The strong vulnerability focus of UNICEF Bulgaria CO activities, targeting the most marginalized
children from deprived and hard to reach communities; Roma and Turkish children; children at risk of
abandonment, those not attending school, children with disabilities, those living in remote rural areas
or in regions with limited employment, children of migrant and refugee families (and particularly those
who are unaccompanied and separated from their families); children in residential care; children with
disabilities; out-of-school children; children victims of violence, has been well recognized by the
stakeholders. These groups of children face significant inequalities that need to be addressed.
UNICEF responds directly to the needs of the most vulnerable groups by supporting their inclusion in
mainstream education; supporting early childhood development; intervening to improve children's
health; supporting provision of complex/advanced services to child victims of violence. In addition,
UNICEF involvement in parental capacity development and empowerment of the parents from the most
disadvantaged backgrounds is considered a pivotal strategy for responding to the needs of the most

30
vulnerable children. Still, most of the modelling interventions addressing the needs of vulnerable
children remain rather small in scale and local in scope, while there is a clear need for a comprehensive
system for early childhood intervention at the national level. Further details on the models designed and
implemented by UNICEF are presented in section 3.3.2, under Impact chapter.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, UNICEF in Bulgaria is monitoring closely
the situation of children and their families and is working with the Bulgarian Government, UN Agencies,
municipalities, service providers, civil society, corporate partners and other partners to help prevent
the spread of COVID-19 virus, strengthen national response capacities and keep children and their
families safe with a special focus on the most vulnerable. UNICEF is providing timely communication on
the best means of preparedness and prevention, including special guidelines and advice for parents,
schools, health and other professionals, children and young people, through community-based
communication, mass media and social media. Moreover, in 2020, 5 output indicators Covid 19 related
were included in the CPD in order to capture the support activities conducted by UNICEF in this context.
3.1.2. To what extent has UNICEF consistently integrated the equity and gender equality in
all aspects of programming and implementation, including policy and advocacy?
UNICEF addresses to a limited extent gender equality in all aspects of programming and
implementation. While some planned actions address specific gender-related needs (such as:
prevention of child marriages in Roma communities, gender sensitive violence against children
statistics), there are also CP areas where the gender equality has not been addressed in an
explicit manner, nor in the programming phase or in the implementation phase (such as ECD).
The Gender Programmatic Review (2020) shows that while gender equality has been developed as a
cross-cutting issue in the UNICEF Bulgaria’s CPD, an in-depth gender analysis is either not undertaken
or not properly translated in the programming and implementation aspects30. Moreover, the results
from the interviews held suggest that gender priorities are not clearly articulated and majority of
stakeholders do not clearly distinguish the gender equality aspect of UNICEF’s work. The poor quality
of data, including lack of disaggregated data by gender, has been identified as a serious limitation for the
robust integration of gender equality in UNICEF’s M&E system.
The overall programming approach demonstrates gender sensitivity, with several outcomes directly
addressing achievement of results for both girls and boys. However, there are only few gender sensitive
indicators within the UNICEF’s monitoring system.
Two specific gender-related interventions have been programmed in the areas of inclusive education
and violence against children, and linked to gender-specific outcomes:
(a) “Roma adolescent girls” has been identified as a particularly vulnerable group, and a modelling
intervention to test an integrated approach for addressing gender roles and social norms in
several municipalities has been envisioned in the CPD to contribute to Output 2.3 „Support for
reducing school dropout“. The intervention puts special focus on prevention of child marriages
in some of the most vulnerable Roma communities, and seeks to identify the best approaches to
empower girls and to influence families. A special indicator has been introduced to reflect the
cross-sectorial approaches used on dropout prevention for Roma adolescent girls and children
at risk of dropping out. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic this intervention was put on
hold and no progress on the gender-specific indicator has been reported.
(b) VAC-related planned interventions put special focus on collaboration with national stakeholders
on improving data collection, including gender-disaggregated data, as well as provision of
guidelines on the production/collection of gender-sensitive VAC statistics. It has been also
envisaged that UNICEF Bulgaria CO will provide policy advice and technical assistance for
legislative amendments and “strengthening the systems for protection in a more child-sensitive
30 UNICEF Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (2020). UNICEF Bulgaria 2022 Gender Programmatic Review. United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
31
and gender-sensitive manner”31. This is expected to contribute to output 3.1. “Strengthened
capacities, multi-sectoral programs, services and evidence-base for prevention and response to
Violence against Children (VaC) & Gender Based Violence (GBV) and for creating a safe and
protective environment for children”.
Reported activities of UNICEF Bulgaria CO also demonstrate varying level of gender responsiveness and
gender mainstreaming efforts are still not consistently and efficiently integrated into the overall
implementation approach.
(a) Early childhood development
- None of the ECD and child care outputs are measured with gender-specific indicators.
- The interventions related to Home Visiting Service (HVS), parenting support programs and
capacity building of front-line workers on ECD could be considered as having a purview
regarding gender responsive approaches. The modelling interventions to strengthen
parenting support though provision of HVS in the regions of Shumen and Sliven contribute
to better access of young pregnant women and mothers, including pregnant adolescent girls,
to integrated services, combining access to home visiting, healthcare, social services. There
is a clear equity principle applied in delivery of these services, with considerable outreach
to Roma and Turkish women and girls. However, as stated in the Gender Programmatic
Review (2020), and confirmed by our informants during the interviews held for this
evaluation, the services are focused extensively on female beneficiaries (pregnant women,
young mothers, mothers-in-law) and are delivered predominantly by female service
providers (nurses, health mediators). There is little evidence regarding engagement of
fathers or male caregivers in the community-based parenting support programs. In addition,
there is no gender disaggregated information on the number of children benefiting from
these services. This situation is caused mainly by contextual factors, such as: patriarchal
norms particularly strong in Roma communities and rural areas or gender specificity of
some professions where the majority of employees are females.
(b) Inclusive education
- UNICEF interventions in this area target improvement of inclusive, gender-responsive
educational policies and practices. Although CPD Outcome 2 states that “boys and girls
especially the most disadvantaged are in school and benefit from improved inclusive, gender
responsive educational policies and practices”, available data and evidence do not articulate
any gender-specific progress of the activities and approaches focusing on inclusion of
children with disabilities in the mainstream education. There are no indications that gender-
differentiated needs of the children with disabilities are considered and addressed by the
interventions and technical support delivered in this area.
- One of the interventions in the inclusive education area has a special gender equality
element targeting ending of traditional child marriage and Roma adolescent girls’
empowerment to advance in secondary education. However, this intervention is outside the
scope of the current evaluation and is not analysed in details.
(c) Protection from violence and access to justice
- There is clear evidence for gender-specific problems in the VAC-area. Both Ministry of
Interior data, and the interviews held by the evaluation team show that there is a tendency
towards increasing sexual violence and bodily harm of boys. Moreover, boys appear to be
more often in conflict in law than girls, with boys being the predominant part of the children
placed in correctional facilities.
- According to the findings of the Gender Programmatic Review (2020), UNICEF interventions
supporting the provision of special premises for interviewing and hearing the testimony of
children (i.e., “Blue rooms”) in several locations could be considered gender-sensitive, as
they allow for gender-sensitive procedures ensuring privacy of child-victims and also
facilitate their forensic examination (especially of the girls). However, the causal link
between the existence of supportive infrastructure and children access to gender friendly
justice is very weak.
31 UNICEF (2017). Country programme document Bulgaria
32
- At the same time, there are limited indications that UNICEF’s actively and efficiently address
the existing low gender-related sensitivity of the regulatory framework.
- UNICEF contributed to the National Strategy for Promoting Equality between Women and
Men for the period 2021-2030, with proposing concrete measures related to strengthening
the capacity for prevention and response to violence and victims’ support.
(d) Data strengthening
- The poor quality of data, including lack of disaggregated data by gender has been identified
by different evaluation studies commissioned by UNICEF as a serious limitation for the
robustness of the M&E system. UNICEF provided a focused support to the National Statistical
Institute and other national information systems aiming at the collection and analysis of
disaggregated and gender-sensitive data. However, the access to quality disaggregated data
on ECD, on inclusive education of CwD and on child participants in judicial proceedings is
still limited.
3.1.3. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to changes in national needs and
rights of the beneficiaries, especially of the most vulnerable and in national
priorities during programme implementation?
The overarching goal of UNICEF Country Programme in Bulgaria is to support the country in its
efforts to enable all children and adolescents in the country, including the most disadvantaged,
to enjoy their rights and develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective society. The
CPD is also fully aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the observations of
the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2018–2021) and the Council
of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child (2016–2021).
The evaluation team has found clear evidence that UNICEF Bulgaria CO has a practice to routinely
engage children and adolescents (and/or their parents) in needs assessments and programming
milestones (planning, mid/end-year review, monitoring, evaluations). Feedback received from some of
the key informants shows that UNICEF approach to routinely organize surveys to collect feedback from
different parties (children, parents, teachers, etc.) is recognized as a good practice providing an
opportunity to look through the lenses of children, to identify properly possible bottlenecks and risks,
and to tailor the program to better meet their needs. The CO practice to commission variety of reports
and analysis every year, mobilizing the available Bulgarian expertise, is also considered by the
stakeholders as a good practice both in terms of the needs-responsiveness of interventions and of
provision of valuable information that ultimately could be used in evidence-based policy making.
UNICEF Bulgaria CO agenda is fully aligned with national priorities, as summarized in Table 1 below.
This finding has been confirmed by the review of the relevant policy documents, all the available surveys
evaluating specific UNICEF interventions, and the feedback received during the interviews held.
- In line with the national strategic documents, UNICEF contributed to the continuation of the
national implementation of child care reform and deinstitutionalization process32.
- The UNICEF supported demonstration home visiting services (HVS) are well aligned with the
Government’s policies, programs and services established in the area of maternal and child
health, early child education and care, social welfare and child protection and
deinstitutionalization33.
- Deinstitutionalization and development of foster care as a social service is a priority of the
national social policy and part of the national policy for support of children and families.
Accommodation of children at risk in a foster family is one of the alternatives to accommodation
in a specialized institution, providing an opportunity to support and overcome crisis situations
for children and their biological families.
- The UNICEF strategies and modelling interventions in the area of ECD are broadly aligned with
the national strategic priorities, aiming at introducing quality social and healthcare services and
preventive programs for children and their families; improving the health care for pregnant
women, mothers and children by providing integrated health counselling services in maternity

33
and child health counselling centres; introduction of screenings for children at risk of
developmental difficulties; etc. Significant policy focus is put at creating a network of services
for prevention of child abandonment, for reintegration into a family environment, special
services for children with disabilities and others.
- Inclusive education has been acknowledged as an important priority of the national policies,
aimed at ensuring the best interests of the child.
- CAC modelling intervention is well aligned with the national priorities aiming at developing
various services, models and tools for violence prevention and work with children, victims and
perpetrators of violence, identified with the National Program for Prevention of Child Violence
and Child Abuse (2017-2020).
- The stakeholders involved recognized the CACs and UNICEF-supported efforts to address
violence and bullying in schools as well aligned with the Government’s national priorities to
ensure a safe environment for children in schools.

3.1.4. To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to the shifts caused by crisis or major
socio-economic and political changes?
UNICEF has adjusted its activities as to timely respond to the challenges caused by the Covid-19
pandemic outburst. In this regard UNICEF have conducted several studies and analysis on the effects
of the pandemic on children’s lives and supported the government, local public actors and other
stakeholders in providing access for children and their families to relevant information and to vital
services (such as: health or education). Regarding the growing anti-human rights movement and
discriminatory public narrative in Bulgaria, UNICEF have adjusted its strategies as to able to further
achieve results for most marginalized children, but its response has been rather cautious than
proactive.
The Covid-19 pandemic created an unprecedented crisis with a strong impact on vulnerable
children. A recent study indicates increasing gaps in access to education (which has been provided mostly
remotely in electronic environment since the beginning of pandemic) for children and students with low
socio-economic status, Roma and those living in rural areas34. Covid-19 pandemic induced also strong anti-
vaccination public opinion and affected negatively the overall propensity of parents to vaccinate children,
especially in some vulnerable Roma communities. In addition, some social services were scaled down,
limiting the access and demand for such services.
The UNICEF’s flexibility and timely reaction to Covid-19 crisis has been largely recognized by the
stakeholders, especially those involved in different piloting interventions locally. UNICEF
contribution involved:
- Provision of sanitary packages and supplies to the most vulnerable families and children;
- Continuous support for parenting of young children using different modalities;
- Provision of information on COVID-19 and guidance on health and caregiving to families with young
children through the home visiting services;
- Efforts to improve the access to remote online learning for children and adolescents from vulnerable
communities, providing tablets and strengthening the role of education mediators.
- Provision of non-formal education activities for asylum seeking children and adolescents;
- Engagement with business within a Back to School with Business Initiative to share knowledge and
guidance on how to safely reopen the schools;
- Active involvement in the prevention of Covid-19 related gender-based violence, in addition to the
other support regularly provided.
In addition to supporting vulnerable children and their families during the pandemic, UNICEF also
contributed to accumulation of COVID-19 related knowledge by commissioning a large number of studies,
including:
- UNICEF commissioned an Assessment exploring economic, social, educational, psychological and
organizational aspects of online learning, which influenced the development of the National
Framework for re-opening of schools.
- UNICEF supported the MoES to develop a Toolkit for education provision in situation of COVID.
- National surveys for young people and COVID-19, providing evidence regarding the beliefs and
behaviours of marginalized youth.
- Representative survey on needs and vulnerabilities among families and the impact of COVID-19
- Monitoring Survey on the social-economic impact of COVID-19 on households.
- An overview of municipal responses to COVID-19 with a focus on social and economic measures,
etc.
However, the political situation in the area of child rights has been deteriorating in recent years. This could
be considered as having a major negative influence on the Country Programme implementation in Bulgaria.

38
The anti-human and anti-child rights narrative gained strong momentum, impeding key children-related
strategic and legislative changes, including adoption of the UNICEF-supported National Strategy for the
child 2019-2030.
Although UNICEF Bulgaria CO reported refocussing of its strategies to skills development and
improving its readiness to work under the worsening anti-child rights environment, the feedback
collected during the interviews indicate a rather cautious approach in reacting to these negative
developments. The documents reviewed and the interviews with CO staff suggest some shift to more
preventative approach and “positive messaging on child well-being and good practice of the realization of
children’s rights”35. The CO utilized domestic violence policy as an entry point to strengthen national and
local response in the area of violence against children and turned the focus from gender-based violence and
access to justice for children which were subjects more difficult to address given the context. The evaluation
found that this approach provided UNICEF Bulgaria CO the opportunity to maintain and strengthen their
partnership with the government and also, maintain its status at national level as a key actor promoting
child-rights realization. Also, despite the fact that the negative public discourse regarding human and child
rights become more visible and the social movements gained more adepts, UNICEF managed to surpass its
targets related to output “Communication for child rights”, in terms of media coverage of UNICEF voice and
number of potential impressions reached through traditional media. However, some of the stakeholders
expressed certain concerns about UNICEF's low preparedness to address public prejudices and to tackle
effectively the strong anti-child propaganda and violation of child-rights.
3.2. COHERENCE
3.2.1. To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme kept true to its mandate and aligned
with UNICEF’s global and regional strategies as well as UNSDCF and SDGs in any given
country?
UNICEF Bulgaria CO CPD remains true to its mandate to ensure the rights of all children to survival,
development, protection and participation and it has been prepared and implemented in line with
the UNICEF’s global and regional strategies.
UNICEF Bulgaria CPD refers to SDGs in the programme documents, implementation strategies. It should be
noted that health, nutrition, education and protection interventions in the first 8 years of life contribute
to the achievement of at least nine of the SDG goals directly, also to the achievement of all goals as the most
cost-effective window of opportunity for laying strong foundations for the future health, education and
economic productivity of their citizens indirectly. Given the middle-income context of the ECA region,
sustainable growth in countries is dependent on the development of “cognitive capital.”
The Country Programme encompasses 4 goal areas:
• Goal Area 1 – Every child survives and thrives: The CPD aimed at promoting national policies
and strengthening national and decentralized capacities to support a nurturing family and social
environment rich with stimulants for 0-3 age children and ensure equitable access to services of
communities in remote settlements and the most disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable
families.
• Goal Area 2 – Every child learns: The CPD aimed at building human, technical and operational
capacity in the MoES for supporting the enforcement of inclusive educational policies and practices.
• Goal Area 3 – Protection from Violence and Exploitation: The CPD aimed at Prevention of
violence against children, protection of victims and improved access to justice.
35 COAR (2019)
39
• Goal Area 4 – Child Rights Monitoring: The CPD aimed at communication and promotion of child
rights, developing new alliances and partnerships for better protection and monitoring of child
rights.
Furthermore, UNICEF Bulgaria CO works with the government and EU institutions to transpose the
European policies and principles of the European Social Charter, perceived as the Social Constitution of
Europe. It represents an essential component of the continent’s human rights architecture, with reference
to civil and political rights, and a broad range of everyday human rights related to employment, housing,
health, education, social protection and welfare, into national policies. The Charter lays specific
emphasis on the protection of vulnerable persons such as elderly people, children, people with
disabilities and migrants. It requires that enjoyment of those rights be guaranteed without
discrimination. UNICEF Bulgaria CO has played a facilitating role in the piloting of Child Guarantee and in
the preparation of the of Human Resources Development and Food and Material Assistance); National Strategy for

3.2.2. To what extent did UNICEF manage to build effective and sustainable partnerships in
working towards addressing the predefined bottlenecks, advocating for evidence for
equity and contributing to results at scale?
The overall partnership network developed by UNICEF Bulgaria CO, can be defined as a relatively
strong community, with various connections between actors in different clusters formed around
each department/specialist of the CO, thus in each addressed area of the CP and also with connection
between the identified clusters. UNICEF has managed to build effective partnerships with key
stakeholders, most effective being the ones with governmental bodies and CSOs. This finding is well
reflected when UNICEF provides technical support to governmental bodies and other implementing
partners, conducts evidence-based advocacy activities or tests models. Nevertheless, the
collaborations with state agencies and institutes, local public authorities and UN agencies and other
international organizations are also well-established. UNICEF Bulgaria CO has recently put efforts
in developing strategic partnerships for engaging the private sector in common projects and
levering resources for children, through the development of a corporate strategy and in involving
more the academia in the implemented projects and in advancing the application of C4BSC
approach.
According to the Social Network Analysis, the main institutions the CO collaborates with are: Governmental
bodies, NGOs and associations and state agencies and institutes. As the below figure shows, among the
institutions that have been mentioned by respondents, majority of connections have been established
between governmental bodies and UNICEF CO (39% of the total number of connections), followed by
collaborations developed with CSOs (27%). State agencies and institutes are also key actors in UNICEF COs
network, as they represent 19% of the connections established with all identified collaborators.

Source: Data collected through a survey conducted at the level of UNICEF CO Bulgaria
The Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy have been identified
most often as important partners in the development of COs activities (7 times each), followed by the
Agency for Social Assistance (6 times) and Ministry of Interior and State Agency for Child Protection (5
times each). Although the interviews held for the purpose of the evaluation have indicated the fields of
cooperation with business bodies and underlined the need to improve partnership with the business circles,
the fact that the country office staff have not mentioned business representatives among the most important
stakeholders may imply a need for improved internal communication in this regard.
45
Stakeholders interviewed described the UNICEF CO’s partnership strategies as (i) active participation in all
multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary activities where children have a stake - high visibility among relevant
stakeholders was ensured in this manner; (ii) active contribution to the development of surveys, research
to inform policy development as well as advocacy and C4BSC strategies. Interviews also provide some
evidence regarding the tendency to improve partnerships by (i) ensuring active involvement of academia,
(ii) strengthening collaboration at the regional and local level to implement new models where service
providers are encouraged to accept the parents and the families as partners, (iii) developing a corporate
strategy, fund raising for vulnerable groups that are not directly addressed (as children from Roma
communities).
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO of Bulgaria, the
data analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with various connections
between actors in different clusters formed around each programming area or each
specialist/expert of the CO. The social network analysis (please see Annex 4) found that the actor that is
best connected within the network is the ECD Officer, followed by: the Officer for communication and social
change, the RMCP Officer, social policy specialist and the consultant on prevention of violence and access to
justice area. Moreover, the collected data indicates that the most frequent and valued (in terms of provided
support) paths of communication can be identified between: a) the Education officer and the Ministry of
Education and Science in Bulgaria, followed by b) the Child protection specialist and the State Agency for
Child Protection and the Agency for Social Assistance and c) Social policy specialist with the Ministry of
Labour and Social Policy.
The programme documents, interviews and the Network Analysis conducted for the purposes of MCPE
imply that, UNICEF CO maintained the high-level involvement and provision of adequate and timely
technical support to the Government of Bulgaria during the implementation of the current CP,
despite the social-political resistance against actions aiming to ensure the human rights of children and
women. UNICEF continued to deliver results and kept vulnerable children’s issues on the national agenda
through continued collaboration with government partners, business and NGOs, and providing quality data
and evidence for decision making as well as conducting C4BSC activities. UNICEF also assumed an active
role for developing policies and guidelines, through cooperation with relevant international organization
and participation in the preparation of operational plans within the framework of ESF+.
There are seven types of partnerships sustained by UNICEF Bulgaria CO:
1/ The partnership with the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and line Ministries, and with
local authorities are managed in line with the country programme of cooperation. UNICEF provides
intensive technical assistance to government authorities through transfer of know-how, investing in
building capacity through training of professional staff, introducing new methodologies, tools and
approaches, assisting the development of strategic documents, conducting evidence-based advocacy to
improve the quality and coverage of public services and brings innovation in the fields it operates. Though,
faced with obstacles due to political resistance on culturally sensitive areas, the partnership with the
government, especially at the technical level, is reported to be constructive and positive, in general. This
finding has been also supported by the social network analysis. The partnerships at the local level, especially
in early childhood growth and development services are reported to be smooth and constructive. The
ownership at the local service units for early childhood services increases with chances of mainstreaming
the new models and/or practices.
2/ The partnership with implementing partners can take several forms, including cooperation with
specialized institutions abroad for the provision of know-how on the specific field of intervention;
46
cooperation with international organizations with a mandate in the outcome areas; international and
national CSOs to provide services within the framework of the programme implementation, and
cooperation with academia and universities either for the implementation of training activities at the field
or for improving the pre-service curricula.
The latter group function as service providers either through services agreements with UNICEF or through
the provision of technical and financial support from UNICEF to accomplish their work at the ground level.
Many of the partnerships in this group have led to a strong ownership of UNICEF priorities, strategies and
objectives on the part of those partners. Other interlocutors, also, have assessed these partnerships as
effective. It should be noted that very close working relations, ranging from joint advocacy initiatives
(initiatives aiming at legislative amendments) to provision of services (either through capacity building or
specialized assistance to target groups) are established with several CSOs. The stakeholder analysis
conducted within the framework of this evaluation implies that the multi-year partnerships with some CSOs
cut across all programme areas and collaboration in various activities. Such long-term partnerships imply
that the collaboration was constructive and effective for producing intended results.
3/ Partnerships with non-governmental organizations, may take the form of cooperation through
networks, alliances initiated by UNICEF to bring together like-minded people and professionals to initiate
a community interested in children. These partnerships are established through partnership agreements
and cooperation in campaigns within the framework of C4BSC activities, organizing seminars, research and
publications. This type of partnerships was effective in building the knowledge base of civil society
organizations and raising public awareness. The social network analysis also concluded that the
partnerships established between UNICEF Bulgaria CO is among the strongest ones and, according to the
perspectives of the CO staff, the most beneficial, in terms of the support provided in developing solutions
for the identified problems (e.g. inputs for legislative changes, developing and implementing demonstrative
models and other). However, it should be noted that some representatives of civil society organizations
were critical of UNICEF’s for not taking a stronger stance against the anti-child rights movement.
4/ The Partnership with International Organizations is working well. Since the UN community in
Bulgaria is small, consisting of UNHCR, IOM, WB and IMF, with few staffs in each organisation; UNICEF, as
the designated official, initiated the process for working together. The group is small, yet effective for
advocacy purposes as well as in the preparation of national strategies through joint efforts with other
international organizations. According to the social network analysis, the collaboration between UNICEF
Bulgaria CO and the other UN agencies and international cooperation organization is the second-best valued
partnerships by the CO staff members.UNICEF is playing an active role in the preparation of the operational
programmes and plans in the framework of EU Cohesion Policy, especially within the framework of
developing and implementing the EU Child Guarantee and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.
5/ Partnerships through South -to -South Cooperation is considered a significant tool for knowledge
exchange and peer interaction. UNICEF Bulgaria CO has conducted activities with UNICEF ECARO, UNICEF
COs in various countries as well as key government and non-governmental partners from the COs in the
region. Within this framework UNICEF Bulgaria CO: a) along with UNICEF Peru and UNICEF Uganda was a
stakeholder in a joint proposal UNICEF headquarters submitted to H&M Foundation for a program to
support early childhood intervention for children with developmental difficulties b) supported the Third
International Conference on assistive technologies for alternative and augmentative communication (AAC)
with exclusive UNICEF participation from ECARO, Serbia and Croatia; c) contributed to knowledge and
experience sharing in the region as key government and non-governmental partners participated in
different events related to De-I and childcare reforms in Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Greece. UNICEF Bulgaria
CO benefited also from the support and cooperation with UNICEF Croatia on the transfer of a parenting
program for parents of children with disabilities, under the ECD component.
47
6/ The Partnerships with the private sector is mainly focussed on project-based cooperation or fund-
raising efforts involving employees and customers of corporate bodies. Partnerships with business are
reported to be stronger in the areas of education and early childhood development compared to relatively
low interest in the area of VAC and J4C. Although it is possible to trace scope of the actual support by the
private sector networks consisting of employees and customers, it is not possible to analyse the
contribution of private sector towards the results at scale. The study titled “The Impact of the Business Sector
on Children’s Rights in Bulgaria: Business Situation Analysis 2020” and interviews held for the purpose of this
evaluation imply that the partnership strategies with the business may evolve into a new phase.
Accordingly, the renewed strategy on partnerships with the private sector is expected to rely less on funds
secured from the private sector and to focus more on building on the corporate responsibilities in terms of
business practices in employment, production of goods and services, local community development,
environmental protection, technology and innovation with a view to converge business practices in a
manner to support the full realization of child rights.
7/ The partnerships with media are established within the framework of Communication for Behavioural
and Social Change (C4BSC), mainly in the form of cooperation in campaigns to disseminate basic messages
and to help make the voices of children heard. Also, in partnership with the Association of European
Journalists, UNICEF, prepared a guidebook for ethical reporting, which is used across the region, to improve
reporting on child rights in media. Notwithstanding the opinion of some interlocutors to the effect that the
media is not fully independent, the opinions collected from stakeholders within the framework of this
evaluation also suggest also that UNICEF, should focus more on building on the potential role of media
through enhancing it capacity for disseminating knowledge on the rights of the children and the need for
all children to fully enjoy those rights, as opposed to working with the media to market its brand and
increase donations.
According to the reports of UNICEF37, the C4BSC activities have managed to reach a substantial number of
people and engaged journalists and young people were engaged in content development.
The CO has developed an inter-sectoral partnership with corporate businesses, NGOs, media and academia
for the organization of the first youth-led virtual hackathon on digital solutions for media literacy38.
Based on the perspective of UNICEF Bulgaria CO staff, on a scale from 1 (no value) to 10, the average value
of the collaboration established with governmental bodies is 7,48 and with state agencies is 7,41. But the
most valued cooperation is the one with CSOs, receiving 8,54 points out of 10. Another very good valued
collaboration is the one established with UN agencies and other international organizations, receiving an
average of 8,4 points. In the case of local public authorities (LPAs), the information and support received by
the respondents is the least valued, receiving 5,4 points.

According to the opinion of respondents to the survey for the social network analysis (i.e., staff of the
country office), the main benefits of the collaboration with partners are: information for solving problems
(31%), followed by support in accessing and convincing decision makers (21%) and information that helps
identifying problems (19%).

Thus, while the most important gain from UNICEF Bulgaria CO partnerships is the relevant information for
solving problems, the second most important benefit is the access to decision makers. These two combined
contribute significantly to the achieved results of the CPD and highly reflect the overall approach of the CO
in generating change for children in Bulgaria.
3.2.3. What are the comparative advantages of UNICEF in relation to other actors in the
country, including development partners, private sector, and non-government sector,
and to what extent were they necessary and sufficient for contributing to the results at
scale to be achieved?
Both the documentation and the interviews held for the purpose of this evaluation reveal that
UNICEF has strong credibility among all stakeholders and well-acknowledged as the primary
defender of child rights. UNICEF – with its accumulated knowledge, experience and expertise at the
49
global, regional and national level – has gained the trust of all social and economic actors as the
facilitator of policy dialogue among public-private-civil sectors. UNICEF is perceived as a reliable
partner that supports the government and strengthens its role in the fields of health, education and
protection.
Quoting the words of an interlocutor: “There are no cases in which UNICEF Bulgaria CO has not fulfilled a
commitment”.
Partners (ministries and public institutions/agencies) acknowledge the contribution of UNICEF in
highlighting the needs for and the implications on children in the decision-making processes in developing
of strategic documents, legislations, policy documents and in piloting new services.
UNICEF is considered to provide valuable support; using excellent communication skills, adopting a flexible
approach to work, responding to partners' needs and providing them with freedom of action. UNICEF has a
very strong team and a very well-established network. They manage to combine the different elements of
the area to support and recognize partnership opportunities very effectively.
UNICEF’s unique contribution is in the way it provides support, which is based on evidence pertaining to
the needs of the target groups and its flexibility and openness to take action in case of emerging
opportunities. UNICEF’s approach to researching, monitoring and evaluating interventions and collecting
feedback from parents, teachers, experts in the Regional Departments institutions is highly appreciated and
perceived as effective.
The municipalities are under a lot of pressure due to the structural changes that rendered them responsible
of many social functions. Therefore, the support provided to municipalities by UNICEF through the services
of CSOs is much appreciated. They also regularly consult with UNICEF staff.
UNICEF has developed good working relations with the relatively small offices of UN organisations in
Bulgaria. The large UNICEF office is described as unique and rich in technical expertise. UNICEF’s
experience in working with the public authorities is perceived as an advantage. The best part of the
collaboration with UNICEF is the fact that it is not based on competition but cooperation to develop common
projects or activities to serve the best interest of children.
Cooperation with other UNICEF offices and prominent institutions as resource providers for knowledge
exchange and peer interaction and is appreciated by all stakeholders since such interaction is perceived as
learning opportunities.
All stakeholders perceive the partnership with the media, mainly in the form of campaigns, as effective in
branding UNICEF and drawing public attention to child related issues, and raising funds. UNICEF is
perceived to have enormous opportunities and resources to structure large-scale and targeted public
campaigns.
Documented evidence and interviews held for the purpose of this evaluation imply that UNICEF is
well-positioned to assume a pivotal role in persuading the actors from different sectors to engage
in concerted efforts for producing results for children. Building on this strength, when faced with
political resistance to promote child rights UNICEF Bulgaria CO, managed to widen the scope and content
of its partnerships with the aim of ensuring an ownership for the rights of children among the general
public, without compromising its strategic partnership with the Government of Bulgaria and the line
ministries at the central and local level. The approaches to establish alliances have reportedly helped to
expand the realm of UNICEF and improve its capacity to intervene.
50
One important aspect of UNICEF’s approach to partnerships within the framework of capacity building
activities is its focus on team building and peer learning and collective learning as opposed to individual
learning.
Also, UNICEF, as an active user of Facebook39 in providing information and announcing new services
targeting younger families is perceived is yet another advantage.
3.2.4. How has UNICEF’s approach to strategic partnerships changed over time, if any?
Building and strengthening partnerships is an important aspiration for UNICEF Bulgaria CO.
Significant investments were made to understand the state of play in the social and economic arena
with a view to ensure that the best interests of children are taken into consideration at all spheres
of life.
UNICEF Bulgaria CO collected evidence through numerous research studies commissioned, supported, or
contributed by it. These studies included: research informing the design and planning of activities under
outcome areas and generating valuable data on vulnerable and marginalized children and on planning the
COVID-19 response. Within this framework, UNICEF Bulgaria CO reviewed and revised its strategic
partnerships with a view to engage academia in partnerships, enhance collaboration with regional
or local service units which are gaining importance compared to previous programme cycles and
focus on special groups (such as the children from Roma community) as well as by strengthening
the partnership with media for fundraising campaigns in this area. Moreover, UNICEF Bulgaria CO
developed a corporate strategy which aims at engaging in a more consistent manner the private
sector in common project as to leverage resources for children.
As opposed to signing bilateral agreements with institutions, UNICEF has started to involve all relevant
institutions at the central and regional level to sign a joint memorandum of cooperation, allocating
respective responsibilities and commitments.
The fact that UNICEF CO’s strategy on C4BSC is perceived as an approach for building strategic, cross-
sectoral partnerships and ownership of a wide spectrum of social and economic actors with a view to
produce results at scale is a strength. According to the data collected through the interviews conducted with
key stakeholders and the evidence presented in the UNICEF Bulgaria CO reports, the partnership with the
media was an important element of the programming for communicating the basic messages for
behavioural and social change and encouraging the general public to promote the rights of children in all
settings, This partnership was effective in ensuring continued public support for children, especially in the
face of the anti-child rights movement, and in performing a critical role as an integral part of the COVID-19
response when families were supported with information about child care and nurturing care and students
were provided with on-line learning opportunities.
Based on interviews carried out, compared to the past, the partnership with businesses currently enjoys
increased attention by UNICEF Bulgaria CO and is expected to expand in scope in a manner to mainstream
the overarching goal of full realization of child rights into business practices throughout the production and
marketing process, including human resources management. UNICEF Bulgaria CO developed a strategy for
partnerships with the private sector, documented in the Private Sector Plan 2018-2022, as an integral part
of the Country Programme Management Plan. Both the documented evidence and interviews held for the
39 As of July 2021, there were nearly 4.4 million Facebook users, with 22.7 percent of those users being between 25
and 34 years of age. The source also notes that 47.7 percent of these users were male and 52.3 percent were female.
Statista Research Department, Oct 15, 2021.
51
purpose of the MCPE indicate that the CO perceives partnerships with the private sector as a means of
achieving maximum results for children by mobilizing resources in a manner to develop operational
partnerships beyond fundraising.
3.3. IMPACT
3.3.1. Did UNICEF Bulgaria contribute to results at-scale? If yes, how and why did it make a
difference and for whom? If not, why not?
UNICEF managed to generate, through its actions, changes in the legislative framework in regards
with ECD area, child protection and justice for children. UNICEF also contributed to the
enhancement of cross-sectoral cooperation, but mainly in relation with the tested models and this
effect remains limited, its continuation after the end of the projects being an important point of
concern. Further, the models developed and implemented by UNICEF have proven to be very
effective in improving the quality of services provided for children and their families in all CP areas
and also changing attitudes and behaviors of parents (in term of child care provided to children)
and teachers (contributing to a more inclusive school environment). But, without their expansion
at national level, their limited impact in terms of number of children and families that benefit from
the intervention cannot generate a significant at-scale change for children lives in Bulgaria.
In 2021 a Situational Analysis (SitAn) to support the development of the future Country Programme has
been conducted and available data and information, as well as SitAn’s findings and conclusions inform this
impact assessment.
Further we present a set of horizontal findings regarding the contribution of UNICEF CO work on the
following 3 key aspects: legislative framework improvements, enhanced cross-sectoral cooperation and
access to improved integrated public services for children and their parents. These conclusions are drawn
from the impact analysis developed under each outcome of the CPD (presented in the following sub-section
3.3.2).
The contribution of UNICEF in improving the legislative framework regarding child rights
realization in Bulgaria is well documented. The access to expertise and well skilled personnel provides
the CO credibility among key stakeholders in each area addressed by the CPD in order, which facilitates
their engagement in strong and long-term partnerships with duty bearers and other implementing
partners. All interviewees acknowledged UNICEF’s contribution to providing effective technical support for
developing the legislative framework in all CPD areas (ECD and child care, inclusive education, protection
of children against violence access to justice for children and strengthening the monitoring system in
regards to child rights realization in Bulgaria). The adoption of the New Social Act represents a
significant progress registered at national level regarding the promotion and realization of child
rights in the areas of social protection and justice for children. Nevertheless, the fact that the new
legislative framework is very recent did not allow the evaluation team to assess its actual impact on
the lives of children in Bulgaria. The policy enactment is an essential step in improving the access of
children to better quality public services, thus, the implementation of the law is another important aspect
that has to be further assessed. The process is a long-term one and the changes that should be generated at-
scale at the level of children’s lives will become observable in time. With the same importance in terms of
the strategic level changes achieved with the support of UNICEF are the legislative improvements made in
the area of refugee and migration and gender-based violence, such us: The National programme for
prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020, The National Strategy for Promoting Equality
between Women and Men for the period 2021-2030, Amendments of the Law on Asylum and Refugees,
amendments of the Regulations and the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria.

UNICEF Bulgaria CO contributed to a better understanding at the level of central and local public
authorities regarding the importance of cross-sectoral perspective when designing public services
and aiming to improve the situation of children in need, but in practice, the effects of UNICEF’s work
in regards with the enhancement of the cross-sectoral cooperation remains limited to the
implemented models and, to a large extent, does not continue after the projects are finished. The
continuous efforts made for strengthening the cross-sectoral approach in certain areas, such as ECD or VaC,
through well designed models that are based on the cooperation of relevant key actors from different
sectors in regards with developing and delivering integrated services for children is well demonstrated by
the available evidence40. Nevertheless, based on the findings of the Situation Analysis and of the data
collected through interviews, the lack of specialized human resources at the level of public service
providers, the understaff situation, the insufficient financing limited the effects of UNICEF’s work beyond
the piloted projects. UNICEF have supported improvements in this respect (such us: support the
strengthening of the legislative framework in the area of social care, support the adoption of the disability
functional assessment, support the development of specialized training programmes for the specialist
working with children), but there is still a need to strengthen the structural conditions that enable better
public services provision for children.
The evidence collected shows that the modeling components of the CPD have been very effective,
but their impact remains, in general, at a limited scale due to the fact that they have not been taken
up by the government. Due to the fact that the models scaling-up is an objective where less progress was
achieved, the observed impact on the targeted children (in terms of improving the lives of children and
ensuring the realization of children’s rights), remains limited at the level of geographical areas where the
pilots are being implemented. The focus of UNICEF efforts on improving the situation of most marginalized
children through the actions and interventions developed is well documented. Most of the CPD outputs are
focused on specific categories of disadvantaged children (such us: children living in poverty, children
exposed to neglect, abuse and violence, children with disabilities, children with special educational needs,
refugee or migrant children, unaccompanied children, children from Roma communities and other).
Further, based on the evaluations of the implemented models, the impact of UNICEF actions can be observed
mainly at the level of these disadvantaged categories. . Nevertheless, as the analysis of the results at-scale
of UNICEF CO Bulgaria in the period of 2018 – 2020/2021 shows and as already mentioned above, the
impact observed or generated go beyond the areas where the pilot programmes are being implemented to
a very small extent.
It is important to mention that, in the context of the pandemic, UNICEF has adjusted or developed new
activities, within the outcomes of the current CPD, as to be able to support the governmental response and
address the needs of most affected children and parents. In this regard, UNICEF has developed an extensive
set of analyses and research on the impact of the pandemic; it has included public health information in its
current campaigns; supported specific activities directly targeting vulnerable families and children. UNICEF
provided learning materials for children and access to online learning for pre-school children and continued
the work of CACs online when face to face counselling could not take place.
*Note on the assessment of UNICEF impact based on the outcome and output indicators in the Country Programme Document
Although most of the indicators analysed are – according to UNICEF denomination – outcome and output indicators, they are not only
measuring direct results of each activity conducted by UNICEF. They also potentially show overall or short-term changes with direct
relevance for children at scale, either referring to the situation of children, changes in public perception, attitude or behaviour or
systemic changes that enable institutions to fulfil better their role in providing services for children and protecting their rights.
Many outcome indicators are formulated as impact indicators as per UNICEF - Final results framework of the UNICEF Strategic Plan,
2018-2021. In this regard, some examples are: under Outcome 1, # of children (disaggregated by gender, age, disability, refugee and
40 Evaluation of HVS 2018, Evaluation of CACs 2020, the data collected from the interviews conducted with UNICEF CO
and the implementing partners.

migrant children) entering formal care every year), under Outcome 2, Rate of school-age children out of school, by sex and education
level and Early leavers from education and training, by sex, under Outcome 3, # of cases of violence against children identified, reported
and addressed – Outcome 3.
Further, it is important to mention here that the contribution of UNICEF to the progress registered at country level, in the
areas addressed by the CP, was difficult to be assessed in some cases, due to the logic of the intervention of the CPD,
especially in terms of outcomes and outputs definition and the causal links established between them, which, to some
extent, lack of coherence. On one hand many output indicators define impacts rather than results and the activities that should
lead to the achievement of outputs are not very clear and, on the other hand, in some cases, the direct links between the outputs
and the outcome that they should contribute to cannot be established. For example, the first 2 outcome indicators under Outcome
2 (Inclusive education and early learning), namely the rate of enrolment and the rate of early drop-outs, are very high level defined
and they are not well corelated with the expected results of the proposed actions. The level of coverage of the developed
interventions cannot generate significant changes regarding the 2 indicators, especially in the context in which for the last decade
Bulgaria has been confronted with a constant decrease of the enrolment rate of children in education system, the highest decrease
being registered at primary school aged children. Only one output is directly linked with the 2 outcome indicators mentioned above
and the only action that can generate a direct impact on the level of school dropout consists in the development of a dropout
prevention model which is planned to be fully implemented in two regions by the end of year 2022. Therefore, its limited coverage
and the lack of a scale-up strategy in regards with this model cannot lead to a significant contribution at the level of the two outcome
indicators. The current design of the ToC not only makes the assessment of the UNICEF CO impact difficult, but also affects the
effectiveness of the monitoring system and thus, the internal capacity of CO to assess the progress made towards achieving the
objectives of the programme during its implementation, as to be able to take mitigation actions if required. In this regard, for the
second outcome indicator, under Outcome 1 (ECD and child care), namely the proportion of disadvantaged families with children
0–2 years of age who received targeted counselling and support for promoting early childhood development with a target of 30%
for year 2022, no administrative or monitoring data is available in order to assess the extent to which UNICEF has contributed to
its achievement. Further, in regards with the monitoring process implemented at the level of UNICEF CO, the fact that the progress
at the level of outcome indicators achievement is not reported annually affects the extent to which the CO is able to effectively assess
the progress of the CP throughout its implementation.
A comprehensive analysis of UNICEF contribution to overall developments at national level and a table analysing the
indicators and achievements of UNICEF Ukraine is presented in Annex 2A.
Indicators in the table are marked on their relevance for the assessment of impact. And when impact can be measured, the type of
impact is identified as: (1) better access to services/direct improvement of the situation of children, (2) behavioural and attitudes
change; (3) institutional change (including institutional capacity raised); (4) change in policy (including strategies, plans, laws,
legislation of other nature/level); (5) improvement of financing for children.
3.3.3.1. Evaluation of UNICEF impact under each Outcome of the Country Programme
A comprehensive account of UNICEF contribution to the reported impact is presented in Annex 2 and
specific detailed examples are analysed as part of the process tracing case studies for three areas: (1) early
childhood development, (2) inclusive education for children with disabilities and (3) violence against children.
The findings of the 3 case studies feeds into the following analysis of impact under each outcome and it is
presented in detail in Annex 3.
UNICEF contribution to observed progress concerning early childhood development and child care
(impact under Programme Outcome 1)
The contribution of UNICEF has been significant in the process of deinstitutionalization, and for
providing solutions and models for alternative care and support, which led to increased access for
vulnerable children to better services. UNICEF also contributed to improved access to support and
counselling for parents from disadvantaged, vulnerable groups and enhanced parenting skills, but
the impact in this regard remained limited to the beneficiaries of the implemented models (HVS and
FCC).
54
Early childhood development is a cross-sectoral area which embeds the health care, education and social
and child protection services, according to the national and institutional legal framework of Bulgaria41.
Nevertheless, the current system of social services lacks cross-sectoral coordination in the area. The efforts
made by UNICEF as regards ECD and child care focused on increasing the access of parents to integrated
and quality services, through testing family-based and community-based support models and through
advocacy for the development of the national legislative framework in this direction.
The first outcome of the CPD 2018 – 2022 – Early Childhood Education and Child Care is operationalized
through 2 outcome indicators. According to the existing administrative data at national level, the first
outcome indicator, which addresses the advancement of the deinstitutionalization process has been
fully achieved in Bulgaria and the target set by UNICEF for 2022, has been already surpassed. In the
area of child care and more specifically in line with the National Strategy “Vision for Deinstitutionalization
of children in Bulgaria 2015 – 2025, Bulgaria has made an important progress, overreaching its objectives.
The number of institutionalized children has dropped significantly, the number of specialized institutions
decreased and the development of alternative care services has been in parallel improved.
For the second outcome indicator of CPD, which refers to the increase of the proportion of disadvantaged
families with children between 0 and 2 years old that receive support and counselling for ECD, there
is no available comparative data that can show the improvements achieved by 2021 at national
level. Nevertheless, the efforts of UNICEF in this concern led to an improved legislative framework in
Bulgaria and to a significant number of families receiving ECD support and counselling, as it will be further
presented.
The findings of the impact assessment on the area of early childhood development, which is presented in
Annex 3. Process Tracing – Case studies, feeds into the following analysis.
UNICEF contributed to a strengthened legislative framework in Bulgaria in the area of ECD and child
care and thus to the improvement of the situation of children, through: testing models and scaling them
up, supporting evidence generation through studies and research, providing technical support to public
authorities. UNICEF has supported the development and implementation of the National Strategy for Vision
for Deinstitutionalization (2015–2025), which, along with the commitment of public authorities, led to a
significant progress in ensuring the right of every child to live in a family environment. The contribution of
UNICEF in informing national policy, and supporting services for vulnerable children and families, and for
finding alternatives to institutional care is highlighted by the fact that UNICEF Bulgaria’s study “Helping to
de-institutionalize children in Bulgaria: Evaluation of the Family for Every Child Project in the Region of
Shumen, Bulgaria, 2017” was included in the Best of UNICEF Research and Evaluation 2020 joint
publication42. Despite the unfavourable political climate due to which the ECD strategy has been put on hold,
Bulgaria has adopted in 2020 the Social Services Act that leads to important improvement in the legislative
framework of social service. The new act lays the ground for a more cross-sectoral coordinated system of
social services, increases the focus on child rights realization and provides the framework for family and
community-based serviced in the ECD area.
There is sufficient evidence that UNICEF’s actions in ECD area resulted in strengthened parenting
competencies for the parents participating in COs initiatives (such as in HVS and FCCs, but not only)
and thus, enhanced quality of parental care. Nevertheless, their impact remains limited to the
geographical areas where the models have been implemented. According to the progress made by
UNICEF in regards with provided support for ECD, 13794 parents/caregivers of children under 5 received
parenting support to improve care and development of their children with support of UNICEF in the
reporting year43. The available secondary data (UNICEF’s reports and the Evaluation of HVS 2018) and
41 UNICEF, Bulgaria Update Strategy Note 2020, p.7.
42 UNICEF, RAM 2020, p.8, p. 47
43 UNICEF, RAM 2020, p.5
55
primary data collected through interviews conducted with key stakeholders, shows that the knowledge,
attitude and practices of parents participating in the models developed by UNICEF, especially among the
most remote, marginalized and vulnerable settings, were improved. The evaluation of HVS model, from
2019, showed that the project enhanced the quality of parental care in certain areas, such as: introduction
of solid food, massaging, bathing. It can be safely concluded that UNICEF has made a significant contribution
in bringing up the need for ECD to the attention of all sectors and enhancing the level of understanding and
knowledge regarding the importance of early years in human development and promoting the development
of a more integrated approach to support parents and children in the early years. This has been achieved
by setting successful examples of practices to support early childhood care and the nurturing family and
social environment, especially at the local level.
The pilot interventions in the field of ECD increased access to social, health and education services
for young children from isolated or disadvantaged communities/most vulnerable children,
however, accessibility and quality of services at national level remain points of concern. The Family
Consultative Centres (FCCs), co-created by several municipalities and UNICEF, was designed within the
frame of the previous CPDs. The number of FCCs providing complex services (social, pedagogical,
psychological, medical, etc.) to vulnerable groups is insufficient and they are not available in all
municipalities. In 2020, 2,046 families and 3,055 children from vulnerable and isolated communities
benefited from outreach and preventive services in the Family Consultative Centres (FCCs)44. The
demonstration of Home Visiting Services in two regions of the country, provided 6000 families of children
aged zero to two with individual guidance, information and education for nurturing care45. An evaluation of
the UNICEF supported HVS model was completed and its findings were used to inform the development of
a proposal for scaling up of the service on a national basis. According to the CPD, the model should be scaled
up the end of 2022, but the progress in this regard is currently slow. Despite UNICEF advocacy and technical
support, toward the end of 2019 Ministry of Health finally decided not to pursue the expansion because of
concerns for availability of sustainable government funding after the end of the project.
Therefore, UNICEF Bulgaria CO played an active role and contributed to the following developments at
policy level in the current programming period:
• Preparation of the new Social Services Act enforced in 2020. Through advocacy and technical assistance
in the process of development of all relevant secondary legislation to the Act, UNICEF contributed in the
efforts to lay the basis for expanding family-centred early childhood intervention services for children
with developmental difficulties in the future, as well as sustainable provision of support for parenting
and building caregivers’ skills for nurturing care, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable children
and their families46.
• UNICEF supported the Open Society Foundation, the Roma Education Fund to conduct The study on
Roma Early Years Inclusion (RECI+ studies), which informed the draft national strategy for inclusion and
participation of Roma for the period 2021-203047.
• The case study of the FCCs model and outreach approach and the CO advocacy and piloting activities
that led to updating the national methodology for provision of state-delegated community support
services is included in the “Realising Children’s Rights through Social Policy in ECA: A Compendium of
UNICEF’s Contributions (2014-2020)” as well as UNICEF Child Protection Scaling Up Paper48.
• Selection of Bulgaria as a pilot country for Phase III of the Preparatory Action for the EU Child Guarantee,
which will be tested with support from UNICEF ECARO and respective Country Offices. The pilot project

on the EU Child Guarantee started in August 2020 and a MoUC (Memorandum of Understanding and
Cooperation) was signed between UNICEF Bulgaria CO, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Central Coordination Unit at the Council
of Ministers, and respective district administrations.
UNICEF contribution to the improved inclusive educational and early learning policies and practices,
adapted to needs of the most disadvantaged (Impact under Programme Outcome 2)
UNICEF has contributed to a significant extent to the strengthened capacity of the education system
to address the needs of children with disabilities and special educational needs, but did not generate
visible impact at the level of school enrolment and dropout rates. The analysis provides clear evidence
that UNICEF undertook and supported a large number of initiatives in the field of inclusive education and
the evaluation team is highly confident that these activities have short term results for the directly targeted
institutions and professionals. They contributed to (i) improved competencies and positive attitudes of
teachers and other supported specialists to work with children with disabilities and (ii) increased
institutional capacity to offer better educational service and additional support to children with disabilities.
The second outcome of the CP includes 3 outcome indicators, from which 2 indicators refer to the level of
participation of school-aged children in the educational system and one the other, to the number of available
specialized school and kindergartens staff for children with special needs. Regarding the rate of school age
children out of school and the rate of early leavers from education (addressed first 2 outcome indicators),
the available administrative data show that the situation for Bulgaria has worsened. .
In comparison with the figures from school year 2016/2017, in 2018/2019 school year the
enrolment rate has been lower, thus the target has not been achieved, as showed below:
• In the case of children aged 3 - 6, the enrolment has decreased from 84.8% in 2014/2015 to 80.1%
in 2019/2020 school year, showing an increase with 4,5 percentual points of children out of
school49.
• In the case of children aged 7 – 10, the enrolment rate has decreased form 96.7% in 2014/2015
school year to 88.3% in 2019/2020 school year, meaning an increase with 8.4 percentual points
of children out of school;
• In the case of children aged 11 – 14/13, the enrolment rate has decreased 94,1% in 2014/2015
to 90.1 in 2019/2020, showing an increase with 4 percentual points of children out of school50.
Regarding the second outcome indicator, namely the rate of early leavers from education and training,
the available data show that the numbers has also increased in the period 2015 – 2020, thus the target
has not been achieved. The available data show that in 2015 the rate or early leavers (population aged
between 18 and 24) was 13.4%, whereas, by 2019, the rate increased to 13.9%51. Moreover, as the Situation
Analysis conducted by UNICEF emphasizes, the “about 30 – 35% of 6 grade children are at risk of dropping
out of school”.sector .
The lack of progress made by UNICEF in this concern is caused by two factors: the poor design of the CP
under outcome 2 and the general context from Bulgaria in regards with the more than 5 years long
downward trend in school enrolment rates. Only one output under outcome 2 addresses directly the two
above mentioned outcomes indicators, namely “Support for reducing school dropout”. Based on its design,
49 The available administrative data do not provide disaggregated enrollment numbers or rates for children aged 3-4 and children
aged 6 -7 and the CPD Bulgaria 2018 – 2022 sets the baseline (2015) and target (2022) for outcome indicator: Rate of school-age
children out of school, by sex and education level (52337). As to be able to proper assess the progress made in this case diagregated
data by sex is required. Nevertheless, the CPD does not set up the target for 2022 in this manner.
50 UNICEF, A Situation Analysis, 2020, p. 83

UNICEF initially planned52, on one hand, to improve the EMIS national system which provides data on
attendance and dropout and, on the other, to develop a prevention dropout model for Roma adolescent girls
and children at risk of dropout and to implement it in two regions of Bulgaria. The limited geographical
coverage of the project and fact that its expansion at national level it is not covered in the CPD made the
expected impact regarding the increase of the enrolment rate and the decrease of school dropout difficult
to be achieved. Moreover, while, at national level significant progress has been registered in the area of
inclusive education (policy framework, services provided, available specialized pre-school and school staff),
as we further present, for the last decade Bulgaria has been confronted with a constant decrease of the
enrolment rate of children in education system, the highest decrease being registered at primary school
aged children. Therefore, the targets set for the 2 outcome indicators were not feasible not only due to the
planned outputs, but also in the context of the general situation regarding the enrolment rates of school-
aged children in the educational system.
In regards with the third outcome indicator, the number of available specialized school and
kindergarten staff for children with special needs, which addresses directly the inclusive education
area by measuring the progress made in the available pre-school and school staff for children in
need of support, the available data show that Bulgaria. The target set for year 2022 in the CP of 4500
specialist in the educational system that can adequately work with children with SEN has been
exceeded in 2020 by 420 specialists. Thus, more children with SEN can benefit from adequate
support, tailored to their needs. The progress can be observed not only in the number of specialized
staff from the educational system prepared to provide support for children with disabilities, but also in legal
provisioning, capacity building, securing of funding and creating favourable conditions for expanding the
access of children and adolescents with disabilities and special education needs (SEN) to quality and
inclusive education.
The findings of the impact assessment on the area inclusive education for children with disabilities, which
is presented in Annex 3. Process Tracing – Case studies, feeds into the following analysis.
UNICEF has contributed to the increased institutional capacity of kindergartens to early detect and
effectively intervene in the case of children with special educational needs and thus, provided
increased access to support services for children enrolled in the kindergartens included in the
project. More specifically, the pilot programme implemented by UNICEF led to improved skills and
capacities of teachers and specialists to implement inclusive education practices, increased access to
support services for children from the targeted regions and changed parental attitudes. In 2020, building
upon the previous experience and lessons learned, UNICEF Bulgaria CO in collaboration with the MoES
expanded the piloting of the pre-school inclusive practices to another 30 kindergartens (with over 6,100
children) in 3 new regions (Sliven, Stara Zagora and Burgas) under the framework of the “EU Child
Guarantee” project. The core component of the project was the recruitment and training of specialist staff
(speech therapists, psychologists, resource teachers). The formative evaluation of the inclusive pre-school
model, implemented in 2018, provided clear evidence regarding the effectiveness of the support provided
by UNICEF, including improved institutional capacity of the pilot kindergartens to early detect children with
special education needs and intervene, improved skills and capacities of over 500 teachers and 100
specialists to implement inclusive education practices, and providing access to support services for more
than 5,000 children, and changed parental attitudes. The evaluation report stated that “it is more than likely
that the no-cost practices implemented during the project and the impact of the teacher training will continue
after project completion”53. Further, the evaluation provided recommendations on scaling-up of the model

reporting year.

58
or different components of it. Based on the expansion of the project, other 6,100 children are provided with
access to support services and benefit from a more inclusive school environment. According to the
conducted analysis, the impact remains limited to the area where the pilot and its extension have
been implemented. Nevertheless, the extension of the programme proves commitment from the
government side in this area and shows good prospects for further advancements towards results at scale.
Evidence also shows that UNICEF contributed to a large extent to the strengthened capacities for
application of functional assessment of disability in the education system in Bulgaria. Thus, the
impact of UNICEF work in this area consists in generating an institutional change. UNICEF provided
technical support to the MoES for the introduction of the functional assessment of children and students
with SEN according to the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Human Health.
UNICEF commissioned a renowned international expert to deliver methodological support to MoES and
training of 70 trainers from the regional centers for supporting the process of inclusive education on how
to apply the functional assessment of children and students with SEN according to the WHO International
Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Human Health54. In 2020 the follow-up trainings for scaling
up the functional assessment were included as a dedicated activity within a new MoES project funded under
Operational Programme Science and Education for Smart Growth55. Therefore, the MoES has taken up the
mechanism initiated by UNICEF and currently, is preparing the scaling up of the application of functional
assessment of disability.
UNICEF contribution in terms of human capacity development in the area of promoting inclusive
education has been significant. Due to the work of UNICEF CO, through modelling, advocacy and
technical support provided to the ministry, normative changes were adopted by the MoES regarding
the training of teachers in the area of inclusive education. Within the modelling intervention, UNICEF
supported Karin Dom and the National Association of Resource Teachers to develop and deliver training
focused on building teacher capacity to work with children with disabilities within the mainstream
kindergartens, as well as to build an inclusive environment and to support the learning of children with
SEN. The training program has been accredited to the MoES for general use, by the registration at
the Information Register of Approved Programs for Upgrading Qualification of Pedagogical
Specialists, offering 4 qualification credits. Available reports and the interviews held provide evidence
that UNICEF in partnership with several universities, assisted to development of (i) the general framework
for introducing pre-service teacher training on inclusive education and (ii) introduction of a 15-hour
mandatory module for pre-service teacher training on inclusive education. The output of this collaboration
and assistance was manifested in the amendments in the Regulation of the Professional Qualification of
Teachers.
UNICEF contribution to preventing violence, protecting child victims and ensure access to timely
remedy to child participants in judicial procedures (impact of Programme Outcome 3)
UNICEF made significant contributions regarding the development of the legal framework in the
area of access to justice for children and protection against violence. Nevertheless, the impact of
UNICEF efforts in developing child-friendly practices in this area remains limited due to the scope
of the implemented models.
Even if the reach of UNICEF’s actions and projects in the area of child protection from violence and
prevention is rather low compared to the needs at national level, all evidence collected show that the
efforts made by UNICEF for the improvement of the system of child protection in the area of VaC
have been essential for providing access of child victims of violence or children being at risk to
54 UNICEF, Country Office Annual Report, 2019
55 RAM (2020)
59
integrated service and support and to child-friendly justice. UNICEF is recognized by all interviewed
stakeholders as a key actor in this area in Bulgaria.
The third outcome of UNICEF CPD for the period 2018 – 2022 is operationalized through 4 outcome
indicators. The first outcome indicator refers to the adequate support received by children on the move,
including access to health and education services. According to the data Bulgaria has made progress in
addressing the needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) and ensuring the realisation
of their rights, nevertheless, the indicator has been partially achieved. The ban on detention of UASC
introduced in the law in 2017 and the adoption of the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria (LARB)
Regulations are two important legislative changes, to which UNICEF CO has contributed through technical
support and evidence generating, that led to improvements in the state response to the needs of UASC.
UNICEF supported the provision of social, health and educational services for children on the move, with a
focus on gender-based needs. Nevertheless, there is a need for more coordination among key stakeholders
providing services, such us child protection, judicial or health, to children on the move and also of increasing
the preparedness of specialized staff dealing with UASC (cultural mediators, psychologists, social workers
and other) and the expansion of the coverage of services provided.
UNICEF has contributed to strengthening the strategic and legislative framework in the area of child
protection, by provided technical support for governmental bodies. The evidence show that UNICEF
has contributed to strengthening the national and local policy in the area of prevention of violence against
children and support for children, victims or at risk of being victims of violence, has been of outmost
importance, consisting in:
• through its participation in the establishment of partnerships between central and local authorities,
civil society, media, court and prosecutor's office;
• by changing attitudes towards children in conflict with the law and creating opportunities for
support, integration and positive change for young people;
• by participating in the creation of national and local policies in the protection of children and in
their implementation;
• collection and summarization of statistics and database, analyses, research in this direction;
• by participating in the introduction and provision of the so-called “blue rooms” that allow the
objectives of the investigation to be achieved.
In this regard UNICEF has contributed with technical support and advocacy activities to the development
and adoption of the following strategic and legal documents or amendments: Social Services Act, National
programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020, National Strategy for Promoting
Equality between Women and Men for the period 2021-2030, Amendments of the Law on Asylum and
Refugees, amendments of the Regulations and the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria. The
contributions provided to the development of SSA were focused on improving the way in which social
services are provided, putting more emphasis on the individualized and customized services and support
for children. UNICEF has also contributed to the introduction of an integrated approach facilitating
“multiagency coordination and team work”. The National programme for prevention and protection of
domestic violence for 2020, has been based, among others, on the experience and results of UNICEF
modelling work (e.g., Child Advocacy Centres and Steps together whole school programme)56. The available
documents show evidence of the support provided by UNICEF to the development of the National Strategy
for Promoting Equality between Women and Men for the period 2021-2030. UNICEF has contributed to the
strategy with specialized input that resulted in adding new measures related to strengthening the capacity
for prevention and response to violence and victims support and the proposed indicators to monitor key
56 UNICEF, RAM 2020, p. 24
60
activities57 (priority area IV. Fight with violence, protection and support to victims). The amendments
introduced to the Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria, and developed with the support of UNICEF, sets
up the practice of referral to child protection departments, representation, the possibility of
implementation of police custody, interpretation and legal aid for unaccompanied and separated children
in the national immigration procedures58.
Moreover, UNICEF has also contributed to the improvements observed at policy level, by generating
evidence in support of the changes made in the legislative area. The CO has conducted several studies
and tested models that have generated evidence on current situation of child protection system, including
VAC and GBV and on the effectiveness of different types of integrated services. The data generated on the
effectiveness of the tested models have informed the process of legal reform. In this concern, UNICEF has
contributed to the development of The Analysis of the child protection (CP) system, developed by the
Ministry of Labour and Social Policy with the support of UNICEF CO and The National Study on Violence
Against Children, developed by UNICEF. Further UNICEF has developed the Situation Analysis on children
and women in Bulgaria, 2017, A Situation Analysis of the child rights in Bulgaria, 2020 and the Evaluation
of Child Advocacy Centres, 2020. In respect with data collecting on the impact of COVID 19 on children,
UNICEF conducted the following: Representative survey on needs and vulnerabilities among families and
the impact of COVID-19, High-Frequency Monitoring Survey on the socio-impact of COVID-19 on
households (with WB) An overview of municipal responses to COVID-19 with a focus on social and
economic measures, Legal analysis on the COVID-19 impact on child rights, A nationally representative
research on preferred information channels, communication platforms, influencers and online behaviours
of adolescents and youth in the digital space and Behavioural Insights national research related to COVID-
19.
The second outcome indicator refers to institutionalized, specialized and quality routine training on the
rights of child participants in legal proceedings for police officers, prosecutors, judges and lawyers working
with children in justice processes. In this area there are no formalized trainings for professionals in the
judiciary working with children, thus the indicator has not been achieved. All data available show that the
professionals are not well prepared to work with children; although slight improvements are observed as
regards the extent to which the alternatives to detention and the restorative practices are used, for
observable at-scale results to be produced, there is a need of a legal framework, including on the integration
of mandatory trainings for professional working with children. Nevertheless, a slight decrease in
proceeding launched against children and also in the number of children convicted has been registered.
UNICEF contributed significantly to the improved access to integrated services for children in
contact with the law, in the areas where the CACs model has been implemented. Nevertheless, the
impact of UNICEF’s work in this area is limited due to the fact that the model has not been scaled-up.
UNICEF have initiated the Child Advocacy Centers project as a framework of intersectoral services (crisis
interventions, therapeutic and legal support, medical and forensic expertise) provided in support of
children victims of violence and their families. The collected evidence shows that, in Bulgaria, UNICEF, along
with its partners in the project, ANIMUS and SAPI, are the only providers of this type of services and that
the model has been effective and the scaling up is at most importance for the improvement of services
provided by the government in the area of VaC. Moreover, the evaluation of CAC model implemented in
Bulgaria showed that the intervention “unique in delivery of integrated and specialized services to child
victims of violence and crimes, and their families”59. Each CAC has a Blue Room which police and justice
officials can use to interview children in a child friendly environment with the support of a psychologist
and/or social worker from the CAC. Another important component of the CAC model is that centers provide
child victims and their families with free legal services. The implementation of the model in Bulgaria has

58 UNICEF, Country Office Annual Report, 2018, p. 10
59 Evaluation of Child Advocacy Centres, 2020, p. 4
61
been based on the previous experience of other countries with similar interventions and was developed
taking into consideration the good practices established in Canada and Iceland. The effectiveness of the
model has been assessed first in 2016 and second in 2020 through two evaluation reports. The CACs project
have supported 538 children (female: 318 and male 220) and 413 parents (female: 323, male: 90) with
integrated services related to prevention and response to VaC up to year 202060. The evidence collected
show that the contribution of UNICEF in the coordination, implementation and funding of the model is vital
for its sustainability in the given situation. Nevertheless, the CO did not elaborate a scaling-up strategy in
the design phase of the model, which led to a difficult process. The lack of public funding allocated for this
type of integrated services provided for children, the lack of administrative capacity and specialized human
resources within public providers will lead to a decrease in the access of children victims of violence to
integrated, quality services if the CAC model will be stopped.
UNICEF has contributed to the effective implementation of the inter-institutional, cross-sectoral
cooperation system for case management in the area of VaC, thus child victims of violence or
children being at risk benefit from improved, integrated services. The Situation Analysis conducted by
UNICEF in 2020, shows that in the period of 2013 – 2019, the use of the Coordination Mechanism for cross-
sectoral support provided to child victims of violence or children being at risk has increased with 33
percent61. The analysis provides evidence on the fact that “social services, health, education and civil society
partners are increasingly involved at key stages of the juvenile justice process”62. Nevertheless, there is still
a stringent need in the formalization of the cross-sector collaboration of key actors in area VaC. As data
collected shows, UNICEF has been acting as a communication and cooperation facilitator between
governmental actors, municipalities and service providers, CSOs and universities. This has been
emphasized in its work on CACs model and constitutes an essential contribution of UNICEF in VaC area and
child protection, due to the lack of cross-sectoral coordination and integrated services provide for children
at risk and victims of violence. Moreover, the NGOs that have been interviewed consider that in general
UNICEF has been not only the facilitator in the collaboration among them through their actions and projects,
but also a facilitator in regards to the communication between CSOs and the government, being a very stable
partners and also having a long-term collaboration with ministries, relevant national agencies, but also with
the municipalities where they implement the modeling projects. The perspectives of the interviewees
converge to the idea that the support provided by UNICEF to the CSOs legitimates their actions. Also, the
data collected from interviews also show that UNICEF has been a liaison between administration within the
projects supported by them, such as Child Advocacy Centers.
The third outcome indicator refers to the number of cases of violence against children identified, reported
and addressed. The indicator has not been achieved because the number of signals and cases launched in
the period 2015 – 2019 have decreased significantly. If in 2015, there were 3,741 signals received for
violence against children and 957 cases launched, in 2019, there were only 1,171 signals received and only
446 cases opened. This trend must be analysed in comparison with the number of children victims of
violence, that has increased from 3,566 in 2015 to 4,122 in 201963. Nevertheless, the available
administrative data is inconsistent and the efforts made in the area of monitoring and identifying cases of
VaC or children at risk are not sufficient.
Regarding the fourth outcome indicator, justice system complies with the minimum standards laid down
in the Beijing Rules of Justice, the available data show progress due to the legislative improvements in the
past years, but the target for 2022 of full compliance remains partially achieved.

UNICEF contribution to child rights monitoring, communication and promotion through engagement
of all relevant stakeholders (impact of Programme Outcome 4)
The monitoring system has slightly improved, with the contribution of UNICEF, but there is still a
need to further develop the system as to fill in the information gaps, capture the level of child rights
realization in the case of most vulnerable children and be able to provide solid evidence for policy-
making. Based on the available data and the collected evidence, limited impact has been observed in this
area. Even if there have been registered improvements in the administrative data collected, the evidence
shows that there are gaps in the monitoring system, the available data is fragmented. There are insufficient
efforts done in identifying children at risk of becoming victims of violence or child victims, children with
disabilities or children from Roma communities, this issue being also emphasized through the analysis
developed under the other 3 outcomes of the CPD.
As per CPD 2018 – 2022, the outcome of the area of partnerships for monitoring, communication and the
promotion of child rights is operationalized through 3 indicators. The first outcome indicator refers to the
extent to which state institutions, the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), and network of child
rights civil society groups are monitoring and regularly reporting on child rights violations, based on the
equity principle thus, providing data on most vulnerable children. According to the available information,
this indicator has been partially achieved. UNICEF has fruitfully collaborated with the NSI and the
Ombudsman’s Office in regards with the development of the monitoring system, but the impact
remains limited. According to the available data, the National Statistical Institute has improved its
statistical infrastructure64 and the key indicators for which the NSI is collecting data are in accordance with
EU requirements. Furthermore, according to UNICEF reports, the NSI produce data on children
disaggregated in line with CRC concluding observations, through the Sector management information
system65. The Directorate on Child Rights of the Ombudsman’s Office in Bulgaria is actively involved in
monitoring the realization of child rights. Nevertheless, according to the data collected, its technical and
financial capacity is insufficient as to able to collect data in all relevant areas. The available analysis and
research developed in respect with child right realization emphasize that disaggregated data are not
available, that information is fragmented and also the available database from different public institutions
are not interoperable. The Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020 highlights that “data on the
actual numbers of children involved in labour, children/adolescents subjected to violence, child marriages,
sexual violence, abuse and exploitation are not available”66. Moreover, the analysis shows that in regards
with vulnerable children, public institutions define and monitor in different manners their status. There
still is an important gap in information regarding children from Roma communities and their rights
realization. Therefore, the extent to which the actions developed by UNICEF in this area have
generated impact at the level of children lives could not be assessed, mainly because the progress
made in this area has been limited at national level, despite the efforts made by UNICEF for the
improvement of the monitoring system in Bulgaria.
The second outcome indicator, refers to the number of complains brought to the Ombudsman's Office by
children per year that are followed up/acted upon. The indicator has been partially achieved. The collected
information shows that the number of complaints filed by children has increased, but they still represent a
small part of the total numbers of complains submitted to the Ombudsman’s Office. Moreover, the adverse
64 UNICEF, A Situation Analysis 2020, p. 30
65 UNICEF, RAM outcome and output indicators, 2020, p. 40
66 UNICEF, A Situation Analysis 2020, p. 30
63
political context and movement of anti-child / human rights that emerged in Bulgaria in the past couple of
years led to a decrease in the activity of the Ombudsman’s Office67.
The third outcome indicator monitor directly the effects of UNICEF’s activities, referring to the number of
partnerships engaged in communication and promotion of child rights. Therefore, the progress registered
in this area, as defined in the CPD, is entirely attributable to UNICEF’s efforts and does not reflect a national
dynamic. According to UNICEF’s reports the indicator has been achieved. UNICEF has strengthened its
business partnership strategy and started to engage more actively the business sector in its
activities. In this respect, the CO has developed a partnership with corporate businesses, NGOs, media and
academia for the organization of the first youth-led virtual hackathon on digital solutions for media
literacy68. In 2020, UNICEF raised 1,581,728 (USD 992,301) in 2020, from private sector, 74% of its annual
target69, which were used for most vulnerable children affected by the pandemic context. Even if the
collaboration with the business community has been effective so far, according to the data collected through
interviews, the new approach the long-term engagement with members of the private sector is at an
incipient stage and its successful implementation requires a change in the narrative of UNICEF from the
focus on temporary collaboration mainly for fundraising, to the development of long-term partnerships
build on common values and orientated towards the development of common project UNICEF’s
partnerships with public authorities and municipalities, key SCOs (within the models implemented, e.g.
CACs, FFC, Together from kindergarten, HVS and other) in the fields of child protection, inclusive education,
early childhood development are well established. The data collected through interviews show that UNICEF
acts as a communication and partnership facilitator among duty bearers from different sectors, NGOs and
academia. An important partnership that needs to be mentioned here is the partnership with Ombudsman
of Bulgaria, which is actively involved in monitoring the realization of chid rights in Bulgaria.
Moreover, as collected evidence shows, UNICEF have contributed to raising awareness to the situation
of vulnerable children in Bulgaria. Its C4D activities have reach a high number of people and
engaged various actors in the area, such as: public authorities, CSOs, academia and media, but their
effects could not be clearly identified or observed.
In 2020, UNICEF developed an awareness and fundraising campaign to support non-verbal children ‘A voice
for every child’. The data collected from interviews indicate that the media coverage of the campaign was
higher than 4.5 million people, reached through TV, radio, print and online media and UNICEF channels.
Three corporate partners supported the campaign with advocacy messages and via the employee and
customer networks. The campaign was supported by bTV, the most watched TV network in the country,
and BNT. C4D activities also contributed to the engagement of young people digital activism, through
production of information materials (videos, blogs, podcasts) that reached 2,382,797 people and engaged
40,72070. Additionally, C4D launched U-Report Bulgaria and has reached 1,945,986 people in social media
and has recruited its first ever 650 U-Reporters. UNICEF have developed the “Voice it” youth forum, the first
youth hackathon on digital solutions for media literacy.
According to the data collected from interviews with key stakeholders, UNICEF have also
contributed to ethical reporting on child rights in media and in this way to changing attitudes and

behaviours. From the perspective of the interviewees that participated in the data collection phase, the the
way in which media refers to children in Bulgaria has been improved in the past years. UNICEF developed
a partnership with Association of European Journalists and created a guide book for ethical reporting (used
not only in Bulgaria but in the region). Through UNICEF’s activities 300 journalists were and young people
were engaged in content writing. This led significant improvements in reporting on children in Bulgaria.
Recently UNICEF has been invited by the Council of Electronic Media to draft a set of norms on how should
media work with children. Moreover, the CO also created a Charter for ethical reporting and plans to scale-
up the project in 2021.
3.3.3.2. Conditions and factors influencing the impact of UNICEF’s Country Programme
Based on data collected from documents reviewed and interviews with stakeholders, the evaluation team
identified a set of conditions and factors that have influenced the extent to which the CO work under the CP
2018 – 2022 have generated results at-scale (such as policy changes, institutional changes, including
increased institutional capacity, changes in terms of access services, attitudinal and behavioural changes or
changes in terms of financing for children). The detailed list of identified influencing factors per outcome
can be consulted in Annex 2B. Detailed analysis of the general impact of the CP in Bulgaria.
Further we present a general view of conditions that have facilitated the realizations of the CP’s outcomes
and factors that have negatively affected the progress of the programme.
In terms of enabling factors, the following were identified by this evaluation:
- effective partnerships and cooperation on the regional and local level, fostered by UNICEF through
the efforts put in in all CPD’s areas (e.g. with the regional departments for education, regional
centers for supporting the process of inclusive education, stakeholders involved in Home Visits
model, stakeholders involved in Child Advocacy Centers model) and thus
- commitment of service providers at the local level, due to sustainable local partnerships, in all CPD
areas;
- credibility of the UNICEF brand and strong public recognition enabling greater influence on public
opinion on the importance of early childhood care for development and inclusive education;
- UNICEF’s access to valuable accumulation of knowledge and use of strong international expertise,
in all areas covered by the CPD;
- EU membership, that allowed the introduction of EU Child Guarantee that could be used as a
leverage to ensure progress in the field of ECD and VaC and also led to the adjustment of the data
collected by the National Statistical Institute according to the European requirements;
- commitment and effective partnership with the Ministry of Education and Science, in the area of
inclusive education;
- the commitment of the Ombudsman’s of Bulgaria regarding monitoring and providing data on the
situation of children in Bulgaria;
- the active role of Human Rights International Bodies in assessing the national monitoring system
and providing recommendation for further improvements.
Below we present in a visual manner the summary of mechanisms enabling the contribution of the UNICEF
to improving the situation of children in Bulgaria.

In terms of hindering factors, the analysis highlighted the following external elements that have influenced
in a negative manner the extent to which UNICEF CO generated results at scale for children:
- The political crisis facing Bulgaria, which led to often changes at the level of governmental bodies
and to the need to engage more resources in the partnership development activities;
- The resistance of conservative political groups and, as a consequence, the postponement of the
ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against
women and domestic violence (known as the Istanbul Convention) and low political attention to the
problems of children with disabilities;
- The lack of evidence-driven policy-making culture and practices in the area of education due to very
fragmented responsibilities in monitoring the child rights realization in Bulgaria and lack of
coordination among relevant public sectors;
- The prolonged periods of remote learning in electronic environment due to Covid-19 pandemic
which increases significantly the risks for learning losses and widening educational inequalities,
especially for the children with disabilities;
- Socio-cultural norms of some communities that may deprive children of their right to develop to
their full potential;
66
- The general tolerance regarding domestic violence against women and children, which can be also
observed at the level of judiciary professionals;
- The lack of knowledge and awareness about child rights, not only among the general public but also
on the part of national and local authorities, professionals and the media;
- The underdeveloped culture of youth and adolescents’ participation and engagement in public life
and decision making, as a result of still lasting patriarchal social norms and age-related stereotypes.
3.3.2. Did UNICEF identify and reassess bottlenecks throughout programme implementation?
The CP documents contain specific strategies that are elaborated to address directly the most
critical bottlenecks. The availability of comprehensive assessments of the situations and needs,
surveys and evaluation studies suggest that UNICEF Bulgaria CO has pro-active approach for
identifying risks at different stages of the interventions, and uses different monitoring mechanism
to revisit the risks and to identify appropriate mitigation measures. At the same time, the review of
the Country program documents and CO reports, as well as interviews held with CO staff and other
stakeholders, demonstrated that all of the identified bottlenecks are persistent and sustained
during the entire program cycle. Moreover, some of the bottlenecks have been transformed into
serious threats, jeopardizing UNICEF Bulgaria CO efforts to reach results at scale.
The major bottlenecks included in the Country Programme documents are the following:
- Weak policy enforcement and policy implementation;
- Inadequacies in budgeting and monitoring especially of cross-sectoral programmes;
- Insufficient national resources to scale-up and mainstream the models demonstrated by UNICEF
projects into the services to families with limited access to early childhood services;
- Lack of comprehensive and disaggregated data on children;
- Weak inter-sectoral cooperation;
- Deficient capacities at regional and local levels, such as: the low level of competencies and skills of
human resources at the level various service providers (in the sectors of justice, health, mental
health, psychological support, therapeutical support) dealing with cases in which children are
involved.
Weak child rights culture and discriminatory social norms, attitudes and practices. The Country Programme
documents contain specific strategies that are elaborated to address directly the most critical bottlenecks,
including:
- Putting emphasis on communication for social change (C4SC) to address the behavioural
bottlenecks and empower families and caregivers to adopt positive child care and development
practices;
- Addressing discriminatory public attitudes and the common prejudice against disadvantaged
children;
- Strengthening the capacities and assisting duty bearers to meet their obligations;
- Empowering and supporting right holders to claim their rights and be agents of change;
- Strategic engagement with government and variety of relevant public institutions, NGOs, academia,
business, etc. for supporting policy-making, policy enforcement and implementation for protection
of children rights;
- Provision of evidence-based advocacy, technical assistance and policy advice to support the
formulation, implementation and monitoring of child-related policies.
- Provision of targeted technical support for capacity building at national and local level.
1/ The evidence generated by the evaluation team suggests that the main bottleneck for full realization of
the CP outcomes stems from the fact that their achievement is highly dependent on political will and
contextual factors, over which UNICEF Bulgaria has limited to no control. This requires a CP design and
implementation plan that very thoroughly consider the environment in which the CP will be
67
realized, identify precisely the possible political/contextual risks, elaborate well-targeted
mitigation measures and offer concrete steps to successfully engage with the government. Although
the CPD and the Updated Strategy Note provide an extensive list of concrete risks for realization of each
output, these risks are mainly related to institutional and individual capacities, available resources,
attitudes, etc. However, the program documents rather vaguely consider the potential political risks
and do not offer specific in-depth analysis and mitigation planning. For example, the Updated Strategy
Note identifies the major political risks in very general terms like “the rise of populist, nationalistic and anti-
rights movements”, “increasing anti-rights agenda and deepening populism”, “political instability”, “risk of
populist measures”, and only briefly points that “UNICEF will identify and engage with key government
stakeholders who are supportive of UNICEF interventions, and who can influence other governmental
actors”, or “will strengthen its engagement with the World Bank, the EC Representation, other international
organizations and civil society for evidence generation and policy advocacy”.
2/ Strong propaganda on the part of the growing and well-organized anti child rights /human rights
movement in the country has led to (i) increasing use of hate speech against children rights and (ii)
deterioration in policy reforms supporting children rights. As a result, the implementation of several of the
UNICEF-supported strategies, polices and laws enabling the scale-up of various services that benefit
vulnerable children have come to a halt, thus failing to produce the expected results and impacts during the
programme cycle covered by this evaluation. More specifically, the government put on hold implementation
the National Strategy for the Child (2019-2030); the ECD Strategy; draft law regulating Juvenile Justice. The
enforcement of the Social Services Act has been delayed. Important Family code amendments have been
also delayed. Various social services reforms are either put on hold or progress very slowly.
Despite the detrimental impact of anti-rights propaganda on major legislative and policy changes focused
on children rights and worsening prospects for scaling-up of most of the modelling initiatives due to
increasing reluctance of the government to advance child-related initiatives, the mid-term review and the
updated strategy do not offer in-depth analysis of this major political risk for CP realization, nor clear
prioritization of the issue. The mid-term programming shifts do not directly target concrete mitigation
efforts in this respect. Rather, the Updated Strategy Note refers to the adopted preventive and crisis
communication strategy, and the need of continuing NGO sector capacity building to respond to this
challenge. Some of the stakeholders interviewed shared concerns regarding the UNICEF Bulgaria
preparedness and mandate to take strong pro-active role in opposing the anti-rights propaganda. Having
the fact, that non-governmental sector in Bulgaria remains weak and is still not able to respond
appropriately to the well-organized anti-rights campaigns, UNICEF Bulgaria’s willingness and ability to
effectively counteract on organized attacks of anti-reform and anti-liberal forces is recognized as crucial.
3/ Cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination remain weak in all areas of UNICEF activities. In addition,
the institutional capacity on local level remains largely insufficient. The UNICEF Bulgaria CO approach to
focus on multi-sectoral initiatives, involving different ministries and/or government agencies, to invested
significant efforts for inter-sectoral coordination, to participate in different multi-sectorial working groups
and to partner with local authorities, has been recognized as an appropriate strategy by majority of the
stakeholders interviewed. However, significant challenges remain, especially in collaboration with the
Ministry of Health. For example, in regards with ECI, where the analysis has identified a lack of leadership
regarding the integrated interventions, a challenge has been to facilitate the change of the focus of health
services from children to parents. In this respect, a change at the level of medical approaches needs to be
generated and this is a complex, long-term process. The current practice in ECI also impedes the
development of a cross-sectoral approach.
4/ The allocation of national funds to serve the needs of vulnerable children is not at the desired level in
terms of physical, material, human and financial inputs, and this could be considered a major threat for the
sustainability of the interventions and/or scaling up models piloted during the programme cycle. UNICEF’s
ability to build effective partnerships to successfully deliver services within the concrete modelling
frameworks, along with the provision of technical expertise (including international) to support the local
capacity building, have been recognized by stakeholders as crucial inputs for the implementation of the
68
respective pilots. However, there is no clear strategy applied to engage the government in scaling-up efforts.
In terms of sustainability, the lack of exit strategy embedded in the modelling design has been recognized
as an important bottleneck.
5/ In terms of internal bottlenecks, different areas of the Country Program appear slightly isolated from
each other, involving separate sets of interventions, without common vision and internal links. This is
visible from the respective Theories of Change and has been confirmed during the interviews. As presented
in sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, even if the outcomes and outputs of the CPD are set at a very high level (e.g. some
outcomes are operationalized through impact indicators or several outputs refer to policy and institutional
changes which are considered long-term changes), the planned interventions cannot contribute to the fully
realization of the outcomes. This situation is determined by the fact the CP is less developed when it comes
to the upstream role of UNICEF. The scaling-up strategies or exit strategies regarding the tested models, the
sustainability approach in terms of identifying and leveraging financial sources needed as the generated
changes to remain in place after UNICEF interventions are ended are less developed or missing (as also
mentioned under point 4). As concluded based on the document review phase of the evaluation and
highlighted in several interviews, the most successful actions of UNICEF were the tested models, that have
generated results at-scale for children, but their impact remained limited to the areas and mostly the
beneficiaries targeted by the pilots. In the same vain, comparing the CPDs of Bulgaria and the other
countries covered by this Multi-country evaluation, it appears that Bulgaria’s CPD is closer to the typical
non-EU agenda than to the EU policy framework. According to the data collected from interviews with key
stakeholders, the CP, thus the work of UNICEF in Bulgaria should be more focused on addressing EU policies,
due to the fact that at the national level, child rights are not on the public agenda. The CO initiated this
process of addressing more EU policies, engaging in strategic partnerships with the institutions responsible
for implementing Cohesion Policy in Bulgaria and thus, leveraging EU resources for the improvement of the
situation of children from Bulgaria. Nevertheless, this focus is not explicitly covered by the current.
3.3.3. Did different groups, including children and the most marginalized, benefit in different
ways from the Country Programme?
Data and information collected by the evaluation team demonstrates that UNICEF Bulgaria CP and
its implementation took into account the specific needs of different groups of children. Although
most of the UNICEF Bulgaria CO interventions are designed to provide universal impact for all
children, in practice, to a large extent they target and plan to offer support for the most marginalised
children and achieve results, mainly, for these groups.
More specifically, Bulgaria Country Programme focus strongly on closing equity gaps by targeting the most
disadvantaged and hardest-to-reach children. However, some groups of vulnerable children benefited less
from the work of UNICEF. The table below represents a summary of the vulnerable and marginalised
children beneficiating from the Country Programme and those ‘left behind’.
As the following table shows, the UNICEF work has produced effects at the level of the following groups of
children:
- Children at risk of poverty, including children from Roma communities and other isolated
communities (outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3);
- Children in residential care (outcome1);
- Children with SEN (outcome 2);
- Children with disabilities (outcome 1 and outcome 2);
- Child victims of violence and children being at risk (outcome 3);
- Children in conflict with the law (outcome 3);
- Refugee and migrant children (outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3).
The analysis conducted by the evaluation team led to the following findings:
69
- Members of the same group of marginalized or disadvantaged children benefited in a different
manner from the interventions designed and implement by or UNICEF’s support based on the
targeted regions under the tested models;
- Under outcome 1, children in conflict with the law and homeless children are not specifically
targeted;
- Under outcome 2, school-aged children with SEN did not benefit from the implemented
interventions, the action being addressed only to kindergarten children.
It is important to mention here that the CP does not address homeless children in any way, even if the
number of homeless children is on an upward trend. The national monitoring system in this regard is
ineffective and the real number of homeless children is not available. Nevertheless, according to the SitAn
2021, the anecdotical evidence imply that most affected by this phenomenon are children from poor
communities, including Roma communities, children transitioning from institutionalized care to the
community and child migrants or children on the move71.

3.3.4. Are the results likely to be maintained over time?
Sustainability of many of the CP outcomes is highly dependent of the political will, existing
institutional arrangements and capacities at national and local level. UNICEF Bulgaria CO
successfully collaborates with the government and different ministries, participates in different
inter-institutional cooperation mechanisms and provides valuable technical support and
expertise. However, given the current political instability, strong anti-rights opposition, constant
changes in the policy agenda on children rights, weak cross-sectorial cooperation, fragmented
institutional practices and limited capacities (especially at local level), the prospects for
sustainability of the results are rather unclear.
Even the most successful modelling interventions that clearly demonstrate effectiveness of a service,
face unclear sustainability prospects, as their scaling-up has been put on halt. The pilot project on the
EU Child Guarantee that started in August 2020 and the Memorandum of Understanding and
Cooperation signed between UNICEF Bulgaria CO, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry
of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Central Coordination Unit at the Council of
Ministers, and respective district administrations, provided good opportunity to further expand the
access to home visiting services, early childhood intervention, inclusive pre-school education and
integrated child and family support services for children with disabilities and developmental difficulties
and children in precarious family situations in additional 10 pilot municipalities on the territory of 3
districts – Burgas, Sliven and Stara Zagora. But as a whole, the lack of (i) exit strategy that is embedded
in the modelling design from the very beginning; and (ii) a clear strategy how to engage the government
in scaling-up efforts have been recognized as major shortcomings in terms of ensuring sustainability of
results. In addition, development of the expertise needed at national and local levels to expand out
projects and introduce them in a sustainable manner in the public services system requires serious
efforts aiming at building the national ownership and commitment since the very beginning of the
modeling interventions.
3.3.5. Which strategies or group of strategies were effective in producing results at scale?
The impact assessment and case shows that the CO used a wide range of strategies, as described
in the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018 – 2022 and all of them proved to be effective, especially when
combined.
The change strategies most often used by UNICEF Bulgaria CO are:
1/ Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children. In all 3 impact areas covered
by this evaluation, UNICEF Bulgaria CO used extensively modelling interventions introducing innovative
approaches for Bulgaria as to facilitate the access of vulnerable children to early childhood development
services, inclusive learning environment in kindergartens, comprehensive support services to child
victims and their families, including:
- Home Visiting Services Model
- Together from Kindergarten
- Child Advocacy Centers
- Steps together whole-school programme
2/ Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children, especially by influencing
domestic planning, financing and the delivery of services for children, using, as a rule, three main tools:
- Provision of technical assistance to key institutions (and duty bearers), for example
technical assistance for the development of relevant legislative framework; technical assistance
for functional assessment of disability, etc.
- Consolidating the efforts and strengthening the capacities of implementing partners, for
example to deliver services, provide trainings, etc.
- Enhancing collaboration, promoting cross-sectoral cooperation and increasing synergies
between different stakeholders – public institutions, service providers, local authorities,
NGOs, academia, etc.
74
3/ Using the power of evidence to drive change for children by providing evaluation and research
in policy making, mobilizing the available Bulgarian research expertise, sharing knowledge, advocating
for strengthening national statistics related to children for better evidence-based policy-making.
4/ Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public by
focusing on (i) communication for social change (C4SC) to address the behavioural bottlenecks and
empower families and caregivers to adopt positive child care and development practices; (ii) provision
of training to improve competencies and attitudes (e.g. of teachers/caregivers); as well as (iii)
implementation of variety of public campaigns to win support from the general public.
The case studies conducted using process tracing allow for a limited analysis of the effectiveness of
strategies and combination of strategies used, as presented in the table below.

4. CONCLUSIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING
RECOMMENDATIONS
4.1. CONCLUSIONS
UNICEF Country Programme 2018-2022 has been implemented so far under a series of
challenging circumstances. For the period under investigation (2018-2021), the only major crisis
affecting Bulgaria is related to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the political instability has also created
a context less enabling for reforms. Bulgaria is a middle-income country, with prudent fiscal policy, low
level of public debt (one of the lowest in the EU), and rather low inflation rate. Different from the three
other countries evaluated in the framework of MCPE, since 2007 Bulgaria is a member of the European
Union, and has benefited of substantial financial support under the EU Cohesion Policy for areas of
interest for UNICEF. Although still small as a share of GDP, the public expenses for education and
healthcare have gradually increased in recent years.
The regulatory framework has been significantly reformed in recent years, but there is a rather low
overall level of enforcement. In line with this, low enforcement of children rights has been recognised
by many stakeholders as a serious challenge to the overall regulatory stability in the country. In addition,
the country’s weak administrative capacity as well as an increasing political resistance to promote child
rights in a national context rather dominated by an anti-rights discourse constitute two key obstacles
towards the implementation and effectiveness of child-related policies in Bulgaria.
The comparative advantage of UNICEF is represented by its access to high quality expertise, its key role as
cooperation facilitator among duty bearers and CSOs in the areas targeted by the CPD, its cross-sectoral
approach and its capacity to promote innovative and effective models of intervention.
The access to expertise and well skilled personnel of UNICEF provides the necessary credibility to build
and sustain effective partnership for children rights and well-being with the Government of Bulgaria,
other key public institutions, civil society organisations, other UN agencies and international
organisations, the media and the business sector. All interviewees have acknowledged the CO
contribution in providing effective technical support for developing the legislative framework in all CPD
areas (ECD and child care, inclusive education, protection of children against violence access to justice
for children and strengthening the monitoring system in regards to child rights realization in Bulgaria).
The contribution of UNICEF has been significant in the process of deinstitutionalization and for
providing solutions and models for alternative care and support and also in providing support and
counselling for parents from disadvantaged, vulnerable groups.
The evaluation finds that UNICEF is well-positioned to assume a pivotal role in persuading actors from
different sectors to engage in concerted efforts to produce results for children. Building on this strength,
UNICEF Bulgaria has widened the scope and content of its partnerships when faced with political
resistance to child rights, to ensure the continued promotion of these rights without compromising its
strategic partnerships with the Government of Bulgaria and line ministries at the central and local level.
The approaches to establish alliances have reportedly helped to expand the role of UNICEF as a key actor
and communication and collaboration facilitator among stakeholders and improve its capacity to
intervene. (See Recommendations 2 and 3)
UNICEF’s approach to addressing the needs of the most marginalized children and generating change that
positively influence their lives is well grounded in evidence
The evaluation shows that UNICEF Bulgaria CO has successfully addressed important pressing needs of
children in the country, especially as regards different categories of vulnerable children, and it
supported policy and institutional development for the benefit of these children. The focus of UNICEF
efforts on improving the situation of the most marginalized children through the actions and
77
interventions developed is well documented. Most of the CPD outputs are focused on specific categories
of disadvantaged children (such us: children in residential care; children living in poverty; Roma
children; children with disabilities and/or at risk of developmental difficulties; child victims of violence;
children in conflict with the law, and refugee and migrant children).
UNICEF Bulgaria CO uses an evidence-based approach to plan its intervention, ensuring relevance in
regard to children needs. Several studies have been used to provide updated information on changing
national needs and to inform appropriate adjustments in the strategies used by UNICEF Bulgaria CO. As
a result, the mid-term strategy adjustment strengthened COs focus on closing disparities for the most
disadvantaged and hardest-to-reach children. Nevertheless, the response strategies of UNICEF Bulgaria
CO in regards with ani-rights propaganda become more preventive. The political situation in the area of
child rights has been deteriorating strongly in recent years. The anti-rights narrative gained strong
momentum, impeding key children-related strategic and legislative changes, including adoption of the
UNICEF-supported National Strategy for the Child 2019-2030. In this respect, UNICEF Bulgaria CO
refocussed its strategies to skills development and improving its readiness to work under the worsening
anti-child rights environment, thus, shifting towards a more preventative approach and “positive
messaging on child well-being and good practice of the realization of children’s rights”. Nonetheless, it
is expected that CO uses its comparative advantage to better address public prejudices and to tackle
effectively the strong anti-child propaganda and violation of child rights. (See Recommendation 2)
In addition to aligning the programme with the national priorities, UNICEF Bulgaria CO routinely
engages children and adolescents (and/or their parents) in needs assessments and programming
milestones, approach identified as a good practice by this evaluation.
Further, the impact of UNICEF actions can be observed mainly at the level of these disadvantaged
categories. Nevertheless, as the analysis of the results at-scale of UNICEF CO Bulgaria in the period of
2018 – 2020/2021 indicates, the effects observed or generated go to a limited small extent beyond the
areas where the pilot programmes are being implemented. Most of the modelling interventions
addressing the needs of vulnerable children remain rather small in scale and local in scope. Long term
impact of UNICEF is limited by the unclear strategy to engage the government in scaling-up efforts of
modelling projects (see Recommendation 7). Nevertheless, the modeling work of UNICEF has
supported its evidence-based advocacy actions and facilitated enhanced collaboration with duty bearers
and other implementing partners.
Moreover, the impact is also limited by several general bottlenecks that remain salient and hinder the
results of UNICEF work, especially related to strong propaganda against a human-rights based approach
of public policies, including the policies for children (see Recommendation 2).
In regards with Covid-19 crisis, UNICEF’s flexibility and timely reaction has been largely recognized by the
stakeholders, especially those involved in different piloting interventions locally.
The evaluation found that the CO reacted rapidly to COVID-19 crisis, and adjusted or developed new
activities, within the outcomes of the current CPD, as to be able to support the governmental response
and address the needs of most affected children and parents. In this regard, UNICEF has developed an
extensive set of analyses and research on the impact of the pandemic, further it has included public
health information in its current campaigns and support activities provided to vulnerable families and
children, it has provided learning materials for children, it has provided access to online learning for
pre-school children and it continued the work of CACs online when face to face counselling could not
take place. Therefore, additional programming shifts have been taken with the aim to pro-actively
participate in Covid-19 pandemic recovery and resilience building and strengthening partnership
engagement with business. Timely and flexible reaction to COVID-19, direct support for children and
parents in vulnerable categories, support for on-line education, thorough information and guidance on
keeping safe, and prevention of gender violence have been among the activities of UNCIEF Bulgaria with
most added value in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.
UNICEF generates data periodically on the impact of political, social and economic changes on children’s
situation in Bulgaria and addresses them to some extent, through revisions of its strategies, but mainly,
uses them in evidence-based advocacy activities. In regards with the national monitoring system on child-
rights realization, the evaluation did not identify major improvements.
78
The evidence generated by UNICEF through testing models and conducting or supporting the
development of studies on the situation of different marginalized groups of children in Bulgaria, has
been used to inform the development or improvement of legislative framework in the areas of ECD and
VaC and, thus to fill in the existing gaps in the national monitoring system. The generated data has also
been used in the advocacy activities conducted by UNICEF, including those regarding the scaling-up of
implemented models, but with less results so far.
Even though UNICEF’s work has also been focused on improving the quality and coverage of
administrative data on child rights realization in Bulgaria, there is still room for improvement in this
area. (see Recommendations 1 and 2).
The impact of UNICEF’s work in terms of improvement of legislative framework in the areas addressed by
the CPD has been significant. In terms of improved access for children to high quality, integrated services,
UNICEF’s contribution has been very important, but remained limited to the areas where the modelling
interventions have been implemented.
The contribution of UNICEF in improving the legislative framework regarding child rights realization in
Bulgaria is well documented. The access to expertise and well skilled personnel of UNICEF provides
them the necessary credibility as to able to engage in strong and long-term partnerships with duty
bearers and other implementing partners. UNICEF provided effective technical support for developing
the legislative framework in all CPD areas (Social Service Act (SSA); National programme for prevention
and protection of domestic violence for 2020; National Strategy for promoting equality between women
and men 2021 – 2030; Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria (LARB) Regulations; Amendments of
the Law on Asylum and Refugees.). Nevertheless, the extent to which the legislative framework is
effectively implemented is another important aspect that has to be further assessed. The process is a
long-term one and the changes that should be generated at-scale at the level of children’s lives will be
observable in time (see Recommendation 1).
The evidence collected for the evaluation shows that the modeling components of the CP have been very
effective. The projects implemented have strengthened cooperation between duty bearers, and have
improved the quality of services for children in marginalized areas or children in precarious living
situations, in the areas of social protection, health and education. They have also increased access to
proper educational services for children with special educational needs and have improved the
knowledge, attitudes and practices of parents, especially those from the most remote and marginalized
settings. And they have improved access to justice for children in contact with the law, as well as access
to specialized case-tailored services for child victims of neglect, abuse and violence or for children at
risk.
UNICEF has also contributed to the development of human resource capacity (such as social workers,
teachers and prosecutors) at the level of local public authorities and other public bodies involved in pilot
initiatives. As noted, the impact of UNICEF’s work can be observed mainly among disadvantaged
children, and analysis of the results at-scale of UNICEF CO Bulgaria in the period of 2018 – 2020/2021
indicates that the effects do go (to a limited extent) beyond the geographic areas where the pilot
programmes are implemented.
Nevertheless, there has been less progress on the objective of scaling up these pilots, and their impact
remains limited to the geographic areas where they are implemented. Most of these interventions
remain rather small in scale and local in scope. The data collected indicate that the provision of
integration could not be delivered to the same level of quality or intensity without the support of UNICEF
because of an ongoing lack of institutional capacity, and long-term impact is limited by the unclear
strategy to engage the government in the scaling-up of pilot projects (see Recommendations 3, 5 and
7).
Further than the gaps identified in terms of evidence to support UNICEF contributions to changes at
national level, the evaluation identified a series of inconsistencies in the CP logic of intervention and
gaps in the CP performance framework (see Recommendations 8).
79
UNICEF puts a lot of effort in maintaining and strengthening partnerships with governmental bodies,
public local authorities, service providers and CSOs, this being an essential strategy in the current political
instability in Bulgaria.
To a large extent, UNICEF successfully maintained its partnerships, with public institutions and CSOs,
despite the constant political changes and varied level of openness particularly at central level (among
ministries) and was also successful in building new and effective partnerships trough:
- Active participation in all multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary activities where children have a
stake leading to high visibility among relevant stakeholders.
- Active contribution to the development of surveys, research, policy documents, activities,
campaigns and projects on the right of children
- Joint action with the public bodies.
Under the prevailing unfavourable social-political environment of strong anti-rights social tension,
which resulted in putting on hold several reforming efforts, UNICEF CO managed to maintain the high-
level involvement and provision of adequate and timely technical support to the Government of Bulgaria
during the implementation of the current CP (see Recommendations 2 and 3). UNICEF continued to
deliver results and keep vulnerable children’s issues on the national agenda through continued
collaboration with government partners, business and NGOs, and providing quality data and evidence
for decision making as well as conducting C4BSC activities.
UNICEF provides intensive technical assistance to government authorities through transfer of know-
how, invest in building capacity through training of professional staff, introducing new methodologies,
tools and approaches, in developing strategic documents, conducting evidence-based advocacy as to
improve the quality and coverage of public services and brings innovation in the fields it operates.
Though, faced with obstacles due to political resistance on culturally sensitive areas, the partnership
with the government, especially at the technical level, has been constructive and positive, in general.
UNICEF Bulgaria CO works with the government and EU institutions to transpose the European policies
and principles of the European Social Charter, perceived as the Social Constitution of Europe. It
represents an essential component of the continent’s human rights architecture, with reference to civil
and political rights, and a broad range of everyday human rights related to employment, housing, health,
education, social protection and welfare, into national policies.
UNICEF has integrated equity and gender equality in the CP in an uneven manner. Gender priorities are
insufficiently clear and there are various levels of gender responsiveness and gender mainstreaming in
UNICEF activities, while the equity focus very clear in both, the CP design and its implementation.
The evaluation found that the overall programming approach demonstrates gender sensitivity, with two
gender-related interventions: (1) prevention of child marriages in some of the most vulnerable Roma
communities and activities to empower the girls at risk; (2) interventions on violence against children.
In addition, gender responsiveness and gender mainstreaming are incorporated into the
implementation of other CP components (such as the HVS, parenting support programmes and the
capacity building of frontline workers on ECD). However, UNICEF’s gender priorities are insufficiently
clear and most stakeholders do not distinguish the gender equality aspect of its work. One serious
limitation is the lack of disaggregated data by gender in all cases; there are few gender-sensitive
indicators within UNICEF’s monitoring system (see Recommendation 6).
Most effective strategies UNICEF that enables the success of the interventions developed by UNICEF
The strategies used by UNCIEF Bulgaria and identified as most successful by this evaluation are:
- Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children, through modelling
services and approaches - in all 3 impact areas covered by this evaluation, UNICEF Bulgaria CO
used extensively modelling interventions introducing innovative approaches to facilitate the
access of vulnerable children to early childhood development services, inclusive learning
environment in kindergartens, comprehensive support services to child victims and their
families;
- Using the power of evidence to drive change for children, especially by influencing domestic
planning, financing and the delivery of services for children;
80
- Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children, especially by
influencing domestic planning, financing and the delivery of services for children;
- Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public,
public by focusing on (i) communication for social change (C4SC) to address the behavioural
bottlenecks and empower families and caregivers to adopt positive child care and development
practices; (ii) provision of training to improve competencies and attitudes (e.g. of
teachers/caregivers); as well as (iii) implementation of variety of public campaigns to win
support from the general public.
It is important to mention that, the analysis has highlighted a set of enabling factors for the impact of
UNICEF in Bulgaria, the following were identified by the evaluation:
- effective partnerships and cooperation on the regional and local level, fostered by UNICEF
through the efforts put in in all CPD’s areas (e.g. with the regional departments for education,
regional centers for supporting the process of inclusive education, stakeholders involved in
Home Visits model, stakeholders and social services providers involved in Child Advocacy
Centers model) and thus
- commitment of service providers at the local level, due to sustainable local partnerships, in all
CPD areas;
- credibility of the UNICEF brand and strong public recognition enabling greater influence on
public opinion on the importance of early childhood care for development and inclusive
education;
- UNICEF’s access to valuable accumulation of technical knowledge and use of strong
international expertise, in all areas covered by the CPD;
- EU membership, that allowed the introduction of EU Child Guarantee that could be used as a
leverage to ensure progress in the field of ECD and VaC and also led to the adjustment of the data
collected by the National Statistical Institute according to the European requirements;
- commitment and effective partnership with the Ministry of Education and Science, in the area of
inclusive education;
- the commitment of the Ombudsman’s of Bulgaria regarding monitoring and providing data on
the situation of children in Bulgaria;
- the active role of Human Rights International Bodies in assessing the national monitoring
system and providing recommendation for further improvements.
4.2. LESSONS LEARNED
The progress achieved so far by the CO regarding the CP 2018 – 2022 highlighted a set of lessons learned.
The political instability in Bulgaria, unfavourable economic context and the growing wave of anti-human
rights groups , led to the need of several changes in the strategy of the CO.
UNICEF has adjusted its strategies to continue its work, despite the negative public discourse and civil
movements that affect the realization of human and child rights in Bulgaria. As a result, the CO learned
that there should be a balance between the extent to which its shifts its strategy to address the needs of
most vulnerable children and the expected results. UNICEF have used several entry-points to promote
the realization of child rights, being cautious in the face of negative perspectives, disseminated by
Bulgaria’s media, on social protection, on the rights of children from Roma communities, and the legal
framework for ECD. As a lesson learned, UNICEF has understood that a more proactive approach is
needed to advance its work. It has, for example, tried to find sources of funding through which to target
the Roma population directly and has, therefore, managed to advance its work through the European
Union Child Guarantee.
Perhaps the most important lesson learned by UNICEF CO is that the need for more efforts on in the
scale-up of models. Without the development of a scaling-up strategy, agreed with all duty bearers in
the early stages of the project, the prospects of public institutions taking up the intervention remain
unclear, mainly due to a lack of public financial resources. Experience has revealed the challenges to the
pilot model used by UNICEF, and the CO needs to address sustainability from the outset.
81
As a result of the first three years of the CP implementation, the CO has realized that it should do more
to build upon the status of Bulgaria as a EU Member State and align more closely with EU priorities, to
position itself as a strategic partner for the government in using EU funds to improve the situation of
children in Bulgaria. UNICEF has worked to support the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee in
Bulgaria, and to leverage the available funds to improve access for the most disadvantaged and
marginalized children to quality, integrated services.
Another lesson learned relates to the strategy adopted by the UNICEF CO when developing partnership
with the business sector. Experience has shown that UNICEF’s usual approach to the fundraising
component of the CP does not achieve the same impact when engaging with the private sector. In
addition, the CO aims to create partnerships beyond fundraising and to engage the business community
in a more strategic way, with interventions developed together and resources leverages on a more
sustainable basis. There is, therefore, a need for a more structured and focused strategy on the
development of partnerships with the business sector.
UNICEF has reacted in a timely and effective way to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, with support
to the government to contain the impact on children’s lives. UNICEF provided support that
complemented the work of the government, as seen in pre-school education, where UNICEF has
provided technical and IT support for children and teachers to help them continue the educational
process. Nevertheless, as the CO observed, there is still a pressing need to improve the quality and
coverage of data on the effects of the crisis on the most disadvantaged children. The inconsistency of the
national monitoring system on child rights has influenced the capacity of public institutions and UNICEF
to addresses the specific needs of the most marginalized children in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. Therefore, the improvement of the monitoring system remains a priority for the
development of well-grounded and effective policies.
4.3. RECOMMENDATIONS
In contrast to the conclusions, the recommendations of this evaluation are not organized according to
OECD DAC criteria, rather they apply to the overall strategy, thematic focus and balance of the
programme. The aim is to propose an appropriate continuation and development based on the
partnerships, teamwork and results of the 2018–2022 Country Programme – taking into account the
challenges encountered.
The evaluation team formulated eight recommendations based on the findings and conclusions of the
evaluation report. These cover four main areas of action: policy advocacy (from a sustainability
perspective); partnership building and cross-sectoral cooperation; programming; and monitoring.
The team has developed a set of indicative measures (institutional, programmatic and operational), that
can be used by the CO to guide the effective implementation of these recommendations, which are
presented in the main report.
The evaluation team suggests to retain the two levels (programmatic and operational) as presented
below: a) recommendations at programmatic level aim at laying the grounds for the development of the
program (establishing consistency with UNICEF’s institutional mandate, global policies and regional
programs, SDGs, of UNICEF, the intervention strategies, working principles, and treatment of horizontal
themes that cut across the program components, complementarity with similar ongoing endeavors as a
whole; b) recommendations at the operational level aim at formulating the actions/projects/activities.
Such differentiation may facilitate monitoring the outputs and outcomes both for the activities and for
the programme.
Policy advocacy
Recommendation 1. Continue to conduct advocacy activities and provide technical assistance to
improve the legal framework, support the development of law enforcement documents and
continue to follow-up on their implementation.
Institutional level:
82
- Prepare an institutional strategy and action plan to conduct advocacy activities, building on the
positive reputation of UNICEF as a reliable resource with international know-how, while
demonstrating a strong willingness to engage with duty bearers in the development of the law
enforcement documents in every possible opportunity.
Programmatic level:
- Focus more efforts on providing technical assistance (to introduce the national stakeholders with
international experience and know-how) to governmental bodies in developing law enforcement
documents (action plants, implementing methodologies, administrative regulations issued by
responsible public bodies, road maps and budgets) and monitoring their implementation through
the following type of analysis: data situation assessment, financial analysis for scaling up, gap
analysis to assess the human, material and financial resource needs for the implementing agencies.
Operational level:
- Plan follow-up and revisiting activities to assess the long term impact of the previous
interventions and draw lessons learned for future programming, as well as to track the effects of
legislative changes (like in the case of the technical support provided to the Ministry of Interior for
the development of the Automated Informational System for the Prevention of Child Crime and
Protection of Children, where there is no available information on the progress regarding the
population of the data base and on its utilization).
- Follow-up and document the implementation of the action plans, advocacy activities (events,
meetings with decision and policy makers and partners, the implementation of communication
campaigns) in connection with policy decisions, declarations on policies or institutional changes
that could allow for a better understanding of how policy change is happening.
Partnership building and inter-sectoral cooperation
Recommendation 2. Continue to strengthen partnerships with both the government and key
stakeholders in the country and develop partnerships with other international organizations
and other UN agencies in a more strategic way.
Institutional level:
- Based on already existing partnerships, create a country-wide coalition/alliance involving all
stakeholders supporting children’s rights enforcement, aiming also to mitigate the negative effects
of anti-rights movements in the country.
Programmatic level:
- Continue to engage with government and key stakeholders (including the local level
represented by the local governments, LPAs and the National Association of Municipalities) in the
design, implementation and monitoring of UNICEF activities to build ownership from the onset and
ensure sustainability of the planned results (see recommendation 7).
- Continue the current practice of signing Memoranda of Understanding with all key stakeholders
(governmental institutions and other members of the UN family - UNHCR, IOM, WB and IMF, other
public, private and civil entities), including a clear definition of responsibilities in all stages of the
process, as well as follow up activities put in place to ensure sustainability. UNICEF ECARO support
in the development of the content of MoUs can be useful.
- Strengthen the strategic partnership with the national responsible bodies for planning and
implementing EU Cohesion Policy in Bulgaria and participate as an observer in the Thematic
Working Groups and in the Monitoring Committees of the operational programmes, in order to
mobilize resources and create synergy as regards measures needed to realize child rights.
83
- Build long-term partnerships with the private sector with a focus on building on the corporate
responsibilities in terms of business practices in employment, production of goods and services,
local community development, environmental protection, technology and innovation.
Operational level:
-Enhance and enrich the means of cooperation with the CSOs, media, and the business circles
through technical assistance for capacity development (monitoring CRC at unit/enterprise and
national level, exchanging good practices, promotion of international best practices) partnerships
for the implementation of projects/activities within the framework of UNICEF programme,
campaigns, joint initiatives, introduction of micro-grant schemes, incentives in the form of contests,
awards, prices etc.
- Conduct social-political-cultural analyses to develop strategies to mitigate the negative effects of
anti-rights movement as an obstacle for the realization of child rights and enforcement of relevant
laws and legislations.
Recommendation 3. Continue to support and facilitate the development of cross-sectoral
cooperation at all levels and all areas addressed by the CPD.
Institutional level:
- Develop a horizontal strategy setting up specific objectives according to which UNICEF CO will
strengthen inter-sectoral cooperation among key stakeholders in the areas included in the CPD,
in order to become more effective further than the implemented models/pilots.
Programmatic level:
- Conduct a thorough stakeholder analysis starting with the programming stage and update it
throughout the implementation.
- Map of the existing institutional structure of cooperation relevant to the wellbeing of children
and provide technical assistance, through skills building and hands-on assistance to institutions
responsible of coordination to strengthen their leadership skills for effective management of
concerted actions by all entities.
- Continue to facilitate and encourage partnerships in a manner to ensure or contribute to
inter-sectoral coordination, as in the case of CACs model that ensured communication and
collaboration between service providers in different sectors: social protection, health, mental
health, and judiciary.
Operational level:
- Capitalize on successful cases in order to explain and promote the benefits of cross-sectoral
cooperation to ensure a holistic approach focusing on the needs of the child and promotion and
realization of child rights.
- Make use of available evidence or generate evidence as to demonstrate how partnerships and
inter-sectoral cooperation facilitated the improvement in the health, development, education,
protection and participation of children.
- Make sure that the efforts and contributions of all partners are duly acknowledged throughout the
process.
Programming
Recommendation 4. Prioritize specific objectives under each area of the CPD to focus more
resources on one single aim and to develop more coherent strategies for actions (this
recommendation should be considered together with recommendation 5).
Programmatic level:
84
- Based on the Situation Analysis develop a detailed problem analysis (including an assessment of
structural conditions such as institutional, human and financial capacities and resources) for each
CPD area.
- Articulate types of interventions, necessary inputs, risks and expected and plausible effects in
regards with each specific problem identified at programme area level.
- Prioritize a smaller number of problems per area where the resources and efforts of UNICEF
CO should be focused as to be able to maximize the effects, taking into account the following two
focuses:
a) on the actions conducted in the previous CP that led to the achievement of significant results
and observable impact and where follow-up measures are needed as to ensure that the
generated effects will remain in place (such us: legislative changes that need to be further
implemented or effective models that need to be scaled-up),
b) on specific negative situations for each CP area where UNICEF can have the biggest
contribution and where there is the highest potential of achieving impact at-scale.
- Identify the structural conditions that contribute to the problem and design the intervention as to
be able to address as much as possible of them.
Recommendation 5. For results-at-scale, plan comprehensive activities that combine advocacy
activities, technical assistance for improved financing/budgeting and support for capacity
building (training, leadership development, procedures, and development of IT capacity)
Programmatic level:
More efforts should be directed towards the following aspects, that should be combined when
designing a set of interventions in a certain area:
- plan human capacity building activities that aim to have a broader coverage (see recommendation
7);
- facilitate leverage of resources by identifying national and international programme that can
support specific types of actions (such as the EU Guarantee) for each problem addressed within each
CPD area (see recommendation 2);
- facilitate the development of cross-sectoral partnerships (see recommendation 3)
Recommendation 6. Integrate equity and gender equality into all CP outcomes (where relevant).
Institutional level:
- Prepare an institutional strategy for promoting equity and gender equality, in order to clearly
identify gender-specific needs (if the case) and necessary activities to obtain positive results from
an equity and a gender transformative perspective.
Programmatic level:
- Identify gender-based needs when planning the actions included in each outcome of the CPD.
- Address gender-based needs under each output, if relevant.
- Explicitly address the needs of most vulnerable groups when planning the actions included in each
outcome and output and design the indicators framework in accordance.
- Set gender sensitive output and outcome indicators and monitor results of UNICEF’s actions
disaggregated by gender, where relevant (see Recommendation 8).
Recommendation 7. Embed sustainability into the design of pilot interventions, including follow-
up plans, handover and exit strategies, and arrangements for scaling-up.
Institutional level:
85
- Prepare an institutional strategy for scaling up innovative models piloted by UNICEF CO,
including key stakeholders, actions to be undertaken and resources needed.
Programmatic level
- As much as possible, plan the models/pilot interventions (introduction of a new service, promoting
a new approach/methods/practices) in a manner to build on the existing strengths and
tendencies in the field to avoid resistance by professionals.
- Based on already existing experiences and good practices (legislation, capacity building etc.),
identify actions to be taken to ensure transfer of responsibilities regarding models during their
implementation.
- Develop concrete action plans together with duty bearers and sign MoUs for steps to be taken by
the stakeholders after the project implementation is over, including a costing plan as well as
mobilization of national and international resources as official part of the Country Programme of
Cooperation between the government and UNICEF.
- Establish the links between the project outputs and outcomes and the mutual
responsibilities towards the implementation of CRC and achieving the SDGs and plan joint
monitoring and evaluation activities to sustain the achievements and to follow up with progress in
the form of long-term impacts.
- Initiate the discussions for leveraging resources by identifying available national resources and
national and international funding opportunities (such as the EU Guarantee, WB etc.) that can
support specific types of actions (including the costing for sustainability and scaling up and continue
facilitating these discussions throughout the implementation).
- Plan human capacity building activities that aim to have a broader coverage (develop training
programmes that can be cascaded through ToC, including the training content in the national
curricula for pre- and in-service training by building on the experience gained as in the case of the
training programme focused on building teacher capacity to work with children with disabilities
within the mainstream kindergarten).
Operational level:
- Promote and encourage joint management for projects/models developed or supported by
UNICEF to facilitate a gradual transfer of responsibilities and to support ownership during
implementation, as opposed to end of project efforts.
- Organize regular meetings with project stakeholder to review and revise the sustainability
plans and introduce improvements, as necessary.
Monitoring
Recommendation 8. Define the indicator framework of the CPD and the monitoring process to
better record the actions and the results of the UNICEF CO.
Institutional level
- Introduce new internal monitoring tools/procedures (as per UNICEF Results-Based
Management Handbook) to clearly trace the change pathways from UNICEF activities to results for
children.
- Document strategies used to address each outcome/output of the programme, to improve the
registration of institutional memory so that achievements can be duly reflected in the regular
reports.
-Make sure that the monitoring reporting system allows reflections about the synergies
between the interventions/activities in different areas/fields in a manner to draw lessons for
future programming while providing information on areas where advocacy activities are most
needed.
86
- Develop a risk mitigation plan in response to cases where the set indicators targets are not
achieved, as well as to mitigate possible social-political-cultural risks that may jeopardize
sustainability.
Programmatic level
- Make sure that the baseline data is available at the programming stage or an activity to set a
baseline is planned for implementation stage.
- Make sure that the indicator sets are sufficient to reflect the differences between the outputs and
the outcomes produced in a manner to inform the impacts.
- To the extent possible, and in collaboration with the stakeholders, identify indicators that are
routinely collected within the national and/or institutional data sets to allow comparisons.
- Where possible and relevant, build on the indicators of previous interventions or identify
indicators to follow up the achievements in the previous cycles to better assess long-term impact.
- Check for overlaps/repetition/links between the indicators for different outputs and outcomes.
- Make sure that the monitoring framework includes qualitative as well as quantitative indicators to
assess changes in behaviors and practices leading to improvements in their lives of target groups,
local communities as well as in service provision.
- Make sure that data collected and reported is in line with the indicator’s label definition.
Operational level
- Periodically assess the level of indicators’ achievement to identifies those at risk, through internal
and external monitoring and evaluation activities.
- Review and revise the indicators, as needed, during the implementation.

Annex 2.A. Summary analysis of UNICEF Bulgaria impact
The table below is mainly based on the reports of UNICEF Bulgaria CO.72
Note on the assessment of UNICEF impact based on the outcome and output indicators in the Country Programme Document:
Although most of the indicators analysed are – according to UNICEF denomination – output indicators, they are not only measuring direct results of each activity conducted by UNICEF. They also potentially show
short term changes with direct relevance for children at scale, either referring to the situation of children, changes in public perception, attitude or behaviour or systemic changes that enable institutions to fulfil better
their role in providing services for children and protecting their rights.
Indicators in the table are marked on their relevance for the assessment of impact. And when impact can be measured, the type of impact is identified as: (1) better access to services/direct improvement of the situation
of children, (2) behavioural and attitudes change; (3) institutional change (including institutional capacity increased); (4) change in policy (including strategies, plans, laws, legislation of other nature/level); (5)
improvement of financing for children
Strategies identified in the table are a simplified presentation of UNICEF Strategies as in the schema below.

Annex 2.B. Detailed analysis of general impact of the CP in Bulgaria
Positive changes regarding early childhood development and child care (impact of Programme Outcome
1)
The first outcome of the CPD 2018 – 2022 – Early Childhood Education and Child Care is operationalized
through 2 outcome indicators. According to the existing administrative data at national level, the first
outcome which addresses the advancement of the deinstitutionalization process has been fully achieved
in Bulgaria and the target set by UNICEF for 2022, has been already surpassing. For the second indicator,
which refers to the increase of the proportion of disadvantaged families with children between 0 and 2
years old that receive support and counselling for ECD, there are no available comparative data that can
show the improvements achieved by 2021 at national level. Nevertheless, the results of UNICEF’s work
in this concern show that a significant number of families have been provided with ECD support and
counselling, as it will be further presented.
According to the collected evidence, the following significant achievements in the ECD and child care
have been made:
• Despite the unfavourable political climate due to which the ECD strategy has been put on hold,
Bulgaria has adopted in 2020, the Social Services Act that leads to important improvement in
the legislative framework of social service. The new act lays the ground for a more cross-sectoral
coordinated system of social services, increases the focus on child rights realization and
provides the framework for family and community-based serviced in the ECD area.
• In the area of child care and more specifically in line with the National Strategy “Vision for
Deinstitutionalization of children in Bulgaria 2015 – 2025, Bulgaria has made an important
progress, overreaching its objectives. The number of institutionalized children has dropped
significantly, the number of specialized institutions decreased and the development of
alternative care services has been in parallel improved.
National strategic and policy improvements in the ECD and area child care
The contribution of UNICEF Bulgaria to the implementation of national and local policies supporting
nurturing family and social environment during the programme cycle 2018-2022 did not fully realize as
planned. The assumption that there was maintained a continued cooperation and development of
mechanisms of cross-sector coordination, especially at local level did not hold true, and did not lead to
a decision to scale up the pilot projects. Furthermore, the foreseen risks increasing political risk due to
strong anti-child right and anti-women rights social tension, resulting in putting on hold of the main
child-related policies were realized. Thus, despite efforts, the ECD strategy could not be developed.
Nevertheless, the new Social Services Act, for which UNICEF has also provided support and which came
into force in July 2020, represents a certain improvement of the national legislative framework on social
protection and thus child protection. The act provides the legal framework for individualized and
customized support and services and moreover, it brings new quality standards for social
services. As emphasized in the Situation of Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020, the new legislation
supports the expansion of community-based services in the ECD area and more specifically of ECI
services. Further, as a consequence of the adaptation of the SSA, an Agency for the Quality of Social
Services has been established.
Progress made in the child care sector and deinstitutionalization
A brief review of the legal and institutional framework pertaining to early childhood in Bulgaria during
the beginning of the programming cycle and as the approaching and end to the current CPD and in the
process of developing the new CPD reveals that UNICEF has made clear contribution to the
deinstitutionalization process in Bulgaria within the framework of the previous CPD as evidenced by
110
the international acknowledgment for UNICEF Bulgaria in this programme cycle. UNICEF is reported to
have made significant contribution in ensuring the rights of all children to live in a family environment,
as assessed by the progress against the outcome indicator: number of children (disaggregated by
gender, age, disability, refugee and migrant children) entering formal care every year. In the last
10 years, the number of children living in specialized residential institutions decreased significantly
from 7,587 in 2010 to 476 in December 201973. The evidence collected show that number of
institutionalized under-3 children has decreased the most, from children 556 in 2015 to 284 children in
2019. However, it is important to mention that there has been observed an increase in the proportion
of children with disabilities placed in Family Type Placement Centres (FTPC)74. Bulgaria has also made
in regards with the number of specialized institutions, form 137 in 2010 to 20 institutions by the end of
2019 year75. Moreover, the administrative data show that there has been an increase of family-based
alternative care, the number of foster families has increased with 10 times since 2009. The number of
community-based services for children and families has increased significantly, from 241 in 2010 to 630
in 2019. In this way, Bulgaria has made significant progress in changing the approach in child care
sector from residential care to family-based and community-based approaches.
Current situation regarding the ECD services and support provided to families through the national
system in Bulgaria
In the area of ECD there is still a significant need in cross-sectoral coordination and provision of integrated
services for families and children in need. The services provided by the national system in the area of
ECD are mainly delivered through the health system and lack focus on promoting holistic child
development and parenting. As the Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020 emphasizes
“accessibility and quality of services remain points of concern”. The health services provided free of charge
for insured pregnant women are insufficient (they include only one antenatal examination and delivery
care) and the access to these services is very limited for women in rural areas76. Moreover, the number of
insured pregnant women has decreased with 2 percentual points from 2014 to 2019. Thus, it is important
to emphasize that Bulgaria has made significant progress in reducing infant and child mortality rate from
9.4 per 1,000 live births in 2010, to 5.6 per 1,000 live births in 201977. Nevertheless, these figures need to
be contextualized, as the number of births is also on an downwards trend. Within the ECD area in Bulgaria
there is not enough support provided to parents with children under 3 years old to build their capacities
to promote the the optimal social, emotional and cognitive support of their children. Early detection of
developmental difficulties is still an area where Bulgaria has not made sufficient progress. The collected
data show that inter-sectoral mechanisms are underdeveloped and professionals are not properly trained.
Further, specialized services for children that are identified as being at risk are insufficient and parents
that have children under 3 years old with disabilities, but not only, lack in access to adequate support.
Therefore, at national level, the access to integrated ECD services, ECI and counselling of parents has
not increased. Nevertheless, the available data on the results on UNICEF’s extensive work on the
development of Programmes and activities for the provision of families / caregivers with counselling and
support for promoting ECD, show an improvement in access to these type of services for most
disadvantaged groups in the areas where the interventions have been implemented. In this respect,
UNICEF CO Bulgaria have fully achieved its targets set for 2020. The available documents show that
in the period 2018 – 2020 more than 13,900 parents of children under 5 years of age benefited from
different parenting support and C4D modalities, including home visiting, community-based parenting
support programs, as well as remote counselling and digital platforms78. Moreover, the provided support
has also been adjusted to the specific needs of those most affected by the COVID 19 pandemic, such as

public health information and support. It is important to mention that there is a need for more focus on
scaling up the results and thus, generating impact at the level of the national system of services provided
in the ECD area.
The second CPD 2018 – 2022 outcome - Inclusive education and early learning is operationalized
through 3 indicators. The first two indicators address the level of school enrollment and the prevention
of school dropout. In the case of both indicators, the rate of school age children out of school and the
rate of early leavers form education, the available administrative data show that the situation form
Bulgaria has worsen.
Regarding the first outcome indicator, in comparison with the figures from school year 2016/2017, in
2018/2019 school year the enrolment rate has been lower, thus the target has not been achieved, as
showed below:
• In the case of children aged 3 - 6, the enrollment has decreased from 84.8% in 2014/2015 to
80.1% in 2019/2020 school year, showing an increase with 4,5 percentual points of
children out of school79.
• In the case of children aged 7 – 10, the enrollment rate has decreased form 96.7% in 2014/2015
school year to 88.3% in 2019/2020 school year, meaning an increase with 8.4 percentual
points of children out of school;
• In the case of children aged 11 – 14/13, the enrollment rate has decreased 94,1% in
2014/2015 to 90.1 in 2019/2020, showing an increase with 4 percentual points of children
out of school80.
Regarding the second outcome indicator, namely the rate of early leavers from education and training,
the available data show that the numbers has also increased in the period 2015 – 2020, thus the
target has not been achieved. The available data show that in 2015 the rate or early leavers (population
aged between 18 and 24) was 13.4%, whereas, by 2019, the rate increased to 13.9%81. Moreover, as the
Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF emphasizes, the “about 30 – 35% of 6 grade children are at risk
of dropping out of school”. Therefore, despite the improvements that Bulgaria have made in the area of
inclusive education, as will be further presented, the overall situation regarding the coverage of
educational public services has worsen in the past at least 5 years. The efforts made by UNICEF have to
viewed in the light of the context of the overall educational system in Bulgaria and with the same level
of importance, in the light of the effects that the pandemic context had and continues to have on the
education section and more specifically on the access of school aged children to education.
In regards with the third outcome indicator, which addresses directly the inclusive education area by
measuring the progress made in the available pre-school and school staff for children in need of support,
the available data show that Bulgaria has made a substantial progress and the target has been fully
achieved. The progress cand be observed not only in the number of specialists prepared to provide
support for children with disabilities, but also in legal provisioning, capacity building, securing of
funding and creating favorable conditions for expanding the access of children and adolescents with
disabilities and special education needs (SEN) to quality and inclusive education.
Progress made in national legislative framework in the area of inclusive education
Bulgaria made an important shift from the traditional educational model to a new model
providing for (i) integration in mainstream education of all children and young people, including
those with special needs and CwD; (ii) enabling learning environment and (iii) individual
support according to individual characteristics of each child or student, introduced with the Pre-
79 The available administrative data do not provide disaggregated enrollment numbers or rates for children aged 3-4 and
children aged 6 -7 and the CPD Bulgaria 2018 – 2022 sets the baseline (2015) and target (2022) for outcome indicator: Rate
of school-age children out of school, by sex and education level (52337). As to be able to proper assess the progress made in this
case diagregated data by sex is required. Nevertheless, the CPD does not set up the target for 2022 in this manner.

School and School Education Act in 2016. A new IE education regulatory framework has been
developed between 2016 and 2021 to support the transition, including a package of regulatory
provisions establishing the state educational standard for inclusive education, stipulating for the
provisioning of both general and additional support for the personal development of students;
introducing requirements for specialized teacher trainings for provision of support to visually and
hearing impaired children and students; introducing an obligation for the parents to provide
information about the health condition of their child; defining the staffing rules for the number of
teachers and other pedagogical specialists in the centers for special educational support; regulating the
status and functions of the resource teachers in the kindergartens, schools or support centers for
personal development and the teacher of children with mental retardation in the centers for special
educational support; defining the standards for the physical environment necessary for education of
children with SEN and CwD, etc. In this regard UNICEF supported the Ministry of MoES in developing
the general framework for introducing pre-service teacher training on inclusive education and
introduction of a 15-hour mandatory module for pre-service teacher training on inclusive education.
Progress made regarding the available support services for children with disabilities
The capacity of the system to provide support serviced to children with disabilities is gradually
improving, but still remains insufficient. The number of professionals (such as speech therapists,
educational mediators, psychologists, social workers and resource teachers) supporting students with
SEN increased by 60% within a year- to 4920 (5,3 per 1000 students) in 2018/2019 school year
compared to 3070 (3,2 per 1000 students) the previous year82.
Initial progress has been achieved in strengthening teacher capacity to work with CwD. A mandatory
Basic Inclusive Education course has been introduced in pre-service university training of all teachers.
In 2019, with the support of UNICEF, 70 trainers from the regional centers for supporting the process
of inclusive education has been trained to apply the functional assessment of children and students with
SEN according to the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Human Health83.
In 2020, follow-up trainings of 70 trainers from the personal development support teams in
kindergartens and schools has been delivered for scaling up the functional assessment84. Both trainings
has been delivered with the UNICEF’s technical assistance and support. Various methodologies and tools
for working with children with different types of disability has been developed with MoES funding in
addition to the screening test for learning difficulties85. Increasing number of specialized training
programs for teachers has been offered- as of August 2021, the Information Register of Approved
Programs for Upgrading Qualification of Pedagogical Specialists of the MoES contains 91 registered
training programs for IE, 56 training programs for work with children and students with SEN and 5
training programs for work with children and students with specific types of disabilities, offering
qualification credits for teachers. According to the SitAn (2021) all these measures resulted in gradually
increasing number of inclusive schools offering accessible and enabling learning environment and
properly trained teachers but their numbers are still insufficient to provide adequate support for all
children with SEN. Despite the available training opportunities, UNICEF’s survey on teachers’ attitudes86
demonstrates very low level of both formal training and of involvement in informal training and self-
training of teachers to support inclusive education. A recent national representative survey on the
impact of remote learning in electronic environment on teachers and students demonstrate that 42% of
Bulgarian teachers believe that they do not have the necessary skills and resources to support students
with SEN87. The access of CwD to additional support services has been improved, but are still
insufficient and unevenly distributed. According to the MoES data, the number of children and

students included in the mainstream education that have been provided with additional support from
the regional centres for supporting the process of inclusive education increased by 13% between 2018
and 2020 – from 17 955 in 2018 to 20 314 in 202088. Despite the progress observed, important barriers
remain. The support services to CwD and their families are still insufficient and unevenly distributed.
According to MoES data, the total number of children with disabilities and special needs in
kindergartens and schools in Bulgaria were over 25,000 in 2020, which means that some 4 686 children
enrolled in mainstream education still don’t have access to support services. One reason is the highly
uneven geographic distribution of specialized services for children with developmental difficulties and
disabilities, which hampers the equal access. In addition to this, CwD that are left outside formal
education system or dropped out don’t have access to complementary support services.
Progress towards attitudinal changes regarding inclusive education
There are mixed signals regarding the changes in teachers attitudes towards inclusive education
of CwD. The specially commissioned UNICEF’s survey demonstrates certain positive shift in teacher
attitudes towards inclusion of CwD in the mainstream educational settings and positive contribution of
specialized trainings on the registered change89. However, the interviews conducted for this evaluation
suggests significant remaining attitudinal challenges for teachers working with CwD, especially among
older teachers. According to the feedback collected, the general teacher attitudes has worsened lately.
More and more teachers, especially those with longer pedagogical experience, face difficulties and
uncertainties working with children and students with disabilities, and increasingly consider that that
these children should be educated separately.
The third outcome of UNICEF CPD for the period 2018 – 2022 is operationalized through 4 outcome
indicators. The first outcome indicator refers to the adequate support received by children on the
move, including access to health and education services. According to the data Bulgaria has made
progress in addressing the needs of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) and
ensuring the realisation of their rights, nevertheless, the indicator has been partially achieved. The ban
on detention of UASC introduced in the law in 2017 and the adoption of the Law on Aliens in the Republic
of Bulgaria (LARB) Regulations are two important legislative changes that led to improvements in the
state response to the needs of UASC. Nevertheless, there is a need of more coordination among key
stakeholders providing services, such us child protection, judicial or health, to children on the move and
also of increasing the preparedness of specialized staff dealing with UASC (cultural mediators,
psychologists, social workers and other) and the expansion of the coverage of services provided.
The second outcome indicator refers to institutionalized, specialized and quality routine training on
the rights of child participants in legal proceedings for police officers, prosecutors, judges and lawyers
working with children in justice processes. In this area there are no formalized trainings for
professionals in the judiciary working with children, thus the indicator has not been achieved. All data
available show that the professionals are not well prepared to work with children and even if there has
been observed slight improvements in the extent to which the alternatives to detention, the restorative
practices are used, there is a need of a legal framework in this respect, including the integration of
mandatory trainings for professional working with children, in order to be able to produce and observe
at-scale results. Nevertheless, there has been registered a slight decrease in proceeding launched against
children and also in the number of children convicted.
The third outcome indicator refers to the number of cases of violence against children identified,
reported and addressed. The indicator has not been achieved because the number of signals and cases
launched in the period 2015 – 2019 have decreased significantly. If in 2015, there were 3741 signals
received for violence against children and 957 cases launched, in 2019, there were only 1171 signals
received and only 446 cases opened. This trend must be analysed in comparison with the number of

stage). UNICEF

children victims of violence, that has increased form 3566 in 2015 to 4122 in 201990. Nevertheless, the
available administrative data is inconsistent and the efforts made in the area of monitoring and
identifying cases of VaC or children at risk are not sufficient.
Regarding the fourth outcome indicator, justice system complies with the minimum standards laid
down in the Beijing Rules of Justice, the available data show progress due to the legislative
improvements in the past years, but the target for 2022 of full compliance remains partially achieved.
Progress made in the improvement of the legislative framework on child protection and access to justice
In 2019 and 2020, in Bulgaria, 3 important policy and legislative documents have been adopted:
- Social Service Act (SSA);
- National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020;
- National Strategy for promoting equality between women and men 2021 – 2030;
- Law on Aliens in the Republic of Bulgaria (LARB) Regulations;
- Amendments of the Law on Asylum and Refugees.
The adoption of the Social Service Act, in May 2020 is a key moment in the development of the legislative
framework in Bulgaria in the area of protecting and supporting children being victims of violence or at
risk of violence. UNICEF and its implementing partners within the project Child Advocacy Centers,
ANIMUS and SAPI, have supported the government in the process of drafting the Social Service Act. The
evidence gathered from documents and interview highlight the importance of UNICEF’s work in this
regard. Moreover, the Social Services Act “weakens the mandate of SACP, and hands over licensing of
social services functions to the Agency for Quality of Social Services (AQSS) and municipalities”91. This
means also that the local policy has been influenced by the adoption of SSA, which has been supported
by UNICEF. Moreover, the SSA changes the way in which the social services are provided, putting more
emphasis on the individualized and customized services and support for children. Also, the new
legislative document, introduces the concept of an integrated approach and thus, facilitates
“multiagency coordination and team work”92.
In regards with the services provided to UASC, the adoption of the Law on Aliens in the Republic of
Bulgaria (LARB) Regulations, have established that the “the educational system cannot be postponed by
more than three months following the submission of the asylum application”93. As a result, the
enrollment rate of UASC in schools has increased significantly. According to the data provided by
the Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020, in 2016/2017 school year the enrollment rate was
10%, whereas in 2018/1019 was 60%. Regarding the improvements that have been made in Bulgaria
in respect to the services and support provided to children on the move, is also important to mention
that in 2017 the ban on detention was introduced into the law and therefore, unaccompanied children
and separated children were not allowed to be detained any more and they should be referred to Child
protection Departments. Further, the Amendments of the Law on Asylum and Refugees led to change in
the arrangements for representation of UASC to be entrusted to specially selected list of legal aid lawyers
from the Public Register of the National Legal Aid Bureau (NLAB)94.
Progress made in the improvement of the national monitoring system of child rights realization
Ministry of Interior developed, with the support of UNICEF, the Automated Informational System for
the Prevention of Child Crime and Protection of Children. The new system put in place in Bulgaria
has been presented at the TransMonEE Network Meeting of National Statistical Offices in Europe and
Central Asia, Austria, in 2019, as a promising example of a national monitoring system of children at risk
and children victim of crime95. Nevertheless, according to the documents revised and the data collected

from interviews, there are no available of data on the operationalization of the system, nor on its
utilization. The information collected through the Automated Informational System are not public yet.
Moreover, duty bearers are not efficient in identifying victims of domestic violence and register them
only when the child or adults file a complaint with the police. The monitoring system is inconsistent and
fragmentated between institutions from various sectors that address the needs of child victims of
violence (child protection, health, education, justice) and the available database are not interoperable.
Progress made in cross-sectoral coordination under child protection area
The Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020, shows that in the period of 2013 – 2019, the use
of the Coordination Mechanism for cross-sectoral support provided to child victims of violence
or children being at risk has increased with 33%96. Moreover, the analysis provides evidence on the
fact that “social services, health, education and civil society partners are increasingly involved at key
stages of the juvenile justice process”97. Further, the analysis emphasizes that Coordination Mechanism
in the Case of Violence, established through the Child Protection Act requires urgent advances in its
implementation.
Moreover, the collected data show that the sector of child protection presents “underdeveloped
mechanisms for timely identification and multi-sectoral responses supporting children in need of
protection”98. The need of further development in the area of child protect in respect to the cross-
sectoral coordination in Bulgaria has been emphasized also in the Analysis of the Child Protection
System in Bulgaria from 2019. The report states that Bulgaria “lacks in clarity as to the multi-sectoral
nature of the child protection system and its main components, functions and approaches”99. The data
collected through interviewees also support the idea that the responsibilities in this sector are
dissipated among a lot of actors and there is a lack of coordination which affects the quality of
services provide for children.
Progress made in proving access to justice for all children victims of violence
The Situation Analysis from 2021 emphasize that the progress made in the period 2018 – 2021 in
the area of access to justice in Bulgaria has been slow100. The analysis also emphasized that in
general free legal aid for children is still difficult to access and inconsistent. The system of so-called “blue
room”, initiated through CACs model, which allows the protection of children involved in legal
proceedings has improved the access of children to child-friendly justice. The Situation Analysis
conducted in 2020, showed that there are 25 blue rooms available in Bulgaria, “but they operate without
any established rules or procedure, and overall are rarely used”101. Moreover, the system of child
protection is not proactive on identifying cases of violence against women and children or children being
at risk. The service providers are not trained in this concern and they do not have the necessary skills
to identify such cases. Thus, as emphasized in the Situation Analysis many cases of violence are not
reported.
Nevertheless, the evaluation team has collected evidences on the positives effects that the CACs model
have on the access to justice for children being victims of violence or being at risk. According to the
evaluation conducted in 2020, the “CACs were able to improve access to justice because they worked
with lawyers who provided free legal services to children and their families”102. The centres also
provided other types of services for children, such as mental health services and psychological and
therapeutic services. They have also initiated the use of “blue rooms”, which allows the protection of
children during proceedings. Further, the evaluation of CACs model emphasizes that the access to
integrated services has been considered very facile by the children and parents that have benefited from

them. The perspective of the beneficiaries towards the relevance and usefulness of the supports
received from the centres is highly appreciative.
The third outcome of UNICEF CPD for the period 2018 – 2022 is operationalized through 4 outcome
indicators. The first outcome indicator refers to the adequate support received by children on the

Regarding the fourth outcome indicator, justice system complies with the minimum standards laid
down in the Beijing Rules of Justice, the available data show progress due to the legislative
improvements in the past years, but the target for 2022 of full compliance remains partially achieved.
Progress in monitoring children rights realization at national level
According to the available data, the National Statistical Institute has improved its statistical
infrastructure104 and the key indicators for which the NSI is collecting data are in accordance with EU
requirements. Furthermore, according to UNICEF reports, the NSI produce data on children
disaggregated in line with CRC concluding observations, through the Sector management information
system105. The Directorate on Child Rights of the Ombudsman’s Office in Bulgaria is actively involved in
monitoring the realization of child rights. Nevertheless, its capacity technical and financial capacity is
insufficient as to able to collect data in all relevant areas.
Nevertheless, the available analysis and research developed in the respect with child right realization
emphasize that disaggregated data are not available, that information is fragmented and also the

available database from different public institutions are not interoperable. The Situation Analysis
conducted by UNICEF in 2020 highlights that “data on the actual numbers of children involved in labour,
children/adolescents subjected to violence, child marriages, sexual violence, abuse and exploitation are
not available”106. Moreover, the analysis shows that in regards with vulnerable children, public
institutions define and monitor in different manners their status. There still an important gap in
information regarding children from Roma communities and their rights realization.
Further, as Bulgaria adopted the 2030 Agenda, it will develop a national mechanism of the coordination
and implementation of the SDG which will include a monitoring system. This is an important
opportunity for further improvements regarding available administrative data regarding the realization
of children rights at national level.
Progress made in partnership strengthening for child rights
UNICEF has strengthened its business partnership strategy and started to engage more actively the
business sector in its activities. In this respect, the CO has developed a partnership with corporate
businesses, NGOs, media and academia for the organization of the first youth-led virtual hackathon on
digital solutions for media literacy107. Nevertheless, its partnerships with public authorities and
municipalities, key SCOs (within the models implemented, e.g. CACs, FFC, Together from kindergarten,
HVS and other) in the fields of child protection, inclusive education, early childhood development are
well established. The data collected through interviews show that UNICEF acts a communication and
partnership facilitator among duty bearers from different sectors, NGOs and academia. An important
partnership that needs to be mentioned here is the partnership with Ombudsman of Bulgaria, which is
actively involved in monitoring the realization of chid rights in Bulgaria.
Progress in communicating and promoting for children rights
As part of the outcome 4 of CPD is directly attributable to UNICEF efforts, C4D, this section addresses
only the progress observed by analysing the CO results in conducting C4D activities. UNICEF has been a
key actor in Bulgaria in promoting child rights through communication and awareness raising
campaigns.
According to the reports of UNICEF108, the C4D activities have managed to reach a substantial number
of people, as it follows:
• The Spring campaign ‘Education for every child’ aimed at developing the first digital educational
platform in Bulgaria that will make the learning process more accessible to children with

Conditions and factors influenced the effectiveness of UNICEF’s Country Program in the area of ECD
The implementation of early childhood development program component could not proceed as planned
due to: (i) significant change in the policies and practices in the provision of services for young children
and their families, compared to the programming stage; (ii) resistance to inter-sectoral cooperation; (iiI)
insufficient national resources, but also lack of political will, to scale-up and mainstream the models
demonstrated by UNICEF projects into the services to families with limited access to early childhood
services; (iv) undeveloped legislation, particularly in regards to parenting support and (v) socio-
cultural norms of some communities that may deprive children of their right to develop to their full
potential.
The strengths that facilitated and supported improvements were: (i) UNICEF’s access to valuable
accumulation of knowledge and use of strong international expertise, especially in the field of ECD; (ii)
credibility of the UNICEF brand and strong public recognition enabling greater influence on public
opinion on the importance of early childhood care for development, (iii) commitment of service
providers at the local level; (iv) effective partnerships and cooperation on the regional and local level
(libraries, social service providers, health facilities); and the last but not least, (v) EU membership that
allowed the introduction of EU Child Guarantee that could be used as a leverage to ensure progress in
the field of ECD.
Conditions and factors influenced the effectiveness of UNICEF’s Country Program in the area of inclusive
education
The research done by the evaluation team shows that unlike the ECD and VAC areas where the lack of
political commitment and the pubic sensitivity to child protection initiatives impose serious risks to
effectiveness of UNICEF’s Country Program, there are no strong political bottlenecks hindering the
UNICEF’s effectiveness and impact in the area of inclusive education for CwD. Nevertheless, there are
significant challenges stemming from: (i) strong stigma and negative attitudes towards children with
disabilities; (ii) the limited parental awareness of the importance of early diagnostics of disability and
weak parental engagement; (iii) the lack of adequate staffing to support inclusive education at regional
and local level; (iv) the lack of adequate qualification and experience of teaching workforce; (v) the lack
of evidence-driven policy-making culture and practices in the area of education; (vi) limited data
availability; (vii) the prolonged periods of remote learning in electronic environment due to Covid-19
pandemic which increases significantly the risks for learning losses and widening educational
inequalities, especially for the children with disabilities; (viii) low political attention to the problems of
children with disabilities.
On the other hand, there are various supporting factors, including (i) commitment and effective
partnership with the Ministry of Education and Science; (ii) effective partnerships and cooperation on
the regional level (with the regional departments for education, regional centers for supporting the
process of inclusive education); (iii) access to and use of strong international expertise; (iv) sustainable
local partnerships with quality service providers; (v) credibility of the UNICEF brand and strong public
recognition enabling greater influence on public opinion on the inclusion of children with disabilities in
mainstream education.
Conditions and factors influenced the effectiveness of UNICEF’s Country Program in the area of
prevention of violence and access to justice
According to the analysis developed by the evaluation team, the hindering factors that have affected the
progress registered in VaC and access to justice area are the following: (i) the political crisis facing
Bulgaria, which led to often changes at the level of governmental bodies and to the need to engage more
resources in the partnership development activities; (ii) the resistance of conservative political groups
and, as a consequence, the postponement of the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on
preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (known as the Istanbul
Convention); (iii) the lack of coordination among sectors and key actors in the area of child protection;
119
(iv) the low level of competencies and skills of human resources at the level various service providers
(in the sectors of justice, health, mental health, psychological support, therapeutical support) dealing
with cases in which children are involved; (v) the general tolerance regarding domestic violence against
women and children, which can be also observed at the level of judiciary professionals and (vi) the lack
of statistical/administrative data. All these bottlenecks led to a slow development of the area at national
level and impacted the activities conducted by UNICEF.
On the other hand, the strengths that facilitated and supported improvements were; (i) UNICEF’s
acknowledged role, by all stakeholders that have been interviewed, as a key actor in the area of VaC and
thus, its credibility among duty bearers and CSOs that activate in this area; (ii) the acknowledged role
of UNICEF as a communication and partnership facilitator among national and local among public bodies
and CSOs in the area of VaC and access to justice (mainly at the level of stakeholders involved in the
development of CACs model) and (iii) the effective partnerships and cooperation on the regional and
local levels.
Conditions and factors influenced the effectiveness of UNICEF’s Country Program in the area of
partnerships for monitoring, communication and promotion of child rights
The hindering factors that have affected the progress registered in developing partnerships for
monitoring, communication and promotion of child rights are the following: (i) the lack of knowledge
and awareness about child rights, not only among the general public but also on the part of national and
local authorities, professionals and the media; (ii) the underdeveloped culture of youth and adolescents
participation and engagement in public life and decision making, as a result of still lasting patriarchal
social norms and age-related stereotypes; (iii) very fragmented responsibilities in monitoring the child
rights realization in Bulgaria and lack of coordination among relevant public sectors; (iv) the insufficient
financial and administrative capacity of institutions and bodies responsible for monitoring.
Based on the analysis conducted by the evaluation team, the strengths that facilitated and supported the
observed improvements were: (i) UNICEF’s credibility among duty bearers, CSOs and general public;
(ii) the active role of Human Rights International Bodies in assessing the national monitoring system
and providing recommendation for further improvements; (iii) the commitment of the Ombudsman’s of
Bulgaria regarding monitoring and providing data on the situation of children in Bulgaria; (iv) the
membership of EU which led to the adjustment of the data collected by the National Statistical Institute
according to the European requirements

Annex 3. Process Tracing – Case Studies
Methodology for Process Tracing
tracking evidence of each link in the causal chain. Therefore, it is suitable for the evaluation of
effectiveness and impact and, partially, the relevance as part of causal chain in the Theory of Change.
This method as a qualitative approach through ex-post design where there is no control group available.
It is distinguishable from other more commonly used approaches of evaluation because it focuses on
increasing our level of confidence in a causal story rather than trying to measure impact and attribute it
to a particular event. It rests on the belief that all processes, if correctly identified and specified, would
show empirical manifestations that if observed would increase our confidence on its existence.
The method includes assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations
and evidence of how and why an effect occurred.
Assigning probabilities to assess the strength of within-case observations and evidence can be
subjective, within the limit of the existing evidence. On the other hand, the entire Process Tracing
analysis is transparent: the evidence determining the probabilities assigned are presented to all readers
of the report and this allows stakeholders to understand the impact and contribution of UNICEF beyond
the numbers related to the evaluators own (subjective) assessment.
The impact case studies about UNICEF contribution on three selected areas – (a) adolescents and youth
participation and health; (b) inclusive education; (c) justice for children – are based on Process Tracing.
The reports sections dedicated to the impact case studies is structure according to the steps that a PT
evaluation needs to follow, explaining briefly in each sub-section what the evaluation team did,
following the six steps of Bayesian Updating in Evaluation set out by Befani (2019): 1) formulating a
contribution claim; 2) establish a prior level of confidence in it; 3) focus on one specific piece of evidence
at a time; 4) estimate the sensitivity of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the
question: If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?); 5) estimate the type I error
of that piece of evidence for that contribution claim (answering the question: If the claim is false, how
likely would we expect to see the evidence?); 6) Update of the prior into the posterior using the Bayes
formula.
The contribution claims have been formulated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and updated
based on the feedback from UNICEF Bulgaria Country Office (CO), before data collection through
interviews. The prior level of confidence is established conventionally at 0.5.
The evidence used was collected from documents provided by UNICEF and the implementation partners
for each of the three selected areas mentioned above and from interviews. Prior to the interviews, the
evaluation team sent a list of the types of documents required to UNICEF CO and received the most
important documents. Interviews have been also used to collect evidences and documents. Interviews
are not considered independent evidence because the people interviewed know each other and have
been working together, sometimes for several years. This would make them more likely to have a
common discourse about the analysed subject. Even though complete independence is not assumed, the
interviews of public authorities and civil society organisations about UNICEF’s contribution, its relative
importance compared to other stakeholders, its reputation and their trust in the organization are
considered important evidences when documents are missing, also considering that evidences on
reputation and trust are traditionally based on stakeholders contributions to the evaluation.
More iterations between the data collection and the analysis of the evidence can increase the possibility
of obtaining more supporting evidence and minimize issues arising from absence of evidence. However,
in practice, this process may increase the time and cost of the evaluation. For this evaluation, only one
iteration of data collection and analysis was possible, due to time constraints.

Process tracing has been applied as an analytical tool to evaluate UNICEF Bulgaria contribution in
positive achievements in the area of early childhood development and to establish the impact level.
Collected evidence from desk research and the interviews conducted has been used to make inferences
about causal explanations of that case through a combination of induction and deduction, and is
weighted in an attempt to provide a reasonable degree of confidence that each claim exists109. In other
words, the quality, strength, power, or probative value of the collected pieces of evidence have been
assessed to support each of the elements of the causal mechanism described in the reconstructed Theory
of Change.
Bayesian probability logic is followed in assessing the strength of the evidence of each part of the chain.
In assessing the strength of evidence the evaluation team considered the reliability of each source and
identified three potential limitations and biases: (1) there were gaps in UNICEF Bulgaria M&E
mechanisms and limited documenting practices used to observe the intended change; (2) part of the
respondents were UNICEF’s service providers and/or partners working together for many years and
their feedback might be biased; and (3) some respondents had limited knowledge on the parts of the
mechanism under investigation that decreased their ability to provide well-informed
judgments/statements. To maximize the reliability and validity of evidence used, the team tried to
triangulate the information as much as possible, and tested consistency of the evidence within different
claims using also the case-specific expertise of the evaluators and their good knowledge of the context.
Also, a clear distinction between “absence of evidence” (which has little inferential power), and “evidence
of absence” has been made, as the latter can strongly challenge the causal mechanism investigated.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain: (1)
UNICEF has provided technical support for the development of the ECD strategy and (2) has collaborated
with key stakeholders in developing the Roma Early Years Inclusion Study, which informed the draft
national strategy for inclusion and participation of Roma for 2021-2030. Further, UNICEF (3) has
implemented the community-based parenting support program and (4) provided support for the
Government to set up Centers for Maternal and Child Health in the regions of Shumen and Sliven, with the
main focus on the component of Home Visiting Service (HVS). UNICEF has also (5) implemented the C4D
initiatives and parenting support programs promoting positive interaction, nurturing and stimulating care
for young children.
These actions resulted in (6) strengthened parenting competencies for the parents participating the
aforementioned initiatives and (7) increased access to social, health and education services for young
children from isolated or disadvantaged communities/most vulnerable children.
Claim 1: UNICEF has provided technical support for the development of the ECD strategy
Evidence implies that UNICEF has made efforts to contribute to the process of preparing the ECD
strategy, as also evidenced below in the support to the preparation of the Early Years Roma Integration
Strategy (Claim 2).
• In 2019, UNICEF provided input and technical support for the drafting process. However, the MES
has no finalized the process yet. (RAM 2020, p. 5)
• In 2020, UNICEF provided very limited technical support to the Government with regard to strategy
development because the process was put on hold by the Government (RAM 2020, p.5)
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
109 Bennett, A. & Checkel, J.T. ed. (2015). Process Tracing: From Metaphor to Analytic Tool. Cambridge University Press
124
Sensitivity-0.70. The existing evidence informs that UNICEF would and could provide technical
support for the development of the ECD strategy, had the process not been put on hold. However,
it should be kept in mind that formulating policies and developing policy documents, may not
always produced expected short-term change as anticipated the ToC. The likelihood of developing
a national strategy depends on various external factors. In Bulgaria, although UNICEF was
strongly positioned to make a contribution to the preparation of an ECD strategy, the anticipated
political risk due to strong anti-child and anti-women rights social tension resulting in putting on
hold of the main child related policies realised reducing the chances of producing the ECD
Strategy.
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability–0.50. There is sufficient ground to accept that the claim had little a
chances to be false at the time of conception of the programme. This claim is justified by the fact
that the UNICEF’s reputation and expertise to promote and monitor child rights accepted by all
stakeholders as an added value in a process towards developing policies for children.
Furthermore, evidence on the efforts to produce the ECD strategy is available.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews imply a cautiously confident (0.700) probability for the
hypothesis “UNICEF Bulgaria has provided technical support for the development of the ECD
strategy”, as being true given the evidence.
Claim 1 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see 0.7
this evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to 0.1
see the evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.8750
Claim 2: UNICEF has collaborated with key stakeholders in developing the Roma Early Years
Inclusion Study, which informed the draft national strategy for inclusion and participation of
Roma for 2021-2030.
The study on Roma Early Years Inclusion (RECI+ studies), supported by the Open Society
Foundation, the Roma Education Fund and UNICEF was completed and the findings disseminated
among key national and international stakeholders and informed the draft national strategy for
inclusion and participation of Roma for the period 2021-2030. (RAM 2020, 64)
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. The existing evidence informs that the likelihood for this claim to be true is
highly confident, because Roma Inclusion is a priority issue for UNICEF in its efforts to reach the
most vulnerable and marginalized children. Furthermore, developing and leveraging resources
and partnerships for children is an identified strategy for the ECD interventions. Similarly, such
collaboration is in conformity with the strategy on using the power of evidence to drive change
for children and would inform the national ECD strategy, if it could be prepared.
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
125
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF supported Roma
Early Years Inclusion Study, which informed the draft national strategy for inclusion and
participation of Roma for 2021-2030.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high likelihood for level of evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens
component”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 2 Evidence – Account and
trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.1
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.900
Claim 3: UNICEF has implemented the community-based parenting support program
The program is designed building on the Family Consultative Centres (FCCs), co-created by
several municipalities and UNICEF within the frame of the previous CPDs. The number of FCCs
providing complex services (social, pedagogical, psychological, medical, etc.) to vulnerable
groups is insufficient and they are not available in all municipalities.
• More than 300 service providers benefitted from capacity building activities organized by
UNICEF and partners to effectively engage with parents, to improve their understanding of
key concepts related to early childhood development. In addition, a module on ECD was
integrated in the introductory training of Roma health mediators. (COAR 2019, p. 2)
• 2,501 families and 3,735 children from vulnerable and isolated communities benefited from
outreach and preventive services – Family Consultative Centres (FCCs). (COAR 2019, p. 2)
• Network of 40 municipalities, local libraries and cultural institutions, as well as social and
educational service providers, delivered a community-based parenting support program
developed by UNICEF reaching out to 680 caregivers of young children, including 168 parents
of children with disabilities and developmental difficulties. (COAR 2019, p. 2)
• 2,046 families and 3,055 children from vulnerable and isolated communities benefited from
outreach and preventive services in the Family Consultative Centres (FCCs). (RAM 2020, p. 8)
• While working remotely during the state of emergency, the FCCs also provided
comprehensive information about COVID-19.
• The CO continued to support one Community Centre to promote secondary education for
Roma adolescent girls and to prevent child marriages in targeted Roma communities. 58 girls
and 29 boys participated in motivational health and educational activities to increase their
interest for completing secondary education. (RAM 2020, p. 19)
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. The existing evidence supports a high level of confidence regarding UNICEF’s
role in the implementation of community-based parenting support programme, since it is an
innovative intervention in line with UNCEF’s strategies and the necessary resources are allocated
by UNICEF for the intervention.
126
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF funded and
implemented the community-based parenting support programme.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria has implemented the community-based parenting support
program”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 3 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this 0.9
evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.1
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.900
Claim 4: UNICEF provided support for the Government to set up Centers for Maternal and Child
Health in the regions of Shumen and Sliven, with the main focus on the component of Home
Visiting Service (HVS).
Designed to inform the development of a proposal for scaling up of the HVS on the national basis
with EU funds as envisaged in national strategic documents related to deinstitutionalization;
Centers for Maternal and Child Health were built on the routine health services for young children
and pregnant women, young children and their care givers provided in health facilities with a
view to extend the services to include regular home visiting services (HVS), otherwise conditional
for specific cases. A pilot study was planned in the regions of Shumen and Sliven assessed as
regions where the most remote settlements, vulnerable and marginalized communities lacked
access to services.
• The demonstration Home Visiting Services in two regions of the country, provided 6000
families of children aged zero to two with individual guidance, information and education for
nurturing care. (COAR 2018, p. 7)
• An evaluation of the UNICEF supported HVS model was completed and its findings were used
to inform the development of a proposal for scaling up of the service on a national basis.
(COAR 2019, p. 2)
• An evaluation of the UNICEF supported HVS model was completed and its findings were
used to inform the development of a proposal for scaling up of the service on a national
basis. However, despite UNICEF advocacy and technical support, toward the end of 2019
Ministry of Health finally decided not to pursue the expansion because of concerns for
availability of sustainable government funding after the end of the project. (COAR 2019, p.
2)
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. Overall, the existing evidence supports a high level of confidence regarding the
instrumental role plaid by UNICEF in supporting the Government to set up Centres for Maternal
and Child Health in the regions of Shumen and Sliven, with the main focus on the component of
Home Visiting Service (HVS).
127
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF supported the
Government to set up Centres for Maternal and Child Health in the regions of Shumen and Sliven,
with the main focus on the component of Home Visiting Service (HVS) and commissioned an
evaluation study to promote the scaling up of the services, which could not be affected within the
framework of current CPD.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria provided support for the Government to set up Centers for Maternal
and Child Health in the regions of Shumen and Sliven, with the main focus on the component of Home
Visiting Service (HVS)”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 4 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the 0.1
evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.900
Claim 5: UNICEF has implemented the C4BSC initiatives and parenting support programs
promoting positive interaction, nurturing and stimulating care for young children.
Over 2,000,000 people were reached with ECD advocacy messages and fundraising appeal via
employee and customer networks of 10 corporate partners. Over 30 media partners and five
celebrities were involved to support the initiative pro-bono, covering over 200,000 people online.
UNICEF developed of an in-house face-to-face programme. Bulgaria conducted an integrated
fundraising and awareness campaign on ECD that generated 43,750 USD. The two-step approach
to the acquisition of pledge donors was tested, resulting with 1350 parents of young children
engaged in positive parenting messages. (COAR 2018, p.15)
UNICEF contributed to the national response to COVID-19 pandemic through different parenting
support and C4BSC modalities (home visiting services, dedicated parenting website, pre-school
teachers, community-based parenting support programs). UNICEF re-programmed interventions
with partners to allow both face-to-face work as well as remote assistance (online, telephone,
etc.) (RAM 2020, p. 2)
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. The existing evidence supports a high level of confidence regarding the
instrumental role plaid by UNICEF in supporting the implementation of C4BSC initiatives and
parenting support programs promoting positive interaction, nurturing and stimulating care for
young children.
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF implemented
C4BSC initiatives and parenting support programs to promote positive interaction, nurturing and
128
stimulating care for young children, which are reported to be highly instrumental during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
c) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens
component”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 5 Evidence – Account and
trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.8
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.1
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.888
Claim 6: These actions resulted in strengthened parenting competencies for the parents
participating the aforementioned initiatives
UNICEF pilot project implementation on early childhood development through capacity building,
hands-on-support to parents through HVS and C4BSC as well as initiatives as part of the COVID-
19 response have contributed to strengthening parenting competencies through material
assistance, information and knowledge as well as skills building.
• Through different parenting support and C4D modalities (home visiting services, dedicated
parenting website, pre-school teachers, community-based parenting support programs).
UNICEF re-programmed interventions with partners to allow both face-to-face work as well
as remote assistance (online, telephone, etc.) (RAM 2020, p. 2)
• 13794 parents/caregivers of children under 5 received parenting support to improve care
and development of their children with support of UNICEF in the reporting year (RAM 2020,
5)
• Community-based parenting support program developed by UNICEF reached out to 680
caregivers of young children, including 168 parents of children with disabilities and
developmental difficulties. (COAR 2019, p.
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. The existing evidence supports a high level of confidence regarding the
instrumental role plaid by UNICEF in the implementation of HVS and community-based
parenting support programme as well as C4BSC, since it is an innovative intervention in line
with UNCEF’s strategies and the necessary resources are allocated by UNICEF for the
intervention.
a) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF implemented ECD
initiatives (HVS, community-based parenting activities and parenting support programs through
C4BSC) to promote positive interaction, nurturing and stimulating care for young children.
b) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
129
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens
component”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 6 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.9
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.1
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.900
Claim 7: These actions resulted in increased access to social, health and education services for
young children from isolated or disadvantaged communities/most vulnerable children.
• Over 2,000,000 people were reached with ECD advocacy messages (COAR 2018, p.15);
• Around 300 services providers benefitted from capacity development activities,
• Institutions and organizations in 40 municipalities participated in community-based
parenting support services (COAR 2019, p. 2);
• Around 5,000 families and 7,000 children received services (COAR 2019, p. 2; RAM 2020,
p. 8)
Nevertheless, due to the political context in Bulgaria related to the movement, the process of
scaling up the HVS model was postponed. Further, the shift in the government priorities, manly
regarding the measures taken to contain the effects of the pandemic in Bulgaria, did not allow
UNICEF to led to resume discussions with the government on the expansion of the programme.
In this context the impact of the intervention remains limited.
a) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.80. The existing evidence supports our confidence that the UNICEF initiatives in the
area of ECD has played and instrumental role in increasing access to social, health and education
services for young children from isolated or disadvantaged communities/most vulnerable
children, through HVS and community-based parenting, through which parents and communities
were rendered partners in support of delivering the basic messages, adopting positive attitudes
and behaviours.
b) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence provided
during the interviews held within the framework of MCPE could not be observed if the claim is
false. Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence
of the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the
hypothesis of “UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens
component”, being true given the evidence.

Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the
“weakest link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 1 (referring to
the provision of technical support for the development of the ECD strategy) with a posterior of
0.875. This means that we can be highly confident that UNICEF Bulgaria contributed to the
overall improvement of early childhood development. The analysis provides clear evidence
that UNICEF undertook and supported interventions in collaboration and cooperation with
public, private and civil sectors in the field of early childhood development. We are highly
confident these activities have short term results for the directly targeted institution,
professionals, families/care givers as well as the society in general and contributed to improved
parenting competencies with possible, long-term changes in terms of improved access to
social, health and education services for young children from isolated or disadvantaged
communities/most vulnerable children.

Case Study 2: Assessment of UNICEF Bulgaria contribution in the area of inclusive
education for children with disabilities
Process tracing has been applied as an analytical tool to evaluate UNICEF Bulgaria contribution
in positive achievements in the area of inclusive education of children with disabilities and to
131
establish the impact level. Collected evidence from desk research and the interviews conducted
has been used to make inferences about causal explanations of that case through a combination
of induction and deduction, and is weighted in an attempt to provide a reasonable degree of
confidence that each claim exists110. In other words, the quality, strength, power, or probative
value of the collected pieces of evidence have been assessed to support each of the elements of
the causal mechanism described in the reconstructed Theory of Change.
Bayesian probability logic is followed in assessing the strength of the evidence of each part of the
chain. In assessing the strength of evidence the evaluation team considered the reliability of each
source and identified three potential limitations and biases: (1) there were gaps in UNICEF
Bulgaria M&E mechanisms and limited documenting practices used to observe the intended
change; (2) part of the respondents were UNICEF’s service providers and/or partners working
together for many years and their feedback might be biased; and (3) some respondents had
limited knowledge on the parts of the mechanism under investigation that decreased their ability
to provide well-informed judgments/statements. To maximize the reliability and validity of
evidence used, the team tried to triangulate the information as much as possible, and tested
consistency of the evidence within different claims using also the case-specific expertise of the
evaluators and their good knowledge of the context. Also, a clear distinction between “absence of
evidence” (which has little inferential power), and “evidence of absence” has been made, as the
latter can strongly challenge the causal mechanism investigated.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain:
(1) UNICEF has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens component and (2) has
provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) in strengthening the
capacities for needs assessment of children with disabilities by introducing the functional
assessment of disability. Further, UNICEF (3) supported the development of educational training
programs for teachers, which included assistance on using assistive technologies, and (4) has
conducted public awareness raising campaigns on sensitivity and intolerance of society and school
communities. These activities resulted in (5) improved educational services in the schools that were
included in modelling initiatives, (6) an increase of 10 % of positive attitudes towards including
children with disabilities in mainstream education among teachers from the pilot kindergartens and
also (7) an increase of enrolment and inclusion of children with disabilities in pre-school and school
education.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study
is presented below.

Claim 1: UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens component
a) Evidence
The evidence is based on program documents and reports provided by UNICEF Bulgaria. It shows
that building upon the experience with the implementation of the modelling initiative for inclusive
education at pre-school level “Together from kindergarten” project, which was launched in 2016 as
a joint initiative of UNICEF the Ministry of Education and Science, UNICEF Bulgaria continued to
provide methodological support to the pilot kindergartens and to document good practices and
lessons learned for national scale-up111. The modelling initiative has been implemented in 35
kindergartens in 4 regions: Montana, Sliven, Schumen and Sofia for two academic years (2016-2017
and 2017-2018). The core component of the project was the recruitment and training of specialist
staff (speech therapists, psychologists, resource teachers).
Formative evaluation of the inclusive pre-school model has been commissioned and implemented in
2018. The evaluation identified lessons learned and provided recommendations on scaling-up of the
model or different components of it. It provided clear evidence for the nature of the support provided
by the UNICEF and established important conclusions regarding the effectiveness of this support,
including improved institutional capacity of the pilot kindergartens to early detect children with
special education needs and intervene, improved skills and capacities of over 500 teachers and 100
specialists to implement inclusive education practices, and providing access to support services for
more than 5,000 children, and changed parental attitudes. The evaluation report stated that “it is
more than likely that the no-cost practices implemented during the project and the impact of the teacher
training will continue after project completion”112.
It is reported that UNICEF Bulgaria initiated a meeting with a broad group of stakeholders - MoES,
National Association of Resource Teachers, the National Education Inspectorate, municipalities,
kindergartens, NGOs - to reach mutual vision and agreement on the next steps for scaling-up the pre-
school inclusive education model and achieving sustainability113. No documents related to the
discussions and the outcome of this meeting has been provided, but this has little inferential power.
In 2020, building upon the previous experience and lessons learned, UNICEF Bulgaria in
collaboration with the MoES expended the piloting of the pre-school inclusive practices to another
30 kindergartens (with over 6100 children) in 3 new regions (Sliven, Stara Zagora and Burgas) under
the framework of the “EU Child Guarantee” project. Although no relevant documents have been
provided, the interviews held with various stakeholders clearly show that UNICEF Bulgaria support
to piloting kindergartens within both “Together from Kindergarten” project and “EU Child
Guarantee” project has been provided and is considered important.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.90. Overall, the existing evidence supports a high level of confidence regarding the
instrumental role plaid by UNICEF in supporting the implementation of the pilot kindergartens and
strengthening their capacity to provide an inclusive learning environment for children with
disabilities and developmental difficulties. Evidence about documented good practices was not

provided to the evaluators and therefore could not be accessed directly, but all the available reports
and interviews give a reasonably high degree of confidence that this claim is true.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.10. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence could not be
observed if the claim is false. This claim is justified by the fact that the UNICEF-supported pilot
kindergartens have been excluded from other MoES/EU-funded projects to avoid double funding.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.900) the probability of the hypothesis
of “UNICEF Bulgaria has supported the implementation of the pilot kindergartens component”, being
true given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.900
Claim 2: UNICEF Bulgaria has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and Science
(MES) in strengthening the capacities for needs assessment of children with disabilities by
introducing the functional assessment of disability
a) Evidence
There is clear evidence that UNICEF provided technical support to the MoES for the introduction of
the functional assessment of children and students with SEN according to the WHO International
Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Human Health. UNICEF commissioned a renowned
international expert to deliver methodological support to MoES and training of 70 trainers from the
regional centers for supporting the process of inclusive education on how to apply the functional
assessment of children and students with SEN according to the WHO International Classification of
Functioning, Disabilities and Human Health114. All the relevant stakeholders confirmed that prof.
Manfred Pretis (funded by UNICEF) provided technical assistance and delivered the above
mentioned training. Following MoES request, the same expert also drafted instructions and
guidelines for applying the functional assessment in educational settings115. In 2020 the follow-up
trainings for scaling up the functional assessment were included as a dedicated activity within a new
MoES project funded under Operational Programme Science and Education for Smart Growth116.
114 COAR (2019).
115 The WHO functional assessment is a multispectral tool that can be used by the general practitioners (doctors),
kindergarten/schools and social services, and has been first introduced and applied in Bulgaria by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Policy.
116 RAM (2020)
135
The interviews held also confirmed that UNICEF Bulgaria also contributed to the adaptation of the
instrument to the national legislative terminology.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.9. Тhe existing evidence is completely conclusive UNICEF delivered technical support to
MoES in introducing the functional assessment of disability. All the respondents interviewed
underlined the importance of this assistance, and especially of valuable expertise of prof. Pretis, for
capacity building in the area of needs assessment of children with disabilities.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.05. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence described above
could not be observed if the claim is false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the high level of likelihood evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and low
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.947) the probability of the hypothesis
of “UNICEF Bulgaria has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Education and Science (MES)
in strengthening the capacities for needs assessment of children with disabilities by introducing the
functional assessment of disability”, being true given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.947
Claim 3: UNICEF Bulgaria supported the development of educational training programs for teachers,
which included assistance on using assistive technologies
a) Evidence
Within the modelling intervention, UNICEF supported Karin Dom and the National Association of
Resource Teachers to develop and deliver training focused on building teacher capacity to work with
children with disabilities within the mainstream kindergartens, as well as to build an inclusive
environment and to support the learning of children with SEN. The training program has been
accredited to the MoES for general use, evident by the registration at the Information Register of
Approved Programs for Upgrading Qualification of Pedagogical Specialists, offering 4 qualification
credits. The training was delivered to teachers, kindergarten directors, speech therapists,
psychologists, teacher assistants and in some instances auxiliary teachers four regions (Schumen,
Sliven, Montana and Sofia), enabling the participants to receive 4 credits for their professional
development. The UNICEF support for this training program was confirmed during the interviews
by all the relevant respondents.
Available reports and the interviews held provide evidence that UNICEF in partnership with several
universities, assisted to development of (i) the general framework for introducing pre-service
136
teacher training on inclusive education and (ii) introduction of a 15-hour mandatory module for pre-
service teacher training on inclusive education. The output of this collaboration and assistance was
manifested in the amendments in the Regulation of the Professional Qualification of Teachers.
UNICEF supported the organization of the second International Conference on Augmentative and
Alternative Communication, bringing together more than 400 participants from the government,
NGO, education experts, principals, teachers, parents, international experts to present and discuss
contemporary approaches and technologies for children and adults with communication difficulties.
UNICEF supported the Foundation Assist to develop a comprehensive training program for
specialists for use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technologies in their work
with children with disabilities. Trainings have been delivered to professionals in 5 Regional Inclusive
Education Support Centres. According to the interviews held the relevant respondents the trainings
were instrumental for the adoption and use of AAC in the regional centres.
In addition, at the end of 2020 UNICEF Bulgaria commissioned a study aiming at exploring the level
of professional competence in the field of AAC and its use in the practice of over 200 specialists from
the Regional Centres for Supporting the Process of Inclusive Education in Bulgaria with the intention
to use the results for provision of AAC-related training for mainstream teachers under the “Voice for
every child” project.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.75. The evidence shows that educational training programs for teachers, including
training on using AAC technologies have been developed and there is enough evidence to be
confident that this happened with the support of UNICEF and that UNICEF funded delivery of
trainings. The evidence is enough to conclude that UNICEF made consistent efforts in raising
awareness and building understanding about the importance and availability of different assistive
technologies.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.3. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false,
as UNICEF funded the partnering organizations efforts in developing and delivering trainings.
However, the evidence does not provide enough ground to distinguish the uniqueness of the UNICEF
support for such training programs, as the supported partnering organizations themselves have
developed and provided similar trainings. For example, according to the Information Register of
Approved Programs for Upgrading Qualification of Pedagogical Specialists, one of the partnering
organizations – Karin Dom –have 13 accredited training programs dealing with SEN, including
related to inclusive education of children with disabilities. Foundation Assist also delivers AAC-
related trainings under MoES-funded programs.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the level of likelihood that the evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.75) and
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to confident (0.714) the probability of the hypothesis of
“UNICEF Bulgaria supported the development of educational training programs for teachers, which
included assistance on using assistive technologies”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 4: UNICEF has conducted public awareness raising campaigns on sensitivity and intolerance of
society and school communities.
a) Evidence
UNICEF reports and provided documents, as well as the interviews confirm the role of UNICEF in
conducting variety of public awareness raising campaigns on sensitivity and intolerance of society
and school communities, including:
- UNICEF took part in an international initiative (Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia and Turkmenistan)
on reducing discrimination and promoting social inclusion of Roma children and young
people and children and youth people with disabilities in Europe and Central Asia region,
supported by David Beckhem for UNICEF. Within this campaign UNICEF Bulgaria focused on
reducing the negative attitudes existing stereotypes among service providers in two regions:
Shumen and Sliven. It has been reported that as a result, “290 adolescents became agents of
change in their communities; over 300 kindergartens and schools learned how to support the
inclusion of Roma children in schools and promote diversity”117.
- UNICEF Bulgaria developed partnerships with the Government, media, the NGO sector and
the business to advocate for the best interest of children, including CwD. In 2019, within the
awareness-raising and social change campaign on child rights “With eyes open for all”,
UNICEF organized a national summit for youth and by youth with disability. According to
UNICEF CO reports, more than 1.3 million people have been reached through large-scale
media coverage of the campaign. The last phase of the campaign was built on the success of
the Parenting month dedicated to parents of children with disabilities.118
- In 2020, UNICEF organized a campaign ‘Education for every child’ aimed at developing the
first digital educational platform in Bulgaria that will make the learning process more
accessible to children with disabilities. The Bulgarian national television was the official
media partner and more than 10 other media outlets supported the campaign that had been
reported to reach more than 3 million people through UNICEF channels and traditional media
(no evidences based documented data has been provided to the evaluation team). UNICEF
reports that through their corporate partners the advocacy messages has reached more than
half million people.
- In 2020, as part of the Education for every child campaign, a campaign of Fantastico
(Bulgarian chain of retail stores) for UNICEF was organized. It is claimed that it reached 3
million+ people, although specific documented evidence was not provided.
- An integrated awareness and fundraising campaign to support non-verbal children ‘A voice
for every child’ has been also organized in 2020. An extensive media coverage was negotiated,
claiming to have reached more than 4.5 million people through TV, radio, print and online
117 COAR (2018)
118 COAR (2019)
138
media and UNICEF channels (no data evidence provided). Three corporate partners
supported the campaign with advocacy messages and via the employee and customer
networks. The campaign was supported by bTV, the most watched TV network in the country,
and BNT119.
The feedback collected during the interviews also provide evidence supporting the claim that
UNICED organize a lot of information campaigns and donation campaigns, thus contributing to
awareness raising.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.9. The evidence allows for certainty that UNICEF Bulgaria has conducted public
awareness raising campaigns on sensitivity and intolerance of society and school communities,
although it is not very evident how it measures the scope of the audience reached by these campaigns.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.05. There is sufficient ground to claim that the evidence described above
could not be observed if the claim is false and UNICEF didn’t initiate/organize/implement these
campaigns.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the level of likelihood that the evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to confident (0.947) the probability of the hypothesis of
“UNICEF has conducted public awareness raising campaigns on sensitivity and intolerance of society
and school communities”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 5: Improved educational services in the schools that were included in modelling initiatives
a) Evidence
As it was described in the previous sections, the new Preschool and School Education Act in 2016 the
adopted State Educational Standard in Bulgaria has made significant progress in addressing barriers
limiting access of children and adolescents with disabilities and special education needs (SEN) to
quality and inclusive education. In addition, significant funding has been secured to strengthen the
institutional capacity and teacher skills to deliver the necessary inclusive learning environment and
support to children with disabilities. At the same time, the transition to the new inclusive model of
mainstream education has been introduced without considering the scope and magnitude of the
limitations in the institutional capacities of kindergartens and schools to deliver quality educational
services to children with disabilities, especially in the economically distressed regions with high child
119 RAM (2020)
139
poverty, ageing teacher workforce, high share of marginalized children, etc. The documents and
reports provided, as well as feedback collected with the interviews confirmed that UNICEF-
supported modelling initiatives target educational institutions in regions where important barriers
are present hampering the equal access to inclusive education services and support. The selection of
piloting locations are based on the level of economic development, child poverty and the number of
children with disabilities. The evaluation of “Together from kindergarten” project provided evidence
that the UNICEF-supported project provided greater support to municipalities without delegated
budgets to kindergartens, and greater support to kindergartens managing their own budget.
The MoES data clearly demonstrate that the number of professionals (such as speech therapists,
educational mediators, psychologists, social workers and resource teachers) supporting students
with SEN is increasing considerably – from 3070 (3,2 per 1000 students) in 2017/2018 school year
to 4920 (5,3 per 1000 students) in 2018/2019 school year. However, there is not enough evidence
to establish the role of UNICEF-supported modelling initiatives in this capacity improvement. The
formative evaluation of “Together from kindergarten” initiative from 2018 provides little evidence
of specific impact of this modelling initiative at regional level and even on local level. It has
established that although the core component of the project was the recruitment of specialist staff,
the impact on improving the overall availability of specialists to provide quality service is not
sustainable it is unlikely that most of the kindergartens will be able to retain specialist staff on the
payroll.
Available reports, including the evaluation report do not provide clear evidence for improved overall
quality of the educational services provided, although there are clear indications that some elements
directly related to quality of education are impacted, among which:
- increased understanding of disability and learning difficulties;
- increased understanding of the role of various stakeholders in inclusive education, including
the role of specialists, teacher assistants and how to work with them;
- improved teacher competence;
- improved teacher mindsets;
- improved equipment and availability of learning materials;
- more inclusive classroom practices;
- positive parental involvement and support.
UNICEF also commissioned an evaluation of the quality of the learning environment in kindergartens
based on direct expert observation in 40 selected kindergartens from four regions (Montana,
Shumen, Sliven, and Sofia) that had been supported under the "Together from the kindergarten"
project. The study provided mixed results, including indications for existing deficiencies in the
instructional approaches used and the individualization of learning opportunities. However, due to
the small sample size, missing control group, inconclusive results and lack of potential to
demonstrate changes in the quality of the environment that could be attributed to the modelling
intervention, this study was not considered as evidence for the purpose of this evaluation.
Also, available data provide indication for improved capacity of pilot kindergartens to early detect
children with SEN and to deliver early intervention.
The interviews held provide enough evidence that the contribution of UNICEF-supported modelling
initiatives for (i) the provision of pedagogical specialists and/or for improving their qualification, (ii)
140
the improvement of facilities and equipment; (iii) the introduction of high-tech assistive technologies
that improve communication with children with severe disabilities is well acknowledged.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity-0.75. The available evidence, including the modelling evaluation report, allow claiming
with confidence that modelling services created conditions for improved educational services in the
institutions involved. However, although UNICEF commissioned a survey on the quality of the
learning environment in 40 selected kindergartens, there are no measurable indicators for the
quality of the educational services per se. Also, there are concerns over the sustainability of the results
after the end of the modelling interventions.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability– 0.4. There is sufficient ground to claim that we could be more confident
than not that the evidence described above could not be observed if the claim is false and the
respective institutions have not been included in the modelling interventions. However, having the
increasing variety of funding opportunities provided by the national programs for development of
education and The EU funded Operational Program „Science and Education for Smart Growth“, it is
not very clear whether these institutions would achieve similar improvement if they were eligible
and received such funding (receiving UNICEF funding makes them ineligible due to the applicable
demarcation rules). One of the major beneficial effect from the modelling initiatives envisaged by the
evaluation report and interviews is the training provided to teachers, but data shows that there are
significant number of available trainings in similar topics, accredited at MoES and also significant
eligible funding for trainings provided by the National Program “Qualification” and the OPSESG
project “Qualification of Pedagogical Specialists”. Additionally, significant public investments have
been made in providing accessible physical environment in schools.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the level of likelihood that the evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.75) and
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.4), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.652) the probability of the
hypothesis of “Improved educational services in the schools that were included in modelling initiatives”,
being true given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.652
Claim 6: An increase of 10 % of positive attitudes towards including children with disabilities in
mainstream education among teachers from the pilot kindergartens
a) Evidence
There is clearly documented evidence, based on well-designed national representative survey among
3,000 kindergarten teachers, confirming an increase with 10 % of positive attitudes towards
141
including children with disabilities in mainstream education among teachers from the pilot
kindergartens compared to 3% decrease in positive attitudes among teachers from non-pilot
kindergartens120.
The available data also shows (i) increased understanding of disability and learning difficulties
among teachers from pilot kindergartens; (ii) increased knowledge of the legislation and
understanding of inclusive education related procedures, including the procedures for the provision
of general and additional support; for screening and for assessment process; (iii) increased
understanding of the role of various stakeholders in inclusive education, including the role of
specialists, teacher assistants and how to work with them; and (iv) an increased understanding of
when and how to refer children to community-based services.
At the same time, the feedback provided during the conducted interviews indicates that the
attitudinal changes are highly dependent on the age of teachers and their experience in working with
children win disabilities. There are concerns that the more the teachers gain knowledge and
experience in working with such children, the more skeptical they become regarding the potential
for their successful inclusion in the mainstream educational settings.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0,9.
There is clear evidence that there is indeed an increase of 10 % of positive attitudes towards
including children with disabilities in mainstream education among teachers from the pilot
kindergartens compared to worsening attitudes in the control group. This provide reasonable ground
to support the hypothesis that modelling interventions contribute to positive attitudinal change
among teachers. However, as the exact causal mechanisms explaining this change are not well
established, additional investigations could further increase the level of confidence.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.1
There is little ground to claim that the above mentioned improving attitudinal characteristics of the
teachers from pilot kindergartens would be observed without UNICEF-supported modelling
interventions, given the worsening attitudes among the control group (teachers from kindergartens
that were not included in these interventions).
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the level of likelihood that the evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.1), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to highly confident (0.9) the probability of the hypothesis of
“An increase of 10 % of positive attitudes towards including children with disabilities in mainstream
education among teachers from the pilot kindergartens”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 7: An increase of enrolment and inclusion of children with disabilities in pre-school and school
education
a) Evidence
Statistical data confirms that there is gradual increase of the share of children and students with
special educational needs for the period 2017-2020, with the most significant growth witnessed in
preschool education. More specifically, while in 2017/2018 school year the children with SEN
represented 1.7% of all children enrolled in kindergartens, this share increased to 2.3% in
2019/2020 school year121. For the same period, the share of students with SEN enrolled in
mainstream schools increased from 2.2% of all students to 2.6% of all students. It should be noted
that there is still no data about the impact of remote learning due to Covid-19 crisis on the enrolment
and inclusion of children with disabilities.
At the same time, there is no available data to establish what the exact percentage of children with
disabilities is. The feedback provided during the conducted interviews suggests that due to higher
per-student cost standard paid for students with SEN, there are some pervasive incentives for certain
schools to diagnose neglected marginalized children and students as children/students with SEN.
Also, existing reports provides indications that the actual numbers of students with SEN receiving
proper inclusive education may be lower as there are practices in some of the mainstream schools to
place students with SEN segregated classrooms122. Existence of such practices has been confirmed
with the interviews. Existing evidence does not allow to establish the magnitude of these practices
and the number of children with SEN separated in segregated classrooms.
Available data and reports do not provide enough evidence to establish a causal inference regarding
the impact of the above established UNICEF activities on the enrolment rates of children with
disabilities in mainstream kindergartens and schools.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0,6.
Existing data, although generally confirming the claim do not provide a reasonable ground for
assigning a higher level of certainty. Although there is evidence for increasing enrollment of children
and students with SEN in the mainstream kindergartens and schools, there is no conclusive evidence
about the actual dynamics in enrollment of children with disabilities. Moreover, there are indications
for de facto segregation of part of those children is some of the schools. This means that the
evaluation team could be only more confident than not that there is an increase of enrolment and
inclusion of children with disabilities in pre-school and school education.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?

143
Type I error probability – 0.45
As there is lack of evidence providing ground for establishing causal inference between UNICEF
interventions and the enrollment of children with disabilities, there is some ground to claim that the
registered growth in enrollment of children with SEN could be observed without UNICEF
interventions, especially in the light of variety of interventions/national programs providing support
to inclusive education.
e) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the level of likelihood that the evidence being present if the hypothesis is true (0.6) and
probability of seeing this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.45), the account evidence of
the documents and interviews increases to more confident than not (0.571) the probability of the
hypothesis of “An increase of enrolment and inclusion of children with disabilities in pre-school and
school education”, being true given the evidence.
Claim 7 Evidence – Account and trail
Prior probability of the claim being true 0.5
Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence? 0.6
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.45
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.571
Conclusion
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest
link” (or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 7 (referring to the overall
impact of UNICEF’s contribution in the field of inclusive education) with a posterior of 0.5714. This
means that we can only be more confident than not that UNICEF Bulgaria contributed to the
overall improvement of the inclusion of children with disabilities in the mainstream
kindergartens and schools. The analysis provide clear evidence that UNICEF undertook and
supported a large number of initiatives in the field of inclusive education and we are highly confident
that these activities have short term results for the directly targeted institutions and professionals,
contributing to (i) improved competencies and positive attitudes of teachers and other supported
specialists to work with children with disabilities and (ii) increased institutional capacity to offer
better educational service and additional support to children with disabilities. Evidence also shows
that UNICEF provided valuable assistance for strengthening the capacities for application of
functional assessment of disability in the education system.

Case study 3: Assessment of UNICEF Bulgaria contribution in the area of protection
from violence against children (VaC)
The analysis in this section uses Process Tracing to measure UNICEF Bulgaria’s contribution in a
selected area of impact, namely violence against children and thus, the improvement registered in
the area. As underlined in the section dedicated to the methodology, we present the change claim
chain, as elaborated in the Inception Phase of the evaluation and immediately after. We than present
and analyse each claim in the logical chain and assess the level of confidence for each claim and
globally.
Based on the initial research, the evaluation team formulated the following change claim chain:
Through (1) models tested and scaled up, (2) contributions to national and local policies
strengthening with regards to prevention and protection against violence, as well as to (3) plans and
proposals for increased funding to be allocated for violence prevention and response programmes
and services, (4) to a strengthened capacity, co-ordination and synergies between UN partners,
Academia and CSOs with regards to VaC agenda and (5) to building and disseminating evidence-base,
(6) a large number of children and parents benefited from integrated services for prevention
and response to violence against children, (7) cross-sector coordination for child protection
from violence has been improved and (8) overall the access to justice for children has been
improved in Bulgaria.
A visual presentation of the theory of change based on the change claim chain for the case study is
presented below.

The analysis of each claim and the general conclusions are presented in the following sections.
Claim 1: UNICEF has contributed to models testing and scaling them up
a) Evidence
The finding of the analysis presented below are based on the evidences collected from the following
documents Country Office Annual Reports, RAM outputs and outcomes reports, A Situation Analysis of
Children Rights in Bulgaria, 2021, the Evaluation of Child Advocacy Centers and from interviews conducted
with representatives of UNICEF, Ministry of Justice and implementing partners.
UNICEF have initiated the Child Advocacy Centers project as a framework of intersectoral services (crisis
interventions, therapeutic and legal support, medical and forensic expertise) provided in support of
children victims of violence and their families. The collected evidence shows that, in Bulgaria, UNICEF, along
with its partners in the project, ANIMUS and SAPI, are the only providers of this type of services and that
the model has been effective and its scaling up is at most importance for the improvement of services
provided by the government in the area of VaC. Moreover, the evaluation of CAC model implemented in
Bulgaria showed that the intervention “unique in delivery of integrated and specialized services to child
victims of violence and crimes, and their families”123. Each CAC has a Blue Room which police and justice
officials can use to interview children in a child friendly environment with the support of a psychologist
and/or social worker from the CAC. Another important component of the CAC model is that they provide
child victims and their families with free legal services. The implementation of the model in Bulgaria has
been based on the previous experience of other countries with similar interventions and was developed
taking into consideration the good practices established in Canada and Iceland. The effectiveness of the
model has been assessed first in 2016 and second in 2020 through two evaluation reports. The CACs project
have supported 538 children (female: 318 and male 220) and 413 parents (female: 323, male: 90) with
integrated services related to prevention and response to VaC up to year 2020124.
The evidence collected show that the contribution of UNICEF in the coordination, implementation and
funding of the model is vital for its sustainability in the given situation. The lack of public funding allocated
for this type of integrated services provided for children, the lack of administrative capacity and specialized
human resources within public providers will lead to a decrease in the access of children victims of violence
to integrated, quality services if the CAC model will be stopped.
According to the consulted documents, the specialized integrated VaC services provided through the Child
Advocacy Centers are “considered as a key intervention for innovation and scale-up”125. Moreover, they
were essential in the response of UNICEF to the COVID19 crisis due to the fact that they were among few
services which continued to function after the pandemic begun. The work developed by the centers has
been conducted both face to face and online and the projecs has provided, since the beginning of the
pandemic 1428 MHPSS consultations to 687 children and 741 parents.
The evidence collected show that UNICEF has also tested models in the area of prevention of violence
against children. UNICEF together with the MoES selected five pilot schools for the implementation of
whole-school approach for prevention of violence. The model provides “introductory trainings for the
school mentors, leadership training for the management staff and training of trainers by an international
consultant to conduct students` workshops on social emotional learning and violence prevention”126. In this
case, according to the representatives of the UNICEF CO, based on the lessons learned through the
123 Evaluation of Child Advocacy Centres, 2020, p. 4
124 UNICEF, RAM 2020, p. 24
125 UNICEF, RAM 2020, p. 25

147
implementation of the CACs model, UNICEF has changed the strategy regarding the implementation and
ensuring the sustainability of the model. In this regard, the main implementing partner is the Ministry of
Education, who is also the authority that is going to scale up the model. Nevertheless, the model has not
been yet scaled up.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.6 The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF contributed to
testing models of interventions in the area of prevention of violence against children and also support for
children victims of violence and their families. Nevertheless, the evidence supports the fact that the models
addressed within this claim are not yet scaled up, even though the UNICEF, along with its partners, have
made efforts in this direction through advocacy activities, evidence providing through models testing.
Moreover, the importance of scaling up the model of Child Advocacy Centers have been recognized by all
stakeholders that were interviewed, the model promoted through the project has been legitimized through
the Social Service Act which promotes an intersectoral approach regarding the support provided to children
victims of violence. Last but not least, UNICEF has made efforts to ensure the sustainability of the model
through alternative funding as European funds and EEA and Norway funds.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.3. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false, although
the existing evidence shows that even if the models have been tested the scaling up is not done yet. The evidence
on testing of the addressed models, creating a model of intersectoral cooperation for service providers in
the area of violence against children, providing evidence on the effectiveness of the models could not have
been collected if the claim was false. All relevant consulted documents record the contribution of UNICEF
in this area. Nevertheless, because the scaling up has not been done yet, the analysis through the evidence
collected could only demonstrate that UNICEF have made an important progress in this process.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.6) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to cautiously confident (0.6667) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF contributed
to testing models and scaling up in the area of violence against children”, being true given the evidence.

Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence? 0.30
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6667
Claim 2: UNICEF has contributed to national and local policies strengthening with regards to prevention and
protection against violence
a) Evidence
The analysis of the level of confidence regarding the second claim in the result claim chain is based on the
evidence collected from the UNICEF’s country annual reports, RAM output and outcome reports, Evaluation
of Child Advocacy Centers, the National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for
2020, A Situation Analysis of Children Rights in Bulgaria, 2021 and on the evidence collected through
interviews conducted with representatives of UNICEF, Ministry of Justice and service providers or
implementing partners such as: ANIMUS, OSI and SAPI.
148
The provided documents show that UNICEF has supported with technical input, through advocacy activities
and evidence generating through modeling testing, the development of the following legislative acts that
address, among other, VaC:
- Social Service Act (SSA);
- National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020;
- National Strategy for promoting equality between women and men 2021 – 2030;
The adoption of the Social Service Act, in May 2020 is a key moment in the development of the legislative
framework in Bulgaria in the area of protecting and supporting children being victims of violence or at risk
of violence. UNICEF and its implementing partners within the project Child Advocacy Centers, ANIMUS and
SAPI, have supported the government in the process of drafting the Social Service Act. The evidence
gathered from documents and interview highlight the importance of UNICEF’s work in this regard.
Moreover, the Social Services Act “weakens the mandate of SACP, and hands over licensing of social services
functions to the Agency for Quality of Social Services (AQSS) and municipalities”127. This means also that the
local policy has been influenced by the adoption of SSA, which has been supported by UNICEF. Moreover,
the SSA changes the way in which the social services are provided, putting more emphasis on the
individualized and customized services and support for children. Also, the new legislative document,
introduces the concept of an integrated approach and thus, facilitates “multiagency coordination and team
work”128.
The National programme for prevention and protection of domestic violence for 2020, has been based,
among others, on the experience and results of UNICEF modeling work (e.g. Child Advocacy Centers and
Steps together whole school programme)129. UNICEF contributed to the strategy by provident concrete
input for the text of the document, mostly around the CACs testing experience.
The available documents show evidence of the support provided by UNICEF to the development of the
National Strategy for Promoting Equality between Women and Men for the period 2021-2030. UNICEF has
contributed to the strategy with specialized input that resulted in adding new measures related to
strengthening the capacity for prevention and response to violence and victims support and the proposed
indicators to monitor key activities130. UNICEF has contributed to priority area IV. Fight with violence,
protection and support to victims.
Moreover, the data provide by UNICEF representatives show that their recommendation submitted to the
Human Rights Council of UN in respect to access to justice for children have been included in the UPR
recommendations to Bulgaria131.
According to the Ministry of Justice, UNICEF’s contribution to the strengthening of the national and local
policy in the area of prevention of violence against children and support for children, victims or at risk of
being victims of violence, has been of outmost importance, consisting in:
- Participation in projects for legislative changes related to child protection and access to justice, in
accordance with international and European standards;
- Introduction of adapted and child-friendly procedures and appropriate environment for interrogation
of child victims and witnesses of violence and crimes, which ensures the achievement of the objectives
of the investigation while not leading to adverse consequences for the psychological recovery of
children;

- Introduction of adapted procedures that guarantee the right of every child to be heard in all procedures
that affect his or her life and well-being - criminal, civil and administrative;
- Participation in the creation of a policy that ensures that children have access to free quality legal aid
provided by the state;
- Participation in the creation of a policy aimed at strengthening the capacity of professionals by
introducing specialization for police officers, prosecutors, lawyers and judges who work with children.
The evidence collected show that UNICEF has also provided technical support and advocate for the
development, revision or adoption of the following legislative and policy documents: National Strategy for
the Child 2019 – 2030, the development of 2019-2020 Action plan for the implementation of the National
strategy for prevention of violence against children and abuse, for the finalization of the draft legislation
concerning children in conflict with law - Educational Measures Act. Nevertheless, due to the political crises,
from the past couple of years, related to the anti-human and anti-child rights movements in Bulgaria, these
documents have not been adopted yet.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.90. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF contributed to
national and local policy strengthening in the area of violence against children. Its work in this regard
was mainly centered on advocacy activities, technical support throughout the development of
legislative/policy documents and through models testing which led, on one hand to the inclusion of several
practices in the local services framework and on the other, based on the evidence produced led to the
adjustment of policy documents (e.g. Social Service Act). However, it is important to mention that at local
level, the UNICEF work had a visible influence supported by evidence mainly in the area where the Child
Advocacy Centers model is implemented, namely, Montana, Shumen and Sofia.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.3. It is rather unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
Not only the UNICEF reports and representatives provide evidence on the contribution of UNICEF, but also
the representatives of the Ministry of Justice from Bulgaria and the representatives of associations and
institutes, partners in UNICEF modelling projects, consider that through its efforts UNICEF have contributed
to the national policy framework in the area of VaC. Moreover, some national policy documents include
referrals to UNICEF’s work, which strengthens again the level of confidence of the evaluation team on the
collected evidence. Each action developed by UNICEF and mentioned above is recognized by stakeholders
as contributing, mainly, to national policy.
Nevertheless, it is important to stress out that the associations and institutes that have been interviewed
have been working with UNICEF for a long time and are partners in the Child Advocacy Centres project, the
main UNICEF modelling work in the area of VaC. Due to their partnership in the projects and activities
related to support for children, victims of violence and their families, they may be biased.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.75) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF contributing to national and
local policies strengthening with regards to prevention and protection against violence”, being true
given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.75
Claim 3: UNICEF has contributed to plans and proposals for increased funding to be allocated for violence
prevention and response programmes and services
a) Evidence
The collected evidence has showed specific examples where UNICEF has contributed to the increase of
funding allocated for violence prevention and response programmes. Through the work done by UNICEF in
2020, including multi-sectoral programmes, evidence based for prevention and also for children victim of
violence and advocacy, 900,000 USD were leveraged from external sources132.
Furthermore, the new adopted Social Service Act, for which UNICEF has provided technical support,
strengthens the regulations on funding in the area of social services in Bulgaria. Even though the effects of
the new legislation are not observable yet, the new framework of integrated services in the area of child
protection should be supported by increased funding. Nevertheless, the data collected through the
interviews show that the opinions are mixed on the real effects that this new act due to the uncertainty
regarding the funds that will be available for its implementation.
The efforts done by UNICEF in regards with the scaling up or ensure the sustainability of the CACs model,
in the absence a firm commitment from the government’s side, have also led to leverage of funding for child
protection. The Draft Operational Programme of Human Resources has integrated the CACs model and
allocated the necessary funding for its implementation. This step done forwards by UNICEF is essential for
the maintained and also extension to other regions the model of integrated services for children victim of
violence and also violence prevention. Nevertheless, the programme has not been adopted yet, therefore,
the actual level of funding allocated for the child protection area may be adjusted by its final version.
Moreover, UNICEF has provided technical support for the development of the Action Plan for the
implementation of the National Strategy for Reduction of Poverty and promoting social inclusion 2030,
which includes the necessary funding for the proper implementation of the strategy.
According to the data collected through interviews, the participation of UNICEF to the development of the
two aforementioned documents was an opportunity to place children in the center of the social protection
system and leverage resource for the improvement of the child protection system.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.90. The evidence allows the evaluators to be confident that UNICEF contributed to plans
and proposals for increased funding to be allocated for violence prevention and response
programmes and services. The UNICEF’s technical support provided to the development of strategic
documents, based on the evidence produced through studies and model testing have contributed to the
provision of increased funding in the area child protection. Moreover, it is important to mention that the
operations of the aforementioned will provide evidence on the extent to which the funding has been
increased. At this moment there were no evidence available on this issue.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
132 UNICEF, RAM report 2020, p. 25
151
Type I error probability: 0.25. It is rather unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
The evidence collected on the contribution/technical support for the development of the strategy and
programmes are provided mainly by UNICEF reports and representatives.
e) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.9) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.3), the account evidence of the documents and interviews
increases to confident (0.7826) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF contributed to plans and
proposals for increased funding to be allocated for violence prevention and response programmes and
services.”, being true given the evidence.

Claim 4: UNICEF has contributed to a strengthened capacity, co-ordination and synergies between UN
partners, Academia and CSOs with regards to VaC agenda
a) Evidence
The evidence collected through documents and interviews with stakeholders show that the work developed
by UNICEF in the area of VaC has facilitated the cooperation of different actors relevant for preventing
violence against children and supporting through specialized services victims of violence. Through the
model Child Advocacy Centers, UNICEF has developed a successful collaboration framework among public
service providers, local municipalities and NGOs. According to the evaluation of the project, the model has
been able to improve the “improve cooperation and coordination across sectors and professionals (e.g.,
teachers, social workers, police officers, prosecutors and judges) in keeping with the best interests of
children victims of violence”133. Moreover, the evaluation states that the cooperation between the 3
municipalities selected for the piloting, the service providers, social workers, police and prosecutors is of
utmost importance for the successful implementation of the model. It is important to mention here that the
project has also facilitation cooperation among stakeholders at national level, such as State Agency for Child
Protection and the Social Assistance Agency.
UNICEF has contributed to the development of the following activities in area of VaC that have facilitated
the collaborations between various stakeholders in the area – public authorities (national and local),
international organizations, universities:
• the organization of the INSPIRE conference in 2019;
• the realization of VaC national study;
• the implementation of CACs model;
• the organization of training programmes developed and supported including through Bodrozzi EU
project implemented by SAPI and Animus, active participation in meetings and strategic events, co-
ordination and support including capacity building for the VaC Alliance (ToT on Inspire Strategies
in 2019, translation and promotion of INSPIRE, etc.);
• Learning Action Partnership and the KHC for Alternative Care at New Bulgarian;
133 Evaluation of Child Advocacy Centers, p. 70.
152
• Universty as well as WHO, UNHCR and IoM with regards to violence against children and women
including GBV prevention and protection.
Moreover, the NGOs that have been interviewed consider that in general UNICEF has been not only the
facilitator in the collaboration among them through their actions and projects, but also a facilitator in
regards to the communication between CSOs and the government, being very stable partners and also
having a long-term collaboration with ministries, relevant national agencies, but also with the
municipalities where they implement the modeling projects. The perspectives of the interviewees converge
to the idea that the support provided by UNICEF to the CSOs legitimates their actions. Also, the data
collected from interviews also show that UNICEF has been a liaison between administration within the
projects supported by them, such as Chils Advocacy Centers.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.95. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF has contributed
to a strengthened capacity, co-ordination and synergies between UN partners, Academia and CSOs
with regards to VaC agenda. All data collected from documents and interviews with key stakeholders
show that UNICEF has act as collaboration and communication facilitator among CSOs, academia and public
authorities in the area of Violence against Children.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability: 0.05. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.95) the probability of the hypothesis that “UNICEF
contributed to a strengthened capacity, co-ordination and synergies between UN partners, Academia
and CSOs with regards to VaC agenda”, being true given the evidence.

The evidence collected from documents and interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the area of VaC
show that UNICEF has contributed significantly to building and disseminating evidence-base. On one hand,
UNICEF has developed or support the development of studies related to the system of child protection in
Bulgaria, further it has analysed and provided evidence on the further need of the improvement of the
monitoring system. On the other hand, UNICEF, through technical support provided to key public actors in
the area, has contributed to the development of a monitoring framework and its operationalization, as
presented further in this section.
The most relevant national studies in the area of child protection, that have been developed with the
support of UNICEF, are:
153
• The Analysis of the child protection (CP) system, developed by the Ministry of Labour and Social
Policy with the support of UNICEF CO;
• The National Study on Violence against Children, developed by UNICEF.
According to the evidence collected from documents and also through interviews, UNICEF has also
supported the The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy to finalize the Analysis of the child protection (CP)
system. The analysis has examined the level of the effectiveness of the protection and support provide to
children at risk by public bodies. The study also addressed the manner in which the system is able to
responds to the individual needs134. The study includes also a section related to the monitoring system in
Bulgaria and recommendations on its improvement. The study emphasizes that that the available statistics
are fragmented between the schools, the Agency for Social Assistance, the child protection departments at
the State Agency for Child Protection, the Ministry of Interior, the Prosecutor's Office and medical
institutions. According to the data collected through interviews the study provides essential evidence and
guidelines for the improvement of the monitoring system.
Furthermore, UNICEF has conducted the following analysis which provides through evidence on the
situation of child rights realization in Bulgaria, that cover the VaC area:
- Situation Analysis on children and women in Bulgaria, 2017;
- A Situation Analysis of the child rights in Bulgaria, 2020;
- Evaluation of Child Advocay Centres, 2020.
The Situation Analysis from 2020 emphasize that “violence against children is on of the areas that need
additional monitoring, evidence based and analysis”135. Furthermore, the models testing work of UNICEF,
has also provided evidence on the effectiveness of certain types of services provided through its actions.
For example, the evaluations that have been done for the model of Child Advocacy Centres have gathered
evidence on the effectiveness of the model, its efficiency, sustainability, bottlenecks encountered and based
on these, provided relevant recommendation for its further implementation and scaling up. The data
provided through the evaluation has also been used as evidence based in the process of developing the text
of the Social Service Act. The evaluation of the model states that “CACs demonstrated to local municipalities
and other professionals how they can deal with cases of VAC and support child victims and their families in
a coordinated manner with a focus on the best interests of the child”136.
UNICEF has provided technical support to the Ministry of Interior for the development of the Automated
Informational System for the Prevention of Child Crime and Protection of Children. The new system put in
place in Bulgaria has been presented at the TransMonEE Network Meeting of National Statistical Offices in
Europe and Central Asia, Austria, in 2019, as a promising example of a national monitoring system of
children at risk and children victim of crime137.
UNICEF has done an extensive set of analysis on the effects on the pandemic on children well-being. This
has also covered the area of violence against children and the stringent needs of children when speaking
about violence prevention and support for abused children. The following studies developed by UNICEF or
with the support of UNICEF provide evidence on the impact of COVID19 pandemic on children, assessing
also the its effects on the violence against children phenomenon, online bullying and gender-based violence:
• Representative survey on needs and vulnerabilities among families and the impact of COVID-19
• High-Frequency Monitoring Survey on the socio-impact of COVID-19 on households (with WB)

UNICEF CO Bulgaria has tart in 2019 to work together with the WHO Regional Office for Europe, WHO CO
of Bulgaria, NCPHA and the Ministry of Health on the development of a community survey of the prevalence
of adverse childhood experiences in Bulgaria. The survey aims at collecting data that can allow the
development of a profile of “adverse childhood experiences by socioeconomic, demographic and other
variables as well as the impact on risk behaviors and other health outcomes”138.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity – 0,95. The evidence allows the evaluators to be highly confident that UNICEF contributed to
building and disseminating evidence-base. Based on the data collected from both documents and
interviews with key stakeholders, the evidence show that UNICEF has contributed to a great extent to
evidence generating, through its studies and models testing and also through its technical support provided
to key actors for the development of legislative frameworks regarding monitoring system in the area of
child protection and also technical support for the development of the database used by the Ministry of
Justice from Bulgaria.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error – 0,05. It is very unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false. The existing
evidence related to studies conducted by UNICEF, support provide to the Ministry of Justice for the
development of the monitoring platform, support provide to the Ministry of Labour for developing the SSA
would not have been present if the hypothesis was false.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.95) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.05), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to highly confident (0.95) the probability of the hypothesis of “UNICEF
contributed to building and disseminating evidence-base”, being true given the evidence. It is true that
this is at the foundation of UNICEF’s works and that all activities developed/conducted are based on
evidences (already existing or new evidences generated through UNICEF’s efforts).

Claim 6: A large number of children and parents benefited from integrated services for prevention and
response to violence against children
a) Evidence
138 Technical meeting to conduct a community survey of the prevalence of adverse childhood experience in Bulgaria, Sofia,
November 2019
155
According to the evidence collected from documents and also from the interviews conducted with the key
stakeholders, that a large number of children and parents have benefited from integrated services for
prevention and response to violence against children, mainly through the services provided by the CACs,
children and parents that otherwise would not have access to this type of specialized multi sectoral support.
In terms of data collected regarding the number of children and families that have benefited from integrated
services for prevention and response to violence, UNICEF reports show that by the end of the year 2019,
more than 7500 children that were victims of violence, witnesses of violence, children in conflict with the
law, children that were participants in administrative and civil proceedings or separated children benefited
from the integrated services provided by the 3 Child Advocacy Centers139. Moreover, in the area of gender-
based violence, through the efforts made by UNICEF, during year 2020, 1337 persons have been reached
through support services and prevention actions, which consisted in case management, social evaluations
and plans of action140. UNICEF has also supported vulnerable mothers and child survivors of gender-based
violence through mother and baby unit and crisis center’ support. Nevertheless, their number (30 mothers
and 28 children) is very low compared to the existing needs at national level in this area. Further, more
than 1428 children and parents have benefited of Mental Health and Psychological Support (MHPSS)
Services provided by CACs during COVID 19 pandemic141.
Moreover, it important to mention that the model implemented by UNICEF has led to an increase in the
demand of integrated services142. According to the evaluation of the model, the national and local key
stakeholders consider that the closing of the centers, in the situation where there are going to be undertaken
by the public bodies, “would be deprive children and their families of much needed quality psychosocial
and legal services”143. UNICEF has also conducted activities in the area of education that addressed
prevention of violence in schools and prevention bullying and cyberbullying.
Regarding the number of children victims of violence or at risk of becoming victims of violence, the Situation
Analysis from 2020 has showed that there can be observe an increase of 30% between 2013 and 2019 of
the cases that were provided with cross-sectoral support144. The analysis shows that in 2017 there were
928 of cases of children being victims of violence or being at risk for which the Coordination Mechanism
stipulation in the Child Protection Act has been activated, where as in number of similar cases in 2019
increased to 1181.
The National Network for Children, in the report card of 2019, emphasize that there were no unified
statistical data that could provide an over all image of the effectiveness of child protection system. This
situation is still lagging, even if there has been made good progress in developing a legal framework
regarding cross-coordination mechanism for support of child victims and children being at risk.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.80. The evidence allows the evaluators to be confident that a large number of children and
parents benefited from integrated services for prevention and response to violence against
children. Even if there is a lack of available administrative data at national level on children benefiting from
integrated services, the evidence regarding the reach of UNICEF’s activities in this regard, show that a large
number of children had benefited from integrated services and support (in the areas of mental health,
psychology, justice) that were provided through CACs, the model being unique in Bulgaria. Therefore, they
could not have been benefited for this kind of support from other sources.

c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error – 0.3. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false. The existing evidence
related to the reach of child victims of violence, children at risk and their families through integrated
services is sufficient to claim in a confident manner that the hypothesis is true. Nevertheless, the reach of
UNICEF actions remains isolated to the regions where the activities have been implemented and the
judgment on the level of truth is based manly on UNICEF’s reports and the perspective of stakeholders on
UNICEF activities results.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.85) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.30), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.7391) the probability of the hypothesis “A large number of
children and parents benefited from integrated services for prevention and response to violence
against children”, being true given the evidence.

Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.7391
Claim 7: Cross-sector coordination for child protection from violence has been improved
a) Evidence
The evidence collected from relevant documents such as: A Situation Analysis of Child Rights in Bulgaria,
the evaluation of Child Advocacy Centers 2021, the CO annual reports and through the interviews conducted
with stakeholders show inconsistent evidences regarding the improvements established in cross-sector
coordination in VaC area in Bulgaria.
Most of the consulted documents emphasize that the child protection system which covers also the violence
against children area. In this respect, the Situation Analysis from 2021 states that the sector of child
protection presents “underdeveloped mechanisms for timely identification and multi-sectoral responses
supporting children in need of protection”145. Moreover, the need of further development in the area of child
protect in respect to the cross-sectoral coordination in Bulgaria has been emphasized also in the Analysis
of the Child Protection System in Bulgaria from 2019. The report states that Bulgaria “lacks in clarity as to
the multi-sectoral nature of the child protection system and its main components, functions and
approaches”146. Moreover, the interviewees also support the idea that the responsibilities in this sector are
dissipated among a lot of actors and there is a lack of coordination which affects the quality of services
provide for children.
Nevertheless, the Situation Analysis conducted by UNICEF in 2020, shows that in the period of 2013 – 2019,
the use of the Coordination Mechanism for cross-sectoral support provided to child victims of violence or
children being at risk has increased with 33 percent147. Further, the analysis emphasizes that Coordination
Mechanism in the Case of Violence, established through the Child Protection Act requires urgent advances

147 Analysis of the Child Protection System in Bulgaria, UNICEF, 2019, p. 122
157
in its implementation. Moreover, the analysis provides evidence on the fact that “social services, health,
education and civil society partners are increasingly involved at key stages of the juvenile justice
process”148. Nevertheless, there is still a stringent need in the formalization of the cross-sector collaboration
of key actors in area VaC.
It is utmost importance to mention that the adoption of the Social Service Act strengthens the coordination
mechanism between duty bearers in the area of child protection, mechanism that has not been formalize
before. The analysis and studies that were consulted by the evaluation team do not cover these systemic
changes due to the recent adoption of the document. But the data collected from interviews emphasize the
importance of the new social services law in regards to the cross-sectoral coordination and integrated
service provision, UNICEF being part of this mechanism. The law is considered a great opportunity in this
regard. The services provided through the Child Advocacy Centers are integrated in the local map of services
and are licensed. Nevertheless, its effects, which are based on the operationalization of the law, could not
be observed or measured at the time when the analysis has been developed. In this regard, the collected
evidence shows also that, to a certain extent, the SCOs are cautiously appreciative when speaking about the
possible effects of the law, mainly due to the uncertainty regarding the available funding for the
implementation of the new framework.
On the other hand, the evidence collected through documents and interviews with stakeholders show that
the work developed by UNICEF in the area of VaC has facilitated the cooperation of different actors relevant
for preventing violence against children and supporting through specialized services victims of violence.
Through the model Child Advocacy Centers, UNICEF has developed a successful collaboration framework
among public service providers, local municipalities and NGOs. According to the evaluation of the project,
the model has been able to improve the “improve cooperation and coordination across sectors and
professionals (e.g., teachers, social workers, police officers, prosecutors and judges) in keeping with the best
interests of children victims of violence”149. Moreover, the evaluation states that the cooperation between
the 3 municipalities selected for the piloting, the service providers, social workers, police and prosecutors
is was of utmost importance for the successful implementation of the model. It is important to mention here
that the project has also facilitation cooperation among stakeholders at national level, such as State Agency
for Child Protection and the Social Assistance Agency. Furthermore, as the evaluation of CACs shows, even
if UNICEF has facilitated the coordination of several relevant actors throughout the implementation of the
model, the it does not have the power to develop a formalized inter-sectoral coordination framework,
therefore “CACs lack the power needed to coordinate inter-agency responses to support children and
families”150.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.70. The evidence allows the evaluators to be cautiously confident that the cross-sectoral
coordination for child protection in Bulgaria has been improved. The activities developed by UNICEF in
this area, especially the model CACs, show its important effects regarding the increase in stakeholders’
cooperation and cross-sectoral coordination (health, social, judicial services). Nevertheless, their effects
remain isolated at the level of regions selected for piloting. All consulted documents, analysis and studies
on the child protection section in Bulgaria shows that the system is still fragmented and that there is a
stringent need for more coordination among key service providers. Moreover, the adoption of the new
Social Service Act provides great opportunity for the improvement of the cross-sectoral coordination
among service providers in the area of child protection, but their effects are not yet observable.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?

158
Type I error probability: 0.40. Taking into consideration that the collected evidence do not show a certain
improvement of the cross-sectoral national coordination in the area of VaC, but rather an improvement at
the level of the 3 regions addressed by CACs model, which is confirmed to a large extent by the stakeholders
that have been interviewed, more evidence regarding the existing changes within the national system are
needed in order to consider the hypothesis as being true.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.70) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.40), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to cautiously confident (0.6364) the probability of the hypothesis that “cross-
sector coordination for child protection from violence has been improved”, being true given the evidence.

this evidence?
Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see 0.40
the evidence?
Posterior probability of the claim being true 0.6364
Claim 8: Overall the access to justice for children has been improved in Bulgaria
a) Evidence
The evidence collected from documents and interviews that were conducted with stakeholders show that
even if the evolution in the area has not been substantial, the access to justice has been increased in Bulgaria
and UNICEF has had an important role in the process. Nevertheless, all consulted studies/analysis on the
current situation of child protection system show that there a lot of improvement that have to be expedited,
including in the area of access to justice.
The Situation Analysis from 2021 emphasize that the progress made in the period 2018 – 2021 in the area
of access to justice in Bulgaria has been slow.151. The analysis also emphasized that in general free legal aid
for children is still difficult to access and inconsistent. The system of so-called “blue room”, initiated through
CACs model, which allows the protection of children involved in legal proceedings has improved the access
of children to child-friendly justice. The Situation Analysis conducted in 2020, showed that there are 25 blue
rooms available in Bulgaria, “but they operate without any established rules or procedure, and overall are
rarely used”152. Moreover, the system of child protection is not proactive on identifying cases of violence
against women and children or children being at risk. The service providers are not trained in this concern
and they do not have the necessary skills to identify such cases. Thus, as emphasized in the Situation
Analysis many cases of violence are not reported.
Nevertheless, the evaluation team has collected evidences on the positives effects that the CACs model have
on the access to justice for children being victims of violence or being at risk. According to the evaluation
conducted in 2020, the “CACs were able to improve access to justice because they worked with lawyers who
provided free legal services to children and their families”153. The centeres also provided other types of
services for children, such as mental health services and psychological and therapeutic services. They have
also initiated the use of “blue rooms”, which allows the protection of children during proceedings. Further,
151 UNICEF, Analysis of the Child Protection System in Bulgaria, UNICEF, 2019, p. 47
152 UNICEF, Analysis of the Child Protection System in Bulgaria, UNICEF, 2019, p. 51
153 Evaluation of Child Advocacy Centers, 2020, p. 71
159
the evaluation of CACs model emphasizes that the access to integrated services has been considered very
facile by the children and parents that have benefited from them. The perspective of the beneficiaries
towards the relevance and usefulness of the supports received from the centres is highly appreciative.
All interviewees confirm that the project has led to an increased access of child victims of violence or
children being at risk to justice and there has been an improvement in regards to child friendly justice
practices and if the centers would not function anymore, the children won’t have access to integrated
services. This perspective has also been confirmed during the data collection process conducted for the
evaluation of CACs model. Both national and local stakeholders expressed their concern regarding the
limited or blocked access of children to justice in the case centers were closing up.
It is important to mention that through the 3 centers that provide integrated services for children, the access
to justice has been improved especially to marginalized and vulnerable children (children living in poverty
or children that are part of ethnical minority groups).
Nevertheless, due to the fact that the CACs model has not been yet scaled up, its positive effects remain
isolated and are mainly observable at the level of the 3 regions included in the pilot. As showed above, at
national level the observed improvements in regards to access to justice for child victims of violence or
being at risk is poor. There are promising developments in the legislative framework, for which UNICEF
also provided support, but without their operationalization their effects are minimum.
Still, according to the data collected through interviews, UNICEF has contributed to the improvement of the
access to justice for children in Bulgaria and the main activities that were effective in this concern, besides
testing the CACs model, are the following:
• through its participation in the establishment of partnerships between central and local authorities,
civil society, media, court and prosecutor's office;
• by changing attitudes towards children in conflict with the law and creating opportunities for
support, integration and positive change for young people;
• by participating in the creation of national and local policies in the protection of children and in
their implementation;
• collection and summarization of statistics and database, analyses, research in this direction;
• by participating in the introduction and provision of the so-called “blue rooms” that allow the
objectives of the investigation to be achieved.
b) Sensitivity - If the claim is true, how likely would we expect to see this evidence?
Sensitivity: 0.80. The evidence allows the evaluators to be confident that the overall the access to justice
for children has been improved in Bulgaria. Based on the presented evidence the evaluation team can
be highly confident that the access to justice has been improved to a substantial extent in the regions where
the CACs model has been implemented, but at national level the improvements, even if they exist, they are
still very poor.
c) Type I error - If the claim is false, how likely would we expect to see the evidence?
Type I error probability – 0.2. It is unlikely to see the evidence presented above if the claim is false. The
evidence regarding the effectiveness of the CACs model in regards to access to justice for child victims of
violence and at risk have been collected from documents, studies and interviews with UNICEF
representatives, government representatives and CSOs representatives.
d) Update of the prior into the posterior confidence level
Given the likelihood of seeing account evidence if the hypothesis is true (0.80) and the probability of seeing
this same evidence if that hypothesis was false (0.20), the account evidence of the documents and
interviews increases to confident (0.80) the probability of the hypothesis “overall the access to justice
160
for children has been improved in Bulgaria”, being true given the evidence. Nevertheless, it is important
to mention that, the overall improvement has not been significant and also that the observed improvement
have not been homogenous at national level.

Conclusions
According to process tracing methodology, the confidence in the overall claim is set by the “weakest link”
(or lowest posterior) in the causal chain, corresponding to claim 7 (Cross-sector coordination for child
protection from violence has been improved) with a posterior of 0.6364. This means that we can be only
cautiously confident that UNICEF contributed in a substantial manner to the number of children and
parents benefiting from integrated services in the area of VaC, to the improvement of access to
justice and to the cross-coordination for child protection from violence, in line with the change chain
presented above and with the theory of change of the area (as presented at the beginning of the annex).
Nevertheless, the analysis allows us to be highly confident about the fact that UNICEF has contributed to
the improvement of collaboration between CSOs, UN partners and Academia in the area of VaC and also,
that it had an essential contribution to the existing evidence on the situation of children from Bulgaria in
regards with the violence phenomena and on the status of the child protection system. Further, we are less
confident in the contribution of UNICEF to scaling up tested models. In this regard the evidence show that
UNICEF has made efforts in this line, but the two models addressed in the analysis are not scaled up yet.

Bulgaria
Even if the reach of UNICEF’s actions and projects in the area of child protection from violence and
prevention is rather low compared to the needs at national level, all evidences collected show that the effort
161
made by UNICEF for the improvement of the system of child protection in the area of VaC have been
essential for providing access of child victims of violence or children being at risk to integrated service and
support and to child-friendly justice. Moreover, UNICEF have conducted several studies and tested models
that have generated evidence on current situation of child protection system, including VaC and GBV and
on the effectiveness of different types of integrated services. Based on this evidence, but not only, UNCEF
has provided support for governmental bodies in the process of strengthening the strategic and legislative
framework in the area of child protection, including the inter-institutional, cross-sectoral cooperation
system for case management in the area of VaC. Furthermore, as the data collected shows, UNICEF has been
acting as a communication and cooperation facilitator between governmental actors, municipalities and
service providers, CSOs and universities.
Nevertheless, the political crisis which Bulgaria is facing, the resistance of conservative political groups, the
lack of administrative capacity, the lack of coordination among sectors and key actors in the area of child
protection, the low level of competencies and skills of human resources at the level various service
providers (in the sectors of justice, health, mental health, psychological support, therapeutical support)
dealing with cases in which children are involved and the lack of statistical/administrative data, led to a
slow development of the area at national level. The new adopted Social Services Act has brought essential
improvements in the legislative framework in area of VaC, but its operationalization still remains a
challenge. Regarding the overall progress made in the area of VaC, the scaling up of the models initiated by
UNICEF that have already proven their effectiveness is still not finalized, thus their effects remain mostly
isolated to the regions where the interventions have been piloted.
It is utmost importance to mention that within this context UNICEF has managed to make essential
contributions to the area, due to the technical support provided, the evidence generating and the provision
of a set of unique integrated services in Bulgaria. In child protection sector and most especially in VaC area
UNICEF had been recognized by all interviewed stakeholders as a key actor.

Annex 4. Results of the Social Network Analysis and stakeholder analysis
Social Network Analysis contributes to answering the evaluation question no. 9 (“To what extent did UNICEF manage to build
effective and sustainable partnerships in working towards addressing the predefines bottlenecks, advocating for evidence for
equity and contributing to the results at scale?”). Social network analysis (SNA) is a field of data analytics (a quantitative method)
that uses networks and graph theory to understand social structures. In order to build SNA graphs, two key components are
required: actors and relationships. In network analysis, actors are referred to as nodes (the dots on the graph) and relationships as
edges (the lines on the graph). Social Network Analysis is the most effective method available today for visualizing and evaluating
group connectivity. By using Network Analysis, three measures can be tracked: (1) depth of relationship and (2) frequency of
communication The Network Analysis allows the evaluation team to track and measure the connections that exist between
stakeholders and UNICEF Country Offices.
In order to apply the Social Network Analysis an online survey among all staff members of UNICEF CO has been conducted.
The data collection phase has been conducted in August 2021. Through the SNA questionnaire, the
evaluation team has collected data on main collaborations developed by UNICEF Bulgaria CO, the areas of
collaboration, type of support received or benefits, frequency of collaboration and the value of information
or other type of support received CO specialists.
By applying network analysis, the evaluation team was able to track and measure the connections that exist
between stakeholders from Bulgaria and the Country Offices and to make recommendations to strengthen
the collaboration of UNICEF with other organizations and/or institutions across the country154. Network
Analysis is the most effective method available today for visualizing and evaluating group connectivity.
Through network analysis, the evaluation team identified key stakeholders and potential connections for
the Country Offices of UNICEF155. By using Network Analysis, the evaluation teams appreciated the depth of
the relationship by looking at two dimensions156:
• Frequency of communication, which was quantified by including a 1-10 scale in the survey that
measures frequency of communication, in which 1 represents weak communication and 10
represents strong communication. The respondents were asked to appreciate the frequency of
communication by using the scale;
• Quality of support, which was quantified by including a 1-10 scale in the survey that measures the
quality of support offered by the selected stakeholders in the survey, in which 1 represents weak
support and 10 represents strong support. The respondents were asked to appreciate the quality of
support by using the scale.
Network analysis provided a tool through which UNICEF ECARO and the Country Office can increase their
collective self-awareness and ability to see the whole system. The network maps that were developed have
the following components157:
• A node is any individual or organization in the network. Nodes can take different size, proportional
to the influence of the individual or organization. In the network analysis that was conducted for
this evaluation, the nodes are the experts (officers, specialists or external consultants) that work
for or collaborate with the Country Offices of UNICEF from the Republic of Moldova, Bulgaria,
Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan and various stakeholders from the four countries that collaborate with
the Country Offices of UNICEF.
• An edge is a bond or relationship that connects two individuals or organizations. Edges can be
assigned a weight depending on the strength of the connection. For this evaluation, the weight

accorded to the edges encompass the values given by the respondents for the two scales included
in the survey: frequency of communication and quality of support. The evaluation made an
average of the values given by the respondents on the two dimensions and applied to the edges.
Besides the development of the graphs, the evaluation team applied a collection of metrics to quantify how
important and influential are nodes in the network, evaluate the size and diameter of the network and
obtain information on the length and distance of the paths between nodes in the network.
Metric Value
Average Degree Average number of links per node
Network Diameter The maximum distance between any pair of nodes in the graph.
Modularity is one measure of the structure of networks or graphs. It was designed to
measure the strength of division of a network into modules (also called groups, clusters or
Modularity
communities). Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes
within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules.
Average path length is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for
Average Path Length all possible pairs of network nodes. It is a measure of the efficiency of information or mass
transport on a network.
A connected component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other, but not
Connected Component connected to another group of nodes. Another way of thinking of this is a group of connected
nodes that have no path to a node from another group.
In the case of Bulgaria, the specialists/country officers that have provided us answers to the questionnaire
work in following areas: early childhood development, refugee and migrant children, communication for
social change, local services, education, child rights monitoring, social policy and child protection.
According to the collected data, the main institutions with whom the CO collaborates are: Governmental
bodies, NGOs and associations and state agencies and institutes. As the below figure shows, from the
institutions that have been mentioned by respondents, most connections have been established between
governmental bodies and UNICEF CO (39% of the total number of connections), followed by the
collaboration developed with CSOs (27%). State agencies and institutes are also key actors in UNICEF COs
network, as they represent 19% of the connections established with all identified collaborators.

The Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Labor and Social Policy have been identified most often
as important partners in the development of COs activities (7 times each), followed by The Agency for Social
Assistance (6 times) and Ministry of Interior and State Agency for Child Protection (5 times each). Most of
the NGOs and associations that have been mentioned have only one connection with UNICEF CO (with the
exception of National Association of municipalities – 3 connections, ANIMUS – 2 connections and National
Network for Children – 2 connections). Nevertheless, as presented above, this category of stakeholders
represents 27% of the total number of connections, due to the fact that UNICEF works with a broad range
of CSOs158. Regarding the importance given by respondents to the collaboration established with UN
agencies, according to the collected data, this is rather low. Just 2 agencies have been mentioned, each with
only one connection, UNICEF ECARO and UNHCR.
Regarding the frequency of communication, as observed from the data collected, most frequent contacts
have established with: UNICEF ECARO, The Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria and Mission wing
foundation. Moreover, the majority of most frequent connections with the identified institutions and
organizations are with CSOs (such as: Mission Wings Foundation, Assist Foundation, Association of
European Journalists, Association of Parents, Bulgarian Pediatrics Association, Karin dom, Social Policy and
Practice Institute and other). Less frequent connections established annually are identified at the level of
governmental bodies (such as: Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Health or
Ministry of Labor and Social Policy).
According to the opinion of respondents, the primary benefit of the collaboration with stakeholders is:
information for solving problems (31%), followed by the support in accessing and convincing decision
makers (21%) and information that helps identifying problems (19%).

bodies, the most important aspect, as perceived by respondents, is that they receive information for solving
problems (42% of the cases), followed by access to decision makers and information that helps identifying
problems (each 26%). In the case of collaboration with LPAs, the benefits are equally distributed among the
following: information for solving problems, information that helps identifying problems and support in
accessing and convincing decision makers.
Another important criterion of the analysis is the level of value that the CO’s staff or contracted experts give
to certain collaborations. On a scale form 1(no value) to 10, the average value of the collaboration
established with governmental bodies is 7,48 and with state agencies is 7,41. The value of the collaboration
established with CSOs is 8,54. In the case of LPAs, the information and supported received by the
respondents is the least valued, receiving 5,4 points. Another high valued collaboration is the one
established with UN agencies and other international organizations, noted with an average of 8,4 points.
Analysing the scores received by each institution, the collaborations that have been the most appreciated
(receiving 10 points) are with the following institutions or organization: Bulgarian Helsinki Committee,
Caritas Sofia, Committee on the Rights of Child, Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria, Mission Wings
Foundation, Novi Pazar Municipality and Teach for Bulgaria.

Source: Data collected through a survey conducted in Bulgaria
In Bulgaria, the social network of UNICEF CO has an average degree of 2.4 edges per nodes. This indicates
that the average connection per actor in the network is around 2 or 3 connections. The size of the network
of UNICEF CO Bulgaria is 65 nodes (how many actors are in the network) and the network diameter has a
coefficient of 8 nodes (the longest path between the least connected actors in the network). Circulation of
information to the peripheral areas of the network is much difficult for UNICEF CO Bulgaria, because the
number of well-connected actors is limited.
Regarding the characteristics of the overall partnership network developed by UNICEF CO of Bulgaria, the
data analysis shows the existence of a relatively strong community, with various connections between
actors in different clusters formed around each department of the CO or each specialist/expert of the CO.
This conclusion is based on the modularity coefficient (0,646), that shows that the network is not formed
only by clusters of interactions, but that the identified clusters are interconnected through the connections
established between their members. The network is less partitioned by areas of interest as in the case of
UNICEF CO Moldova, because the experts of UNICEF CO Bulgaria are connected with external organizations
that are specialized or activates in various fields, not only in one field, as in the case of the experts of UNICEF
CO Moldova. This statement is also supported by the presence of only one connected component in the
network.
The coefficient of the average path length is 4.089, which indicates a flow of information that encounters
roadblocks in the network of UNICEF CO in Bulgaria. The average number of steps along the shortest paths
for all possible pairs of network nodes is 4 UNICEF experts and/or external partner organization. This
length can be explained due to the peripheral areas of the network in Bulgaria. In other words, to reach a
certain actor in the network it requires a path of communication through 4 other members from the
network.

The ECD Officer, the Social Protection Specialist and the Child Protection Specialist, all from UNICEF, are the
nodes that have both the highest betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. In addition to these three
nodes, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and the Ministry of Health have one of the highest coefficient
in closeness centrality.
The ECD Officer is the node that has the highest coefficients in all three metrics: degree, betweenness
centrality and closeness centrality. This node is the best positioned node in UNICEF’s network in Bulgaria.
The ECD Officer is connected with the Ministry of Health (betweenness centrality: 0.15, closeness centrality:
170
0.34), Ministry of Education and Science (betweenness centrality: 0.19, closeness centrality: 0.31), Ministry
of Labour and Social Policy (betweenness centrality: 0.17, closeness centrality: 0.35) and WHO
(betweenness centrality: 0.04, closeness centrality: 0.28). As well, the ECD Officer is connected with many
municipalities and NGOs from Bulgaria.
Partnerships for Early Childhood Development were seriously impaired by the resistance on the part of
well-established ministries to accept and adapt to the inter-sectoral, multi-disciplinary approaches.
Furthermore, the unfavourable social-political environment put on hold the anticipated progress and
impaired the scaling up and mainstreaming pilot projects. On the other hand, partnerships at the local level,
initially established in the previous programme cycle and extended to this programme cycle within the
framework of pilot projects are reported to contribute to good cooperation between different service units.
Combining several services targeting young children and families have improved access to health services,
better parenting practices in the most vulnerable and marginalized communities and in turn, motivated the
service providers to partner with the parents to provide comprehensive care.
Effective examples of partnerships include the cooperation between UNICEF and WHO to support for
revising the National Recovery Plan that led to the incorporation of ECD in the document and the
cooperation between the academic institutions and CSOs for the training and supervision of nurses within
the framework of home visiting services.
At the local level the pilot projects have supported the municipalities to perform their tasks efficiently,
persuaded them to scale up the services to allow transition from an entirely child-oriented model to a
family-oriented model. It is also stated that the specialists are transforming from being narrow specialists
into become broad specialists in early childhood intervention. It is worth noting that the Haskovo
Municipality is working on several large projects for marginalized groups and currently implementing a
project for the construction of social housing, which will only be used if the parents find a job on the
condition that the children attend kindergarten/school.
Notwithstanding the fact that the improvements are limited mainly to individuals and families benefitted
from pilot interventions and that there still is the need to reach out to all families and caretakers and all
children; UNICEF has made an important contribution to deinstitutionalization, the capacity of services
providers and parents is reported to have improved.
The partnership structure under the outcome area Inclusive Education is simpler with clear roles and
responsibilities for each stakeholder and therefore reported to conducive for mainstreaming the project
achievements ed into the routine procedures and practices as well as pre- and in-service training curricula.
The introduction of the screening test at the entrance to the kindergarten, to determine the aptitudes as
well as the needs for additional support of the child requires transition to a new system, which radically
different from the previous one. As an organization that combines health and social assistance and
education UNICEF's role in this transition through the introduction and application of screening tests, the
provision of pedagogical specialists, the improvement of the material and technical base, the introduction
of high- technologies to improve communication in children with certain disorders or disabilities, and for
the role of various NGOs, is perceived as extremely supportive. Changes have been made to many of the
bachelor's and master's programs with the introduction of inclusive education classes. Resource teacher
training programs have been introduced. Trainings for teachers in the application of screening tests were
conducted. The interviews imply increased confidence of teachers in their knowledge and skills related to
Inclusive Education and it is reported that principals started to consider such training as essential. A
comparative analysis of teacher profiles revealed that longer the support, stronger is self-confidence of
teachers. Therefore, Introductory, upgrading training and supervision to provide feedback, is considered a
171
very effective approach. Nevertheless, the teams in some kindergartens still feel insecure about working
with these children, especially in the villages.
Although the number of children with developmental problems in the education system has increased, there
it is not possible to assess this as genuine integration where the child is independent in school or
kindergarten.
Really effective support for parents in the community is achieved. This UNICEF project offers a completely
new philosophy for working with parents of young children, and a new way of providing a social service
altogether. There is an increase in the capacity of parents, they are much more informed, they have much
more access to different services.
The partnership structure under the outcome area Protection with different groups of stakeholders is
reported to be effective. The cooperation of the Ministry of Justice and in particular of the Legislative
Council Directorate with UNICEF Bulgaria is assessed as extremely fruitful. They jointly drafted and
assessed several legislations pertaining children in conflict with the law, during which representatives of
UNICEF Bulgaria presented their analyses and opinions on the subject of the activity.
The contribution of UNICEF is related to the introduction of interdisciplinary services, which consolidate
the activities of the various departments. UNICEF is part of the coordination mechanism for interaction in
cases of children who are victims or at risk of violence and cooperation during crisis intervention.
This generally leads to improved access to justice for children who have experienced violence and crime,
and is particularly important for vulnerable and marginalized children, such as the poor and ethnically
minority groups.
Zona Zakrrila has demonstrated a very successful model for and integrated service for both child victims
and children in conflict with law.
UNICEF and its implementing partners within the project Child Advocacy Centers, have supported the
government in the process of drafting the Social Service Act. The evidence gathered from documents and
interview highlight the importance of UNICEF’s work in this regard. Also, the new legislative document
introduces the concept of an integrated approach and thus, facilitates “multi-agency coordination and team
work”159.
The partnership structure under the outcome area Child Rights Monitoring is reported to be effective in
terms of improved data collection practices and successful campaigns. The interviews revealed that UNICEF
has conducted effective communication campaigns, which further strengthened its brand and ensured the
ownership of the wider public for child related issues and priorities. The C4BSC interventions, especially
within the framework of COVID-19 response, have created opportunities to reach out to and inform the
society as a whole on child related issues. The tools developed within this framework have high chances to
be used in in the future and for new modalities that may be transposed to programmes to support the efforts
to improve the health conditions and learning achievement of especially the most vulnerable and
marginalized children.

CONTEXT
Country Programme Evaluations (CPEs) in UNICEF fulfil a key role in identifying lessons which can inform the
design of the next Country Programme or adjustments in the current Programme, and opportunities to improve
UNICEF’s performance1. The CPEs assess (i) the contribution of the Programme of Cooperation to national
development results; (ii) UNICEF’s contribution to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) through the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSCDF)results; and (iii)
UNICEF’s strategic positioning in relation to its child rights mandate.
Being strategic evaluations, CPEs are mostly used2 to inform the direction of Country Programmes (CPs), which
is outlined in the country programme documents that are designed and planned every 5 years, on average. At
national level, CPEs may also inform the UNSDCF planning and evaluation processes and, at regional and global
levels, they may inform multi-country evaluations, synthesis and strategic evaluations undertaken to assess
and/or document UNICEF’s performance, management decisions and policy and programme development. CPEs
in UNICEF align with UNICEF’s 2018 Evaluation Policy with which it has become a requirement for Country Offices
(COs) to commission CPEs, at least, once every two programme cycles, and once per programme cycle, if
monitoring information or audit point to a significant shift in the programme context, or a significant increase in
the level of risk. To guard independence, CPEs are managed from Regional office (RO) level in close collaboration
with COs and with final quality assurance undertaken by UNICEF’s Evaluation Office in New York (Table 1)3.

According to the COs engaged in CPEs in 2019-2020, CPEs have proven to be useful source for COs to inform their
next programme documents. In 2021, ECA Regional Evaluation team will manage country programme
evaluations for the country programmes: Bulgaria, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine; which are currently
starting a new planning cycle and preparing for their country programme document. For 2021, ECA
Regional Evaluation Team proposes a new value proposition in the modality of CPE delivery with the intention
of creating economies of scale and generating exchange and collaboration among countries through conducting
a Multi-Country Programme Evaluation (MCPE). The new value proposition will focus on results at scale and
propose a common ground framework reinforcing the connection of the programmes with UNICEF internal and
external coherence and allowing reaching out to regional and global stakeholders in a more strategic
manner, and minimizing the efforts required from the counterparts.
2. OBJECT OF EVALUATION
The object of evaluation will be the implementation of UNICEF Country Programmes of the selected
countries for a period of at least four years (2016 – 2020)- or longer to ensure that long-term results are
captured in the upper middle-income region. Theory of Change (TOC) of each CO’s CPD or a Results Matrix
190
are included in Annex A160. The Country Programmes (CPs) is UNICEF’s contribution to the realization of
the rights of every child, especially the most disadvantaged or vulnerable in a specific country. They reflect
the long-term vision of UNICEF to reach out results at scale. CPs are implemented through the change
strategies which adapt over the time to meet the needs of the target population in the local context. This is
exactly what the MCPE is sought to explore i.e. contribution of CPs to the results at scale and how
those results were achieved (through which change strategies) and who benefitted from them and
how.
The objective of the CP is to accelerate progress towards realization of the rights of all children in each of
the four countries. Aligned with the Convention on Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on
Eliminations of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and reflecting a human rights-based
approach, the CP is defined by a strong sector-based approach and an emphasis on up-stream systems
strengthening. The primary documents that frame the CP are the Country Programme Document (CPD) and
the Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP) both of which align with key national policy and strategic
documents including but not limited to: National Plan of Action to Implement concluding Observation of the
UN CRC for each of the country; National Strategies and Programmes. Given that CPDs are developed
together with the host governments of the four countries and other partners, there are many stakeholders
involved in the implementation of the CPs. While governments have primary responsibility for
administration of national development processes and programmes, civil society plays an essential role,
particularly in implementation.
The main components of the selected CPs and their respective budgets are as the following:
Current CPD components Indicative Budget

Water and sustainable environment 200 (RR) + 6,600 (OR)
Independent child rights monitoring 1,100 (RR) + 2,200 (OR)
The main components are implemented through a number of programme and project activities throughout
the countries with special focus on some of the geographical areas and demographic groups which will vary
from country to country. The budget of each CO as per their CPDs162 (in thousands of USD) are: Bulgaria
160 There are also programme specific TOCs which are available but not included in this ToR due to limited space.
161 Other resources (emergency) for the humanitarian response in Eastern Ukraine is estimated at $15 to $20 million per year

specific-purpose contributions during the period of implementation of the CPD. Budgets may differ from the actual expenditure.

(2018-2022) – 15,715 Kyrgyzstan (2018-2022) 31,730; Moldova (2018-2022) - 17, 508; Ukraine (2018-
2022) – 41,480.
The current assignment will start in 2021 – a year before the completion of the current CPDs. The timing is
important in order to ensure that its results feed into the design of the new CPDs.
3. EVALUATION CONTEXT
The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic could push up to 86 million more children into household
poverty by the end of 2020 globally, an increase of 15 per cent, according to a new analysis released by Save
the Children and UNICEF163. The analysis highlights that, without urgent action to protect families from the
financial hardships caused by the pandemic, the total number of children living below the national poverty
line in low- and middle-income countries could reach 672 million by year-end. Countries across Europe and
Central Asia could see the most significant increase, up to 44 per cent across the region.
The impact of the global economic crisis caused by the pandemic and related containment policies is two-
fold. Immediate loss of income means families are less able to afford the basics, including food and water,
less likely to access health care or education, and more at risk of child marriage, violence, exploitation and
abuse. When fiscal contraction occurs, the reach and quality of the services families depend on can also be
diminished. For the poorest families, lack of access to social care services or compensatory measures further
limits their ability to abide by containment and physical distancing measures, and thus further increases
their exposure to infection. Hundreds of millions of children remain multidimensionally poor - meaning
they lack access to health care, education, proper nutrition, or adequate housing – often a reflection of
inequitable investments by governments in social services. For children living in countries already affected
by conflict and violence, the impact of this crisis will further increase the risk of instability and of households
falling into poverty. In this context, UNICEF continues to work with governments and other national and
international partners to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the most disadvantaged in Bulgaria,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Ukraine.
Bulgaria164
Bulgaria is an upper-middle-income country and a member state of the European Union (EU) since
2007. Its population is 7,000,039 people as of end 2018, of which children are 17% of the country’s
population. Bulgaria is one of the two countries in the EU with highest shares of children at risk of poverty
and social exclusion, which was 38% in 2018 (around 410,200 children). Poverty and deprivation are more
prevalent among Roma families living in marginalized communities: about half of Roma children live in
households in the lowest decile of the income distribution, compared to fewer than one in ten Bulgarian
non-Roma children. Roma families also tend to have less access to basic social services, and face exclusion
and discrimination in education, employment and housing.
There is no complete data on the actual number of children with disabilities in the country, but the
estimated number is about 26,000. With respect to the number of children in institutional care, it has
dropped from 7,587 in 2010 to 662 in December 2018 (Agency for Social Assistance). At the end of 2019,
the number of children in residential care is 3,095 and 45 % of them or 1,415 children are placed in family-
type placement centers for children and young people with disabilities (ASA). The number of social services
for children and families has almost tripled - from 241 in 2010 to 620 in 2018 (ASA). Despite this progress,
the number of children who are separated from their families has not dropped and, annually, some 2,000
children continue to be separated and placed in alternative care.

192
Overall, the social protection system in the country is well established. Bulgaria has developed a
comprehensive system of services and social benefits intended to support all vulnerable groups and to
reduce poverty and social exclusion. However, the system is fragmented with considerable gaps in coverage,
especially for the bottom 20% of the population (income -related). Many families are not accessing
available services and benefits or the support they are offered is not necessarily adequate to their needs.
About 75,000 households belonging to the poorest 20% of the population receive no social benefits at all.
More than half of the children from the poorest 20% of the households receive no formal or informal care.
As a result, the contribution of services and benefits to reduce poverty and social exclusion is lower
compared to other EU countries.
Existing social services have not been developed systematically, and in some municipalities and settlements
are unable to provide adequate support. There is a considerable number of medium and small size
municipalities without any services for people with disabilities, and in many cases, support is limited to
residential type care with no option for day care or consultation services. In other localities, available
capacity is lower than demand, and long waiting periods may be common before users receive any kind of
service.
Disadvantaged children and families usually require access to a coordinated set of services to mitigate risks
of vulnerability, minimize dependency, and avoid falling into the intergenerational cycle of poverty and
social exclusion. The newly adopted Social Services Act (2019), aimed at improving the quality,
effectiveness, financing and monitoring of social services and delivery mechanisms, will address some of
these challenges. The Act introduces changes to the definition, planning, accessibility, quality and funding
of social services. It enables a significant shift towards prevention of family separation and social exclusion
and provides a basis for the provision of integrated support, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable
children and families. The effective implementation of the Act was postponed to July 2020.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, UNICEF in Bulgaria is monitoring closely the
situation of children and their families and is working with the Bulgarian Government, UN Agencies,
municipalities, service providers, civil society, corporate partners and other partners to help prevent the
spread of COVID-19 virus, strengthen national response capacities and keep children and their families safe
with a special focus on the most vulnerable. UNICEF is providing timely communication on the best means
of preparedness and prevention, including special guidelines and advice for parents, schools, health and
other professionals, children and young people, through community-based communication, mass media
and social media. UNICEF is supporting the efforts of the health, education, child protection and social
welfare sectors for continuing the provision of services to children and families through the provision of
some protective supplies and equipment as necessary to support the functioning of social services,
strengthening remote counselling and development of alternative operation modalities.
Kyrgyzstan
Kyrgyzstan is a land-locked, lower-middle-income country of 6.5 million people. It has rich endowments,
including minerals, forests, arable land, and pastures, and there is significant potential for the expansion of
its agriculture sector, hydroelectricity production, and tourism industry. The country has experienced
instability since independence in 1991. Corruption and nepotism were suggested to be major stress factors
underlying political and social upheavals in 2005 and 2010165. To prevent the concentration of power, a
parliamentary constitution with elaborate checks and balances was adopted in late 2010, making the
Kyrgyz Republic the only Central Asian country in which the president is limited to a single term.
Child poverty is a serious issue in Kyrgyzstan. Poverty is on rise (32% per cent) with children
overrepresented in poverty statistics (41% in 2015), resulting in poor access to quality services and
165 https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kyrgyzrepublic/overview

protection, and higher vulnerability to natural and man-made disasters166. Children living in poverty miss
out on pre-school and school education and healthcare, and face malnutrition. The poorest children live
mainly in rural areas in the southern regions of the country, many belong to families with three and more
children and families with unemployed adults
In Kyrgyzstan, UNICEF’s Country Programme 2018 - 2022 aims to reach the most disadvantaged
children167. UNICEF works at policy level with the Government to improve the social system, and on the
ground to make sure that this system reaches all children, with a particular emphasis on the most
vulnerable. UNICEF works across sectors of child protection, health, social policy, early childhood
development and education, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), response in emergencies, climate
change and disaster risk preparedness, children with disabilities and youth.
The global COVID-19 pandemic changed lives in Kyrgyzstan as it did in many parts of the world. In light of
the situation and early closure of schools, the Ministry of Education and Science, with the support of UNICEF
and other development partners, developed a remote learning platform for all students and preschool
children as of April 8. Over 1.7 million children were expected to follow the video lessons via various TV
channels across the country, in which teachers conduct their classes according to the school curriculum.
Moldova168
The Republic of Moldova, which is one of Europe’s poorest countries, saw a long-
lasting political crisis involving three governments within the last 12 months. This political situation
affected the development and implementation of various policies and strategies, including the National
Development Strategy “Moldova 2030”. In a context of high political instability following parliamentarian
elections and local elections in the year 2019, the country experienced three different governments in less
than one year.
Household consumption accounts for over 80% of GDP and depends strongly on remittances. The lack of
opportunity is the main push factor for migration, particularly for rural youth. The Government’s fiscal
revenue for social services is affected by an estimated one third of the work force being employed
informally. Children are the most affected by challenges faced by the social assistance system. As
the financial accountabilities attributed to Local Public Authorities (LPAs) do not fully match available
capacity to prioritize, finance and plan, social services for children and youth in health, education, child
protection, social protection remain underfunded. UNICEF continued to advocate with LPAs to establish
community level support services involving day care, family support and family-based placement services,
including a minimum social services package
Some 20,000 children, of which 90% are children left behind by both or the only migrant parent were
separated from their family in 2018 alone. While the number of institutionalized children decreased six-
fold over the past decade, a quarter of those still in institutions are children with disabilities.
Formal education does not fully provide the skills that young people need to transition to gainful adulthood.
Moldovan students registered better results in PISA 2018 compared to 2015, however these results were
still much below the OECD average, with about half of 15 year-old students not being proficient in reading,
mathematics or sciences. In 2018, youth unemployment (15-24 years old) doubled the national
average and youth inactivity is affecting about 60 per cent of young people. More than a quarter
of unemployed youth is not in education, training nor have a job (NEET), whereas young women are the
largest cohort in this category (NBS,2019). The lack of awareness and opportunities, the exclusion of

disadvantaged groups and insufficient funding for Youth Councils and Resource Centres undermine the
participation of children and youth.
Notwithstanding the turmoil in the political context and a certain slowdown of the implementation of the
Country Programme, still tangible achievements were made in relation to the child rights agenda. The
advancement of inclusive education remained at the forefront of the programme. A Joint Evaluation of the
Implementation of the Programme for Development of Inclusive Education in the Republic of Moldova for
2011-2020 was conducted with UNICEF support resulting in recommendations regarding system
strengthening and change of social norms towards enrollment of children with disabilities and those with
special educational needs in regular schools. The year saw also inclusion of Roma children in selected Roma
densely populated communities in education through UNICEF’s support for extensive work with all
involved stakeholders. During the year, the Government successfully adopted a Decree on Regional Services
for Children Victims and Witnesses of Crimes, while also specific legislation on cyber protection of children
was enacted. Furthermore, the Secretariat of the Parliament of Moldova accepted to include legislative
work on bullying on the Parliament’s 2020 agenda by initiating four regional consultations and a national
policy dialogue.
Ukraine169
Ukraine has travelled the path of post-Socialist transformation during its independence years170.
By now, the country has built well-established institutions of democratic society with market-driven
economy as well as civil society institutions. Construction of the independent state was going on amid
dramatic events and socio-political transformations accompanied by a great number of not only economic
but also political crises. Since the “Maidan” uprising in February 2014, the country has witnessed several
momentous events, including the outbreak of conflict in eastern Ukraine.
In its sixth year, the situation in the conflict-affected Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine
continues to take a significant toll on the lives of more than five million people. After nearly four years of
conflict in eastern Ukraine, 3.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance – 60% of them are
women and children171. Approximately 1.6 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of
thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded. More than one half of the Internally Displaced
Populations settled in Donetsk and Luhansk regions nearby the line of contact. Every day, the armed conflict
in eastern Ukraine forces millions of civilians to make impossible choices whether they eat, buy medicine
or send their children to school. UNICEF is supporting health, nutrition, HIV prevention, education, access
to safe drinking water, sanitation and protection for children and families caught in the conflict. UNICEF’s
strategy in Ukraine is about protecting children and realizing child rights on both sides of the contact line.
Responding to the urgent needs of 800,000 children and their families, UNICEF continues to strengthen
social protection and psychosocial support, as well as health, education and water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) services. The capacities of local professionals, authorities and civil society actors are being
enhanced to strengthen preparedness and accountability to affected children. UNICEF is working to
improve access to quality, inclusive, age- and gender-sensitive social services for children and families to
increase their resilience to protection-related risks, including through cash-based interventions. UNICEF
also works with humanitarian partners to target those closest to the contact line, while also strengthening
educational and community-based systems to support those impacted by the conflict. This bridging of
humanitarian action and development programming is central to UNICEF’s approach. As lead agency for the

WASH and education clusters and the child protection sub-cluster, UNICEF continues to advocate with
parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and child rights standards.
At the time of COVID-19, the most vulnerable families in terms of socio-economic impact of COVID-19 are
the ones who cannot diversify their income172. Families with both parents and multi-generational
households are more like to compensate decline or loss of income by one family member with income or
social benefits preserved by other family members. Whereas the following categories are more
dependent on single income source and are more likely to fall into poverty as a result of COVID-19: single
parents with children, households with children below 3 year old, and single pensioners above 65 year old;
as well as families with 3 and more children, who have traditionally the highest rates of poverty.
4. RATIONALE, PURPOSE AND USE OF EVALUATION
Rationale: The key rationale for conducting MCPE and doing so at this stage of CP cycles for the four
countries is identified in UNICEF’s 2018 Evaluation Policy. According to the Policy, it is a requirement for
COs to commission CPEs, at least, once every two programme cycles. Consequently, CPEs are included in
the Costed Evaluation Plans (CEPs) of all the four COs to be conducted in 2021 with the view of them feeding
into the developing of new CPDs for the next five years. The selected COs have identified an important
priority to conduct in this programme cycle the CPEs and agreed on the proposal of this terms of reference
as an strategic point of reflection and external view to design and plan for their next CPD.
CPEs have become an integral part of Country Programme management and play a challenge function to
ensure that CO staff address strategic-level issues. The CPE process itself is unique bringing together the
entire CO, RO, donor community in the country, Government and beneficiaries including young people.
Therefore, CPEs are instrumental for facilitating the strategic reflection on how to best prioritize UNICEF
efforts in each country and in the region as a whole to deliver the results for children.
The common purposes of the Country Programme Evaluation are to
• Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s contribution
to the results for children at scale especially for the most vulnerable
• Support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by
understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies through which the
Country Programme is delivered to better understand the added value of UNICEF in each country
context.
• Draw lessons from the previous CPD implementation in order to make the best use of UNICEF’s
change strategies in each country and in the region as a whole, while considering current
circumstances.
Use: The evaluation may be used by a broad range of stakeholders of which some have a direct stake in the
evaluation because they are involved in implementation of the CP or programmatic frameworks, plans or
strategies towards which the CP contributes. These stakeholders are referred to as Primary Stakeholders.
Other stakeholders, i.e. Secondary Stakeholders, refer to rights holders and duty bearers who benefit from
the contributions of the CP, and organisations with which UNICEF does not have any formal partnership but
that work with similar programmes and on child rights issues for which lessons and good practices drawn
from the CPE may be relevant. Primary stakeholders include but may not limited to the:
State Bodies. UNICEF’s main Government partners that UNICEF collaborates with relevant state
bodies on the coordination and detailed contents of each CP component in each of the four country.
The line ministries and state agencies may include: Prime Minister’s Office; Ministry of Health,
172 Nataliya Borodchuk and Liudmyla Cherenko (2020) FIGHTING COVID-19 IN UKRAINE: Initial estimates of the impact on poverty. UNICEF. 15

196
Ministry of Social Protection, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice;
different Departments on Youth and Minors; Pre-school and School Education, Teacher Training,
Family Support; General Prosecutor's Office; Judges Training Institute, Supreme Court; Committee
on Youth Affairs and Sport; Republican Centre of Additional Education; Committee/Agency on
Statistics, etc. The government stakeholders will use the findings of MCPE for helping UNICEF design
new CPDs.
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). UNICEF COs are likely to have collaborated with CSOs,
primarily, as implementing partners and in relation to piloting of CP activities. CSOs are the main
vehicle in implementing the CPDs and will undoubtedly use the findings in their direct work to
improve the services they provide and ensure that the voice of children is heard.
The academia: Through the CP implementation period, UNICEF COs collaborate with a range of
academic institutions. Academia will use the findings of MCPE to inform their evidence generation
activities.
Donors. UNICEF’s multilateral and bilateral donors – without which the CP would not be possible –
have a direct stake in the evaluation findings as these will account for UNICEF’s performance.
Donors include the European Commission (EU); the Department for International Development
(DFID), UK; the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI); the Government of Japan;
Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation; the Swiss Committee for UNICEF; the UK Committee for
UNICEF; the US Fund for UNICEF; and USAID. Donors will use the findings of MCPE for learning
purposes and informing their own programming.
UN agencies and international finance institutions. The UN system comprises of UN agencies
resident in country and contributing from abroad173. The current UNDAF174 involved inputs from
the WHO; the UNDP; the UNFPA; the UNODC; the UNAIDS; the UNESCO; the ILO; the FAO; the UN
Women. In addition, UNICEF partners with Bi-lateral donors (USAID, DFID, SIDA, among others),
the World Bank, and other IFIs. Similar to UN partners will use the findings of MCPE for learning
purposes and informing their own programming.
UNICEF stakeholders. Finally, stakeholders inside UNICEF who have a particular interest in the
MCPE include: Staff in UNICEF’s COs; the Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (ECARO), and
senior management in UNICEF who can draw upon the evaluation findings for regional and
corporate learning and accountability purposes.
5. OBJECTIVE OF THE EVALUATION
Aligned with corporate policy requirements, this formative MCPE serves both accountability and learning
purposes. The MCPE will look back and assess the relevance, coherence and impact achieved throughout
implementation of the CPs in the four countries to identify good practices, and draw lessons and forward-
looking recommendations that can inform the 2023-27 CP planning process, which will commence during
the last quarter of 2021175. The CPE has three objectives, which are to:
• Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national stakeholders by evaluating UNICEF’s contribution
to the results for children at scale especially for the most vulnerable in Bulgaria, Moldova,
Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine for which inequity and gender are considered to form part
• Support the development of the next UNICEF Country Programme Document (CPD) by
understanding and evaluating the implementation of the change strategies through which the
173 Resident: UNDP, UNICEF, WFP, FAO, WHO, UNHCR, IOM, UNODC, UNFPA; Non-resident: ILO, UNAIDS, OHCHR, UN Women, UNOPS, UNESCO,

174 At the time, this was referred to as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).
175 The rolling Country Situation Analysis is expected to be finalized in September to inform the drafting of UNICEF`s Programme Strategy Note
(PSN) that will begin during the third quarter of 2019 and is expected to be finalized by October 2019. Together with other relevant exercises and
documents, the PSN will inform the CPD planning process that is expected to be completed by May 2020.
197
Country Programme is delivered to better understand the added value of UNICEF in each country
context.
• Draw lessons from the CPD 2018-22 implementation in order to make the best use of UNICEF’s
change strategies in each country, in this group of countries, and in the region as a whole, while
considering current circumstances.
Lessons and recommendations should include but not be limited to reflect upon: a) UNICEF’s role and
strategic position looking back and thinking ahead into the next CPDs; b) the appropriateness of type and
combined use of implementation strategies; c) what UNICEF could do better and differently to enhance its
contribution in the countries under scrutiny. The recommendations will have a forward-looking
approach176.
6. SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
Time and Geographical coverage: The MCPE will be conducted for Bulgaria, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and
Ukraine. MCPE will explore the current and previous programme cycles assuming that some results at scale
would have required more than one cycle to materialise. The period of scrutiny could potentially span from
earlier years depending on the impact of interest given that long-terms results require longer time where
one CP cycle might not be enough for them to materialise. COs are also welcomed to have a focus on a
specific period of time when the CP was implemented e.g. COVID-19 epidemic or change in Government’s
highest leadership, etc. The final choice of the period to be evaluated will be defined during the inception
stage depending on the impact areas that the CO would choose to explore. The geographical scope is flexible
suggesting that COs can either focus on a specific spatial dimension of their work or specific target group,
again depending on the impact areas selected for scrutiny.
Programmatic coverage: The evaluation will explore UNICEF’s contribution to impact through the OECD-
DAC criteria of relevance and coherence and take into consideration the UNICEF’s eight change strategies
as per UNICEF strategic Plan177 and others that might have needed to put in place:
1. Programming excellence for at-scale results for children
2. Gender-responsive programming
3. Winning support for the cause of children from decision-makers and the wider public
4. Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children
5. Leveraging the power of business and markets for children
6. United Nations working together
7. Fostering innovation in programming and advocacy for children
8. Using the power of evidence to drive change for children.
Figure 1 depicts the visual representation of the MCPE’s focus and OECD-DAC criteria together with the
UNICEF change strategies.
Figure 1 A Conceptual framework of MCPE focus on Results at Scale
176 Considering the current circumstances and variables that keep changing overtime, the evaluation exercise will include recommendations that
can be applicable in the uncertain and changing context towards the design and implementation of the next CPD.
177 https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_Strategic_Plan_2018-2021.pdf
198
In particular, Figure 1 presents the hypothesis that the CP (box in the far left) is delivered through the
UNICEF change strategies (middle boxes) that can be conceptualized and aligned with the OECD-DAC
criteria of coherence and relevance leading to impact i.e. results at scale (box in the far right). In the process
we might identify other strategies that might not be considered in the current UNICEF Strategic Plan. The
change strategies act as a catalyst towards achieving the results at scale178 and are a means to an end which
is contributing to the results for children at scale with a special focus on most vulnerable. By exploring the
UNICEF change strategies, MCPE will encourage a specific ‘drill-down in detail’ exercise to bring out about
how UNICEF contributes to the results at scale, what its strategic positioning in each country is and will
result in actionable recommendations.
The framework aligns itself with the two objectives of evaluations which are learning and accountability
and also fits well with the three OECD-DAC criteria of impact, relevance and coherence as discussed above
(with sustainability being embedded throughout and effectiveness being part of impact)179. Sharing a
common framework will allow learning about what is and is not working from the comparative angle and
will therefore be helpful for both COs and RO to draw lessons at the country and identify trends at the sub-
regional level.
7. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND QUESTIONS
The project evaluation questions are formulated as per OECD-DAC evaluation criteria with some
adjustment to UNICEF’s change strategies and will explore relevance, coherence and impact. Sustainability
and effectiveness are not explicitly scrutinised but are embedded in the selected criteria and their questions.
Additional cross-cutting issues such as relevant human rights, including child rights, equity and gender equality
are also examined as part of MCPE.
Impact: Impact will explore whether, how, and to what extent the UNICEF CP has generated or is likely to
generate significant positive or negative, intended or unintended results at scale. Ideally, the evaluation seeks
to identify longer term or broader in scope180 sustained results in systems or norms, and potential effects on
people’s well-being, human rights, and gender equality especially for those who are most vulnerable. At the
178 UNICEF’s approach to programming for children and young people aims to achieve sustained results at scale. That means maintaining and
expanding support from both the public and private sectors – as well as non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations,
development agencies and United Nations partners. (UNICEF, Annual Report 2018)
179 According to the revised UNICEF CPE guidelines, CPEs are not required to focus on all the OECD-DAC criteria. The suggestion is to focus on
relevance, coherence and effectiveness. For the purposes of this MCPE, effectiveness is replaced with impact and is considered as part of it.
180 While this is an ideal aim the evaluation can also identify more localized achievements that are considered worthy of being evaluated.

same time, the evaluation will explore whether or not the CP was designed to reach at scale from the very start.
The evaluation of UNICEF’s contribution to the results at scale will be conceptualized using a Theory of Change
of each specific CO and the CO’s staff by identifying both the most significant positive result achieved by the CO
as well as any unintended result that the CP might have led to. The identified results (both intended and
unintended) need to be evaluated against the success or failure in addressing pre-identified bottlenecks in order
to achieve or not achieve such a result. Investigating impact will require articulating specific claims (both
intended and unintended) and identifying the change strategies forming the causal pathways towards the
impact.
Key questions Did UNICEF contribute to the results at-scale? If yes, how and why did it make a
difference and for whom? If no, why not?
Sub-questions: Did UNICEF identify and reassess bottlenecks throughout programme implementation?
Did different groups, including children and the most marginalised, benefit in different
ways from the Country Programme? Are the results likely to be maintained over time?
Which strategies or group of strategies were effective in producing results at scale?
Relevance: Relevance examines the extent to which CP objectives and design are sensitive to the socio-
economic, political, equity and capacity conditions in which it is implemented and are informed by evidence to
identify and address the bottlenecks. It requires analyzing any changes in the context to assess the extent to
which CP has been adapted so that UNICEF and its change strategies remain relevant over the time of the CP
implementation. The evaluation will be required to examine if the needs of the beneficiaries especially those
most vulnerable were assessed throughout the programme cycle and compare them to the situation throughout
the implementation (as identified in the CCA and the SitAn). The evaluation will also explore significant changes
in the context during programme implementation and the CP adjustments to them to achieve the results at scale.
Key questions: To what extent has UNICEF responded to the (changing) needs of the most
vulnerable throughout the programme implementation and consistently integrated
the equity and gender equality in all aspects of programming and implementation,
including policy and advocacy?
Sub-questions: To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to changes in national needs and rights of
the beneficiaries especially of the most vulnerable and in national priorities during
programme implementation?
To what extent has UNICEF been able to respond to the shifts caused by crisis or major
socio-economic and political changes?
Coherence: Coherence is twofold. First is the alignment dimension which is about examining the extent to which
the CP objectives and design respond to UNICEF’ own policies, and priorities, as well as those of the UN and
continue to do so when circumstances changed. UNICEF CP has to be compatible with UNICEF’s own regional
and global strategies as well as with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework
(UNSDCF). The latter entails CP’s compatibility with the wider UN work in terms of complementarity,
harmonization, co-ordination and avoiding duplication of effort and bring the value added of the organization to
fulfill its specific mandate. Evaluation can include looking at changes in coherence between the start and end of
the period being evaluated. Coherence analysis will also look for synergies or inconsistencies between actions in
a related field which are expected to work together.
200
Second is the partnership dimension where the idea is to explore the partnerships of UNICEF in delivering the CP
and addressing the meaningful bottlenecks and advocating for evidence for equity to be sustained in national
systems to reach the results at scale. Coherence analysis from the point of view of partnership will assess how
UNICEF builds partnerships and with whom (e.g. UN, private sector including market and businesses, research
and academic, etc.) and how it leverages resources for the results at scale. The evaluation will basically explore
the effect of UNICEF strategic partnerships on the delivery of the CP. In addition, the analysis will include
exploring the added value and comparative advantage of UNICEF vis-à-vis other development partners in each
given context. This element will be explored through the systematic cross case comparison of UNICEF’s
partnerships where the analysis initially will seek to identify how UNICEF differs from other “players” or “actors”
that have a stake in the policy sector at the country level and then identify if UNICEF appears to be important to
achieve the results at scale.
Key questions: To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme kept true to its mandate and aligned
with UNICEF’s global and regional strategies as well as UNSDCF and SDGs in any given
country?
To what extent did UNICEF manage to build effective and sustainable partnerships in
working towards addressing the predefined bottlenecks, advocating for evidence for
equity and contributing to the results at scale?
Sub-questions: What are the comparative advantages of UNICEF in relation to other actors in the country,
including development partners, the private sector, the non-government sector and to what
extent were they necessary and sufficient for contributing to the results at scale to be
achieved?
How has UNICEF’s approach to strategic partnerships changed over time, if any?
These evaluation questions are final and are not subject to change. Each CO is able to add up to two
questions to this list as/if needed.
8. APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
The approach and methodology presented is guided by the UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy181, the
Evaluation Norms and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)182, UNICEF Procedure for
Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluations and Data Collection and Analysis183 and UNICEF’s reporting
standards.
The proposed approach as a way forward is to design and implement a multi-country programme
evaluation (MCPE) for Bulgaria, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine. The proposed approach will have the
common evaluative elements which are shared by the COs and the elements which will be optional for each
CO to add. It is assumed that this design will be effective to strike a balance between the interests of each
CO and RO’s interest in learning across the region.
The MCPE will take the following general approach:
• Allow for maximum ownership by CO staff and place the least possible burden on UNICEF staff.
Strike a balance between CO ownership and multi-country evaluation arrangements allowing some

201
standardization of the aspects of the purpose, scope, evaluation questions, an overall methodology
and team composition with a certain individualization to meet the varying interests of COs
• Engage country, sub-regional and regional key partners throughout the evaluation process
• Work in a way that will allow sharing good practices and lessons learned across and within
countries. All of this toward the ultimate goal of improving UNICEF’s the implementation of change
strategies and accountability in all country contexts
• Make the maximum use of ongoing and recent evaluations, with a view to reducing duplication (as
well as evaluative burden) and to deepening the available data set.
• Identify some key trends in the region that can inform other country programmes and promotes
cross-fertilization
• Facilitate the identification of regional and sub-regional trends while the focus will be on the
specific countries
• Ensure that current context and forward-looking analyses are formulated based on information
and evidence available for a forward-looking recommendations and way forward.
The methodology will be chosen among the evaluation manager, technical committee, and the evaluation
team. It will be based on the questions, what additional goals and interests the COs have, and whether
various attributes of UNICEF CPs and evaluation process make it feasible to use different methods184. Taken
these considerations into account, the overall evaluative framework proposes a Theory-based Evaluation
(TBE) with potentially both quantitative and qualitative methods and data collection and analysis
techniques. Considering this double layer approach, it is likely that TBE methods such as process tracing
(PT) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) or a combination of both would be suitable choices to
answer the evaluation questions on impact and relevance (Table 2). The proposed evaluation methodology
should reflect a human rights-based and equity-focused approach with data being disaggregated by sex,
ethnicity, age, disability, etc., and it should pay diligent attention to ethical issues. Table 2 proposes possible
methodological options to answer the evaluation questions and evaluation teams are welcome to suggest
an overarching design to make it all work as a holistic framework. The bidders are also required to propose
preliminary plans for primary data collection in each country with some level of standardisation across the
four countries. More is discussed in the next section.

Please note that due to the current uncertain circumstances due to the consequences of COVID19 and
decisions around it taken place in each country, the recommendations and analysis of questions may
include scenario analysis to ensure that recommendations are applicable in the future. It is therefore
encouraged the use of evaluative methods such as participatory systems mapping when doing a
forward-looking stakeholder analysis185, and/or Bayesian Belief Networks, or similar.
The team together with UNICEF evaluation team will clarify strategies for conducting analyses and
disaggregation of data with a view to assess UNICEF’s contribution to diverse beneficiary groups. The team
will, furthermore, review the TOCs for the individual programme components with a view to verify
evaluability, device strategies for how to manage possible data limitations. The team will be expected to
explain its approach to triangulation and quality assurance of all evaluation deliverables and to clarify, how
it plans to engage key evaluation stakeholders to promote participation, ownership and utilization of the
evaluation.
Available data include a number of relevant evaluation and research which have been completed in each CO
(Annex 2) that will inform, particularly, the contextual analysis to be undertaken during the Inception
Phase. In addition, all COs have been reporting annually on output indicators in UNICEF’s Results
Assessment Module (RAM), but challenges in accessing data for selected outputs and outcomes prevail in
relation to some programme sectors. The output level indicators mainly rely on the project-level data. The
evaluation team will also find that disaggregation of data, at times, is limited, and baseline date unavailable,
which will influence assessment of changes.
185 The map can be used to run through potential scenarios of change. For example, if there is a factor stakeholders have high control over, we
may explore how a range of different changes in that factor affect the rest of the map, using the map to walk through these changes step by step.
203
9. MCPE PROCESS
Once the evaluation team is on board, the evaluation will be structured in the following main phases defined
by accompanying activities as described below:
A Desk Review: The evaluation team will commence the evaluation with a document review for
which an electronic library will be established for each CO comprising relevant documentation that
will be updated on an ongoing basis during the evaluation process. Documentation made available
to the team may include but will not be limited to: CP financial information; programme monitoring
data covering the timeframe for the evaluation; work plans; available TOCs for CP components;
management plans and strategy notes; situation analyses; Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)
and other relevant surveys; donor reports; needs assessments; corporate key policies, strategies
and normative guidance that has informed the development of the CP; reports and studies relevant
for the operational context; and Government and partner key policy and strategy documents. It is
important that the evaluation team develops a framework for the desk review. It will be a useful
stage for identifying the first glimpse of potential results that COs may be interested in focusing on
and identifying the boundaries of MCPE. Desk review will also be instrumental for identifying the
areas of focus, based on the evaluation questions based on existing data.
Initial Briefings; In addition to the desk review, brief introductory skype interviews with staff from
UNICEF’s Regional Office and the COs will inform the detailed planning of the evaluation
methodology. Once the initial desk review is completed, there will be a joint and separate call(s)
with wider MCPE stakeholders to introduce the evaluation and the team to the entire CO staff and
key evaluation stakeholders, including members of an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG)
established as a sounding board for the evaluation to foster transparency and participation and to
review key evaluation deliverables.
An Inception Report (IR) An inception report (a joint report for the entire MCPE) will be submitted
that demonstrates impartiality, and that aligns with UNICEF’s quality standards186. The IR will be
subject to quality assurance, a review conducted by internal evaluation stakeholders and the ERG,
an ethical review – should proposed data gathering involve vulnerable groups, sensitive subjects
and/or use of confidential data – and, finally, quality assurance by ECARO that requires a
satisfactory rating for the field mission to proceed and be considered an acceptable product187. The
approval of the IR marks the completion of the Inception Phase. Based on the desk review, the IR
will provide a contextual description and focus; justifications of proposed changes to the evaluation
ToRs; an a detailed methodology (including sampling strategies for all primary data collection
activities; and analytical evaluative methods at the country and regional level); proposed impact
areas for scrutiny; refined theoretical framework; a description of the quality assurance mechanism
of the evaluation team. The IR will also outline evaluation team strategies for management of data
gaps, or data reliability issues, and it will include ethical considerations relating to primary data
generation and use, as per UNICEF guidelines. Attached to the IR will be an evaluation matrix
outlining evaluation questions, sub-questions, judgement criteria/indicators, data sources and
instruments/methods; a preliminary regional and in-country stakeholder analysis188 (example) that
will be refined for the Evaluation Report; the MCPE TOC overall and one per participating CO; a work
plan with a timeline; and an overview of the division of labour between the evaluation team
members. IR could add the evaluation team’s assumptions of “ideal evidence” to test their
theories/hypotheses of what evidence would conclusively prove (or strengthen considerably) and
what evidence would conclusively disprove (or weaken considerably) their theories.
Virtual data collection: Following the inception phase, a three-week virtual data collection with
full participation of all team members will be organised during which primary and, if relevant,
secondary data will be generated and collected. Important to note that the international
evaluation team members are not expected to travel. National consultants hired in each country
186 Please refer to Annex D
187 For details on UNICEF’s external quality assurance review, please refer to Annex D
188 http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/anticorrupt/PoliticalEconomy/stakeholderanalysis.htm
204
will be the primary vehicle for data collection, analysis and in-country validation and do so either
face to face or virtually depending on the COVID-19 situation in each country.
An Evaluation report (ER) and a brief Synthesis Report (SR): The evaluation team will prepare
a draft evaluation report (one per CO) that will be subject to a review undertaken by CO staff,
members of the ERG and the evaluation manager; an external quality assurance that requires a
satisfactory rating and, if required, an ethical review. Following the first review of the draft report
and the initial quality assurance, the evaluation team will incorporate the comments provided as
appropriate and prepare a final report. Approval of the ER as a product will be subject to quality
assurance by the ECARO evaluation team. Once a final draft report has been approved, the
evaluation Team Leader together with the national consultants will present the evaluation findings
and recommendations to each CO staff, the ERG and, if relevant, other national stakeholders. The
Team Leader will, furthermore, present the evaluation findings to relevant stakeholders from
UNICEF’s RO and, if required, selected headquarter staff. The regional report as well as each of the
four country offices reports will comply with UNICEF’s reporting standards and be no longer than
40-60 pages excluding annexes, each. Upon completions of the evaluation report (including the
regional and the 4 country office reports), it will be rated in UNICEF’s Global Evaluation and
Research Oversight System (GEROS)189, and it will be published on UNICEF’s global website. A brief
synthesis report is also expected to be produced compiling the key findings, conclusions and
recommendations for the RO.
10. SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND LIMITATION
There are two special conditions. First, it is a multi-country evaluation. Figure 2 illustrates the aspects of
the CPE which are standardized for all the COs and those which are flexible and can be adjusted by COs. As
shown, most of the areas are flexible to accommodate the COs’ interests and needs.

respondents
chosen through
common critera
The MCPE will answer a set of core evaluation questions suggested above for all the COs as well as some
additional questions added by COs (up to eight). MCPE will explore the current and previous programme
cycle assuming that some results at scale would have required more than one cycle to
materialize. However, COs are also welcomed to have a particular focus on a specific timing e.g. COVID-19
189 https://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/index_GEROS.html
205
epidemic or change in Government’s highest leadership, etc. depending on the results that the CO would
choose to explore. The geographical scope is flexible suggesting that COs can either focus on a specific
spatial dimension of their work or specific target group, again depending on the results selected for
scrutiny. The overall methodology will be the same to all COs i.e. criteria to choose the appropriate
methods to answer the evaluation questions. All the methods and tools will be predominantly the same
but can differ depending on the limitation and possibilities available in each
country. Institutions/organisations and respondents can be similar i.e. equivalents of the same institution
across the countries with some specific ones added in any given context, for example, some countries may
have more NGOs/CSOs partners. Respondents will vary from country to country. It is envisaged that there
will be one central team conducting MCPE with an international team leader, one or two experts and one
national expert per each country (CO will help to identify national experts). The team will be selected and
managed by RO. The outputs will include a joint inception report (IR), a joint synthesis report and four
individual evaluation reports for the four COs.
Second, the special condition is around the COVID-19 restrictions. Considering the current travel
restrictions, the bidders should prepare technical and financial proposal accordingly.
Limitations include
• Lack of systematic documentation of the design and implementation of some programme
interventions may limit the evaluation.
• Due to ongoing structural reforms in some of the governments e.g. Ukraine, a high staff turn-over
has been observed in recent years, which does influence availability of institutional memory.
• Not all key informants might be available or reachable at the time of evaluation.
• Evaluation should be conducted without travelling to the country, which will have certain
challenges associated with it.
11. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Considering UNICEF’s strategic agenda to harness innovation and deepen and widen the evidence base to
drive and sustain global progress towards the realization of children’s rights, ensuring ethical conduct in
evidence generation is imperative. This is necessary both in its own right and as a significant contributor to
ensuring quality and accountability in the evidence generation process, especially when it involves children.
The evaluation team remain in strict adherence with UNEG ethical guidelines and code of conduct. The team
leader will be in charge of leading the entire process and be responsible for timely and quality deliverables
of the entire process as well as of the evaluation outputs.
Evaluation methodology should be based on UNEG Ethical considerations and respond to UNEG ethical
guidance to evaluation as guiding principle to ensure quality of evaluation process
(http://www.uneval.org/search/index.jsp?q=ETHICAL+GUIDELINES) as well as on Standard Operations
Procedures (SOP) for Quality Assurance and Ethical Standards in UNICEF-supported Research, Studies and
Evaluations (RSEs) towards Measurable Results for Children in the CEE/CIS Region and UNICEF Procedure
for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis. UNICEF will use its existing LTA
for external ethical approval to get a clearance. Annex 3 lists the sources for the ethical guidelines.
Evaluation team members should identify any potential ethical issues and approaches, as well as the
processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation process in their proposal. At this stage, it is not
anticipated that MCPE will engage children under 18 and other vulnerable groups of the population in data
collection. However, should bidders propose otherwise, all MCPE deliverables will be subject to ethical
approvals through the regional LTA holder.
206
12. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS
The activity will be managed by the RO and conducted by external contractors (Figure 3).

The activity will be managed by the RO and conducted by external contractors (Figure 4). The RO will be
responsible for the day-to-day oversight and management of the evaluation and for management of the
evaluation budget. A form of cross-divisional stakeholder / advisory group (e.g. Evaluation Steering
Committee, Evaluation Reference Group (ERG)) will be required both at the RO level as well as for each
country. Further discussion is needed on the form and membership of such a group at the country level. At
the top-level ERG will consist of RO advisers and chaired by the Regional Director. The top-level ERG will
provide guidance and supervision to the CPEs. UNICEF Regional Evaluation Team10 will work closely with
the external evaluation team headed by a MCPE team leader and supported with other team members
including local experts. The team leader will be working with local consultants based in each of the MCPE
country who will be a local specialist11. Each CO will have a focal point (CRM/M&E/Evaluation focal
point) to be the first line of contact on behalf of the CO who will work with the CO staff and ERG. The RO will
assure the quality of the evaluation and guarantee its alignment with UNEG Norms and Standards and
Ethical Guidelines and provide quality assurance checking that the findings and conclusions are relevant
and proposed adaptations are actionable. All major deliverables will be reviewed firstly by RO (zero draft)
and then by the ERG and COs. The MCPE process will be collaborative, transparent and effective to the
extent possible. Table 3 outlines the key tasks and roles of RO and COs.

UNICEF as a commissioner takes the accountability of the evaluation and ECARO Evaluation Adviser is designated
as supervisor for this evaluation. Support for this evaluation will be provided by ECARO Evaluation team which
will perform a managerial function for this evaluation (Evaluation Manager).
The Evaluation Manager will have the following responsibilities:
• Lead the management of the evaluation process throughout the evaluation (design, implementation and
dissemination and coordination of it follow up);
• Convene the ERG meetings; Facilitate the participation of those involved in the evaluation design;
• Coordinate the selection of the Evaluation Team;
• Safeguard the independence of the exercise and ensure the evaluation products meet quality standards;
• Connect the Evaluation Team with the wider programme units, senior management and key evaluation
stakeholders, and ensure a fully inclusive and transparent approach to the evaluation;
• Facilitate the Evaluation Team’s access to all information and documentation relevant to the
intervention, as well as to key actors and informants who should participate information-gathering
methods;
• Provide the evaluators with overall guidance as well as with administrative support; Oversee progress
and conduct of the evaluation, the quality of the process and the products;
• Manage/support relationship between COs, partners, etc
• Approve the deliverables and evaluate the team’s work in consultation with ERG
190 Financial arrangements will be discussed and agreed by COs and RO.
208
• Take responsibility for disseminating and learning across evaluations on the various programme areas
• Ensure that all deliverables are submitted to external QA review conducted by external institution;
• Disseminate the results of the evaluation.
The RO and CO ERGs will:
• Review and provide comments and feedback on the quality of the evaluation process as well as on the
evaluation products (comments and suggestions on the TOR, draft reports, final report of the evaluation).
• Facilitate the communication/presentation of results to COs and relevant partners at the regional and
country level
The Evaluation Team will report to Evaluation Manager and conduct the evaluation by fulfilling the contractual
arrangements in line with the TOR, UNEG/OECD norms and standards and Ethical Guidelines; this includes
developing of an evaluation (implementation) plan as part of the inception report, drafting and finalizing the final
and synthesis reports and other deliverables, and briefing the commissioner on the progress and key findings
and recommendations, as needed. The Evaluation Team should also adhere to UNICEF’s Evaluation Policy, to
UNEG’s ethical guidelines for UN evaluations and to UNICEF Reporting Standards. Evaluation team members will
sign a no conflict of interest attestation. Annex 4 presents the technical requirements of the team. The Evaluation
Team must demonstrate personal and professional integrity during the whole process of the evaluation. The
Evaluation Team must respect the right of institutions and individuals to provide information in confidence and
ensure that sensitive data cannot be traced to its source. Further, the team must respect ethics of research while
working with children including using age appropriate consent forms, age appropriate data collection, and
principle of do no harm. Furthermore, the team and its members must take care that those involved in the
evaluation have an opportunity to examine the statements attributed to them. The evaluation process must be
sensitive to beliefs, manners, and customs of the social and cultural environment in which they will work.
Especially, the team must be sensitive to and address issues of protection, discrimination and gender inequality.
Furthermore, the team members are not expected to assess the personal performance of individuals and must
balance an assessment of management functions with due consideration of this principle.
13. WORKPLAN AND DELIVERABLES

evaluation, its methodology and its main findings, conclusions and recommendations. It should fairly and
clearly represent the views of the different actors/stakeholders. It should clearly give the conclusions and
forward-looking recommends in a way that is substantiated by evidence. The draft will be shared with the
ERG to seek their comments. Although particular for each concept, the reports will have common
components, and same analytical framework as described in these ToRs, which should allow for a systemic
analysis. The drafts report will be quality assured by the Evaluation Manager. The final draft will be quality
assured by external QA institution, if needed. There will be four Country-specific evaluation reports in total
(one per country). All supporting evidence will be shared with the ECARO’s Evaluation Team.
Synthesis Report in English - Electronic to be submitted after Country-Evaluation Reports are complete).
Synthesis report should synthesise key findings of the four Country-Evaluation reports. The synthesis
report will enable regional office to have a comparative systemic view of how strategies have been
implemented in each participating country under a specific context. It will describe strategic positioning of
UNICEF among regional and national stakeholders and regional support in COs’ country programme
implementation. The Final Report should be submitted along with the Power Point presentation or similar
electronic means in English (electronic version). Presentation should be based on the finalized evaluation
report summarizing the entire process, purpose, objectives, methodology, findings. It will have specific
recommendations and conclusions for the overall view of the four countries. All supporting evidence will
be shared with the ECARO’s Evaluation Team.
Dissemination plan and advocacy approaches should be developed as part of the IR and then discussed/agreed
with the CO. Primarily, the result will be disseminated to the CO senior management. The findings will be
discussed at the management team meetings, programmatic reviews to inform the CO’s programming. The plan
for dissemination and advocacy of the Evaluation result will be cleared by the Evaluation Manager.
The Evaluation Team should propose a timeline to submit the deliverables in their implementation plan (in
proposals). Necessary and adequate time (at least two weeks) should be allocated for review and quality
assurance processes of the deliverables by the Regional Evaluation Advisor and External Institution.
All reports should follow the structure and detailed outlines discussed and agreed with UNICEF (Annex 5)

Annex 4. TECHNICAL QUALIFICATION CRITERIA
Object of the contract. UNICEF is seeking to contract a Consultancy company, corresponding to the following
requirements:
• Duly registered in the country of residence, without limitation as to the countries of registration.
• Proven experience in evaluation using TBEs mentioned in Table 2 (not less than ten years) are a must.
• Consulting experience on evaluation programme evaluations in post-soviet countries is an asset.
The Consultancy company shall provide the Evaluation Team. The Evaluation Team should be comprised of
Team Leader (international), Evaluation Specialist (1 or 2) and national experts (one in each country i.e. 4 in
total).
The Evaluation Team Leader should have the following qualifications:
• Advanced university degree, preferably in evaluation, social studies or a related field. A combination
of relevant academic background and relevant work experience may be accepted in lieu of the
advanced university degree;
• At least ten years’ experience in evaluation, including experience of programme evaluations and
familiarity with UNICEF and the UN system (CVs required);
• Previous solid experience of designing and leading Theory-Based and Systems-Based Evaluation
designs.
• Previous experience of evaluation of humanitarian programmes is an asset
• Geographical scope of professional experience in four MCPE countries
219
• Understanding of Sustainable Development Goals and its relation to UNICEF work in ECAR;
• Familiarity with UNICEF and procedures (possible but not necessary);
• Strong analytical skills and statistical data analysis experience;
• Ability to produce content for high standard deliverables in English;
• Language skills (English is a must and Russian is a strong asset)
• Sensitivity towards ethics with regards to human and child rights issues, different cultures, local
customs, religious beliefs and practices, personal interaction and gender roles, disability, age and
ethnicity.
Evaluation Team Leader should have the following qualification in addition to the above:
The Team Leader must have documented professional experience in conducting rigorous independent
evaluations that meet professional evaluation standards - and more than 10 years of professional
experience. The Team Leader should, furthermore, have a strong development background with a
profound understanding of development and Human Rights-Based programmes. It is also a requirement
that the Team Leader has expertise in strategic planning, and evaluation experience from the Europe and
Central Asian Region. In addition, he/she must have expertise relating to one or more of the sectors in
which UNICEF works. As the Team Leader of the evaluation, the candidate will demonstrate previous
experience in managing a multi-disciplinary team and delivering quality evaluation outputs. The proposed
Evaluation team must correspond to the minimum criteria – team composition and minimum experience
of the proposed staff. In case of deviation, the offers may be considered technically not compliant.
Evaluation Specialist
Evaluation specialists should have relevant higher academic/post-graduate degrees and a minimum of
five years of relevant professional experience in evaluation, and sector expertise in two, ideally more, of
the following five sectors:
1) education (formal/informal)
2) mother and child health and wellbeing (ECD) and WASH;
3) evidence generation and social policy;
4) communication for social change
4) child protection; and
5) gender
6) disaster risk reduction
Evaluation Specialists must have specialised evaluation expertise and experience in any of the evaluation
techniques and approaches mentioned in Table 2. A knowledge of Russian language by one of the Evaluation
Specialists will be an advantage. It will be ideal if the team can cover almost all of the techniques and
approaches specified in Table 2 among themselves.
National Experts
National Experts should have relevant higher academic/post-graduate degrees and a minimum of five
years of relevant professional experience in research especially in conducting data collection activities (in
English and local language(s)), analysing collected primary and existing secondary data and writing up the
analysis in English. Each National Expert should speak a relevant local language and be knowledgeable of
the local context. For Ukraine, a local expert with the knowledge of both humanitarian and development
work will be considered as highly suitable.
