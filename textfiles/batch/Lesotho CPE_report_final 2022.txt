EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small, landlocked country in Southern Africa, with a population of 2.1 million
people of which 38 per cent are children and adolescents. The United Nations classifies Lesotho as a
Least Developed Country (LDC) – defined as having low income levels and facing severe structural
impediments to sustainable development. Lesotho is vulnerable to the impact of climate change, and over
the past decade it has experienced successive climate shocks in the form of recurrent droughts and
floods. Lesotho falls within the low human development category, with a Human Development Index
(HDI) value of 0.514 in 2021, placing it at 168 out of 191 countries in 2021.
Almost all children in Lesotho experience at least one deprivation, and nearly half of Lesotho’s children
aged 0–17 years are multi-dimensionally poor. Child mortality, though declining since 2017, remains high.
There are geographic and socio-economic disparities in vaccination rates of children under 24 months,
with lower coverage for children in rural areas and from poor households. Nearly one-third of children
under 5 years are stunted and malnutrition is reported to have increased as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. Lesotho has made significant progress in its HIV response, achieving the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets, but progress has been made fragile by the
onset of COVID-19. Achieving quality education outcomes is a persistent challenge for the country. With
free and compulsory education, primary school enrolment is high, but drops at secondary level.
Enrolment levels at pre-primary facilities are low, with only one-third of children accessing any form of
pre-primary education. Violence against children persists, with girls experiencing sexual violence from
partners and schoolmates. Girls and boys experience overlapping emotional and physical violence.
The UNICEF Lesotho Country Programme 2019–2023 seeks to support the Government of Lesotho in
addressing the multiple challenges experienced by children, and attain progress against national targets
for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Country Programme has the vision "to reach every
child, everywhere, with opportunities to survive, develop and reach her or his full potential."
UNICEF implements the country programme through three programme components, namely:
a) Component I: Young children survive, thrive and attain learning outcomes.
b) Component II: Children and adolescents are protected from violence and HIV and have improved
learning outcomes.
c) Component III: Reducing child poverty and enhancing equity and social protection.
These components are underpinned by programme effectiveness measures, including programme
performance monitoring and evaluation; the application of results-based management to ensure rigour in
planning and monitoring; evidence-based advocacy and partnerships; and the use of communication for
development.
Evaluation purpose, objectives and scope
UNICEF commissioned the evaluation of the 2019–2023 Country Programme between UNICEF and the
Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho. The evaluation was conducted between February and
September 2022 and serves the dual purpose of learning and accountability. Specifically, the purpose of
the evaluation is to identify best practices, results and lessons from the design and implementation of the
vii
Country Programme, and so inform the development of the UNICEF Country Programme Document
(CPD) 2024–2028. The evaluation is also expected to contribute to the development of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2024–2028. The evaluation also
serves to establish accountability to national and international stakeholders and the Executive Board for
the results achieved with the resources that have been invested in implementing the Country Programme.
The objectives for the evaluation as set out in the Terms of Reference were:
(a) To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability of the Lesotho
Country Programme from its inception to the present, with particular attention on equity, gender
equality, behavioural and social change for development, risk-informed programming, convergence of
programme components and achieving results at scale, as well as UNICEF's strategic positioning in
relation to its child rights mandate.
(b) To identify and document key lessons learned, good practices and innovations in implementing the
current 2019–2023 Country Programme, which can inform and support advocacy efforts for scale-up
and replication.
(c) To provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen programmatic
strategies in the design of the next Lesotho Country Programme, taking into consideration national
development priorities and plans and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the country.
The scope of the evaluation included all UNICEF activities implemented under the Country Programme,
including emergency and humanitarian activities. The period covered by the evaluation is from January
2019 to August 2022. The formal Country Programme Document approved by the Executive Board was
used as the basis for the evaluation. It took into consideration changes the Country Office made to the
outputs, indicators and targets of the Country Programme at its Strategic Moment of Reflection (2021).
Evaluation methodology
The evaluation followed a theory-based approach, assessing the results of the interventions against the
theories of change developed for each of the programme components and the targets set for the outputs
of each programme component. The evaluation also considered the assumptions and risks underpinning
the theories of change to explain the factors that may have influenced the results. To ensure that the
evaluation would be useful to the Country Office, staff was consulted at all critical stages of the
evaluation. The evaluation observed the norms and standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group
(UNEG) and the Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation.1 Informed consent was obtained from key informants
prior to the start of each interview, and confidentiality was observed.
The evaluation followed a phased approach – inception, data collection, data analysis and reporting.
During the inception phase, the evaluation consultant conducted stakeholder mapping and document
review, and consulted the Country Office to refine the draft evaluation questions. The primary data
collection entailed conducting remote interviews from June to August, and carrying out a field mission in
1 United Nations Evaluation Group, ‘Norms and Standards for Evaluation’, UNEG, New York, 2016,
<www.uneval.org/document/detail/1914> and United Nations Evaluation Group, ‘UNEG Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation’, New York, 2008, <www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/102>.
viii
August 2022. The evaluation interviewed or consulted a total of 57 persons, 55 per cent female and 45
per cent male.
In addition to interviewing UNICEF staff, the evaluation interviewed persons from the following
organizations:
(a) Government: Ministry of Development Planning, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of
Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Justice and Law and Ministry of
Social Development.
(b) Civil society organizations: Help Lesotho, Lesotho National Federation of Organisations for the
Disabled, Lesotho Red Cross Society and Lesotho Schoolnet Camara.
(c) United Nations in Lesotho: UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Food Programme (WFP) and
World Health Organization (WHO).
(d) European Union Delegation to Lesotho.
The evaluation consultant shared the emerging findings and areas of recommendation with the Country
Office at a workshop that provided an opportunity for the Country Office to interrogate these findings and
potential recommendations. In addition to presentations made at the workshop, the Country Office
provided written inputs on the emerging findings. The feedback from the Country Office was taken into
consideration in preparing the draft evaluation report. The draft report was circulated to the Country Office
for comment, and the report was finalized, taking these comments into account.
The evaluation has the following limitations:
(a) The evaluation was unable to secure interviews with all the intended stakeholders listed in the
inception report, even though the data collection period was kept open for three months, and the
Country Office and evaluation consultant made several follow-ups. The data collection period
coincided with a busy period for government officials.
(b) The evaluation comprised 10 key evaluation questions, which had been reduced from the larger
number of questions in the Terms of Reference. Even though the number of questions was reduced,
each question was made up of two or three sub questions. The evaluation did not seek to answer all
the sub questions, as this would make the analysis and reporting unwieldy. Instead, the findings
reflect the main thrust of the evaluation questions.
(c) The lack of updated national data is a major limitation to assessing progress at the outcome level.
Most outcome indicators require statistics from government sources, and in many instances, the
latest data is 2018. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was scheduled to be conducted
during the current country programme cycle, but was postponed as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Main findings
Relevance
The evaluation found that the Country Programme was well aligned with national priorities as set out in
Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan II (NSDP II) and in sector plans of the relevant ministries.
The key components of the Country Programme fall mainly within the NSDP II Key Priority Area II:
Strengthening Human Capital and the NSDP II crosscutting issues of children, youth and gender. The
ix
Country Programme is also aligned with Key Priority Area IV: Strengthening national governance and
accountability systems; the strategic objectives of which are as follows: (i) enhancing the efficiency of the
justice system; and (ii) strengthening national monitoring and evaluation systems. Other national priorities
reflected in the Country Programme include NSDP II strategic objectives to improve the efficiency of the
social protection system and increase access to sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene.
UNICEF Lesotho responded rapidly and effectively to the changing context of the COVID-19 pandemic,
mobilizing additional resources to support the national response, and adapting programme interventions.
It adjusted its mix of strategies to respond to the needs of the changing context, and also adjusted its
internal operations. Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a disruption, UNICEF also used the
opportunity to do things differently and use the COVID-19 response interventions as a foundation for
building long-term resilience.
The evaluation found that UNICEF Lesotho made good use of its comparative strengths to influence
policies and implementation. Examples include the support UNICEF provided in the procurement and
cold chain storage of vaccines; its use of its convening power in the UN Nutrition network to influence
nutrition policy process through the development of an investment case for nutrition; its support in the
development of new guidelines for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV; the
development of the Inclusive Education Policy; and the development of the National Social Protection
Strategy.
Coherence
The evaluation found that the Country Programme is aligned with UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan (2018–
2021) and NSDP II priorities to address gender inequality. Examples of UNICEF interventions addressing
gender inequality include support to the Ministry of Education and Training to strengthen the gender-
responsiveness of national education sector plans and policies; capacity strengthening of law
enforcement officials to identify and respond to cases of gender-based violence; and the Joint UN
programme 2gether 4 SRHR (sexual and reproductive health rights) empowering adolescent girls and
young women. The Country Office, however, lacks an overarching gender strategy, and so interventions
addressing gender inequality lack coherence. The evaluation identified the need for gender technical
capacity in the Country Office.
UNICEF collaborated with other UN agencies in the response to COVID-19, and plays an important role
in UN coordination. Other UN agencies commented positively on UNICEF’s collaboration, but also
pointed to the need for more effective collaboration and coordination among UN agencies in the next UN
Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.
Effectiveness
Programme component I: Young children survive, thrive and attain learning outcomes
UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health and health care workers to deliver quality, integrated services to
strengthen the survival of mothers and newborns. This capacity strengthening contributed to an
expansion in facilities providing primary emergency obstetric and newborn care and health facilities
implementing newborn care packages, as well as enabling hospitals to implement the Perinatal Problem
Identification Programme system (PPIP). UNICEF support to the Expanded Programme on Immunization
continued during the period under review, helping to sustain good immunization coverage. Prevention of
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) was further strengthened with the adoption of new guidelines and
training of health care workers to implement these.
x
UNICEF supported interventions aimed at improving community practices in nutrition and hygiene, using
a combination of policy advocacy, strengthening coordination mechanisms and supporting service
delivery, and working in partnership with civil society organizations. With the already poor state of
nutrition of children worsening as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nutrition will require more attention
going forward.
In the area of Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD), UNICEF helped to strengthen systems for
ECCD. The number of trained ECCD facilitators and teachers receiving formal training increased with
support from UNICEF. The subsector however is still challenged by the lack of adequate budgetary
provision and the insufficient numbers of qualified teachers.
UNICEF contributed to increasing access to drinking water services, improving hygiene in schools and
communities and improving sanitation in schools. This contribution was important during the COVID-19
pandemic, as it enabled the Government to reopen schools safely. UNICEF also contributed to
strengthening systems in the water sector through providing technical and financial support to the Office
of the Water Commissioner to strengthen coordination of the sector. While UNICEF’s support to Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) takes place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
challenges of WASH in Lesotho are longstanding ones. UNICEF has an ambitious agenda for the
remaining period of the Country Programme, including supporting the Department of Rural Water Supply
in rehabilitating water supply systems in areas most affected by climate shocks, developing a
management information system to overcome the existing fragmentation of data systems and improve
data governance and influencing policies to mainstream gender and disability in WASH services.
Programme component II: Children and adolescents are protected from violence and HIV and have
improved learning outcomes
UNICEF contributed to the national HIV response through interventions aimed at addressing the infection
rates of HIV among adolescents and young people, especially adolescent girls and young women who
account for a disproportionate number of new infections. The support includes technical assistance to the
Ministry of Health to revise the Antiretroviral Guidelines and Strategy for Accelerated Health of
Adolescents; and technical and financial assistance for the development of national, district and facility-
level HIV targets for improving programme efficiency. HIV services for adolescents and young people
have also been strengthened. UNICEF’s contribution to HIV interventions is made as a member of the UN
Joint Task Team on AIDS and technical working groups of the Ministry of Health, such as the technical
working group on adolescent health.
In the education sector, UNICEF contributed to strengthening systems and capacities of the Ministry of
Education and Training. In addition to advocacy on early childhood education, UNICEF supported policy
development for non-formal education and inclusive education, and provided support for strengthening
the Education Management Information System (EMIS). With the onset of COVID-19, UNICEF supported
the development of the national education response to COVID-19, and mobilized resources for
implementation of the response. UNICEF supported the provision of materials for distance learning to
ensure continuity of learning during COVID-19 restrictions, and aided with the rollout of the Learning
Passport. Children in Lesotho effectively lost two years of schooling and it will require a mammoth effort
from the Government and its development partners to address the learning crisis. The updating of
information on the EMIS is taking longer than expected and there is a risk that information will not be
timely for planning purposes.
To improve access and quality of child protection services, UNICEF contributed to strengthening the
capacities of the Ministries of Home Affairs, Social Development, Justice and Law, and Education and
xi
Training. Achievements include the re-establishment of the Child Helpline in the Ministry of Social
Development, which provides 24-hour access for children in need of support; the launch of the Violence
Against Children Survey report and the development of the National Response Plan to address key
findings of the survey; strengthening national and community level child protection structures; and training
of village child justice committees to increase alternative dispute resolution measures for children at the
community level justice system. UNICEF support to the Ministry of Home Affairs to strengthen the birth
registration system contributed to an increase in registration of births in Lesotho. Social and Behaviour
Change Communications (SBCC) underpinned Child protection measures. Some key informants
expressed the view that, the magnitude of child protection challenges demands that this aspect of the
Country Programme should be prioritized and allocated adequate resources.
Programme component III: Reducing child poverty and enhancing equity and social protection
Building on the previous Country Programme, UNICEF contributed to enhancing social protection for
children in Lesotho through strengthening policies and strategies, and supporting the development and
rollout of shock-responsive social protection. Key results achieved under the current Country Programme
include the development of the National Social Protection Strategy that was adopted by the Government
in 2022 and the updating of the National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA). This system
is the Government’s single registry of socio-economic data on households, and is used for planning
services and targeting beneficiaries of social protection services. Ministries used the database during the
COVID-19 pandemic to identify vulnerable households in need of government assistance. UNICEF’s
technical and financial assistance to the Ministry of Social Development enabled the development and
implementation of a cash transfers plan to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing
Child Programme Grant beneficiaries. Key informants have expressed concern that the updating of the
NISSA is time-consuming and delays may render the information out-of-date.
UNICEF’s support to the Ministry of Finance has enabled the ministry to implement pre-budget public
consultations with the aim of improving the quality and transparency of the public finance budget process.
In addition, UNICEF built capacities in the Ministry of Finance to develop budget briefs for the national
budget, education and social protection. The ministry proposes to extend the development of budget
briefs to other sectors of government, subject to the availability of resources to do so. In the area of child
rights monitoring, UNICEF supported the Government to produce the Child Poverty Report and the
Voluntary National Review (VNR) Report 2022. UNICEF’s work in this area is at an early stage and will be
expanded once it has mobilized necessary resources.
Results at outcome level
Assessment of UNICEF’s contribution at the level of outcomes was made difficult by the lack of updated
national data for measuring outcome level indicators. Where data were available, the evaluation found
positive changes in outcome indicators for social protection, health and children and adolescents’ access
to services. Learning outcomes for children and access to pre-primary education have not progressed. In
the case of learning outcomes, it should be noted that learning outcomes were last rated in 2019 as “not
achieved” and updated data were not available at the time of the evaluation.
The COVID-19 pandemic was a key factor affecting the results of the Country Programme.
Implementation slowed down during periods of restrictions, and attention and resources had to be
diverted to respond to the immediate crisis. Risk factors identified in the theories of change also emerged.
The country experienced political instability during the period under review, with the coalition government
replaced by a new coalition government in 2020. A new government following the elections held on 7
October 2022 has now replaced this coalition government. Like other countries in the sub-region, Lesotho
xii
is experiencing macro-economic challenges and fiscal constraints worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase in resources mobilized by the Government and its
development partners, the larger proportion of resources was directed to the COVID-19 response.
Resources were also redirected/repurposed from other sectors to support the health sector.
Programme effectiveness
The Country Office has adopted sound tools for effective programme management, and diligently tracks
progress against key indicators and targets for programme outputs. The absence of an overarching
theory of change for the Country Programme is a missed opportunity for strengthening programmatic
coherence. UNICEF is contributing to strengthening the policy environment for monitoring and evaluation,
as well as capacities of government officials responsible for monitoring and evaluation. The demand for
strengthening national monitoring and evaluation capacities is large and requires a joint effort with other
UN agencies.
UNICEF has prioritized SBCC but lacks an overarching SBCC strategy, and SBCC initiatives have not
been been evaluated to assess their effectiveness. UNICEF has made good use of partnerships as a tool
for achieving results for children. There is scope for strengthening existing partnerships and increasing
the diversity of partners. The Country Office is developing a partnership strategy with this aim in mind.
Efficiency
UNICEF allocated its financial resources to outputs that were prioritized by the Government for the
response to COVID-19 and for continuity of essential services. A significant proportion of the allocation
went to the social protection output, which achieved positive results for children. Allocations to outputs for
child protection and ECCD-pre-primary education are among the smallest of allocations of the three main
Country Programme outcomes, and these are two areas where progress has been limited. Although staff
resources have been deployed efficiently, the Country Office should explore alternative models for
staffing the Country Office. The decade structure/life cycle approach has largely been effective in
supporting delivery of the Country Programme, and has to some extent fostered programmatic
coherence. There is however a need to strengthen programmatic coherence by crafting an overarching
theory of change for the next Country Programme and an office-wide resource mobilization strategy.
Sustainability
Prospects for the sustainability of results are mixed. The evaluation found examples of interventions that
have good prospects for sustainability. For example, by strengthening the systems and capacities for the
procurement and storage of COVID-19 vaccines, the Ministry of Health is able to use these strengthened
systems for managing other vaccines, including those for routine immunization. The evaluation also found
examples of government ownership, such as the Ministry of Social Development taking over the funding
of two full-time positions in the Child Protection Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Social Development,
which were established with financial support from UNICEF. UNICEF’s partnerships with civil society
organizations also increased the probability of sustainability as these organizations have integrated the
UNICEF interventions into their work programmes.
Fiscal constraints present a major challenge to scaling up interventions and/or institutionalizing in the
budgets of the relevant ministries. The evaluation notes that partnership agreements make provision for
partners to outline sustainability plans once project funding ends. There is however the huge burden of
expectation from government partners that UNICEF will continue to mobilize resources on their behalf to
fund important activities.
xiii
Conclusions and lessons learnt
The evaluation concludes that UNICEF Lesotho has achieved commendable results in a context
challenged first by drought and then by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The agility of the Country
Office, the technical expertise of staff and the relationships with partners have been key enablers of
results. There are areas that can be improved in the current Country Programme, and in anticipation of
the next Country Programme.
UNICEF ensured the relevance of the Country Programme by adapting its mix of strategies to the
changing demands of the country context. While responding to the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
development agenda was not forgotten – UNICEF advocated for continuity in delivery of essential
services for children and adolescents.
Internal coherence of the Country Programme can be improved. The Country Programme lacks an
overarching theory of change, and so synergies between country programme outcomes are not obvious.
Gender equality has not been addressed coherently within the Country Programme, and there is an
absence of office-wide strategies for SBCC, partnerships and resource mobilization. Coherence and
collaboration with other UN agencies, though strong during the implementation of the UN Social and
Economic Response Plan for COVID-19, can be improved.
Overall, the Country Programme is effective, and is likely to achieve at least 75 per cent of the output
targets by the end of 2023. Where achievement of output targets is lagging, there is sufficient time to
address blockages to progress before the end of the current programme cycle. Assessing progress at the
level of outcomes is made difficult by the lack of updated national data, particularly in the health and
education sectors.
While outputs for social protection have mobilized a large volume of resources, other areas such as child
protection have not mobilized sufficient resources to achieve the intended results. In the absence of an
office-wide strategy, resource mobilization is driven by siloed priorities rather than by integrated
programming. The Country Office has utilized staff resources efficiently, but there is scope for considering
alternative models of staffing the Country Office and providing technical assistance to government
partners.
Several results achieved under the Country Programme have good prospects for sustainability as
UNICEF is strengthening systems and the Government has strong ownership of these systems.
UNICEF’s strategies of strengthening existing capacities in government and partnering with civil society
organizations have also contributed to the sustainability of results. While there are examples of the
Government institutionalizing UNICEF-supported programmes and taking over the financing of these, the
budgetary constraints that will remain for the foreseeable future limit the prospects for the Government to
scale up successful interventions.
Key lessons learned from the implementation of the Country Programme are:
1. Focusing on an issue where UNICEF can make a difference, and investing significant resources on
that issue is likely to be more impactful than spreading thinly over a large number of interventions.
2. Responding effectively to a national crisis requires good planning, coordination and collaboration,
even under the extremely difficult conditions such as those experienced during the first year of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
xiv
3. Crosscutting issues such as gender equality, partnerships and social behaviour change and
communication can benefit from specific strategies to guide how they are implemented in the Country
Programme.
4. While technology is an important enabler for development and during periods of crisis, the
practicalities associated with introducing new technology should be considered carefully, and
attention paid to the sustainability of the technology.
5. Quality, disaggregated data are essential for the effective planning, implementation, monitoring and
reporting progress of the Country Programme.
Recommendations
The evaluation makes strategic and operational recommendations, which should be acted upon within the
next six months (short-term) or within the next 12 months (medium-term). These recommendations are for
the consideration of and implementation by UNICEF Lesotho, with the support of UNICEF Eastern and
Southern Africa. Partners in Government, development partners and civil society partners may also wish
to reflect on these recommendations to shape their future partnerships with UNICEF.
Priority Time frame
Recommendations for the next Country Programme
Recommendation 1: UNICEF should improve the design of the next High Short-term
Country Programme by developing a theory of change for the
Country Programme and nested theories of change for the
components of the Country Programme.
Recommendation 2: UNICEF should develop a gender strategy for High Short-term
the next Country Programme, and start the process by conducting a
gender programmatic review.
Recommendation 3: UNICEF should retain the life cycle approach High Medium-term
in the design and implementation of the next Country Programme.
The Country Office should be more deliberate in pursuing
programmatic coherence and collaboration across work sections or
units.
Recommendation 4: UNICEF should identify one or two issues as a High Medium-term
focus for the next Country Programme. This does not lessen the
importance of other issues, and is intended to serve as a flagship for
positioning UNICEF to play a key influencing role and have a
significant impact.
Recommendations for the current Country Programme
Recommendation 5: UNICEF should review the current programme High Short-term
portfolio, identify projects or activities that could be scaled down at
the end of the current Country Programme cycle, and put in place
action plans for their sustainability. The review should also identify
areas that could be scaled up and are likely to continue in the next
Country Programme. UNICEF should also address the challenges
identified with two important systems, namely, the NISSA and the
EMIS.
xv
Recommendation 6: UNICEF should develop strategies for High Medium-term
enabling and enhancing programme effectiveness. This includes
developing a Country Programme monitoring framework, finalizing
the partnership strategy, developing a resource mobilization strategy
and ensuring that SBCC strategies are embedded in programmes.
Recommendation 7: UNICEF should conduct an internal review of Medium Medium-term
all outcome and output indicators to ensure that they are consistent
with the CPD, the annual work plans (AWPs) and the Results
Assessment Module (RAM) report

1 CONTEXT OF THE EVALUATION
1.1 Development context
The Kingdom of Lesotho is a landlocked country situated within the borders of South Africa.
Geographically, Lesotho is small (30,355 square kilometres) with a high altitude. It has a population of
2.1 million, of which about 38 per cent are children and adolescents.2
Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy, with King Letsie III as Head of State and the Prime Minister as
Head of Government. Parliament comprises a National Assembly with 120 members and a Senate
with 33 members. A general election was held on 7 October 2022.3
Lesotho's national development aspirations and priorities are expressed in the National Vision 2020
and the NSDP II (2018/19–2022/23). The National Vision states, "By the year 2020 Lesotho shall
be a stable democracy, a united and prosperous nation at peace with itself and its neighbours.
It shall have a healthy and well-developed human resource base. Its economy will be strong,
its environment well managed and its technology well established”.4 Employment creation and
the achievement of inclusive economic growth are overarching targets of NSDP II. It is envisaged that
the achievement of macro targets will lead to poverty reduction, social inclusion and protection of the
environment.
The United Nations classifies Lesotho as a LDC – defined as having a low income and facing severe
structural impediments to sustainable development. The classification is based on gross national
income, assessment of human assets and assessment of Lesotho’s economic and environmental
vulnerability.5 Yet the World Bank classifies Lesotho as a lower middle-income country.6
Lesotho’s national poverty line (2017/18) is Lesotho loti 648.88 and its poverty rate is 49.7 per cent.7
The poverty rate is higher in rural areas (60.7 per cent) than urban areas (28.5 per cent). Poverty
reduction between 2002/03 and 2017/18 favoured urban areas (which have reduced from 41.5 per
cent in 2002/03) whereas there has been little change in poverty rates in rural areas (61.3 per cent in
2 Lesotho Bureau of Statistics, Lesotho Census, 2016.
3 The Independent Electoral Commission of Lesotho declared that the Revolution for Prosperity (RFP) party won
the most seats in the National Assembly, but did not achieve a two-thirds majority. The RFP will therefore govern
in coalition with other parties: <www.gov.ls/rfp-wins-the-2022-national-assembly-elections>.

6 The World Bank classifies lower middle-income countries as those with a Gross National Income (GNI) of
1,460–4,095 USD per capita (July 2021 income classification threshold). GNI per capita only reflects national
average income and does not take into account how governments spend income, nor does it measure the impact
of government spending on human development.

2002/03).8 The poverty levels of Lesotho are higher than those of other member countries of the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), namely Botswana, Eswatini, Namibia and South Africa.
Lesotho's modest economic growth in 2019 slowed down further in 2020, primarily due to the COVID-
19 pandemic lockdowns, business closures and border closures. Real GDP growth is estimated to
have contracted by 1.2 per cent, 0.4 per cent and 9.5 per cent in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.9
Lesotho has a high fiscal deficit mainly due to massive health spending in responding to the COVID-
19 pandemic. This deficit is likely to remain high if revenues from the SACU continue to decline. The
economy began to recover in 2021/22, and GDP growth is projected at 2.3 per cent for 2022/23 and
2.5 per cent for 2023/24, averaging 2.8 per cent over the medium term.10
Lesotho is vulnerable to the impact of climate change, and over the past decade it has experienced
successive climate shocks in the form of recurrent droughts and floods. These climate shocks impact
negatively on livelihoods and food security, as nearly 75 per cent of the population rely on agriculture
for their livelihoods. Climate change also exacerbates existing environmental stresses such as land
degradation and loss of biodiversity.11
Lesotho falls within the low human development category, with a HDI value of 0.514 in 2021,
positioning it at 168 out of 191 countries in 2021. Table 1 shows the comparison between the 2019
and 2021 human development indicators for Lesotho. Most indicators show a regression, undoubtedly
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 Human Development Report states that this decline
is evident globally as the world face new kinds of uncertainty that layer and interact to form a new
uncertainty complex.12

1.2 Situation of children and adolescents
According to the 2020 study on multi-dimensional child poverty in Lesotho, almost all children in
Lesotho experience at least one deprivation, and as many as 45.5 per cent of Lesotho’s children aged
0–17 years are multi-dimensionally poor – they experience three or more deprivations out of eight,
simultaneously.13 When disaggregated by age group, children 0–23 months are more likely to be
multi-dimensionally poor than those in the older age category. As many as 68.8 per cent of Basotho
children under 24 months are multi-dimensionally poor, compared to 38.2 per cent of children 5–12
years. The most common deprivations experienced by children 0–23 months are protection from
violence, housing and nutrition. The lack of birth registration, lack of access to electricity and
frequency of meals were found to be the main causes of deprivation for this age group. Housing,
sanitation and education are the most commonly experienced deprivations for children of school-
going age (5–17 years). The study also found that children in rural areas, particularly children living in
the mountain ecological zone, experience more deprivations than their urban counterparts.14 The
study is based on data collected in 2018, predating the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely
that child poverty has worsened since then.
13 These dimensions are water, sanitation, housing, access to information, education, nutrition, health and
protection from violence.

Child mortality (children under 5 years) has declined slowly since 2017, but remains high at 89.5 per
1,000 live births in 2020, and is much higher for boys (96.8) than for girls (81.9). Infant mortality and
neonatal mortality are 70 and 44 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Common causes of death
amongst children include prematurity, birth asphyxia, pneumonia and malnutrition15. Maternal mortality
is 554 per 100,000 live births (2017). Despite the high rates of skilled birth attendance, there are wide
disparities between urban and rural areas (90 per cent vs. 73 per cent) and wealth quintiles (richest,
94 per cent; poorest, 60 per cent).16 Registration of births of children under 5 years is low at 43.5 per
cent and 45.5 per cent for females and males, respectively.17
According to the DHS 2014, more than two-thirds (68.6 per cent) of children aged 12–23 months had
received all the basic vaccinations, however there were geographical and socio-economic
disparities.18 For instance, only 47.5 per cent children in Mokhotlong, one of the highland districts with
very hard to reach areas, and only 59.7 per cent of children in the lowest wealth quintile had received
all the basic vaccines. Routine immunization has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, shifting the focus of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) to the COVID-19
vaccination rollout since the second half of 2021. The country witnessed a 5 per cent decrease in
MCV1 and stagnation in DTP3 coverage compared to 2020.19
Lesotho has a very high prevalence of stunting of children under 5 years (estimated at 32.1 per cent
for 2020). It is well established that persistent malnutrition can cause long-term irreversible physical
and cognitive damage to children. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common micronutrient
deficiency amongst children aged 6–59 months. Food insecurity in Lesotho was exacerbated further
by the COVID-19 pandemic, directly impacting the nutritional well being of children. A computerized

SMS-based survey conducted by UNICEF in Lesotho between June and August 2021 showed that
only one in three children were fed with the minimum meal frequency and at least 40 per cent of
children were fed smaller quantities of nutritious foods, such as vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables,
pulses, dairy, eggs, meat, poultry and fish due to the COVID-19 pandemic.20
Lesotho has the second-highest HIV prevalence in the world and the impact of HIV on women and
children continues to be significant. Young women (10–24 years) and adolescent girls (10–19 years)
in particular account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. In 2019, HIV incidence in
young women stood at 1.5 per cent, nearly three times that of young men (0.6 per cent), while over
12,000 children in Lesotho are estimated to be living with HIV and 1,000 children were newly infected
with HIV.21 The rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is 8 [5-10] per cent in 2021.22
Lesotho has made significant progress in its HIV response, including in achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-
90 targets; 90 per cent of people living with HIV are now aware of their HIV status; 97 per cent of
those who know their HIV status are on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 92 per cent of those
on ART are virologically suppressed. Lesotho is categorized as a country at national epidemic control,
defined as the point at which new HIV infections have decreased and fall below the total number of
deaths among HIV-infected individuals.
The root causes of poor health outcomes, particularly among mothers, newborns and children in
Lesotho are directly linked: uneven access and poor-quality of primary health care and social
determinants, such as poverty, socio-economic and geographical inequalities.23
While Lesotho provides free and compulsory primary education, with a net enrolment rate of 85 per
cent prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, at the pre-primary level the enrolment rate is low. The main
service providers are private and/or faith-based organizations such as churches. Only 3 out of 10
children attend any form of pre-primary education.24 Despite high levels of enrolment at the primary
level, completion rates drop drastically at secondary level.25 At primary level the completion rate is 80
per cent, which drops to 33 per cent at lower secondary level and even further to 13 per cent at higher
secondary level. Achieving quality education outcomes is a persistent challenge for Lesotho, even
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 15 per cent of children aged 7–14 years demonstrated
foundational numeracy skills and 45 per cent demonstrated foundational reading skills in English or
Sesotho.26 The last Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality
(SACMEQ) for Grade 6 also highlighted that while an average child gets over 8 years of schooling, in
effect the learning adjusted period is only 5.5 years. School closures during 2020 due to COVID-19
are likely to have had a negative impact on education outcomes in the short and medium-term. The
NSDP II highlighted the mismatch between learning and skills as one of the key challenges.

According to the Violence Against Children and Youth Survey 2018, 7.3 per cent of females aged 13–
17 had experienced sexual violence in the 12 months preceding the survey. For the most recent
incident of sexual violence, former intimate partners (42.6 per cent); classmates or schoolmates (22.0
per cent); friends (12.5 per cent); neighbours (10.7 per cent); and strangers (10.3 per cent) were
commonly the perpetrators of the violence. Estimates for sexual violence against males were found
by the study to be unreliable. Males were slightly more likely to experience physical violence than
females. Among the 13–17 year olds surveyed, 21.1 per cent of females reported experiencing
physical violence in the 12 months preceding the survey, and this was the case for 27.1 per cent of
males. Among 13–17 year olds, 6.9 per cent of females experienced emotional violence by a parent
or caregiver, compared to 3.8 per cent of males; 22.4 per cent and 20.4 per cent of females and
males, respectively, experienced peer emotional violence.27 Children also experience overlapping
violence; for example, they may experience emotional violence as well as physical violence. The
survey highlighted health conditions associated with violence, including the risk of HIV.
According to the 2018 MICS, 31.9 per cent of 5–17 year olds were engaged in child labour.28 Two-
thirds of children engaged in economic activities were engaged in herding animals, and in most
instances (82.3 per cent), these were males.

1.3 The COVID-19 pandemic
The Government of Lesotho declared a state of emergency on 18 March 2020, with a national
lockdown for all non-essential services. The Government of Lesotho also established the National
Emergency Command Centre (NECC) in early 2020. Led by a cabinet sub-committee and the Ministry
of Health, the centre developed and managed the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic.31
The structure included government officials, as well as partners from civil society and the United
Nations in Lesotho. The Disaster Management Authority (DMA) is responsible for coordinating the
NECC. The National COVID-19 Secretariat supported the work of the NECC, and was dismantled in
April 2022. Lesotho recorded 34,490 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 706 deaths between 3
January 2020 and 26 September 2022. A total of 1,102,069 vaccine doses have been administered,
872,661 persons were fully vaccinated, and 1,631,364 persons received at least one dose of
vaccine.32
The early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is evident when reviewing Lesotho's progress on the
Agenda 2030. Table 2 shows a comparison of progress on SDGs relevant to the Country Programme,
pre-COVID 19 and during COVID-19. Lesotho’s VNR report (2019) was prepared prior to the onset of
COVID-19, and showed that Lesotho was improving moderately on SDGs 2, 4, 5 and 6, and
significant challenges for SDGs 1, 3 and 16. Furthermore, there was no regressing on any SDGs
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
30 The data on secondary completion rates were obtained from the UNICEF Education Fact Sheet 2021. The
figures are based on the 2018 MICS data and are therefore reflected in the 2018 column of the table.

The updated Common Country Analysis (CCA, 2020) shows Lesotho regressed in five SDGs 1, 2, 3,
6 and 16),33 and experiencing major challenges in SDG4. Prior to 2019, there was moderate progress
in SDG 2 (Zero hunger) and SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), but these areas experienced major
challenges during the COVID-19 period. On the positive side, Lesotho is on track with SDG 17
(Partnerships). Also, SDG 5 (Gender equality) is experiencing some challenges, but to a lesser extent
than the other SDGs.
Lesotho’s VNR report (2022)34 found that, while the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to setbacks in
progress towards the 2030 Agenda, the pandemic provided opportunities for the country to ‘build back
better’. The opportunities for building back are found in the national response to the COVID-19
pandemic. The Government and its partners, including UNICEF, in addition to addressing the
immediate health crisis, sought to strengthen the social protection system and provide continuity in
teaching and learning, as well as investing in improving access to clean water.

2 OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION
The UNICEF Country Programme 2019–2023 is the object of the evaluation.
2.1 Overview of the Country Programme
The vision of the Country Programme 2019–2023, as set out in the CPD, is "to reach every child,
everywhere, with opportunities to survive, develop and reach her or his full potential". The
Government of Lesotho is UNICEF's main partner in achieving the vision of the Country Programme.
UNICEF uses the following mutually reinforcing strategies to implement the Country Programme:
(a) Addressing data and evidence gaps, and using data and evidence for policy advocacy
(b) Using sector platforms to enhance the delivery of multisectoral interventions, and in turn, improve
service delivery, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations
(c) Accelerating low-cost, high-impact interventions using primary health care and health systems
strengthening approaches
(d) Refocusing on equity and its contribution to the realization of child rights while maximizing space
for innovative strategies in under-served areas
(e) Leveraging resources through innovative financing models for effective and efficient public
finance for children
UNICEF implements the Country Programme through three programme components, namely:
Component 1: Young children survive, thrive and attain learning outcomes. This component
supports (a) integrated maternal and newborn health interventions including HIV prevention,
treatment, care and support; (b) interventions towards reducing stunting in children; (c) access to
early childhood development, pre-primary and primary education particularly for children with
disabilities and children in marginalized and disadvantaged communities; (d) strengthening the civil
registration system, in particular, birth registration; and (e) strengthening the child protection system.
Component 2: Children and adolescents are protected from violence and HIV and have
improved learning outcomes. This component comprises three elements, namely, ensuring the
right of children and adolescents to protection from violence and exploitation, reducing HIV infections
among adolescents with a focus on girls and helping children to achieve optimal learning outcomes
through access to quality education options.
Component 3: Reducing child poverty and enhancing equity and social protection. Specific
priorities of UNICEF under this component are (a) strengthening public finance for children, so that all
children benefit optimally from government budgets at the central and decentralized levels; (b)
supporting the establishment of an integrated child-sensitive, gender and shock-responsive social
protection system; and (c) supporting robust evidence generation to inform social and economic
policies and programmes for children.
The Country Programme sets out measures to ensure that it achieves impactful results for children.
These programme effectiveness measures include programme performance monitoring and
evaluation, the application of results-based management to ensure rigour in planning and monitoring,
evidence-based advocacy and partnerships and the use of communication for development.
The Country Programme is aligned with the development priorities set out in NSDP II 2019–2023, the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
9
(CRPD), the SDGs, the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018–2021, and the regional priorities of UNICEF
Eastern and Southern Africa. The Country Programme is expected to contribute to the United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Lesotho.
2.2 Results framework of the Country Programme
Table 4 shows the outputs and outcomes of the Country Programme approved by the Executive
Board in 2018. Although the CPD delineates the three programme components, the programme
components are interrelated and it is expected that activities from different components be linked
programmatically for more impactful results. This convergence can be thematic, for example, different
programme components involved in birth registration, or it can be geographic, such as different
components working in the same community so that their respective interventions are mutually
reinforcing.

the country.
Output 4.3: Guidance, tools and resources for effective

available to UNICEF and its partners.
The Country Office monitors and reports on the progress towards achievement of outputs and
outcomes through 13 outcome indicators and 37 output indicators, as shown in Table xx. The number
of indicators is not onerous, and the perusal of the Country Office RAM report found that the Country
Office has managed to report against the output indicators. Assessing progress on outcome indicators
however presents a challenge. The outcome indicators are standard indicators for UNICEF and have
baselines and targets to be achieved by the end of the country programme cycle. The evaluation
observed that the main sources for measuring the indicators for Outcome 1 are national sources,
namely, the District Health Information System 2, the Demographic and Health Surveys, and
Education Sector reports. Outcome 2 has an indicator that depends on national education sector
reports. If these national sources do not have updated information, as was the case, it presents a
challenge for assessing progress at the level of outcomes.
The evaluation observed shortcomings in the reporting of some of the output indicators. The reporting
in many instances did not include sex-disaggregated data where it would have been useful to have
disaggregated data. There were also several instances where reporting only referred to the number,
for example, the number of adolescents reached or the number of districts covered. Reporting the
number only does not give a sense of the scale of the result. For example, coverage of three districts
could either be 100 per cent coverage if the target was three districts, or it could be 30 per cent if the
intention was to cover all 10 districts.

2.3 Rights holders
The Country Programme seeks to enable duty bearers (the Government and its ministries) meet their
obligations to ensure that the needs and rights of children and their parents/caregivers are met.
Children as rights holders are the primary beneficiaries of the interventions under the Country
Programme. Outcome 1 addresses the needs and rights of children 0-9 years to quality health care
that will ensure their survival at birth, their right to health and nutritious food that will enable them to
grow into healthy adults, and their needs for early stimulation and development to serve as a solid
foundation for learning. Outcome 1 also has mothers, including young mothers, as rights holders to
quality maternal health and HIV services, to ensure their survival and the survival of their children in
childbirth, and the prevention/elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Under Outcome 2,
the rights holders are children and adolescents (10-19 years). The outcome addresses the rights of
children to education, health services, including sexual health reproduction, and protection against all
forms of violence. The rights holders under Outcome 3 are children as beneficiaries of a responsive
social protection system and social policies for the realization of their rights.
While the Country Programme seeks to support the realization of the rights of all children in Lesotho,
it also emphasizes the importance of gender-responsiveness in the design and implementation of
interventions. The interventions therefore take into account the different needs of girls and boys, for
example, in the learning environment, in child protection, and in health services.
Section 1.2 of the Country Programme Evaluation report provides information on the status of children
and adolescents in Lesotho. The Country Programme seeks to address, for example, the needs and
rights of the 45.5 per cent of children 0-17 years who are multi-dimensionally poor, the estimated 32
per cent of children under-five years whose growth has been stunted by food insecurity and the lack
of good nutrition, and address the different forms of violence experienced by girls and boys in
Lesotho.
2.4 Geographic coverage
The Country Programme has a national coverage, that is, all 10 administrative districts of Lesotho. It
seeks to benefit all children primarily through strengthening national policy frameworks and systems,
hence the national coverage. In testing service delivery approaches and interventions, or responding
to humanitarian emergencies, the Country Programme targets particular districts in the country. For
example, the rehabilitation of water facilities targeted the seven most drought affected districts in
12
Lesotho, and the training of early childhood educators targeted three rural districts, namely, Mafeteng
Mohale’s Hoek, and Quthing. These districts are less developed than the districts of Maseru and
Berea.
2.5 Theory of change
2.5.1 Theories of change for programme components
UNICEF Lesotho prepared detailed strategy notes for each programme component, in accordance
with UNICEF requirements. The strategy notes provide a detailed description of the situation of
children in Lesotho, the bottlenecks that need to be addressed, and the strategies to deliver the
outputs that contribute to the achievement of the outcomes of the Country Programme. The strategy
notes include a narrative of the theory of change for the respective programme components. The
diagrammatic representations of the theory of change are included in Annex G.
Theory of change: First Decade (0 to 9 years)
The theory of change posits the following: If children are fully vaccinated, and together with the
mother receive quality care during and immediately following birth including treatment to prevent HIV
transmission, children’s births are registered, children are treated for illnesses, children are
exclusively breastfed, stimulated and are given diversified nutritious diets for the first two years of life,
and beyond three years of age children receive quality education, then children in Lesotho will survive
(under-five mortality reduced), thrive (under-five stunting reduced) and achieve age appropriate
learning outcomes.
This overarching theory of change for the First Decade (Outcome 1) has nested theories of change
for each output that contributes to Outcome 1, and these in turn inform the strategies and approaches
to achieving the intended results for each of the outputs. For example, the theory of change for Output
1.1 proposes that UNICEF Lesotho supports systems strengthening for the expansion of
immunization and early infant diagnosis, enhance capacities for the storage and distribution of
vaccines, and support the Ministry of Home Affairs with innovative technology to enable the
registration of children, including those who live in hard-to-reach areas.
For Output 1.2, the theory of change proposes strategies that include capacity strengthening of a
range of service providers involved in addressing infant and young child feeding and reducing
micronutrient deficiencies, and support for the multi-sectoral Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) platform. The
theory of change for Output 1.2 identifies synergies between positive nutrition outcomes and access
to and use of safe water and sanitation facilities and good hygiene. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
(WASH) became more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was confirmed as a separate
output in 2021.
For Output 1.3, the theory of change proposes that if parents are engaged in positive parenting
including stimulation, play and development for children 0-2 years, and children 3-5 years have
access to pre-primary education and quality school readiness interventions, then they will perform
well in subsequent years of school, repetition rates and early school-leaving rates are reduced, and
children are more likely to complete their secondary education. The theory of change also
emphasizes the necessity for education that is inclusive of children with disabilities, and children from
marginalised and disadvantaged communities.
13
Theory of change: Second Decade (10-19 years)
The theory of change logic at the Outcome level is: If UNICEF addresses key issues and blockages
that influence the well-being of children and adolescents, including their education, skills
development, protection from violence, in an integrated manner, this will contribute to the overall
development of children and adolescents in Lesotho. Furthermore, if the capacities of duty bearers in
health, education, and child protection systems are strengthened, duty bearers can provide
accessible, quality, gender-responsive services to children and adolescents. If children and
adolescents are aware of and experience these services as child- and adolescent-friendly, the
demand for quality services will increase, and duty bearers in turn will change and improve their
services to respond to the demand for services.
The theory of change is further elaborated that the level of outputs. For Output 2.1, if adolescent have
the knowledge and understanding of their rights, health, especially on HIV, they can be empowered to
demand SRH and HIV services that are responsive to their needs. If the demand for HIV prevention
among adolescents at risk is increased, then the risk of new infections among adolescents is reduced.
If the demand for treatment adherence among adolescents living with HIV is increased, then AIDS
related deaths would be reduced. If new infections and AIDS related deaths among adolescents are
reduced, then Lesotho will move closer towards having an AIDS-free generation.
The logic underpinning Output 2.2 is: If the school environment, governance and parental
engagement are strengthened or improved, the quality of teaching and learning is improved, which in
turn improves the learning outcomes for children. Specifically, if teachers are capacitated with the
knowledge and skills they need to be effective teachers, then the quality of teaching improves, and in
turn improves the quality of learning and learning outcomes. If the most disadvantaged adolescents
including those with disabilities have access to learning, and if adolescents who are out of school
have access to quality alternative education solutions and alternative pathways to education, they can
achieve learning outcomes.
The logic for Output 2.3 is: If the knowledge and skills of children/adolescents, caregivers, law
enforcement and other government officials including teachers, and civil society organizations and
community organizations are enhanced, then they will be able to identify and report cases of sexual
violence and child marriage to the appropriate authorities, and law enforcement authorities will
respond within the standard operating procedures and legal prescripts. If religious leaders, teachers,
community leaders and other gatekeepers and decision-makers in local communities are persuaded
to promote positive socio-cultural norms, attitudes and practices, this will contribute to prevention and
reduction of violence against children and adolescents.
Theory of change: Reducing child poverty, enhancing equity and social protection
At the Outcome level, the theory of change can be summarized as: If the capacities of the
Government are strengthened to improve social policies, strategies and programmes, then children in
Lesotho, especially the most vulnerable children, will benefit from a system of social protection that is
gender-responsive, and have their rights realized in a sustainable manner. The theory of change is
expanded upon at the level of outputs. Output 3.1 proposes that: If the Government is supported to
establish and integrated social protection system, then an appropriate mechanism for the
identification of vulnerabilities will be in place, there will be appropriate policies and laws for social
protection, there will be an institutional and administrative structure in place to effectively identify
vulnerable populations, particularly children and their families, the social protection system will be
multi-faceted and coordinated, enabling the Government and partners to address multiple and
compounding vulnerabilities of children and families, in emergency and non-emergency situations.
14
The second leg of the theory of change (Output 3.2) addresses the issue of public finance for
children. The logic is that; If Government officials have their capacities strengthened, and if advocacy
to strengthen public finance for children is pursued, then policy makers and decision-makers will pay
attention to children’s issues when decisions on budget allocation are made. This attention will
contribute to increasing the size of, and equity of the allocation, improve transparency and
accountability of the national budget for basic social services, and enhance spending efficiency and
value for money.
Effective decision-making requires reliable, quality data. The logic for Output 3.3 is: If the capacities of
Government institutions, research organizations and civil society organizations are strengthened, then
they will be able to generate real-time data and evidence to monitor the situation of children in
Lesotho. This monitoring in turn will contribute to evidence-led advocacy for the adoption of policies,
strategies and the equitable investment public resources.
Assumptions and risks
The theories of change in the strategy notes identified assumptions and risks. The common
assumptions were the commitment of the Government and the adequacy of financial and human
resources in Government to implement the interventions needed to achieve the outputs and
contribute to the outcomes of the Country Programme. The issue of Government financial resources
is especially pertinent for the sustainability of the results achieved under the Country Programme.
The strategy notes also identified major risks, namely, political instability, macro-economic instability
and climate change. As mentioned in the country context section of the evaluation report, political
instability in the period preceding the current programme cycle and during the programme cycle is a
key consideration as it affects the pace of implementation, as well as the extent to which the
Government is willing to adopt reforms to systems and legal frameworks. Lesotho’s economic
vulnerability is another major risk as it limits the availability of public resources for development,
including, public resources for children. The risk of climate change and natural disasters are high, as
discussed under the section on the country context.
2.5.2 Assessment of the theories of change
The theories of change for the programme components have an internal logic that links the outputs of
the particular programme component to the outcome of that programme component. Individually, the
theories of change are sufficiently detailed to use in the analysis of the effectiveness of the Country
Programme, and understanding the enablers and constraints to the results achieved.
The theories of change for Component 1 and Component 3 usefully identify synergies between the
outputs in the component and it is clear how the outputs collectively contribute to the outcome of the
programme component. The synergies between outputs for Component 2 are not as explicit, and the
outputs appear as three discrete programmes.
Although the theories of change for each programme component broadly follow a similar outline, they
differ markedly in the level of detail, presentation and the diagrammatic representation of the theory of
change. It is clear that each programme team in the Country Office was responsible for the
preparation of the theory of change for their respective components. However, the three theories of
change were not consolidated into an overarching theory of change for the Country Programme. This
is a missed opportunity to identify synergies between the programme components and improve the
internal coherence of the Country Programme. The evaluation constructed a high-level theory of
change summarizing the key elements of the theories of change of the three programme components.

3 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF
THE EVALUATION
3.1 Evaluation purpose
The evaluation serves the dual purpose of learning and accountability. Specifically, the purpose of the
evaluation is to:
• Identify best practices, results and key lessons learned from the design, planning and
implementation of the Country Programme. The intention is to use the results of the CPE to
inform the development of the next UNICEF CPD.
• Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national and international stakeholders.
• Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to the Executive Board.
Discussions with UNICEF Lesotho indicated that the evaluation would be used to inform the
forthcoming evaluation of the UNDAF, the development of the UNSDCF and the Country Programme
for UNICEF 2024–2028. They also indicated that the results of the evaluation could assist in making
improvements to current Country Programme for the remaining 18 months of current project cycle.
Table 7 shows the main audiences for the CPE and their interests and potential use of the results of
the CPE. The potential uses of and interest in the evaluation are based on the inception consultations
with the Country Office. The consultation included individual discussions with the Representative and
Deputy Representative to ascertain the most important issues they wished the evaluation to cover or
matters that required emphasis. These discussions were followed by a discussion with the Country
Management Team to outline the evaluation process and proposed methodology, and to solicit their
views on the key evaluation questions.

Government of Lesotho Evidence of results achieved through the Country Programme and
recommendations for improvement by UNICEF and Government.
Specifically, the Ministries of Health, Social Development and
Education and Training as the main partners of UNICEF can use
the results of the evaluation to strengthen their responses to the
gaps and challenges identified in the evaluation, and build on the
results achieved to date. The results of the evaluation can also be
used by other ministries, for example, Home Affairs, Justice and
Development Planning to develop strategies and mobilize resources
to address gaps and challenges in areas related to their mandates.
21
Civil society organizations The organizations that have partnered with UNICEF in the
implementation of the Country Programme can use the results of
the evaluation to strengthen implementation of their programmes
and to plan and mobilize resources for scaling up or expanding
interventions.
Development partners Development partners, including the EU Delegation, the Global
Partnership for Education and PEPFAR can use the evaluation
results for their own assessment of their partnerships with UNICEF.
There are other development partners who may not have
contributed financially to UNICEF but play an important role in the
development cooperation in Lesotho. They can use the results of
the evaluation to identify areas opportunities for partnership with
UNICEF, and coherence with other development partners in
Lesotho.
UN Country Team Lesotho The UN Country Team has an interest in the results of the
evaluation. The results will serve as input to the UNDAF evaluation,
and therefore reduce the need to cover the same ground as the
UNICEF evaluation. The results of the evaluation will also be used
in development of the UNSDCF.
UNICEF ESARO UNICEF ESARO can use the results of the evaluation to identify
areas where the Lesotho Country Office requires additional
technical support. It can also use the results of the evaluation in the
ESARO contribution to the Lesotho UNSDCF process.
UNICEF Executive Board Evidence of results achieved through the Country Programme and
recommendations for improvement/consideration in the next CPD
3.2 Evaluation objectives
The objectives for the evaluation as confirmed by the Lesotho Country Office in the inception phase
are:
(a) To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability of the
Lesotho Country Programme from its inception to the present, with particular attention on equity,
gender equality, behavioural and social change for development, risk-informed programming,
convergence of programme components and achieving results at scale, as well as UNICEF's
strategic positioning in relation to its child rights mandate.
(b) To identify and document key lessons learned, good practices and innovations in implementing
the current 2019–2023 Country Programme, which can inform and support advocacy efforts for
scale-up and replication.
(c) To provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen programmatic
strategies in the design of the next Lesotho Country Programme, taking into consideration
national development priorities and plans and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in
the country.
These evaluation objectives coincide with objectives set out under Section 4 of the Terms of
Reference. There was a discrepancy between these objectives and the objectives on the first page of
22
the Terms of Reference that included an objective to reflect on UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic and its implications for building resilience. During the inception phase this discrepancy was
clarified and the objectives under Section 4 of the Terms of Reference were confirmed as the main
objectives of the evaluation. UNICEF’s responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic would be covered
by key evaluation question 4 and integrated into findings for other questions, as may be appropriate.
3.3 Evaluation scope
The scope of the evaluation included all UNICEF activities implemented under the Country
Programme (2019-2023), including emergency and humanitarian activities. The period covered by the
evaluation is from January 2019 to August 2022. The formal Country Programme Document approved
by the Executive Board was used as the basis for the evaluation. It took into consideration changes
the Country Office made to the outputs, indicators and targets of the Country Programme at its
Strategic Moment of Reflection (2021).
The evaluation scope was comprehensive, inclusive of all activities and funding sources. It assessed
each programme component and related outputs in terms of the programme strategies: policy advice,
systems strengthening, and service delivery intensification, and the appropriate mix of these
strategies for the country context. While the evaluation was not expected to assess the impact of the
Country Programme, it was required to make an assessment of progress towards the targets set for
the outcomes of the Country Programme. The evaluation did not examine the operational activities of
the Country Office in detail, and instead reflected on these under the questions relating to the
efficiency of the Country Programme in the allocation and use of financial and human resources.
In the case of humanitarian action, the evaluation assessed UNICEF’s response to the emergency
aspect of the COVID-19 response, noting that the COVID-19 emergency was also used as a basis for
developmental interventions. The humanitarian action in response to the 2019 drought also formed
part of the scope of the evaluation.
The evaluation paid particular attention to UNICEF’s strategic positioning as the agency with the
mandate on child rights, within the development community in Lesotho. Here the evaluation paid
close attention to the views of national partners in Government and civil society, about UNICEF’s
strategic positioning in relation to other UN entities, UNICEF’s added value and its use of its
comparative strengths.
The Terms of Reference required the evaluation to examine issues of equity, gender equality and
convergence of programme components. The evaluation covered gender equality as a crosscutting
theme and included gender equality in the key evaluation questions, and in specific questions used in
the key informant interviews. Where available, the evaluation results used sex-disaggregated data in
reporting. The evaluation sought to address the issue of equity in the design of the evaluation by
identifying field mission project sites that included highly disadvantaged districts in the rural areas of
Lesotho. Inclusion was also covered in the evaluation, paying attention to the issue of children with
disabilities and the necessity for their inclusion in the education system.
The evaluation paid attention to the issue of coherence and synergy. Here, it examined coherence
within the Country Programme, if and how the components of Country Programme connected to
generate results, and coherence how the teams in the Country Office collaborated across their
respective sections. The evaluation also assessed the alignment of the Country Programme with
UNICEF’s global commitments expressed in the Gender Action Plan 2018-2021, the Convention of
the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
23
3.4 Methodology
3.4.1 Evaluation approach
The evaluation followed a theory-based approach, assessing the results of the interventions against
the theories of change developed for each of the programme components and the targets set for the
outputs of each programme component, assessing the extent to which the assumptions for achieving
results held true and also taking into account the risks that materialized during the implementation of
the Country Programme.
Given the objectives of the evaluation, it was essential that the evaluation be designed, conducted
and reported in a way that would ensure its use by the Country Office and interested stakeholders.
The evaluation therefore consulted and sought the inputs of the Country Office at all critical stages of
the evaluation. The Country Office made inputs to the draft Terms of Reference. To launch the
evaluation, the evaluation consultant made a presentation to the Country Office Management Team
on the objectives, purpose and scope of the evaluation, and to obtain their comments on the draft key
evaluation questions. The presentation also sought to mobilize their support for the evaluation. The
Country Office was also given the opportunity to provide comments on the draft inception report, and
their comments were taken into consideration in finalizing the inception report. Each section of the
Country Office was consulted on the list of potential key informants and made inputs to the sampling
of projects for the field mission. The preliminary findings and areas of recommendation were shared
with the Country Office at a workshop, and they were also given the opportunity to provide written
comments on the preliminary findings. The draft evaluation report was shared with the Country Office,
and they were given a substantial period (three weeks) to submit written comments on the draft
evaluation report. There were further follow-ups with the Country Office to verify information and
clarify their inputs.
The evaluation observed the norms and standards of UNEG and the Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation.36 The inception report identified ethical considerations for the evaluation and these were
adhered to in the main phase of the evaluation. Prospective key informants received a letter (email)
invitation informing them of the evaluation and inviting them to participate in an interview. On
receiving their written agreement (email confirmation) to participate, the interviews were scheduled
and key informants received questions in advance. At the beginning of each interview, key informants
were reminded that their participation was voluntary, and they could opt out if they wished. The
evaluation consultant outlined the interview process, and the conditions of confidentiality and
anonymity, and only proceeded once they confirmed that they were satisfied to proceed. UNICEF
officials were not present in interviews conducted with stakeholders and partners. The evaluation did
not interview rights holders (children and adolescents) and thus no ethical clearance was required.
The evaluation aimed to be gender-responsive in its design and implementation. The interview guides
contained questions on gender equality, asking for examples of how interventions contributed to
gender equality. The selection of project sites for field visits included those where young women were
the direct beneficiaries of the project (2Gether4SRH) and Updating of the NISSA at community level,
where participants were most likely to be women with children benefiting from the Child Grants

Programme. The initial sample of key informants were selected on the basis of their involvement in
the Country Programme, and gender was not an explicit consideration. The sex distribution in the final
sample of key informants is a result of those who were willing to participate, and not a result of using
sex as a selection criterion. The evaluation did however record the sex of all key informants as this
could assist in interpreting their responses to questions relating to gender equality.
3.4.2 Evaluation framework
The Terms of Reference set out key evaluation questions, which were discussed with UNICEF
Lesotho and refined. Table 8 shows the final evaluation questions. An evaluation matrix was
developed to guide the data collection and analysis. The matrix sets out the judgment criteria for each
evaluation question and the data sources and methods of collection. The evaluation matrix is
contained in Annex B.
Table 8: Evaluation criteria and questions
Evaluation criteria Evaluation questions
1. Relevance 1. To what extent is the Country Programme guided by national priorities, clear
programme theories and relevant programme strategies appropriate to the changing
context and emerging issues, and does it have the capacity to respond and adjust as
necessary? Has UNICEF LCO employed a mix of policy advice, systems
strengthening and service delivery intensification appropriate for the country context?
2. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner in the
country context? What are UNICEF's comparative strengths in the country –
particularly in comparison to other UN agencies and development partners – and how
were these harnessed to help achieve the results?
2. Coherence 3. To what extent have Lesotho Country Programme strategies to address gender
equality and equity, particularly the alignment of the Lesotho Country Programme
with the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and UNICEF's GAPs
(2014–2017 and 2018–2021), been consistently integrated in all aspects of
programming and implementation, including policy and advocacy? Did the Country
Office's strategic approach to addressing the challenges of equity and gender
equality play a complementary role to that of government and other development
actors?
4. To what extent is the Country Programme linked to and achieving synergies and
coordination with other UN agencies, particularly in response to emergencies, such
as COVID-19?
3. Effectiveness 5. To what extent has the Country Programme achieved its outcomes and outputs, or
is likely to achieve them, including any differential results across gender, income,
ethnicities, etc.? What results have been achieved through convergence, and what
are the other major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of Country
Programme outcomes?
6. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and exclusion
and progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality? To what extent
are programmes, communications and advocacy efforts gender
responsive/transformative, and, relatedly, are UNICEF LCO staff capacitated to
integrate and implement gender responsive/transformative programmes? How
effectively has UNICEF LCO integrated social and behavioural change in its work and
25
that of its partners?
4. Efficiency 7. Were resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise, etc.) allocated and
utilized strategically to track and achieve results, including equity and gender-related
objectives?
8. To what extent have the convergence strategy, the programme structure, including
the life cycle approach, the office structure and the matrix management approach
supported the delivery of the Country Programme? Were the chosen strategies and
approaches the most cost effective and efficient? Were there alternatives that would
have worked better and what are those?
5. Sustainability 9. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country Programme
sustainable at the relevant levels (e.g., community, provincial/state, national)? To
what extent have the programme strategies adopted by UNICEF contributed to, or
been designed in a way that they will contribute to, sustainability of results, especially
equity and gender-related results?
10. To what extent have the programme strategies, plans and tools, particularly those
with an equity and gender focus, been institutionalized in systems, policies,
mechanisms and strategies among government, NGO/civil society, and other
partners and stakeholders? Will the strategies/plans/tools be more widely replicated
or adapted? What's the scalability of models introduced by UNICEF?
3.4.3 Data collection
Primary data collection: The evaluation collected primary data through semi-structured interviews
with government officials, civil society organizations, UNICEF staff and staff in other UN agencies in
Lesotho. The evaluation adopted a purposive (non-probability) sampling strategy. It selected key
informants who were directly involved in the implementation of the Country Programme, key
informants representing development partners (donors), and key informants from the UN system in
Lesotho. The long list of key informants was constructed from the list of participants in UNICEF’s
Strategic Moments of Reflection meetings held in 2021, as they were likely to have an intimate
knowledge of the Country Programme. The evaluation consultant obtained additional suggestions for
key informants from the Country Office programme staff. As can be seen from Table 8, the evaluation
was not successful in obtaining interviews with all the organizations identified in the proposed sample.
The most significant gap was the Ministry of Health, a key partner in the implementation of the
Country Programme. Of the 13 potential key informants, the evaluation only secured and interview
with one official in the Ministry of Health. The evaluation also did not secure interviews with the
Ministry of Water and the Bureau of Statistics. It is noted that the Terms of Reference called for
consideration of participatory methods, especially with regard to rights holders. During the inception
phase it was agreed that rights holders would not form part of the primary data collection.

Most of the interviews were conducted virtually, using the Teams and Zoom platforms. The interviews
lasted one hour on average, and lasted 90 minutes for group interviews. The evaluation developed a
set of questions for each category of key informants, and these questions were sent in advance of the
interview to enable the informants to prepare if they felt the need to do so. The questions were
supplemented with probing questions in the course of each interview. The interviews were not
recorded, and instead, handwritten notes were taken. During the inception phase the evaluation
consultant discussed the issue of recording and concluded that key informants would be more at ease
without recording the interviews. This is understandable in the case of government officials and civil
society as the interviews were conducted immediately prior to the elections, when tensions and
uncertainty about the election outcome were high. The evaluation conducted 34 interviews, involving
a total of 57 individuals, 55 per cent female and 45 per cent male. Table 10 shows the number of key
informants and number of interviews. The interviews were conducted over the period from June to
August 2022.

In addition to the key informant interviews, the evaluation consultant undertook a field mission to
Lesotho from 15–19 August 2022, as COVID-19 travel restrictions had eased. The field mission
entailed visits to two field sites and a group interview with a civil society organization implementing a
UNICEF-supported programme. The selection of the sample of projects and sites was done during
the inception phase. The Country Office submitted a short list of potential projects (five projects for
27
Outcome 1, five projects for Outcome 2 and three projects for Outcome 3). The final sample of three
projects were selected, guided by the following criteria:
• Coverage of each programme component
• Projects implemented by the Government
• Projects implemented by civil society organizations
• Budget allocated to the projects
• A mix of performance
• Projects in remote areas (subject to logistics) as well as projects in peri-urban and more
accessible areas
The projects selected covered the three programme components and were considered large in
monetary terms. The time required to reach the sites was also taken into consideration. The
evaluation consultant also used the opportunity to conduct in-person interviews with stakeholders who
had not been interviewed prior to the field mission.

Secondary data: The evaluation drew on UNICEF documents: programme strategy notes, country
office annual reports, country office programme report (RAM), UNICEF global documents; UNDAF
documents and annual reports; government documents (national plan, VNR reports); and databanks
of UNICEF, UNAIDS, WHO and the World Bank. It also drew on government strategy documents and
plans, reports relevant to the sectors covered by the Country Programme, and official statistics from
the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics. While the Country Office provided several documents, the evaluation
consultant conducted internet searches to supplement the initial batch of documents received from
the Country Office. The list of main documents consulted is in Annex C.
The review of the secondary data was conducted in two phases. The first phase was conducted in
preparing the inception report. This entailed reviewing the country context information and the
28
situation of children and adolescents in Lesotho, and updating these with the latest information
available. It included a review of Country Programme Document, Strategy Notes, Country Office
Annual Work Plans and Country Office Annual Reports to gain insights into the details of the Country
Programme and theory of change, and the nature of the data used in reporting progress and results.
Notes were made on each major document to briefly state the contents of the document and
relevance for particular evaluation questions. In the main phase of the evaluation, the secondary data
were used to triangulate, as far as possible, the primary data collected through the key informant
interviews.
Data analysis and reporting: The evaluation assessed the primary and secondary data against the
evaluation matrix. The analysis also assessed the data against the theories of change for the three
main programme components and in particular, whether the strategies proposed in the theories of
change were used, and the extent to which the assumptions made in the theories of change held true.
The interview data was extracted from the interview notes and tabulated against the questions
contained in the evaluation matrix. The common responses and themes were extracted from these
data tables and complemented by information contained in the country office annual reports and RAM
report. An assessment was then made using the judgment criteria set out in the evaluation matrix.
For questions on relevance, government documents, particularly the National Strategic Development
Plan II, the UNDAF 2019-2023 and UNICEF corporate documents were used to validate the data from
the interviews. The analysis entailed checking the sections of these documents to ascertain how the
interventions under the Country Programme aligned with priorities set out in these documents. In the
case of alignment of the Country Programme, the wording of the Country Programme Outcomes was
assessed against the relevant sections of the UNDAF. The evaluation also looked for changes made
to the Country Programme outputs and results framework and other changes proposed at the
Strategic Moment of Reflections sessions. In analyzing the data pertaining to the relevance of the
Country Programme in the context of change and crises, the evaluation analyzed the Country Office’s
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its Humanitarian Action for Children responses.
The analysis of coherence focused on UNICEF’s collaboration with other UN agencies in Lesotho,
particularly though not exclusively in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluation looked
for documentary evidence of the examples provided by UNICEF and other UN agencies of their
collaboration. The evaluation was able to access and review the list of joint programmes of the United
Nations in Lesotho, but was not able to access comprehensive information on all joint programmes.
The analysis of the effectiveness (results at output and outcome levels) formed the largest of the data
analysis. Here, the data for each output and outcome of the Country Programme was analyzed and
secondary data, preferably from Government sources and other sources external to Country Office,
were sought to triangulate the interview data and the information extracted from Country Office
documents. The analysis, as far as possible, sought sex disaggregated data and data on inclusion, for
the indicators used to assess progress or achievement of the outputs and outcomes. Triangulating the
data on the results at output and outcome levels was hampered by the lack of updated, national data.
This limitation is discussed further in section 3.4.4 of the evaluation report. In assessing the
effectiveness of the Country Programme, the evaluation also referred to the theory of change for each
of the programme components (Annex G) to assess the strength of the linkages between the
interventions, the outputs and the outcomes, and the extent to which the assumptions held true.
The analysis of the efficiency of the Country Programme in the allocation and use of resources relied
on the financial data from the Country Office. The evaluation was able to obtain data on budget
allocations and utilization by programme outputs and by types of financial resources. This enabled the
evaluation to analyze the allocation financial resources across the all the outputs of the Country
29
Programme. The financial data were not sufficiently disaggregated to conduct a detailed assessment
of the gender-responsiveness of the budget allocations.
The analysis of sustainability of the Country Programme considered evidence on the extent of country
ownership in the form of the Government institutionalizing the interventions or policy frameworks, and
assuming full responsibility for the financing of interventions. Sustainability also considered the extent
to which systems have been strengthened, and examples where the Government and/or other
partners have continued or scaled up the interventions that UNICEF has supported.
The final stage of the data analysis involved the preparation of preliminary findings that integrated the
data from the document analysis with the primary data from the interviews and field visits. The
evaluation presented these preliminary findings to the Country Office in workshop. The Country Office
worked in their component teams to reflect on the preliminary findings and areas of recommendation,
and provided feedback in plenary. The feedback as well as the written inputs from the workshop
assisted the evaluation consultant to refine the preliminary findings and areas of recommendation and
address the data gaps. The draft report was shared with the Country Office for their review and
written feedback. The comments received were taken into account in finalising the report.
3.4.4 Limitations
The evaluation has limitations that should be taken into consideration in interpreting the main findings.
At the time of planning the evaluation, COVID-19 restrictions were in place, and in the inception
phase it was agreed that data collection interviews would be conducted remotely, via Zoom or Teams
platforms. These interviews were to be complemented by a brief field mission towards the end of the
data collection phase. Remote interviews and meetings have become the norm for government
officials and other key informants in Lesotho and the evaluation consultant has conducted remote
interviews for other evaluations since 2019. However, remote interviews are not a completely
satisfactory substitute for in-person interviews. They do not provide the evaluation consultant with the
non-verbal information that can be obtained from in-person interviews. Where group interviews were
held, it was also challenging to ensure that all voices in the group were heard. Poor internet
connectivity presented a problem in some interviews.
The field mission conducted following the remote interviews greatly assisted in promoting a more
participatory approach. The evaluation consultant was able to meet most of the Country Office staff
and the Representative, and this contributed to strengthening the dialogue on the emerging findings
and securing additional information to strengthen the evaluation. The visits to the three selected
projects gave the implementers an opportunity to engage directly and in-person with the evaluation
consultant in their work settings.
The evaluation was unable to secure interviews with all the intended stakeholders listed in the
inception report, even though the data collection period was kept open for three months. Interviews
with key government partners did not materialize despite several follow-ups. The period of July to
August was a busy one for government officials. Securing interviews with international partners also
proved challenging because of the holiday period.
The small number of interviewees per organization, in instances only one person per organization,
presented a challenge to maintaining anonymity. It is difficult to reference key informants as sources
of information in the findings section of the report, as this would breach the undertaking made by the
evaluation consultant that statements or views would not be attributed to individuals.
30
The evaluation comprised 10 key evaluation questions, which had been slightly modified from the
compounded questions in the Terms of Reference. Even though the key evaluation questions were
modified, each evaluation question was made up of two or three sub questions. The evaluation did
not seek to answer all the sub questions, as this would make the analysis and reporting unwieldy.
Instead, the findings reflect the main thrust of the evaluation questions.
The Terms of Reference called a strong focus on gender-responsiveness in the evaluation
methodology and in reporting the results of the Country Programme. Questions relating to gender and
gender-responsiveness were included in all interview guides, and the selection of project sites for field
visits also took gender into consideration. However, the evaluation was not able to report sex-
disaggregated results for all outputs of the Country Programme, as this information was not always
available from reports of UNICEF Lesotho and its partners.
There are other data limitations that should be taken into consideration. The lack of updated national
data is a major limitation to assessing progress at the Outcome level. Most outcome indicators require
statistics from government sources, and in many instances, the latest data is 2018. The Demographic
and Health Survey was scheduled to be conducted during the current Country Programme cycle, but
was postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Voluntary National Review reports of
2019 and 2022 illustrate the gaps in Lesotho’s national data for effectively monitoring progress
towards achieving the national targets of the SDGs.
The manner in which the Country Office reports its results is another limitation. In most instances,
results record only the number of beneficiaries, etc., which is reported without a denominator. The
results reported therefore do not give an indication of the scale of the results.
31
4 FINDINGS
Discussion of the findings of the evaluation is organized around the main evaluation criteria, namely,
relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability; and the evaluation questions
for each criterion.
The context within which UNICEF Lesotho implemented the Country Programme was unprecedented
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the evaluation, two of the three-and-a-half years
of the Country Programme implementation were of necessity focused on supporting the national
response to and the recovery from the pandemic. While the evaluation findings frequently make
reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, this is not all that UNICEF has done under the Country
Programme. There are areas where UNICEF continued to focus on the development agenda and
advocated continuity of essential services for children, adolescents, mothers and caregivers.
4.1 Relevance
Evaluation question 1. To what extent is the Country Programme guided by national priorities, clear
programme theories and relevant programme strategies appropriate to the changing context and
emerging issues, and does it have the capacity to respond and adjust as necessary? Has UNICEF
LCO employed a mix of policy advice, systems strengthening and service delivery intensification
appropriate for the country context?
Finding 1: The Country Programme is well aligned with national priorities as set out in
Lesotho’s NSDP and in the sector plans of relevant ministries.
There is clear alignment between the Country Programme and Lesotho’s national priorities. The key
components of the Country Programme fall mainly within the NSDP II Key Priority Area II:
Strengthening Human Capital and the NSDP II crosscutting issues of children, youth and gender. In
the case of the latter, there is alignment between the Country Programme and the NSDP II strategic
objectives: (i) promote development of children and protect their rights; (ii) promote gender equality;
and (iii) improve youth participation in development.
NSDP II strategic objectives for health and nutrition include: (i) strengthen disease prevention
interventions; (ii) increase access, coverage, effectiveness and quality of health care service delivery
for all; (iii) sustain health care services; and (iv) strengthen and scale up nutrition interventions. The
Country Programme Component I addresses strengthening the quality of health care services,
disease prevention and strengthening nutrition interventions.
Within the education sector, NSDP II strategic objectives include: (i) improve access and quality of
early childhood care and development, primary and secondary education; and (ii) promote an
inclusive and equitable education system. The NSDP II objectives are well reflected in the
Government’s Education Sector Strategic Plan 2016–2026. The Country Programme is aligned to
both of these key documents, and includes inclusion- and equity-integrated support for improving the
access and quality of early childhood care and development, as well as primary/secondary education,
out-of-school children and adolescents.
For social protection, NSDP II strategic objectives include: (i) improve efficiency of the social
protection system; and (ii) promote income enhancing social protection programmes, and these are
reflected in the Country Programme.
32
The Country Programme is also aligned with areas of the NSDP II, namely, Key Priority Area IV:
Strengthening national governance and accountability systems, the strategic objectives of which are:
(i) enhancing efficiency of the justice system; and (ii) strengthening national monitoring and evaluation
systems.
Within the water sector, NSDP II has the strategic objective to increase access to sustainable water,
sanitation and hygiene. The Country Programme’s WASH interventions are in line with this strategic
objective.
Government partners, namely, the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Home Affairs
and the Ministry of Social Development confirmed the alignment of the Country Programme with the
priorities of the sector/ministry and indicated that UNICEF’s consultation in preparing the Annual Work
Plans and regular engagement with government partners contributed to ensuring alignment with the
priorities of their respective ministries. The Ministry of Health identified several interventions under the
Country Programme that are highly responsive to the health sector, for example, immunization, health
systems strengthening and improving the quality of care for mothers, newborns and children.
Key informants from the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Health noted that child
protection and nutrition, respectively, are not receiving sufficient attention in the implementation of the
Country Programme. In the case of child protection, government partners appreciated UNICEF’s
support, but felt that child protection needs are increasing and require more support from UNICEF
and development partners. Although the NSDP prioritizes nutrition, the Ministry of Health
acknowledged the lack of attention to nutrition, which was primarily due to the Ministry focusing on the
health response to COVID-19.37
Finding 2: UNICEF Lesotho has demonstrated its ability to respond rapidly and effectively to
the dramatically changing context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country office mobilized
additional resources to support the national response, and adapted programme interventions
to respond to the pandemic. It adjusted its mix of strategies to respond to the needs of the
changed country context, and also adjusted its internal operations. While COVID-19 was a
disruption, UNICEF was agile and used the opportunity to do things differently. UNICEF is also
using the COVID-19 response interventions as a foundation for building long-term resilience.
UNICEF contributed to all five main categories of outputs of the UN COVID-19 Socio-Economic
Response Plan, with its main contributions being to: (i) Health First: protecting health services and
systems during the crisis; and (ii) Protecting People: social protection and basic services. UNICEF’s
contribution to the COVID-19 response in 2020 resulted in 22,501 children immunized despite the
pandemic, 361,162 people benefiting from improved access to WASH services, and 4,195
adolescents and young people benefiting from SRH services, as well as HIV prevention, diagnosis
and treatment. In education, 116,957 girls and 107,960 boys benefited from distance learning
solutions including the 12,000 pre-school children that benefitted from age-appropriate books, and
households benefited from inclusive social protection programmes and cash transfers.38 Details of
these results are discussed further in the section on Effectiveness.
37 The official responsible for nutrition in the Ministry of Health was not available for interviews to explore the
issue further. The data on child nutrition in Lesotho indicate that nutrition remains a serious challenge for the
country.

33
The evaluation found several examples of UNICEF’s responsiveness, and its leadership during the
COVID-19 crisis. While many of its activities were focused on the immediate response to COVID-19,
UNICEF also sought to ensure that the interventions served as the foundation for
building/strengthening systems for resilience.
(a) UNICEF played a key role in the procurement, storage and distribution of vaccines for COVID-19.
The country office supported the Government to develop the National Deployment and
Vaccination Plan (NDVP), undertake the district planning and roll-out of vaccines, and upgrade
cold chain systems at national and district health facilities. The benefits of strengthening the
system for vaccines go beyond COVID-19 vaccines and extend to other vaccines and related
medical products. UNICEF did not lose sight of the necessity for continuity of other health
services for children and advocated for continuity of routine immunization services. UNICEF was
also successful in leveraging COVID-19 investments to support broader health systems, such as
in developing community health information systems and assessing health care waste
management.
(b) Mobilizing resources from the Global Partnership for Education, UNICEF provided extensive
support for the Ministry of Education and Training to shift to online learning when the detrimental
impact of school closures was becoming evident. UNICEF supported the Ministry to introduce the
Learning Passport for online learning and learner packs for children unable to access online
learning.39 UNICEF also supported the Ministry to phase in the safe re-opening of schools by
providing financial assistance for the procurement of personal protective equipment for schools,
the installation of hand washing stations and the training of school focal points in COVID-19
prevention and mitigation.40 The introduction of alternative methods of learning and teaching is
already serving as the basis for developing a comprehensive learning strategy to support children
and adolescents in and out of school to ensure continuity in all contexts and to improve education
outcomes and skills. The hand washing stations in schools are potentially a catalyst for improving
other aspects of WASH in schools and communities. Using its own resources, UNICEF supported
the improvement of online pedagogy at the Lesotho College of Education through procurement of
ICT equipment. In addition, UNICEF improved the learning and teaching environment at the
college through installation of hands-free hand-washing stations for both the lecturers and
students.
(c) Social protection formed an important element of the Government’s response to mitigate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on poor households. UNICEF’s technical and financial
assistance to the Ministry of Social Development enabled the development and implementation of
additional cash transfers to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on existing Child
Grants Programme (CGP) beneficiaries (47,974 beneficiaries) and enrol an additional 8,162 new
CGP beneficiaries.41 The support has enabled the Government of Lesotho to have a functional
shock-responsive social protection system in place, and will assist the Government in responding
to future shocks.
(d) The COVID-19 context put the spotlight on the vulnerability of children to violence, particularly
during the period of restricted movement and continued school closures, hence UNICEF

supported the Government through the Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Education and
Training, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Justice and Law to ensure continuity of essential
protection services including birth registrations. UNICEF supported the capacity building child
protection teams to enable them to identify, report and respond to any form of violence against
women and children. These included the strengthening of education sector personnel for safe
schools' operations, community council protection teams and village child justice committees to
increase alternative dispute resolution measures for children at community level. UNICEF further
supported the reactivation of the Child Helpline as the main channel for children to report violence
and provide referral to other service providers, and the development of Standard Operating
Procedures and referral mechanisms for ease of child protection case management.42 The
Government was supported with the provision of personal protective equipment to the entire front-
line Social Service Workforce to continue provision of essential services including the provision of
psychosocial support services to children and parents.
(e) SBCC formed an important part of UNICEF’s response. UNICEF supported the national COVID-
19 Risk Communication and Engagement group that was critical to driving communication
awareness about COVID-19 and debunking misinformation about the disease and vaccines.
UNICEF demonstrated agility in changing or modifying its modalities during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Where feasible, it held virtual meetings and consultations, provided financial assistance to, for
example, community health workers to purchase airtime and data for their participation in virtual
meetings. UNICEF also used U-Report43 and telephone surveys to solicit views of programme
beneficiaries during the COVID-19 lockdown periods.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented several challenges to the operations of UNICEF in Lesotho, and
the Country Office demonstrated agility in meeting these challenges. Staff was provided with
equipment to enable them to work remotely, and flexible, blended work arrangements were
introduced with the reopening of the office. Office procedures were modified, for example, the use of
electronic signatures. Senior management is reported to have paid attention to the health and well
being of staff through constant communication and regular meetings. UNICEF also supported
government staff with airtime to enable them to continue work relations, remote supervision and
attending meetings.
COVID-19 was not the only emergency in the current programme cycle. In 2019 when the
Government declared a drought emergency affecting over 500,000 people. UNICEF mobilized
US$868,485 for the response to the crisis and supported the Government to develop the National
Drought Response Plan, as well as strategies on nutrition, WASH, social protection and child
protection.44 Over 2,000 children with severe and acute malnutrition received nutritional supplies, over

43 U-Report is a messaging tool used by UNICEF to engage young people on issues that affect them. It gathers

300,000 people benefited from WASH interventions, and over 3,000 child victims of violence were
referred to psychosocial support and legal and health services.45
The Country Office adjusted its mix of strategies in response to the changes in the country context.
The COVID-19 crisis called for an emphasis on service delivery intensification, while in the recovery
phase there is an appropriate emphasis on systems strengthening to build resilience to future shocks.
The CPD and the theories of change for the three main components of the Country Programme
indicate a clear intention to focus on policy advocacy and capacity development to strengthen
systems. However, the context of the COVID-19 pandemic saw UNICEF supporting service delivery
in critical areas of health, education and social protection, as illustrated in Finding 2. This is what the
context demanded. This does not mean that the other strategies were not used – in supporting
service delivery, UNICEF also sought to strengthen capacities and systems. UNICEF’s ability to
mobilize financial resources for service delivery was a critical factor – without the financial resources
mobilized specifically for the COVID-19 response, UNICEF would probably have emphasised
‘upstream’ strategies.
Evaluation question 2. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner
in the country context? What are UNICEF's comparative strengths in the country – particularly in
comparison to other UN agencies and development partners – and how were these harnessed to help
achieve the results?
Finding 3: UNICEF has made good use of its comparative strengths to influence policies and
implementation to achieve results for children.
UNICEF used its comparative strength on procurement and logistics to great effect, being in the
forefront of supporting the Government to initially prevent infection (through promotion of hygiene
practices and improving access to water) and to procure vaccines for COVID-19. Its technical
expertise in cold chain storage enabled the Government to enhance its cold chain capacity. This is
discussed further in the section on Effectiveness.
Other United Nations agencies in Lesotho acknowledge UNICEF as the foremost agency on matters
pertaining to children and shared examples of how they benefit from UNICEF’s comparative
strengths. WHO, the lead agency for normative and policy guidance on health issues, acknowledged
UNICEF’s expertise in community engagement and relies on UNICEF to support the implementation
of these norms and guidelines. Another UN agency described UNICEF’s good relationships with the
Ministry of Social Development and Ministry of Education and Training as an advantage for other
agencies, which ordinarily do not have access to these ministries.
The evaluation found examples of UNICEF using its convening role to achieve results for children. For
example, UNICEF chairs the UN Nutrition network, which has facilitated nutrition policy processes,
including the development of an investment case for nutrition to guide policy on the level of
investments required to reduce the burden of malnutrition in the country.46 UNICEF also used its

prepared by Oxford Policy Management, UNICEF Lesotho, 2022.
36
convening power to advocate and facilitate better coordination among the ministries of Home Affairs,
Health and Social Development on matters pertaining to birth registration.
As the lead agency on the rights of children, ministries value the technical expertise, advice and
resources that UNICEF brings to the table. UNICEF is therefore well placed to influence the content of
policies and their implementation. Examples of this influence include the National Vaccine
Deployment Strategy; the revision of PMTCT guidelines; the development of the Inclusive Education
Policy; and the development of the National Social Protection Strategy. These examples are
discussed in more detail in the section on Effectiveness.
4.2 Coherence
Evaluation question 3. To what extent have Lesotho Country Programme strategies to address
gender equality and equity, particularly the alignment of the Lesotho Country Programme with the
Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and UNICEF's GAPs (2014–2017 and 2018–
2021), been consistently integrated in all aspects of programming and implementation, including
policy and advocacy? Did the Country Office's strategic approach to addressing the challenges of
equity and gender equality play a complementary role to that of government and other development
actors?
Finding 4: The Country Programme is aligned with UNICEF’s GAP (2018–2021) and
interventions under the Country Programme are among the priority interventions of NSDP II to
address gender inequality. The evaluation found examples of the integration of gender
equality in results and priorities to empower adolescent girls, complementary to the work of
other UN agencies in Lesotho. However, UNICEF’s work in addressing gender inequality tends
to be projectized and lacks coherence.
Gender-responsiveness is reflected in the outcome statements of the Country Programme, and the
evaluation found specific outputs that are aligned with the UNICEF Gender Action Plan 2018-202147
as illustrated in Table 12.

There are several examples of UNICEF interventions addressing gender inequality. UNICEF’s
support for advocacy to eliminate early, forced and child marriages in Lesotho, which is also a priority
reflected in NSDP II, is one such example. Within the education sector, UNICEF supported the
Ministry of Education and Training to strengthen gender-responsiveness of national education sector
plans and policies. In the case of child protection, UNICEF supports capacity strengthening of law
enforcement officials to identify and respond effectively to cases of gender-based violence and
prevent violence, as well as supporting the implementation of the Gender and Development Policy
Implementation Plan (2019–2024). UNICEF’s support in the areas of Sexual Reproductive Health for
adolescents and young girls, HIV prevention, and menstrual health all contain elements of addressing
gender inequality. The joint UN 2gether 4 SRHR programme in Lesotho targeting pregnant and
breastfeeding adolescent girls and young women is a major intervention supported by UNICEF to
empower adolescent girls. UNICEF is a member of the UN Gender-Based Violence Forum and is
tasked with focusing on issues relating to Gender-Based Violence and children.
There is no doubt that UNICEF is addressing the issue of gender inequality. However, there appears
to be little coherence among these interventions, and they are reported as discrete projects or
interventions in UNICEF’s annual reports for 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Country Office reports sex-
disaggregated results where such data are available. The Country Office does not have an
overarching gender strategy. Such a strategy would enable the Country Office to achieve coherence
among the various gender-related projects. The evaluation also found that the Country Office does
not have a partnership with the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sport and Recreation. The Department of
38
Gender in the ministry is the lead entity in Government responsible for coordinating efforts to prevent
and respond to gender-based violence through the Anti-GBV Coordination Forum. The mandate of
the department is to ensure equality of opportunities for women and men, girls and boys, so that
development efforts have an impact on gender on all gender issues.48 The Country Office, in its 2021
Strategic Moments of Reflection indicated that it would expand the partnership with the Ministry of
Gender, Youth, Sport and Recreation.
The evaluation observed that while the Country Office has a gender focal point, it does not have a
gender specialist. It is also noted that UN Women does not have a physical presence in Lesotho as
the organization operates from the multi-country office in Pretoria, South Africa. There appears to be
no collaboration between UN Women and UNICEF in the country. This further underscores the need
for gender technical capacity in the Country Office.
Evaluation question 4. To what extent is the Country Programme linked to and achieving synergies
and coordination with other UN agencies, particularly in response to emergencies, such as COVID-
19?
Finding 5: UNICEF collaborated with other UN agencies in the response to COVID-19, and
plays an important role in UN coordination. Other UN agencies commented positively on
UNICEF’s collaboration, but also pointed to the need for more effective collaboration and
coordination among UN agencies in the next UNSDCF.
As mentioned under Finding 2, UNICEF contributed to all five main categories of outputs of the UN
COVID-19 Socio-Economic Response Plan. Key informant interviews of external stakeholders and
UN agencies confirmed that there was good collaboration among UN agencies during the COVID-19
response. UNICEF and WHO, as joint focal points for the COVID-19 response, are reported to have
collaborated extensively during this period. UNICEF also broadened its partnerships with non-
traditional partners, such as the Embassy of Japan and USAID, and started working with other
government institutions within and outside the Ministry of Health.
All agencies are expected to collaborate in order to deliver on the development agenda as expressed
in the UNDAF 2019–2023. UNICEF has a large country office relative to other UN agencies in
Lesotho, and other agencies look to UNICEF to take up the coordination role. UNICEF chairs the
Programme Coherence Team and the Communication Group, and has used these platforms for
fostering synergies and coherence among the UN agencies. The Country Office and UN agencies
interviewed identified examples of good collaboration: the Transforming Education summit with
UNESCO; collaboration with WFP on school feeding; and the UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS.
UNICEF collaborated with FAO on linking food security to social protection, a collaboration that began
in 2013 with piloting the integration of food security and the Child Grants Programme and ended in
2016, producing a successful cash plus model focused on nutrition that has been evaluated and
continues to be the basis of UNICEF work on Community Based Nutrition Interventions.49

The joint UN Nutrition network reprogrammed funds from the global UN-REACH (Renewed Efforts
Against Child Hunger) programme and developed a livelihoods intervention to address the impact of
COVID-19 lockdowns among 2000 households with children under the age of 5 years. The Prime
minister launched the intervention and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office also officiated at the
event.50
While other UN agencies appreciate the role that UNICEF plays in coordination, more than one
agency raised the concern that UNICEF does not always acknowledge or leverage the comparative
strengths of other UN agencies, and that collaboration among UN agencies in the country could be
improved.
4.3 Effectiveness
Evaluation question 5. To what extent has the Country Programme achieved its outcomes and
outputs, or is likely to achieve them, including any differential results across gender, income,
ethnicities, etc.? What results have been achieved through convergence, and what are the other
major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of Country Programme outcomes?
Evaluation question 6. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and
exclusion and progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality? To what extent are
programmes, communications and advocacy efforts gender responsive/transformative, and, relatedly,
are UNICEF LCO staff capacitated to integrate and implement gender responsive/transformative
programmes? How effectively has UNICEF LCO integrated social and behavioural change in its work
and that of its partners?
The evaluation assessed the effectiveness of the Country Programme, using the results framework
and indicators reflected in the Country Programme Full Report 2021 and the results reported for the
period up to 31 December 2021. The Strategic Moments of Reflection (SMR) report of December
2021 suggested modifications to indicators and targets, and these have been taken into account in
the discussion of results.
4.3.1 Results achieved
Outcome 1: By 2023, young children (0 to 9 years), particularly the most vulnerable,
benefit from gender responsive health, nutrition, WASH51 and early learning services.
Output 1.1: By 2023, the capacity of the Ministry of Health and the cadre of health workers is
improved to deliver quality integrated MNCH and HIV services.
Finding 6: UNICEF supported the Ministry of Health and health care workers to deliver quality,
integrated services to strengthen the survival of mothers and newborns. This capacity
strengthening contributed to an expansion in facilities providing primary emergency obstetric
and newborn care and the implementation of newborn care packages in health facilities, while

51 WASH does not appear in the CPD Outcome 1 statement. It is included here based on the proposal made at
UNICEF Lesotho SMR meeting in December 2021. Outputs related to WASH are discussed as a new set of
outputs, separate from the other outputs for Outcome 1, as proposed at the SMR discussions.

also enabling hospitals to implement the Perinatal Problem Identification Programme (PPIPP).
UNICEF support to the Expanded Programme on Immunization continued during the period
under review, helping to sustain good immunization coverage. PMTCT was further
strengthened with the adoption of new guidelines, which health care workers were trained to
implement.
Through UNICEF’s support, the Ministry of Health was able to designate 90 per cent of facilities as
providing primary emergency obstetric and newborn care by 2021, while 100 per cent of health
facilities are implementing the essential newborn care package. With UNICEF’s support, the Ministry
has established Kangaroo Mother Care units in seven hospitals in 2021, and 18 hospitals (17 district
and one tertiary) are implementing the PPIP system. This latter system tracks the quality of services
by identifying the causes of inpatient deaths and factors that can be modified to ensure the survival of
mothers and newborns.52 As is evident from the available data, the decline in neonatal mortality rates
has been stagnant; it was 45.25 per 1,000 live births in 2017 and declined slightly to 44.26 in 202053.
This is mainly due to poor quality care services during antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care.54 A
key informant from the Ministry of Health indicated that neonatal mortality has not improved and that
medical staff needed to be better skilled at identifying risks to newborns as early as possible.
UNICEF’s continued support to the Expanded Programme of Immunization contributed to maintaining
good immunization coverage, which risked being reduced during the period of COVID-19 movement
restrictions. WHO-UNICEF estimates of the coverage of MCV1 for 2021 is 90 per cent, and 82 per
cent for MCV2, while coverage for DTP3 is estimated at 87 per cent.55
Lesotho continues to make progress in eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. UNICEF
supported the revision of PMTCT guidelines and the review of national and subnational targets for
PMTCT. New guidelines for elimination of mother-to-child transmission (e-MTCT) were adopted and
health care workers were trained to ensure quality implementation of the new guidelines. The MTCT
rate has declined slightly from 6.75 per 100 population in 2018 to 5.98 in 2020,56 and the percentage
of pregnant women living with HIV and receiving ART for PMTCT has increased to 93 per cent in
2021.57
Community interventions continue to be a significant part of health services in Lesotho and village
health workers (VHWs) remain a critical link between community and health facilities. UNICEF
supported the Ministry of Health to develop a community monitoring and evaluation framework,
indicators, a monitoring and evaluation tool and the Community Health Information System (CHIS) to
ensure tracking of basic curative, promotion and preventive health care services provided at
community level. This intervention was implemented through integrated Child Survival and
Development (CSD) programming using nutrition, HIV and MNCH funding.58

Output 1.2: By 2023, parents and caregivers have increased capacity to practice and demand quality
MNCH, IYCF and hygiene interventions.
Finding 7: UNICEF supported interventions aimed at improving community practices in
nutrition and hygiene, using a combination of policy advocacy, strengthening coordination
mechanisms, supporting service delivery and working in partnership with civil society
organizations. With the already poor state of nutrition of children worsening as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, nutrition will require more attention going forward.
Through UNICEF support to the Ministry of Health, all 10 districts in the country are implementing
programmes aimed at improving the diversity of diets for children. A total of 26,919 mothers and
caregivers benefited from nutrition and education counselling, slightly below the target of 35,000, and
17,842 children received micronutrient powders.59 Health workers (148) and community leaders (287)
also benefited from training in IYCF and HIV, field officers were trained to increase the uptake of
nutrition and HIV services and social accountability scorecard training was given to health and
nutrition workers (15) and peer educators (35) to improve service delivery access and quality in two
districts. UNICEF also supported continuity in essential health care services for pregnant women and
children, providing iron-folate supplements to about 30,000 pregnant women receiving antenatal care
services, while vitamin A was administered to 22,661 children aged 6–11 months and 58,579 children
aged 12–59 months. Children experiencing severe acute malnutrition received treatment at health
facilities in all 10 districts (2,300 children).60
To address the burden of malnutrition and its consequences, the Government developed the 2019–
2023 Lesotho Food and Nutrition Strategy and Action Plan (LFNSAP).61 UNICEF provided technical
support in the development of the strategy. This costed plan identifies eleven (11) key results areas
with 39 goals and 105 strategies to be implemented at an estimated cost of US$239 million over five
years (2019–2023). However, this cost represents nearly 20 per cent of total current health
expenditure and implementation was delayed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.62
As a result of joint resource mobilization and leveraging the role of the monarch, His Majesty King
Letsie's Nutrition Champion Lesotho received a loan of US$18 million and a US$4 million grant from
the World Bank and the Power of Nutrition, respectively, to implement nutrition specific intervention
and strengthen the coordinating role of the Food and Nutrition Coordinating Office.63 UNICEF Lesotho
continued to chair the joint UN Nutrition network to provide further coordinated implementation of
nutrition support to government. Nutrition falls within the responsibility of four major ministries,
namely, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and
the Cabinet-Prime Minister’s Office. UNICEF, through the UN Nutrition network, has sought to
mobilize high-level engagement of the national coordination structure of the Food and Nutrition

Coordinating Office, but this remains a challenge. The World Bank support has just begun addressing
the coordination issues.64
Output 1.3: By 2023, improved capacity of the Government (Ministry of Education and Training,
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development) to provide high quality early childhood
development, care and pre-primary education.
Finding 8: UNICEF supported systems strengthening in the ECCD sub-sector, and the results
are moving in a positive direction with an increasing number of ECCD facilitators and teachers
receiving formal training. The curriculum, revised with support from UNICEF, is expected to
benefit over 47,000 children in pre-schools. The sub-sector, however, continues to face many
challenges, notably, the lack of adequate budgetary provision, insufficient numbers of
qualified early childhood education (ECE) teachers, and the decline in enrolments in pre-
primary education since 2018.
The revision of the ECCD curriculum is a significant result of UNICEF’s support and coordination. The
revised curriculum, which has begun rolling out in pre-primary facilities attached to primary schools,
according to a key informant in the Ministry of Education and Training, shows promise in improving
the quality of ECE. The curriculum will also be rolled out to private ECE centres that will receive
guidance from the Ministry, but they will have the latitude to implement as they see fit. The Ministry of
Social Development has finalized guidelines for day-care centres, with support from UNICEF, and
these guidelines are expected to improve the quality of services at day-care centres.
UNICEF supported the training of ECE teachers. Through supporting NECDOL, a cumulative total of
2,309 ECE teachers were trained, benefiting 9,484 children (5,288 female) aged 3–5 years. UNICEF
also supported the Lesotho College of Education with protective equipment so that ECE teacher
trainees could continue to learn. There is a long way to go in ensuring that ECE teachers have the
requisite qualifications, as currently less than 20 per cent of ECE teachers are qualified.
There is concern about the decline in pre-primary enrolments reflected in the EMIS data. Gross
enrolment declined from 38.2 per cent in 2018 to 36.6 per cent in 2019. As the decrease predates the
COVID-19 pandemic, it cannot be attributed to the pandemic. The Ministry of Education and Training
is aware of the decline and has begun investigating its causes.
Budget provision for pre-primary historically has been a challenge. UNICEF, in partnership with
NECDOL, has been advocating for increasing the budget share for pre-primary education from 0.21
per cent in 2019 to 2 per cent in 2021. However, the pre-primary education share of the education
budget declined to 0.13 per cent in 2021, reportedly due to pressures on the national budget to
respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased marginally to 0.14 per cent in the 2022 fiscal
year.65 Key informants from the Ministry of Education and Training indicated that financial support
from UNICEF would be critical going forward if the Ministry is to make progress in the ECCD
subsector.
Output 1.4: By 2023, WASH systems are strengthened and WASH service delivery enhanced for
sustained access to and use of safe water, sanitation and hygiene services and practices for all.
Finding 9: UNICEF contributed to increasing access to drinking water services, improving
hand hygiene in schools and communities and improving sanitation in schools. It also

contributed to strengthening systems in the water sector. The water sector is vital to the social
and economic progress of Lesotho. The sector faces challenges that also present an
opportunity for UNICEF to play an influencing role at the policy level.
Even though WASH is not identified as a distinct output under Outcome 1, nor is it reflected in the
Outcome 1 statement, UNICEF understood the importance of WASH in achieving results for children
and adolescents, and for the communities in which they live. UNICEF achieved notable results in
WASH in the period under review.
UNICEF supported the construction/rehabilitation of 79 water supply systems in drought-affected
areas, benefiting 101,321 people, giving them access to clean water supply in communities (22),
schools (69) and health care facilities (12). To strengthen the management of these water supply
systems, which were reconstructed on climate resilience principles, UNICEF supported the training of
over 400 sector stakeholders and community members.66 An additional 163,820 people in health care
facilities benefited from water supplied by trucks.67
Schools and communities benefited from UNICEF’s support to improve hand hygiene. Hand hygiene
stations were installed at 74568 schools, benefiting 251,100 learners. Training and awareness to
improve hand hygiene practices were rolled out in 858 schools with established WASH clubs. This
training benefited over 16,000 learners and 956 teachers and school board members.69 Communities
and health care facilities also benefited from behaviour change communication (423,234 people).70
UNICEF worked in partnership with World Vision and the Lesotho Red Cross Society to achieve these
results.
UNICEF supported improved sanitation in schools, with 9 completed inclusive toilet blocks (7 in
progress) and 22 menstrual hygiene management rooms.71
In systems strengthening, UNICEF provided technical and financial support to the Office of the Water
Commissioner to strengthen coordination of the water sector. This entailed facilitating policy dialogues
on WASH in schools and hand hygiene, as well as supporting engagement with external bodies, for
example, Sanitation and Water for All (SW), the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) water sector. UNICEF supported the
development of the National Hand Hygiene Strategy (2021) and the Hand Hygiene market analysis
with the Ministry of Health, along with the National WASH in School Guidelines (2021) with the
Ministry of Education and Training. UNICEF also supported the Department of Rural Water Supply to
improve data and monitoring in the sector.
While UNICEF’s support to WASH takes place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
challenges of WASH in Lesotho are longstanding ones. The coverage of WASH services, especially
in rural areas, though improving since 2000, is not adequate. Less than half the population (45.82 per

cent) use safely managed sanitation services, 27.86 per cent of the population use safely managed
drinking water services (the proportion is higher in rural areas) and 51.32 per cent of the population
have no hand washing facility at home.72 The country experiences recurrent droughts and 6 of the 10
districts are rated as high drought risk areas.
UNICEF intends to intensify systems strengthening and service delivery in the remaining period of the
Country Programme cycle. This includes exploring the WASH financing landscape and opportunities
for innovative financing; mainstreaming climate resilience in WASH; the development of strategies to
end open defecation; influencing policies to ensure mainstreaming of inclusion (gender and disability)
in WASH; and the development of a sector management information system to overcome the existing
fragmentation and improve data governance. On service delivery, UNICEF intends to continue work
with the Department of Rural Water Supply to rehabilitate water supply systems in areas most
affected by climate shocks, scale up WASH in schools, work with partners to end open defecation and
improve access to safely managed sanitation services.73 Completion of this ambitious agenda will
require resources, and it is likely that the work will continue into the next Country Programme cycle.
Outcome 2: By the end of 2023, adolescents (10–19 years), particularly the most
vulnerable, benefit from gender-responsive quality health, HIV, learning and
protection services.
Output 2.1: Adolescents living with or at risk of HIV have increased capacity to demand quality
prevention, identification, care and support services.
Finding 10: UNICEF contributed to the national HIV response through interventions aimed at
addressing the infection rates of HIV among adolescents and young people, especially
adolescent girls and young women who account for a disproportionate number of new
infections. There has been a small decline in the rate of new infections and the number of
adolescents and young people living with HIV since 2018, and an increase in the percentage of
children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral treatment.
UNICEF’s contribution to the national HIV response was primarily at the level of generating evidence
through proof of concepts to inform strategies, guidelines and plans for improving adolescent HIV
services. This includes technical assistance to the Ministry of Health to revise the 2021 Antiretroviral
Guidelines and the Strategy for Accelerated Action for Health of Adolescents; and technical and
financial assistance for the development of national, district and facility-level HIV targets for improving
programme efficiency. The work on target setting at health facility level enabled UNICEF to contribute
to the review of the 2019–2023 National Strategy and Plan Monitoring & Evaluation Framework and
the PEPFAR 2022 Operational Plan.
In the area of strengthening HIV services for adolescents and young people, UNICEF supported the
Ministry of Health to provide at least three high impact HIV prevention interventions (testing, treatment
and behaviour change interventions) in all 10 districts of Lesotho, and additional SRHR/HIV
messaging in two districts, reaching 1,870 adolescents and young people.74 In total, UNICEF’s
72 UNICEF Datawarehouse, accessed 19 September 2022. Figures for 2019 are from the WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme (2021).
73 UNICEF WASH presentation to SMR, December 2021.
74 UNICEF Lesotho Country Programme Full Approved Report 2021.
45
SRH/HIV messaging reached nearly 50,000 adolescents in 2021. UNICEF supported the Ministry of
Health to implement the social accountability initiative aimed at improving the quality of adolescent
friendly health services. This enabled the Ministry to monitor access to these services; they found a
40 per cent reduction in HIV testing among young people between 2020 and 2021. The evidence
generated was used to develop interventions to increase the uptake of services.75
HIV was also integrated into the 2gether 4 SRHR programme which has components led by UNFPA,
UNAIDS and WHO. Through this programme implemented by Help Lesotho, adolescent mothers
(433) and their caregivers/partners received counselling and psychosocial support during the COVID-
19 pandemic. The 2gether 4 SRHR programme provides integrated services that include nutrition
awareness and referrals, income generation assistance, reintegration into education, food relief and
gender-based violence. The programme has been implemented in four sites in two rural districts and
targets unemployed, rural pregnant girls and young mothers 12–24 years, as well as their parents and
caregivers. It has produced positive results, namely: 99 per cent of mothers know their HIV status, 89
per cent make autonomous decisions to use contraceptives, 87 per cent use modern contraceptives,
80 per cent negotiate condom use with their partners and 98 per cent of HIV-exposed infants have a
HIV-free status at 18 months.76
UNICEF’s contribution to HIV interventions is made as a member of the UN Joint Task Team on AIDS
and its membership of technical working groups of the Ministry of Health, for example, the Technical
Working Group on adolescent health. These provide an opportunity for UNICEF to influence the
agenda on HIV. The approach of influencing agendas and leveraging stakeholders is appropriate in
view of UNICEF’s limited resources, and can be more effective than spreading limited resources thinly
to work more ‘downstream’ in HIV.
Output 2.2: Improved capacity in the Ministry of Education and Training to provide high quality
education, including alternative pathways.
Finding 11: UNICEF contributed to strengthening systems and capacities in the education
sector in Lesotho. The direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning has been
profound, and it will require a concerted effort to regain the ground lost during the pandemic.
UNICEF provided extensive support to the Ministry of Education and Training during the period under
review. As the coordinating agency for the Local Education Group, UNICEF’s support in 2019 focused
on advocacy on ECE,77 policies for non-formal education and inclusive education and strengthening
the EMIS. The nature of the support changed dramatically in 2020 when the immediate impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic became evident. UNICEF’s contributions included:
• Convening stakeholders to develop the national education sector response plan and mobilizing
US$3.5 million from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE).
• Supporting the development of distance learning through radio, television and learner packs to
ensure continuity in learning during COVID-19 restrictions.
• Supporting the rollout of the Learning Passport.

In 2021, UNICEF supported the Ministry of Education and Training to reopen schools safely –
supporting the procurement of masks for children, the installation of hand washing stations, the
training of teachers in accelerated learning to enable children to make-up for learning lost during
COVID-19 restrictions and on-going improvements on EMIS. The table below summarizes the support
provided and the number of schools, teachers and children who benefited.

At the level of policy and plans, UNICEF supported the Ministry in reviewing the National Education
Sector Plan (2020–2023), with particular attention on addressing the issues of access and retention of
boys in school; drafting the Prevention and Management of Learner Pregnancy Policy; and
developing the inception report of the National Skills Audit study.
Key informants raised the following key challenges:
(a) The EMIS system is not living up to its promise of quality and timely data. There have been
serious delays in capturing data and the current data collected in 2020 is, according to the
Ministry, becoming out-dated, which is limiting its effective use in planning. Connectivity problems
and insufficient devices for data collection represent challenges to collecting data at school and
district levels. The EMIS is in transition and is not yet able to provide data on individual learners
that the Ministry is ultimately aiming for.
(b) The Ministry of Education and Training has adopted the Learner Passport well for those who have
access to devices and data. The poorest children do not have devices and data outside school
premises is not free as the relevant regulatory authority has not yet made a decision on zero
rating of data for Learner Passport. UNICEF has supported the Ministry to develop learner packs
for children in pre-primary to Grade 4 who cannot access online platforms.
(c) An Inclusive Education Policy is in place, but resources for implementation are limited. There is
also a lack of data on children with disabilities.78
Children in Lesotho have effectively lost two years of schooling, and when this is added to the poor
learning outcomes that predate the COVID-19 pandemic, the situation presents difficulties for the

47
education sector. Harnessing the lessons learned from implementing alternative teaching and
learning platforms can help to address these difficulties and improve learning outcomes.
Output 2.3: Law enforcement officials have increased capacity to identify, prevent and report violence
against children and child marriage.
Finding 12: UNICEF contributed to strengthening the capacities of key ministries, namely,
Home Affairs, Social Development, Justice and Law and Education and Training to improve
access and quality of child protection services. This was especially critical during the period
of COVID-19 restrictions. Systems and institutional strengthening at the level of government
ministries were complemented by SBCC and strengthening community-based structures for
child protection.
UNICEF reported notable achievements for the period under review. These include:
(a) The launch of the Violence Against Children Survey report and subsequent development of the
National Response Plan to address key findings. The survey generated evidence to inform
strategies and programmes aimed at preventing and responding to violence against children.
(b) The Child Helpline was re-established in the Ministry of Social Development. The helpline,
previously run by a non-governmental organization, had closed for some time and was
reactivated under the auspices of the Ministry and provides 24-hour access for children in need of
support.
(c) Partnering with the Lesotho Red Cross Society, national- and community-level child protection
structures were strengthened, benefiting 15,679 children (females: 8,273 and males: 7,406) with
community-based mental health and social support services. Caregivers (10,5200) received
psychological support and positive parenting guidance to better support their children.
(d) To date, 52 village child justice committees have been trained to increase the alternative dispute
resolution measures for children at the community-level justice system. These committees include
children as members, and deal with crime prevention.79
(e) Support to the Ministry of Justice and Law for compilation of a training manual for justice
personnel dealing with child protection issues, including prosecution of children, labour issues,
etc.; the development of Standard Operating Procedures and referral mechanisms for ease of
child protection case management.
(f) Support to the Ministry of Home Affairs to implement the Civilian Registration and Vital Statistics
(CRVS) Strategic Plan 2020–2024 to make civil registration accessible to all, especially people in
hard-to-reach areas, and to introduce innovative approaches to civil registration. With the
implementation of improvements to the system, establishing registration facilities in health care
centres and community outreach, the Ministry has achieved an improvement in the percentage of
children under 5 years whose births are registered, reaching 49 per cent in 2021.
(g) Child protection messaging for advocacy formed a significant part of UNICEF’s interventions, with
a total of 537,528 child protection messages sent to 13,400 subscribers. Other UN agencies,
government ministries and civil society organizations also use these messages. There were other
79 Figures from Key Informant 34.

campaigns led by the Minister of Social Development to address harmful practices and promote
positive prevention strategies – these campaigns reached 18,120 people (10,900 females).
(h) UNICEF’s support enabled Lesotho to meet state party reporting obligations on the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Convention on the Rights and Welfare of
the Child.
Key informants expressed the view that, while UNICEF is making a valuable contribution, the
magnitude of child protection challenges demands that this aspect of the Country Programme should
be prioritized and allocated adequate resources.80 Some of the challenges facing child protection
include:
(a) The Government adopted the Child Friendly Schools approach in the previous Country
Programme cycle. There are significant implementation challenges, including lack of funding, and
the training of teachers in violence prevention and response was disrupted during COVID-19
restrictions, as many teachers did not have access to online facilities.81
(b) Challenges in reaching village child justice committees in remote rural areas, making monitoring
and capacity building difficult. The Ministry of Justice and Law has ambitions to have these village
committees across the country, but lacks the financial resources to do so, as well as evidence of
the effectiveness of these community-based structures.
(c) Challenges in changing entrenched attitudes and behaviours of justice sector professionals
(magistrates, judges and court officials) so that their engagement/processing of child matters is
consistent with child rights principles and more modern approaches to children’s issues.
Outcome 3: By 2023, all children, particularly the most vulnerable, benefit from
gender-responsive social policies for the sustainable and equitable realization of their
rights.
Output 3.1: By 2023, the Government of Lesotho has an improved child- and gender-sensitive, shock-
responsive social protection system.
Finding 13: UNICEF contributed to enhancing the social protection for children in Lesotho
through strengthening policies and strategies and supporting the development and rollout of
shock-responsive social protection. NISSA has played a central role in targeting, planning and
coordination of social assistance. There are however challenges with updating the information
on NISSA.
UNICEF provided significant technical assistance as well as financial assistance to enhance social
protection for children in Lesotho. Key results achieved during the Country Programme cycle include:
(a) The development of the National Social Protection Strategy, which was presented to the Informal
Cabinet in early 2022 and was adopted on 2 August 2022. The strategy is reported to be an
improvement on its predecessor as it includes a monitoring and evaluation framework/plan that

was previously lacking. UNICEF support also enabled the Ministry of Social Development to
finalize the Social Assistance Integration Strategy and develop an operations manual to support
strategy implementation.
(b) UNICEF’s technical and financial assistance to the Ministry of Social Development enabled the
development and implementation of a cash transfers plan to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on existing CGP beneficiaries (47,974 beneficiaries) and enrol an additional 8,162 new
CGP beneficiaries. A total of 53,089 households received humanitarian cash transfers in 2021.
The support has enabled the Government of Lesotho to have a functional shock-responsive
social protection system in place.
(c) UNICEF supported the Ministry of Social Development to develop NISSA in 2010 when the CGP
was introduced. Since then, UNICEF has been supporting the population of the NISSA database
and improvements needed for the system to function effectively as the Government’s single
registry on socio-economic data of all households. The data in NISSA is used in planning and
managing delivery of social assistance payments, targeting beneficiaries for social assistance
programmes, case management and monitoring and evaluation of social assistance programmes.
By 2021, the NISSA database contained 477,563 households, including 157,309 urban
households. In 2022, UNICEF is supporting the Ministry to update the NISSA data, and this is
currently being done on a pilot phase in rural districts. NISSA has been used by other government
agencies, for example, the Disaster Management Authority to target households during the
drought emergency and in the COVID-19 response.
UNICEF was able to achieve these results through the large volume of resources (€21 million from
2015 to 2022) it mobilized from the European Union, and this is testimony to the confidence that the
European Union and the Ministry of Social Development have in UNICEF as a partner.
In 2022, the World Bank approved a loan of US$26.5 million to the Government to strengthen the
livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households in selected communities and to improve the efficiency
and equity of selected social assistance programmes through the Pathways to Sustainable
Livelihoods Project.82 The loan follows the World Bank’s 2021 review of Lesotho’s social protection
programmes and systems. The review made wide-ranging recommendations that have direct
relevance to UNICEF’s work in social protection, for example, scaling up coverage and increased
benefits for the CGP; scaling up digital payments; linking the CGP to health, education and nutrition at
local level; introducing a grievance system for all social assistance programmes; and using NISSA for
targeting for means testing for tertiary bursaries.83
There is uncertainty among some key informants about the delineation between the World Bank and
UNICEF, and concern that the two organizations may be duplicating work. The Ministry of Social
Development has indicated that it is discussing the delineation internally and will be engaging with
UNICEF and the World Bank to give clarity.
Key informants have expressed concerns about the current state of the NISSA system. The process
for updating the NISSA is time-consuming, and there are concerns that the data is rapidly becoming

out-dated and limiting its usefulness. The evaluation observed the pilot updating process in one
community – the community facilitation process took five hours and is used in addition to the door-to-
door enumeration process to capture data on each household. The community process is intended to
promote transparency and community participation. It involves community members discussing the
classification of each household (ultra-poor, poor, middle or able) whether or not they are present,
and appears intrusive. It also has potential to be divisive in communities. Social workers facilitating
the community process confirmed that there were often complaints from community members in the
days following the community process. Key informants also expressed scepticism about obtaining
comprehensive coverage of urban households as enumerators experience difficulties in gaining
access to urban households.
The NISSA system has had technical difficulties, for example, the inability to download data on urban
households. IT systems are developed by external consultants due to a lack of internal capacity in the
Ministry. This dependency on external consultants creates difficulties when there are problems with
the systems or when they have to be modified.
Output 3.2: By 2023, the Government and citizens have increased awareness and capacity to
enhance participation, transparency, accountability, equity and quality of public investment in children.
Finding 14: UNICEF’s support has enhanced the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to adopt
and institutionalize participatory public finance processes. Through UNICEF’s support, the
Ministry is progressively strengthening its medium-term expenditure framework and its
capacities to prepare budget briefs.
UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Finance to implement pre-budget public consultations in a bid
to strengthen the quality and transparency of the public finance budget process in four districts (out of
a target of eight districts) for the 2022/23 budget. UNICEF also procured technical assistance to
capacitate the Ministry of Finance to develop sector (cluster of ministries) medium-term expenditure
frameworks. Four pilot sectors (education, social development, health and gender) have been
identified. UNICEF, in collaboration with UNDP, IOM and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, is
supporting the Government to establish an architecture for financing the acceleration of the
attainment of the SDGs in Lesotho.
UNICEF and the Ministry of Finance co-authored budget briefs on the national budget, education, and
social protection for the 2020–2021 financial year. The Ministry prepared a mid-year budget brief and
has signalled its desire to assume full ownership of the budget brief preparation. UNICEF has
provided training to 20 government officials to facilitate full ownership by the Ministry. According to the
Ministry, the budget briefs are used to inform the Budget Department in their preparations of the next
budget.
The Ministry believes that budget briefs have great potential as evidence to inform decision-making
and is keen to extend the development of budget briefs to other sectors. The difficulty the Ministry
faces is that the sectors to which they wish to expand fall outside the main focus of UNICEF and are
uncertain about the extent to which UNICEF will support them with capacity building and production of
the budget briefs.
51
Output 3.3: By 2023, quality evidence and data are generated through UNICEF-supported
Government programmes to ensure child rights monitoring.84
Finding 15: Lesotho produced two key reports, namely, the Child Poverty Report and the VNR
report 2022, with the assistance of UNICEF. The Country Office envisages further activities
under this output, should it mobilize the necessary resources.
UNICEF provided support to the Bureau of Statistics to conduct and publish the Child Poverty Report.
This is an important result as the Poverty Report uses the Multiple Overlapping Deprivation Analysis
(MODA), which provides updated and detailed analysis of the deprivations experienced by children in
Lesotho. This will enable the Government, UNICEF and other partners to design better-targeted
interventions. The Child Poverty Report updates the 2018 baseline report that was based on the 2014
DHS.
The Government, with the support of UNICEF and other UN agencies in Lesotho, presented its 2022
VNR report to the United Nations Development Cooperation Forum. This report follows on the 2019
VNR report and presents progress towards attainment of the SDGs. The 2022 report focuses on five
SDGs, namely, SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 4 (Quality education), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 15
(Life on land) and SDG 17 (Partnerships), and how progress has been affected by the COVID-19
pandemic. The VNR process reinforces the importance of periodic monitoring and reporting on the
SDGs for learning and fostering greater coordination among ministries, departments and agencies.
The report also highlighted the need for strengthening capacities within government to set priorities
within available resources and align budgets to priorities.85 The report will serve as an important input
to planning, not only for the Government, but also for the United Nations system as it begins the
process of developing the new UNSDCF. UNICEF also produced the poverty estimation to fill the data
gaps for the VNR reporting on Goal 1. It is worth noting that UNICEF spearheaded the use of the U-
Report for the first time, to sensitize and consult youth about SDG progress. This is a promising start
to involving youth more actively in Child Rights Monitoring.
4.3.2 Progress at outcome level
Finding 16: Results at the level of outcomes of the Country Programme are mixed. Social
protection for children, health and children and adolescents’ access to services show positive
changes at indicator level. Learning outcomes for children and access to pre-primary
education have not progressed.
The evaluation assessed progress at the level of Country Programme outcomes using data reported
in the UNICEF Lesotho Country Programme Report and the latest available data accessed from the
UNICEF database and UNAIDS. Table 14 shows the status of indicators as of December 2021,
assessed against targets and baselines. Assessing progress against outcome indicators is a
challenge as the last DHS for Lesotho was reported in 2018, as the survey planned for 2019 was
postponed due to COVID-19. In the case of data relating to education outcomes, the last national
assessment was conducted in 2019.

Indicators for social protection are positive, with an increase in the proportion of the national budget
allocated to the social sector and in the proportion of children in poor families benefiting from direct
cash transfers. This increase is undoubtedly a reflection of the additional resources that the
Government directed to the social sector to respond to and mitigate the negative impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF played a significant role in supporting the Ministry of Social
Development to expand the number of households benefiting from cash transfers and increasing the
size of cash transfers. Indications from the Ministry of Social Development are that the Government
remains committed to expanding and strengthening the system of social protection subject to the
availability of resources.

As the Country Programme was developed prior to 2019, it does not have indicators for the COVID-
19 health response. As of 14 August 2022, the country had administered 1,102,069 doses of COVID-
53
19 vaccine.86 As of 17 July 2022, 38.25 per cent of the population had completed the initial
vaccination protocol (i.e., were fully vaccinated) and 2.26 per cent of the population was partly
vaccinated.87 UNICEF contributed to this result through its support in areas of procurement, logistics,
cold chain storage and SBCC to address vaccine hesitancy. This contribution is alongside the support
to routine immunization, PMTCT and neonatal care – all indicators which show progress at the
outcome level.
Results at the outcome level show an increase in the number of children who experienced violence
being reached by health, social work or justice/law enforcement services. The percentage of children
living with HIV and receiving ART has increased from the 2018 baseline, and there has been a
modest increase in the proportion of children under 5 years whose births have been registered.
Outcome indicators for education are not moving in a positive direction. The decline in gross pre-
primary enrolments and no improvement in learning outcomes are areas of concern. Although
UNICEF made a significant contribution to supporting continuation of learning during the COVID-19
lockdowns and also supported learning in the recovery phase, this was not sufficient to address the
problem of poor learning outcomes that pre-date the pandemic and have been compounded by the
pandemic.
Finding 17: Results of the Country Programme have been affected by several factors,
including the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the risks identified in the theories of change
emerged during the period under review, and certain assumptions on which the Country
Programme was based did not hold true.
The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Country Programme results; the impact was
negative in some areas but also presented opportunities for positive or improved results. Social
protection is a case where coverage of social protection was increased at a faster rate than might
have been the case in the absence of the pandemic. Improvements in WASH, including hand hygiene
in schools and communities, are another example of positive outcomes from the pandemic. In the
case of education, the pandemic contributed to two years of lost learning, notwithstanding the efforts
made to provide distance learning and accelerated learning once schools reopened. While the
pandemic is reported to have contributed to an increase in gender-based violence and violence
against children, it also spurred on the reactivation of the Child Helpline.88
The period under review also saw the country experience political instability. The coalition
government collapsed in May 2020 and a new coalition government, headed by a new Prime Minister
was formed. Elections conducted on 7 October 2022 resulted in a new party leading the government.
In times of political uncertainty, decision making in ministries tends to slow down and there is slower
progress on matters that require the approval of the cabinet, ministers, or at the level of the Principal
Secretary. In his inauguration speech, the new Prime Minister committed to major reforms of the
public sector, to make it more efficient, effective, transparent and accountable, including the
introduction of performance contracts for Ministers and Principal Secretaries, revised legislation and

policies for the deployment of government officials, and the introduction of citizen-based monitoring.89
These changes are likely to impact the pace of implementation of programmes in the coming year.
The theories of change of the three programme components identified macro-economic stability as a
key assumption for the Country Programme strategies to contribute to the achievement of the outputs,
and in turn contribute to progress at the level of outcomes. This assumption did not hold true. Like
other countries in the sub-region and globally, Lesotho has been experiencing macro-economic
challenges and fiscal constraints.90 Although the COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase in resources
mobilized by the Government and its development partners, the larger proportion of resources was
directed to the COVID-19 response. Resources were also redirected/repurposed from other sectors to
support the health sector. Government partners believed that the resources available for the COVID-
19 response and for routine services were insufficient.91
The decline in the HDI score for 2021 for Lesotho and most countries globally is testament to the
impact of the pandemic and the increasing uncertainty and complexity of the national, regional and
global environment.92
4.3.3 Programme effectiveness
Outcome 4: The country programme is efficiently designed, coordinated, managed
and supported to meet quality-programming standards for achieving results for
children.
Output 4.1: Guidance, tools and resources to effectively design and manage the programme of
cooperation are available to UNICEF and its partners.
Finding 18: The Country Office has adopted sound tools for effective programme
management, and diligently tracks progress against key indicators and targets for programme
outputs. The absence of an overarching theory of change for the Country Programme is a
missed opportunity for strengthening programmatic coherence.
The Country Office bases its work on annual work plans that have been agreed to with government
partners, based on prior discussions on key results planned and the resources available. The mid-
term reviews of progress, held with government partners and civil society partners, provide an
opportunity to adjust the programme where necessary. The Country Office is able to track
implementation of programmes by partners through the Partner Reporting Portal. A series of internal
meetings with documented follow-up actions, including monthly programme management team
meetings, enable the Country Office to monitor and report on progress. The Country Office uses a
donor reporting workflow to ensure timely submission and quality of reports to donors. Field

monitoring, which was halted in 2020, resumed in 2021, enabling UNICEF to track implementation
progress and challenges, perform quality assurance checks, and collect monitoring data for reporting
to donors.
The Country Programme design is informed by a theory of change for each outcome: the First
Decade, Second Decade and Social Inclusion. While these are useful for understanding the rationale
underpinning the choice of interventions in each of the three outcome areas, they are not embedded
in an overarching theory of change for the Country Programme that shows the connections or
coherence of the three outcomes. Each theory of change is presented differently in a diagrammatic
form, suggesting different thought processes and approaches to developing the theory of change.
This makes it all the more difficult to see the linkages between the theories of change and how the
three outcome areas “add-up” to contribute to the vision of the Country Programme as stated in the
CPD: “to reach every child, everywhere, every time, with opportunities to survive, develop and reach
her or his full potential.”
The evaluation observed some inconsistencies between the indicators in the CPD, Annual Work
Plans and RAM report. There is also missing target information in the RAM report and changes
proposed at the SMR December 2021 have not yet been made in the RAM reporting system.
Output 4.2: Guidance, tools and resources to effectively generate, analyse and utilize statistical and
qualitative information for Child Rights System Monitoring are available in the country.
Finding 19: UNICEF is contributing to strengthening the policy environment for monitoring
and evaluation, as well as capacities of government officials responsible for monitoring and
evaluation. The demand for strengthening national monitoring and evaluation capacities is
large and requires a joint effort with other UN agencies.
Following on the Lesotho Monitoring and Evaluation Situation Analysis (MESA) completed in 2017
with support from UNDP, UNICEF is contributing to strengthening national monitoring and evaluation
capacities. UNICEF supported the Ministry of Development Planning to lead the process of
developing the national monitoring and evaluation policy, with its accompanying implementation
strategy and action plan, as well as evaluation guidelines. The Government is expected to approve
the policy during the current Country Programme cycle. UNICEF also supported the Ministry of
Development Planning to secure training in monitoring and evaluation for 40 government staff from
various ministries, departments and agencies. The national monitoring and evaluation policy,
evaluation guidelines and training represent a good start to building a robust national monitoring and
evaluation system in Lesotho. Strengthening the national monitoring and evaluation system can also
encourage government ministries, departments and agencies to improve the quality of their
programme and administrative data. The Ministry of Development Planning is appreciative of the
support received from UNICEF, but expressed concern that the resources available for strengthening
the national monitoring and evaluation system are insufficient to match the scale of the task. UNICEF
has been working in collaboration with the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office and UNDP on
strengthening national capacities, and this is probably an area of work that will be continued under the
next UNSDCF.
UNICEF contributed to the Lesotho Vulnerability Assessments (LVAC), participating in the
development of data collection tools for these assessments; as well as supporting the mapping of 400
high-risk schools in seven districts trained on infection prevention and control.93

The Country Office has made good use of U-Report as a tool for collecting data on the views of
programme beneficiaries. This was especially useful during the COVID-19 lockdown periods. For
example, UNICEF using U-Report, supported the Ministry of Health to poll health workers. The
responses from 400 health workers were used to inform the messaging for the first phase of vaccine
introduction. UNICEF also supported the Ministry of Health to conduct a social listening exercise,
analysing conversations on COVID-19 in 5 of 10 districts and using these to inform the subsequent
phases of the national vaccine strategy.
During the period under review, UNICEF launched its research and evaluation agenda. One
evaluation on the Child Friendly Schools programme was completed in 2019, while two evaluations
commissioned are to be completed in 2022. The Country Office also collaborated with the UNICEF
Office of Research – Innocenti and a national consultancy firm to conduct a research study on
children’s views and experiences of COVID-19 in Lesotho, as part of a global study.
Output 4.3: Guidance, tools and resources for effective communication on child rights issues with
stakeholders are available to UNICEF and its partners.
Finding 20: UNICEF has utilized SBCC in several Country Programme interventions. The
Country Office however does not have a SBCC strategy, nor have SBCC initiatives been
evaluated to assess their effectiveness.
UNICEF utilized SBCC in the implementation of the Country Programme. The evaluation found
examples of SBCC in all three Country Programme outcomes. The COVID-19 context reinforced the
importance of SBCC in programme implementation and achieving sustainable results.
SBCC featured strongly in the COVID-19 response. UNICEF supported the national COVID-19 Risk
Communication and Engagement group that was critical to driving communication awareness about
COVID-19 and debunking misinformation about the disease and vaccines.94 SBCC was used in the
national deployment of COVID-19 vaccines – to collect data to understand perceptions,
misperceptions and concerns about vaccines, and to design and implement communication
messages and engagement processes to respond to these. SBCC also played an important role in
WASH in schools and communities – in communicating and practicing hand hygiene and the use of
tippy taps that had been installed – through collaboration with community water committees and
WASH clubs in schools.95
While SBCC played an important role in the response to COVID-19, SBCC was not confined to
COVID-19. SBCC was also used in the WASH emergency response to the 2019 drought, and was
also used to mobilize communities/mothers to ensure that young children continue to receive routine
immunization during the pandemic. In child protection, UNICEF engaged in SBCC with campaigns on
child marriages.96 Other examples of SBCC are found in campaigns to address taboos around
menstrual hygiene; campaigns for male family planning; and empowering young mothers and their in-
laws to relate to one another.
Discussions at the 2021 SMR indicated that the Country Office attached importance to SBCC.
However, the SBCC interventions pursued to date did not emerge from an overarching strategy, nor

have they been evaluated for their effectiveness or impact.97 Such a strategy might guide how best to
use SBCC in supporting purposeful implementation of the Country Programme and in utilizing SBCC
resources required for implementation, as well as revealing how the effectiveness of SBCC
interventions will be assessed. The SMR meeting urged each section to ensure that it made provision
for SBCC in its budget.98
Finding 21: UNICEF has made good use of partnerships as a tool for achieving results for
children. There is scope for strengthening existing partnerships and increasing the diversity
of partners. The Country Office is developing a partnership strategy with this aim in mind.
Civil society partnerships. UNICEF works in partnership with a number of civil society organizations in
Lesotho, for example, the Lesotho Red Cross Society, LNFOD, the Network of Early Childhood
Development of Lesotho, Help Lesotho and the Catholic Relief Services. These partners have
enabled UNICEF to extend its reach into communities and have implemented programmes on behalf
of UNICEF. Partnerships with civil society organizations have focused on service delivery, though not
exclusively so. The evaluation noted an example of partnering on advocacy for inclusive education
with LNFOD. In-country civil society organizations have access to the communities they serve and a
nuanced understanding of the country context. They are able to bring another lens or perspective on
a particular issue and should be used more in advocacy on the rights of children. A platform or forum
for engaging civil society organizations can also assist in coordination and building synergies in
implementation of programmes. In doing so, the Country Office will need to be mindful of the resource
constraints that civil society organizations have, and that joint advocacy with civil society
organizations may require UNICEF to provide some financial support. A concern expressed by civil
society partners was that UNICEF and donors agree on performance indicators, but third parties (e.g.,
civil society organizations) are not always involved in determining the performance indicators. This
results in inappropriate indicators or unrealistic performance targets set.
Private sector. UNICEF’s partnerships with the private sector are nascent or sporadic. The Country
Office has held discussions with mobile network providers for support to the Learning Passport and
obtained financial support from a life insurance company to pilot a nutrition intervention. The private
sector in Lesotho, a low middle-income country, includes South African companies with operations in
Lesotho and does offer potential as a partner. The private sector can be leveraged for technical
expertise, not only for financial resources. UNICEF can also build partnerships with the private sector
for advocacy on child rights.
There are few donors in Lesotho and UNICEF works with USAID/PEPFAR, the European Union, and
the Global Partnership for Education. UNICEF has also mobilized resources from two private
philanthropic foundations.
The evaluation found that the partnerships are pursued and managed by the respective sections
and/or individuals within the Country Office, without the guidance of a partnership strategy to
coordinate UNICEF’s partnerships. This was evident from the interviews with the Country Office
teams and confirmed by stakeholders who urged UNICEF to adopt a more coordinated approach to
its partners to build synergies and avoid duplication of effort.99 The Country Office runs the risk of
missed opportunities for truly strategic partnerships – where there is a shared vision of the results to

58
be achieved by the partnership, with each partner contributing according to their comparative
strengths. Partnerships then remain ad hoc, driven by individuals, and are limited in diversity.
4.4 Efficiency
Evaluation question 7. Were resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise, etc.) allocated and
utilized strategically to track and achieve results, including equity and gender-related objectives? How
did the country office approach implementation of programme areas that were not well resourced?
Finding 22: UNICEF allocated its financial resources to outputs that were prioritized by the
Government for the response to COVID-19 and for continuity of essential services. A
significant proportion of the allocation went to the social protection output, which achieved
positive results for children. Allocations to outputs for child protection and ECCD-pre-primary
education are among the smallest of allocations of the three main Country Programme
outcomes, and these are two areas where progress has been limited.
The Country Office has been effective in mobilizing resources for the Country Programme, mostly
earmarked to specific programmes. Resource mobilization is the responsibility of the staff in the
various sections of the Country Office, and is not left to a single resource mobilization officer. This is a
sound approach, as each section understands best what is needed. However, in the absence of a
resource mobilization strategy to guide resource mobilization, there is a risk that different sections of
the office could approach the same potential resource partner, or staff jealously guard their
relationship with their resource partners and are reluctant to share them with other sections in the
office which could benefit from support. There is also the risk that resource mobilization becomes
fragmented and inefficient and opportunities to mobilize resources are missed. There are other UN
agencies competing for the attention of the same resource partners. The limited number of potential
donors in Lesotho makes it essential to have a clear strategy for resource mobilization. In addition, an
office-wide resource mobilization strategy could facilitate better development of integrated
programmes, as often programme integration is explored after individual siloed programmes have
been developed and funded.
Most of the Country Office resources are from Other Resources (OR–Regular = 64 per cent and OR–
Emergency = 12 per cent), with Regular Resources representing 18 per cent of the resource
allocation for Country Programme. There is therefore limited discretion that the Country Office can
apply in the allocation of resources to the various outputs. That is, funds mobilized (Other Resources)
must be used for the intended purpose. The volume of resources that are mobilized for a particular
output determines the allocation of funds to outputs.
As can be seen from Figure 4, nearly one-third of the resource allocation was to Output 3.1 Social
Protection, reflecting the success with which the Country Office has been able to mobilize resources
for social protection. The resources for Output 3.1 were largely in the form of Other Resources–
Regular (over US$12.5 million), while the allocation from Regular Resources for this output was less
than US$4,000,000 (Figure 5).
Sizeable volumes of resources were mobilized and allocated for Output 1.2 and Output 2.2, for health
and education, respectively. The largest share of resources for these two outputs were from Other
Resources–Emergency, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 5). The volume of resources
allocated to child protection and ECCD-pre-primary education is small. The allocation for child
protection seems not to be commensurate with the intended results for this output. Key informants
point to the limited finance in the face of the high costs associated with reaching existing village
59
justice committees and the Government’s plans to significantly increase the number of village justice
committees.

60
Financial resources from UNICEF are meant to be catalytic and attract resources from other sources,
including the Government. This has happened to a limited extent, as there are very few donors in
Lesotho. On the side of the Government, UNICEF’s financial contributions complement what the
Government already funds – for example, in social protection, or funding technical assistance to
develop or review a strategy or policy. However, there are also examples of UNICEF funding activities
that seem not to be strategic, for example, venues and catering for meetings.
While partners are generally satisfied with the efficiency of UNICEF procedures, concerns were
expressed about the system of drawing down funds on a quarterly basis – it is difficult to spend all the
funds in one quarter and a block is placed on the next draw down. There is however
acknowledgement on the part of these partners that perhaps there is a problem with how they plan,
and that they are requesting too much for their capacity to spend.
The evaluation was not able to make a detailed assessment of the gender-responsiveness of the
budget allocations, as the budget information is not disaggregated. The evaluation could only infer
from the budget allocation to some outputs. The allocations to Outputs 1.1, 1.2 and 2.1 for example,
are intended to primarily benefit women and adolescent girls, and the (very small) allocation to Output
2.3 is intended in part to respond to gender-based violence. However, for the remaining outputs, it is
difficult to assess gender-responsiveness of the allocations.
Finding 23: Staff resources have been deployed efficiently. Staff however do feel that the
Country Office is under-staffed to meet the demands of the country.
The Lesotho Country Programme is small in terms of the volume of resources mobilized and spent,
and the staff size is commensurate with the size of the Country Programme. The prevailing view in
the Country Office is that the staffing is insufficient for what the Country Programme is expected to
achieve, and that while Lesotho is a low middle-income country, the capacity and resource limitations
in government ministries require a much more hands-on approach than would be the case in an upper
middle-income country. The Country Office contracts consultants to fill gaps in its own staffing and
capabilities. A concern raised by staff is that while the contracting model increases the capacity of the
Country Office, there is the risk that contracted experts engaging directly with ministries develop
relationships with these ministries to the exclusion of UNICEF, raising questions about the value-
added of UNICEF beyond provision of funding. Related to this is the view that if the Country Office
increased the number of senior national officers and made effective use of their expertise and local
knowledge, this could be more cost effective than engaging consultants, while also providing
continuity in the work and relationships with government partners and strengthening UNICEF’s
influencing role. The model of funding Technical Advisers within government ministries, with the view
to the Government eventually taking over funding of these positions, was raised by government
partners as a more efficient model for providing technical assistance to ministries than appointing
consultants.
Operations staff play an important role in providing the enablers for programme delivery. The Country
Office has a small operations staff component, which is complemented with support from the BLNE
Hub in Johannesburg. There is good collaboration between operations and programmes functions,
with operations issues discussed as a standing item on the monthly Country Management Team
meetings, and joint monitoring of key management indicators that include monitoring of grants,
reporting, resource mobilization and monthly direct cash transfers. Financial management is reported
to have improved as a result of the close collaboration between operations and programme
61
functions.100 Operation staff raised concerns about being under-staffed, and these were noted at the
December SMR discussions. Since then, a position to deal with human resource administration
matters has been filled in the Country Office.
Evaluation question 8. To what extent have the convergence strategy, the programme structure,
including the life cycle approach, the office structure and the matrix management approach supported
the delivery of the Country Programme? Were the chosen strategies and approaches the most cost
effective and efficient? Were there alternatives that would have worked better and what are those?
Finding 24: The decade structure/life cycle approach has largely been effective in supporting
the delivery of the Country Programme and has to some extent fostered programmatic
coherence. Coherence can be improved. The Country Office operates partly on a matrix
management, but for the most part, the Country Office operates in a conventional hierarchical
management arrangement.
The decade structure of the Country Programme requires sections of the Country Office to collaborate
and ensure that they contribute to a particular outcome, irrespective of the section in which they are
located. The evaluation found a few examples of coherence that were planned. Although WASH falls
programmatically under the CSD section, WASH in schools is based on close collaboration with the
Basic Education and Adolescent Development section (BEADS) of the Country Office. Child
protection located under this section contributes to the work of the CSD in respect of birth registration.
Monthly programme management team meetings, biweekly meetings of section heads and biweekly
meetings of all staff not only help the Country Office to track progress with the implementation of the
Country Programme, but also assist in allowing sections and teams to draw in staff from other
sections or teams for a specific piece of work. There is room for improving programmatic coherence
and general agreement among Country Office staff that coherence should be institutionalized rather
than left to individuals to decide when and with whom to collaborate.
4.5 Sustainability
Evaluation question 9. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country
Programme sustainable at the relevant levels (e.g., community, provincial/state, national)? To what
extent have the programme strategies adopted by UNICEF contributed to, or been designed in a way
that they will contribute to, sustainability of results, especially equity and gender-related results?
Evaluation question 10. To what extent have the programme strategies, plans and tools, particularly
those with an equity and gender focus, been institutionalized in systems, policies, mechanisms and
strategies among government, NGO/civil society and other partners and stakeholders? Will the
strategies/plans/tools be more widely replicated or adapted? What's the scalability of models
introduced by UNICEF?

Finding 25: UNICEF’s strategy of systems strengthening, fostering government ownership and
partnerships with civil society organizations contributes to the sustainability of results. There
are also interventions with limited prospects for sustainability given the financial constraints
in government ministries.
The evaluation found examples of interventions that have good prospects for sustainability. By
supporting systems strengthening, UNICEF is improving the prospects for the sustainability of results.
Examples include strengthening the capacities and systems for vaccines; part of the COVID-19
response was supporting the Ministry of Health in the provision of systems managing different
vaccines, including those needed for routine immunization and health management information
systems. UNICEF’s support for strengthening the Civil and Vital Statistics Registration is another
example of sustainability. The system has the capability to be rolled out at hospitals, and with the
training and manuals provided, births can be registered at hospitals. Strengthening the system of
social protection, including NISSA, will contribute to a sustainable social protection system for
Lesotho.
There are examples of government ownership, which augur well for sustainability. The Child
Protection Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Social Development was established with financial
support from UNICEF. The Ministry has taken over the funding of the two full-time positions in the
unit. The Government has officially adopted the Learning Passport as its online platform for learners
and teachers, and the civil society organization that has been working with UNICEF and the
Government on the Learning Passport has incorporated it into the online learning programmes.
Although there are still challenges related to data charges, the Learning Passport has good prospects
for sustainability. The budget briefs are another example of sustainability. There is a clear interest
from the Ministry of Finance in replicating the budget briefs beyond the social sector and taking full
ownership of the budget analysis and drafting of these briefs. The co-authorship of the past budget
briefs and the training provided to government officials serves as a foundation for the Ministry to scale
up the budget briefs (subject to the availability of financial resources).
Partnering with established civil society organizations is another strategy that contributes to the
sustainability of results. For example, the Lesotho Red Cross Society continues to deliver on projects
after UNICEF funding has ended, integrating the UNICEF-funded initiatives into other projects.
There are projects or initiatives where donor funding will be ending in the current programme cycle,
including the HIV and Nutrition integrated programme funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and
Development Office and 2gether 4 SRHR, funded by the Swedish Agency for International
Development Cooperation. These will require advocacy for integration into the budget lines of the
relevant ministries. The Child Helpline has been taken over by the Ministry of Social Development
with donor funding for two years and will need a plan to sustain its operations once the donor funding
ceases. The micronutrients project will see donor funding coming to an end, and the Government is
negotiating a loan for its continuation.
Government partners identified the lack of adequate finance as the main obstacle to implementing
policies and/or scaling up interventions. The WASH interventions in schools, for example, could only
reach a limited number of schools with the available budget. There is a huge unmet need for
improving WASH in schools, but the Ministry of Education and Training and related ministries do not
have the funds to scale up.
UNICEF’s support has a beginning and an end, and how support ends is an important consideration
in ensuring that results achieved are sustainable. The evaluation notes that partnership agreements
make provision for partners to outline sustainability plans once project funding ends. There is however
63
the huge burden of expectation from government partners that UNICEF will continue to mobilize
resources for them and fund the important activities.
UNICEF support has generated important knowledge products, for example, the budget briefs and the
Child Poverty Study. Creating greater awareness of knowledge products, beyond the initial launch, is
a strategy for scaling up knowledge. The evaluation did not find use of this strategy by UNICEF. It
may be that there has been limited opportunity to do so because of the COVID-19 restrictions.

5 CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNT
5.1 Conclusions
The implementation of the Country Programme 2019–2023 takes place against the backdrop of an
environment that is challenging and uncertain. The drought in early 2019, followed by the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic, has seen the first half of the Country Programme cycle dominated by
humanitarian responses. As the immediate threat of COVID-19 has begun to subside, the social and
economic impact of the pandemic, coupled with the on-going climate change crisis, place greater
pressure on UNICEF to support the Government of Lesotho as it tries to recover from the pandemic.
While COVID-19 has exposed the shortcomings and gaps in government policies, systems and
delivery of services for children, it has provided UNICEF with the opportunity to test alternative
approaches, strengthen existing systems and develop new partnerships.
UNICEF Lesotho has delivered commendable results for children and adolescents in this very
challenging period. The results achieved are testimony to the agility and resilience of the Country
Office, the technical expertise of its staff, good management practices and strong relationships with its
partners. There are areas for improvement that can be addressed within the current Country
Programme and in anticipation of the next Country Programme.
Relevance
The Country Programme has been highly relevant to addressing the multiple and overlapping
deprivations that children and adolescents in Lesotho experience, and it is well aligned with the
priorities for children and adolescents set out in the NSDP II. UNICEF ensured the relevance of the
Country Programme by adapting its mix of strategies to the changing demands of the country context.
Its focus on service delivery intensification in the immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis is
appropriate, as is its shift in emphasis to systems strengthening to build resilience to future shocks.
The development agenda was not forgotten in the period of the humanitarian crisis as UNICEF
advocated for continuity in delivery of essential services for children and adolescents.
Coherence
The Country Programme is aligned with the UNDAF 2019–2023, and UNICEF contributes to
coherence within the UN system in Lesotho, through chairing the Programme Coherence Team and
the Communications Group. Collaboration among UN agencies under the UN Social and Economic
Response Plan was strong, but there are calls from UN agencies to strengthen collaboration further,
and for UNICEF to recognize and make better use of the comparative strengths of these agencies.
The internal coherence of the Country Programme can be improved. The theories of change for each
Country Programme component or the three core outcomes were not nested in an overarching theory
of change, and so the synergies and connections between the outcomes are not obvious. The
absence of a theory of change for the Country Programme as a whole may also explain the
projectized rather than coherent approach to addressing gender inequality, ECD and adolescent
programming task forces, as well as the absence of crosscutting strategies for SBCC and
partnerships.
Effectiveness
The Country Programme is effective, and is likely to achieve at least 75 per cent of the output targets
by the end of the country programme cycle. UNICEF has made important contributions, including
strengthening the social protection system; maintaining the reduction in mother-to-child transmission
65
of HIV; ensuring continuity in routine immunization; contributing to continuity in teaching and learning;
strengthening capacities in the ECCD sector; and aiding in the provision of psychosocial support
children and caregivers.
Output targets have been achieved in all four outcomes of the Country Programme. UNICEF’s ability
to mobilize resources for its partners, the use of SBCC and strong partnerships have been important
enablers of results achieved, along with effective monitoring of the implementation of the Country
Programme.
There are areas where the achievement of output targets was lagging at the end of December 2021,
and there is sufficient time for the Country Office to address the blockages to progress before the end
of the current Country Programme. These include working with government partners to resolve
challenges with the updating of NISSA and the delays in data capture for the enhanced EMIS, as well
as updating health sector data (through surveys and administration data).
When assessing the results at the level of outcomes of the Country Programme, there are good
results for social protection, HIV and immunization. Nutrition of young children and adolescents
remains a challenge. Assessing progress at outcome level for aspects of health and education has
been challenged by the lack of updated national data. There is a need to strengthen national data
systems, and this is an issue that could benefit from joint action on the part of UN agencies in
Lesotho. Climate change will continue to require attention in the next Country Programme.
Efficiency
UNICEF has allocated resources to the outputs for which the resources have been mobilized. The
Country Office has been especially effective in mobilizing resources for social protection and
education. The volume of resources mobilized and allocated for child protection is insufficient to
achieve the intended results of this programme output. The office lacks an office-wide resource
mobilization strategy that could assist in mobilizing resources for under-funded programme
components and facilitating programme integration at the early stages of programme design. The
Country Office has utilized staff resources efficiently, but there is scope for considering alternative
models of staffing the Country Office and providing technical assistance to government partners.
Sustainability
Several results achieved under the Country Programme have good prospects for sustainability as
UNICEF is strengthening systems and the Government has strong ownership of these systems.
UNICEF’s strategies of strengthening existing capacities in government and partnering with civil
society organizations have also contributed to the sustainability of results. While there are examples
of the Government institutionalizing UNICEF-supported programmes and taking over the financing of
these, the budgetary constraints that will remain for the foreseeable future limit the prospects for the
Government to scale up successful interventions.
5.2 Lessons learnt
The implementation of the Country Programme, especially against the backdrop of the COVID-19
pandemic, generated several lessons learnt, and the most pertinent of these are mentioned below.
1. A relentless focus on, and investing significant resources on one particular issue where UNICEF
can make a major difference, can be more impactful than spreading investments and resources
66
across a myriad of small-scale interventions. UNICEF’s success in the area of social protection is
a good example of this approach.
2. Responding effectively to a national crisis requires good planning, coordination and collaboration,
even under the extremely difficult conditions such as those experienced during the first year of the
COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF was able to plan under conditions of crisis and mobilize the
resources required to support the national response to the pandemic. It was necessary to have
detailed plans on how to deliver its support under conditions of restricted movement, for example,
the logistics, storage and distribution of vaccines, and the rapid development of teaching and
learning materials. Collaboration with government partners, civil society organizations and other
UN agencies was essential for the effective implementation of the COVID-19 response. A related
lesson is the importance of psychosocial support and equipment to enable Country Office staff to
work remotely. Staff received such support that enabled them to continue their work under very
stressful conditions.
3. Crosscutting issues such as gender equality, partnerships and social behaviour change and
communication can benefit from specific strategies to guide how they are implemented in the
Country Programme. Strategies for these cross-cutting issues can facilitate coherence and
synergies of interventions, lend specificity to the results to be achieved in these cross-cutting
areas and the monitoring of results, and clarity on the division of labour in the Country Office for
these cross-cutting issues.
4. Technology is an important enabler for development and during periods of crisis. However, the
introduction of technology should give careful consideration to the practicalities of using the
technology and the issue of sustainability. The introduction of the Learning Passport is a good
example of excellent technology, which is hampered by the lack of devices for children who
cannot afford their own devices, and the cost of data outside of school premises. Another
example is the limited number of computers at district level to capture data for the new EMIS,
resulting in delays in capturing and uploading data to the EMIS.
5. Quality, disaggregated data are essential for the effective planning, implementation, monitoring
and reporting progress of the Country Programme. National data systems have significant data
gaps and this has presented difficulties for UNICEF to assess progress at the level of programme
outcomes. The lack of adequate data presents a major challenge to the Government in
monitoring progress towards attainment of the SDGs, and a challenge to other UN agencies and
development partners for assessing the effectiveness of their contributions to the development of
Lesotho.
67
6 RECOMMENDATIONS
This section of the report outlines the recommendations, categorized into recommendations for the
next country programme and recommendations for the current country programme. Short-term
recommendations are those that should be acted upon within the next 6 months, and medium-term
recommendations are those that should be acted upon within the next 12 months to the end of the
country programme cycle.
Early ideas for recommendations were shared with the Country Office, and these were refined based
on the feedback from the Country Office. The recommendations are for action by UNICEF Lesotho.
However, government partners and the UN Country Team may wish to take cognizance of the
recommendations in preparation for the forthcoming UNSDCF. Civil society organizations are
important partners in the implementation of the Country Programme and may wish to take cognizance
of the recommendations for their internal planning and strategies on their future engagement with
UNICEF.
6.1 Recommendations for the next Country Programme
Recommendation 1: UNICEF should improve the design of the next Country Programme by
developing a theory of change for the Country Programme and nested theories of change for
the components of the Country Programme. (Priority: high; time-frame: short-term)
The current Country Programme has theories of change, but these are not nested in an overarching
theory of change, thus making it difficult to see the linkages between the components and how their
convergence contributes to Country Programme outcomes. An overarching theory of change will
assist the Country Office in developing a shared understanding of the change pathways, assumptions
and risks, and identifying cross-cutting strategies to address risks. It will also assist the Country Office
in presenting a coherent picture of the Country Programme to its partners in government, civil society,
the UN system in Lesotho and other stakeholders.
UNICEF should test or validate the draft theory of change with its partners in government and civil
society. This will enable the Country Office to test the assumptions and risks in the draft theory of
change, identify data gaps and improve the selection of indicators for the Country Programme.
Involvement of government partners and civil society can also foster a greater sense of national
ownership of the Country Programme and support sustainability.
UNICEF should engage other UN agencies in discussions on the draft theory of change. Not only is
this useful for validation, it can also serve to identify opportunities for joint programmes and
collaboration. The theory of change can also serve as UNICEF’s input to the design of the UNSDCF.
The draft theory of change for the Country Programme should guide the development of theories of
change for the programme components. The process should be iterative, making adjustments to the
Country Programme theory of change where required.
The Country Office should use the theories of change during its annual review to test assumptions
and risks and take appropriate action.
Recommendation 2: UNICEF should develop a gender strategy for the next Country
Programme and start the process by conducting a gender programmatic review. (Priority:
high; time-frame: short-term)
68
Although the various interventions under the current Country Programme are gender-responsive, the
Country Programme lacks coherence in its approach to gender inequality. The Country Office should
develop a gender strategy for the next Country Programme that is transformative and brings
coherence to UNICEF’s gender-related initiatives. A gender programmatic review can provide
UNICEF and its partners with a detailed evidence base on the progress in addressing gender
inequalities in Lesotho to inform the development of gender-transformative policies for the next
Country Programme. The gender programmatic review process is also an opportunity for UNICEF
and its partners, especially government partners, to jointly interrogate the current strategies and
approaches to addressing gender inequality and to enhance the capacities of the Country Office and
government and civil society partners for gender analysis and the application of a gender lens.
UNICEF should consider conducting this review jointly with other UN agencies such as UNFPA, with
which it has a joint gender-related programme. The review also presents an opportunity to involve UN
Women and the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation.
Recommendation 3: UNICEF should retain the life cycle approach in the design and
implementation of the next Country Programme. The Country Office should be more deliberate
in pursuing programmatic coherence and collaboration across work sections or units.
(Priority: high; time-frame: medium-term)
The life cycle approach in the design of the Country Programme is a useful approach to ensure that
interventions are appropriate for the age and development stage of children and adolescents. The
approach has to some extent allowed staff in the Country Office to work outside their section
boundaries. The life cycle approach should be retained.
The Country Office should be more deliberate in integrated cross-sectoral programming, delivery and
reporting in the next Country Programme. This involves setting out clear procedures to be followed for
integrated interventions within UNICEF. Not all interventions need to be integrated interventions, and
the Country Office should only pursue integrated programmes where the results delivered will be
significantly better than not having an integrated programme.
As part of the Country Programme design process, the Country Office should review its management
and coordination mechanisms and align these to the new Country Programme. It should ensure that
reporting lines are clear where programmes are integrated. The Country Office should also review the
staffing mix to ensure that the Country Office is ‘fit for purpose’ for the next Country Programme.
Recommendation 4: UNICEF should identify one or two issues as a focus for the next Country
Programme. This does not lessen the importance of other issues and is intended to serve as a
flagship for positioning UNICEF to play a key influencing role and have a significant impact.
(Priority: high; time-frame: medium-term)
Focusing on a specific issue where UNICEF has the potential to make a significant impact is one of
the key lessons from the implementation of the Country Programme. Building on its past work in
social protection, UNICEF seized the opportunity to advance the social protection agenda and made a
difference to the children and households that benefited from the social protection response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The choice of priority issues is for the Country Office to decide, using UNICEF’s guidance on
prioritization in developing Country Programme documents, along with guidance from ESARO. The
evaluation does however recommend that addressing the learning crisis in Lesotho should be
considered as one of the top priorities. As the country moves to the post-pandemic era, UNICEF
should consider focusing its attention on building forward, and here the learning of children and
adolescents presents an opportunity. The education of children and adolescents is in crisis, and
69
UNICEF is well placed to make a significant contribution. Transforming education and learning offers
an opportunity for integrating a range of issues, for example, child mental and physical health, WASH,
climate change action, nutrition of school-aged children, social protection, child protection, SRHR and
HIV. It is also an opportunity to address the issues of disability and children marginalized by virtue of
living in remote areas, gender inequality, strengthen the use of technology and innovation and put into
place SBCC. The focus on learning can serve as a platform for partnerships with the private sector,
which tends to favour education programmes in their corporate social investment. This approach does
not lessen the importance of the other work of UNICEF, as all should contribute to improving learning
outcomes.
6.2 Recommendations for the current Country Programme
Recommendation 5: UNICEF should review the current programme portfolio and identify
projects or activities that could be scaled down at the end of the current Country Programme
cycle and put in place action plans for their sustainability. The review should also identify
areas that could be scaled up and are likely to continue in the next Country Programme.
UNICEF should also address the challenges identified with two important systems, namely,
the NISSA and the EMIS. (Priority: high; time-frame: short-term)
UNICEF should avoid the carry over of projects by default into the next country programme. It should
review the current portfolio and identify the projects and activities that could be scaled down, scaled
up or maintained. This portfolio review should take into account the current performance of the project
and changes in the country context and situation of children that might indicate the need to continue.
For example, nutrition is one area that requires more attention and is an area of work that could be
scaled up, focusing on one or two high impact interventions.
The review process should start as soon as possible and should involve government partners and
civil society implementing partners. In this way, the Country Office is better placed to manage
expectations and also identify options or action plans for the sustainability of these interventions.
The NISSA is an important system for the Government, and has enormous potential for an integrated,
comprehensive approach to social protection in Lesotho. On completing the piloting of the update of
the NISSA, UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Development should agree on the most efficient
methodology for updating the NISSA and ensuring that the data remain relevant. UNICEF should
engage the NISSA staff to better understand the technical difficulties with updating the database,
including the issue of updating the urban household data.
It is understood that the EMIS is in a transition phase. However, progress has been very slow and
there is a risk that the Ministry of Education and Training loses confidence in the new EMIS. It is
essential that UNICEF engage the Ministry to understand the root causes of the problem and assist
the Ministry to put workable solutions in place, which may include supporting the Ministry in advocacy
for sustainable financing for EMIS from the Ministry of Finance.
Results for children are dependent on the quality and volume of public finance allocated for the
health, education, and protection of children. In the current economic climate in Lesotho, public
finance resources are severely constrained. UNICEF should step up its advocacy on public finance
for children. It should seek to influence decisions on where the Government can make the most
impactful investment for children, within its constrained resources envelope. This may require more
detailed analytical work beyond the budget briefs, as well as specialist expertise that may not be
available currently in the Country Office.
70
Recommendation 6: UNICEF should develop strategies for enabling and enhancing
programme effectiveness. This includes developing a Country Programme monitoring
framework, finalizing the partnership strategy, developing a resource mobilization strategy
and ensuring that SBCC strategies are embedded in programmes. (Priority: high; time-frame:
medium term)
Partnerships, SBCC and resource mobilization have been important enablers of results for the
Country Programme. UNICEF’s approach, however, has been opportunistic rather than the result of
strategy.
The Country Office is embarking on the development of a partnership strategy to enhance the
effectiveness of its partnerships and to increase the diversity of its partners. The strategy should be
completed in this current programme cycle and updated for the next Country Programme, if required.
In developing the partnership strategy, UNICEF should consider the following:
(a) Reviewing its portfolio of existing partners and partnerships to identify the value that each brings
to achieving results for children, identifying which partnerships can benefit from additional
investment and identifying new partnerships, for example, in the private sector.
(b) Considering the capacities and available resources of partners to contribute to the partnership.
(c) Ensuring the objectives and outputs of the partnerships are mutually agreed, with a clear division
of labour and indicators to assess the partnership. Joint investment (monetary and in-kind) should
be documented, as should decision-making processes and conflict or dispute resolution
processes.
The Country Office has already flagged the necessity for better integration of SBCC in its
interventions, including ensuring that all programmes make budgetary provision for SBCC. The
Country Office should prioritize which programme and interventions require SBCC, and ensure that
social and behaviour change interventions are evaluated to assess their effectiveness.
The Country Office should develop a strategy and action plan to guide its resource mobilization. In
doing so, it should consider the following:
(a) The strategy should clarify the roles and responsibilities of Country Office staff in resource
mobilization. Staff should be trained to identify and use opportunities to engage existing and
potential resource partners.
(b) It may be useful to establish a small resource mobilization task force to drive the development of
the strategy and monitor its implementation.
(c) Communication for the purposes of resource mobilization should be tailored for different
audiences and adopt a multi-media approach.
(d) Joint resource mobilization within the Country Office should be pursued where there are clear
advantages in doing so. The strategy should also make provision for guidance on joint resource
mobilization with other UN agencies.
Recommendation 7: UNICEF should conduct an internal review of all outcome and output
indicators to ensure that they are consistent with the CPD, the AWPs and the RAM report.
(Priority: medium; time-frame: medium-term)
The evaluation found inconsistencies between the indicators stated in the CPD and the indicators
reported in the RAM report and AWPs. There were also proposals to change targets. The Country
Office should check all indicators and targets in its planning and reporting documents and ensure that
71
they are consistent. Where changes to targets and indicators have been agreed, the Country Office
should ensure that the changes are captured as soon as systems permit.
While this recommendation addresses the current Country Programme, a review of indicators should
serve as input to the selection of indicators for the next Country Programme. Consideration should be
given to the appropriateness of the indicators and the availability of reliable, quality national data to
monitor progress and evaluate results.

Introduction
As per UNICEF's Evaluation Policy 2018, every UNICEF Country Programme must be evaluated at
least once every two country programme cycles. Such Country Programme Evaluations (CPEs) are
conducted by the Evaluation Section of the respective UNICEF Regional Office.
CPEs intend to capture and demonstrate evaluative evidence of UNICEF's contributions to
development results at the country level and the effectiveness of UNICEF's strategy in facilitating and
leveraging national efforts for achieving development results. Their purpose is to:
Identify best practices, results and key lessons from the ongoing Country Programme to inform the
development of the next UNICEF CPD
Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to national and international stakeholders
Strengthen accountability of UNICEF to the Executive Board
The CPE will be managed by the Evaluation Section of UNICEF's East and Southern Africa Regional
Office, under the overall oversight of the ESARO Regional Director, and in close collaboration with the
UNICEF LCO, the Government of Lesotho and development partners. Quality assurance will be
provided by UNICEF's Evaluation Office, which reports directly to UNICEF's Executive Director, and is
functionally independent within the organization. The CPE will be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of UNICEF's 2018 Evaluation Policy and the norms and standards of UNEG.
The terms of reference outline a brief description of the Country Programme; the evaluation's scope,
objectives and key questions; evaluation methodology; stakeholder involvement; roles and
responsibilities; evaluation process; deliverables; and evaluators' qualifications.
National Context
Lesotho is a high-altitude and landlocked country of 2.1 million people, encircled by South Africa. With
a gross national income per capita of US$1,390, Lesotho has been classified as a lower middle-
income country by the World Bank. However, poverty remains higher than neighbouring countries and
Lesotho faces frequent shocks, which include severe droughts, widespread HIV/AIDS and most
recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. While the country has been making consistent, though slow,
progress in reducing poverty and child mortality, and improving access to social services, the COVID-
19 pandemic and strict lockdowns had a serious impact on households and the well-being of children.
The prolonged global economic slowdown will adversely impact the implementation of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, directly affecting children and adolescents who make up 38 per
cent of the population.101
101 Lesotho Census, 2016.
74
Economic growth was expected to contract by 4.8 per cent in 2020102 due to the national lockdown
which resulted in restricted movement, closed borders and closure of businesses. COVID-19 is
expected to increase the poverty rate by 1.2 to 1.9 per cent by the end of 2020. Mitigating the impact
will require a massive increase in spending, including for social protection and humanitarian
assistance. Overall, 28 per cent of the population of Lesotho live on less than US$1.90 a day, while
50 per cent of the population live below the national poverty line.103 People living in rural areas,
women and children are disproportionately poor. Despite numerous child-focused poverty reduction
programmes, children remain the hardest hit by poverty in Lesotho: 65 per cent of all children in
Lesotho are simultaneously deprived of at least three basic social services.
COVID-19, prolonged strikes and ad hoc “go slow” movements in the health sector, coupled with
lockdown restrictions, had a serious negative impact on Lesotho’s already weak health system.
Lesotho has the second highest HIV prevalence in the world and the impact of HIV on women and
children continues to be significant. Young women (10–24 years) and adolescent girls (10–19 years)
in particular account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. In 2019, HIV incidence in
young women stood at 1.5 per cent, nearly three times that of young men (0.6 per cent), while over
12,000 children in Lesotho are estimated to be living with HIV and 1,000 children were newly infected
with HIV.104 Lesotho has made significant progress in the HIV response, however, children fair more
poorly than adults in terms of access to treatment and viral suppression.
There are high national levels of antenatal care (95 per cent for the first visit) and delivery in a health
facility (77 per cent).105 However, under-five mortality remains a challenge, especially for boys (102
per 1,000 live births). Common causes of death amongst children include prematurity, birth asphyxia,
pneumonia and malnutrition.106 Maternal mortality is also extremely high, at 1,024 deaths per 100,000
live births,107 and skilled birth attendance displays wide disparities between urban and rural areas (90
per cent vs. 73 per cent) and wealth quintiles (richest, 94 per cent; poorest, 60 per cent).108
In 2020, COVID-19 further exacerbated serious food insecurity, which had a direct impact on the
nutritional well-being of children. One third of children in Lesotho are stunted (92,000 children under
the age of 5), a number that has increased in recent years from 33 per cent in 2014 (DHS) to 35 per
cent in 2018 (MICS). The persistent nutritional deprivation that causes stunting also causes long-term
irreversible physical and cognitive damage. Micronutrient deficiencies amongst children aged 6 to 59
months stands at 51 per cent; iron deficiency anemia is the most common deficiency.
Primary education is free and compulsory, and before COVID-19, Lesotho was close to achieving
universal primary education with a primary net enrolment at 85 per cent and a good retention until
completion of primary school.109 For Basotho learners, 2018 and 2020 can be characterized as two

years of education loss. School disruptions due to teachers on strike then school closures due to
COVID-19 have affected over 500,000 learners.110 This will have short- and long-term consequences
for children and the country, as educational outcomes were already low in Lesotho: only 45 per cent
of children aged 7–14 demonstrate foundational reading skills in English or Sesotho and only 15 per
cent demonstrate foundational numeracy skills.111
In terms of child protection, Lesotho launched the Violence Against Children Survey in 2020. The
survey showed that girls and boys experience unacceptably high rates of sexual and physical
violence, with more than half of boys and almost one in three girls experiencing physical violence.112
On birth registration, fewer than half of children under 5 are registered (45 per cent of boys and 43 per
cent of girls were registered). This varies widely across districts and increases with household wealth
quintile (poorest, 34 per cent; richest, 63 per cent).
As households struggle to make ends meet, as caregivers’ capacity to care for children in a nurturing
environment is diminished due to illness and stress, there are early indications of an increase in
negative coping mechanisms, including early marriage and child labour. The impact of COVID-19 on
health, livelihoods, food security, learning and well-being is profound. As part of delivering as One
UN, UNICEF Lesotho continues to highlight issues affecting children in joint advocacy and resource
mobilization efforts.
The Government of Lesotho is highly committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and recognizes the transformative goal of the agenda. Lesotho has
mainstreamed regional and international commitments, including the SDGs, into national priorities,
defined through the NSDP II 2018/19–2022/23. The UNICEF Lesotho Country Programme 2019–
2023 is aligned with the NSDP II, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities, the SDGs and the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018–2021. Recently, contributing to the
COVID-19 response and recovery has become our priority, with specific emphasis on saving lives,
enhancing household coping capacities and improving community resilience.
UNICEF Programme in Lesotho
The vision of the Country Programme, 2019–2023, is to reach every child, everywhere, every time,
with opportunities to survive, develop and reach her or his full potential. The UNICEF Country
Programme 2019–2023 was developed in alignment with the Lesotho NSDP II, 2019–2023, the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the SDGs
and the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018–2021. It also contributes to the governance, human capital
development and economic growth pillars of the Lesotho UNDAF. Since early 2020, contributing to
the COVID-19 response and recovery has become a priority, with specific emphasis on saving lives,
enhancing household coping capacities and improving community resilience.
UNICEF’s work in Lesotho is anchored in an integrated approach around the first and second
decades of a child’s life. To do so, our Country Programmes are implemented through three
programme components:
110 Based on EMIS enrolment data from 2019 as 2020 data is not yet available.
111 2018 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey.
112 Lesotho Violence Against Children and Youth Survey, 2018.
76
1. Young children survive, thrive and attain learning outcomes
2. Children and adolescents are protected from violence and HIV and have improved learning
outcomes
3. Reducing child poverty and enhancing equity and social protection
This first component envisions that by 2023 young children, particularly the most vulnerable, benefit
from gender-responsive equitable social programmes. The component supports multiple SDGs,
particularly Goals 1 (End poverty in all its forms, everywhere) to 6 (Ensure access to water and
sanitation for all) and underpins national efforts to reduce maternal and under-five mortality and
improve learning outcomes.
This second component focuses on: (a) ensuring the right of adolescents and children to protection
from violence and exploitation; (b) reducing new HIV infections among adolescents, with a focus on
girls; and (c) helping children to achieve optimal learning outcomes through access to quality
education options, including alternative pathways that enable transfer between formal and non-formal
education. It aligns closely with SDG 4 (Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote
lifelong learning); 6 (Ensure access to water and sanitation for all); and 8 (Promote sustained,
inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all).
The third component works towards the realization of nearly all the SDGs, particularly Goals 1 to 5,
10, 16 and 17. To realize the Country Programme vision, UNICEF works to strengthen strategic
partnerships to leverage resources and influence policy implementation. The specific priorities of this
programme component include: (a) strengthening public finance for children to ensure that all
children, including the most vulnerable, benefit optimally from government budgets at the central and
decentralized levels; (b) supporting the establishment of an integrated child-sensitive and gender- and
shock-responsive social protection system; and (c) supporting robust evidence generation to inform
social and economic policies and programmes for children.
Additionally, the focus of the country programme is to meet quality standards in achieving impactful
results for children under the programmatic components above. This is achieved through several
strategic areas that include programme performance monitoring and management, following UNICEF
policies and procedures. UNICEF applies results-based management to ensure rigour in planning and
monitoring, with regular annual and mid-year reviews, which provide opportunities to adjust for
acceleration and scaling up. Evidence-based advocacy and partnerships strengthen child-sensitive
policies, strategies, plans and programmes. UNICEF also uses communication for development to
create and sustain demand for basic social services and to overcome harmful traditional norms and
cultural practices, particularly child marriage and violence against children. UNICEF enhances cross-
sectoral and multisectoral programming to achieve more impactful results.
All the above components collectively aim to secure the well-being and future potential of children in
Lesotho.
Evaluation Objectives
The overall objectives of the CPE are:
1. To assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and sustainability of the
Lesotho Country Programme from its inception to the present, with particular focus on equity,
gender equality, convergence of programme components and achieving results at scale, as
well as UNICEF's strategic positioning in relation to its child rights mandate.
77
2. To identify and document key lessons learned, good practices and innovations in
implementing the current (2019–2023) Country Programme that can inform and support
advocacy efforts for scale-up and replication.
3. To provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen
programmatic strategies in the design of the next Lesotho Country Programme, taking into
consideration national development priorities and plans and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development in the country.
Scope of the Evaluation
The proposed CPE will cover the Lesotho Country Programme (LCP) from 2019–2023, capturing and
demonstrating evaluative evidence of the effectiveness of UNICEF in both the leveraging of national
efforts and the organization's direct contributions in achieving development results for children at the
country level. It is anticipated to begin in January 2021, with the inception phase, and take 60 days
over a span of five months to complete. As a country-level evaluation of UNICEF, the CPE will focus
on the formal UNICEF CPD approved by the Executive Board but also consider any
changes/revisions from the initial CPD during the period under review. Subject to specific areas of
focus identified below, the scope of the CPE includes the entirety of UNICEF's engagement in the
country, and therefore covers interventions funded by all sources. The CPE will also cover any
humanitarian or emergency response supported by UNICEF Lesotho during the period under
evaluation.
The CPE should have a particular focus on UNICEF's positioning within the development community
and its national partners in relation to its child rights mandate. The CPE will also examine the
following areas of concern:
• Equity;
• Gender Equality;
• Convergence of programme components.
While the unit of analysis will be the LCP as a whole, each of the components making up UNICEF's
programme will be assessed with a focus on how equity, gender and programme convergence have
been approached. The CPE will also have a strong focus on gender as a cross-cutting theme across
evaluation criteria and evaluation questions. It will also specifically examine the coherence of the LCP
with the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and the GAPs (2014–2017 and
2018–2021).
The LCP is entering year four of a five-year cycle. It is not expected that programmatic results will
manifest sufficiently to draw conclusions about the impact of the present LCP. The CPE aims to foster
learning of what has worked, what has not and why, in the current LCP with a view to designing the
next LCP.
Evaluation Criteria and Preliminary Evaluation Questions
The CPE will be guided by key evaluation criteria and aim to answer the following evaluation
questions:
Relevance: The CPE will seek to assess the extent to which the objectives of the Country
Programme and its design were and remain appropriate within the country context, as well as whether
UNICEF's approach towards addressing them was the most suitable considering its mandate,
resource base, comparative advantages, and operational structures. It will assess both whether
UNICEF has identified the most relevant goals or strategies to solve the programme challenges
posed and whether these are equity focused and gender responsive.
78
1. To what extent is the Country Programme guided by national priorities, clear programme
theories and relevant programme strategies appropriate to the changing context and
emerging issues, and does it have the capacity to respond and adjust as necessary?
2. To what extent has UNICEF been able to position itself as a strategic partner in the country
context? What are UNICEF's comparative strengths in the country – particularly in
comparison to other UN agencies and development partners – and how were these
harnessed to help achieve the results?
Coherence: The CPE will assess policy consistency with key UNICEF strategies and international
commitments including gender equality and women's empowerment, equity for children and the
human rights-based approach; as well as UNICEF's coordination and convening role, within the UN,
and with government sectors and donors in Lesotho.
3. To what extent have LCP strategies to address gender equality and equity, particularly the
alignment of the LCP with the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action and
UNICEF's GAPs (2014–2017 and 2018–2021), been consistently integrated in all aspects of
programming and implementation, including policy and advocacy? Did the Country Office's
strategic approach to addressing the challenges of equity and gender equality play a
complementary role to that of government and other development actors?
4. To what extent is the Country Programme linked to and achieving synergies and coordination
with other UN agencies, particularly in response to emergencies, such as COVID-19?
Effectiveness: The CPE will assess the extent to which the Country Programme results were
achieved and whether the adopted strategies by UNICEF, particularly the convergence of programme
components, were gender responsive/transformative and demonstrated a reasonable contribution at
the outcome level, including any differential results across groups.
5. To what extent has the Country Programme achieved its outcomes, or is likely to achieve
them, including any differential results across gender, income, ethnicities, etc.? What results
have been achieved through convergence, and what are the other major factors influencing
the achievement (or not) of Country Programme outcomes?
6. Did the Country Programme contribute to the reduction of inequities and exclusion and
progress towards the achievement of greater gender equality? To what extent are
programmes, communications and advocacy efforts gender responsive/transformative, and,
relatedly, are UNICEF LCO staff capacitated to integrate and implement gender
responsive/transformative programmes?
Efficiency: The CPE will measure how resources/inputs (funds, expertise, time, etc.) were converted
into and affected results. It is also understood as the way in which UNICEF manages its partnerships,
to operationalize its strategies, implement activities and deliver outputs.
7. Were resources (funds, human resources, time, expertise, etc.) allocated and utilized
strategically to track and achieve results, including equity and gender-related objectives?
8. To what extent have the convergence strategy, the programme structure and the office
structure supported the delivery of the Country Programme? Were the chosen strategies and
approaches the most cost effective and efficient? Were there alternatives that would have
worked better and what are those?
Sustainability: The CPE will assess the extent to which continuation of benefits from Country
Programme interventions was ensured, including the likelihood of and risks to continued long-term
benefits, and the potential for scale-up and/or replication.
79
9. To what extent are the positive changes and effects of the Country Programme sustainable at
the relevant levels (e.g., community, provincial/state, national)? To what extent have the
programme strategies adopted by UNICEF contributed to, or been designed in a way that
they will contribute to, sustainability of results, especially equity and gender-related results?
10. To what extent have the programme strategies, plans and tools, particularly those with an
equity and gender focus, been institutionalized in systems, policies, mechanisms and
strategies among government, NGO/civil society and other partners and stakeholders? Will
the strategies/plans/tools be more widely replicated or adapted? What’s the scalability of
models introduced by UNICEF?
To answer these overarching questions, the evaluator will be expected to develop sub questions as
part of the evaluation matrix to further focus the evaluation, not expand the scope, during the
inception phase, which will be reviewed with all stakeholders during the inception period.
Evaluation Approach and Methods
The evaluation methodology will adhere to the UNEG Norms & Standards.113 The detailed evaluation
design will be developed by the external evaluators or evaluation consultancy firm to be contracted to
conduct the evaluation during the inception phase, in close consultation with the ESARO Evaluation
Section managing the evaluation and key evaluation stakeholders. The design should specify how
data collection and analysis methods integrate gender considerations throughout the evaluation
process, including to the extent possible, inclusion of girls and boys and women and men, as well as
a range of Country Programme stakeholders.
The CPE will be conducted at the outcome level. A theory of change approach (including
reconstructing a theory of change for the entire Country Programme) will be used in consultation with
stakeholders, as appropriate, to better understand how and under what conditions UNICEF's
interventions are expected to lead to improved well-being of children in Lesotho. Discussions of the
theory of change will focus on mapping the assumptions behind the programme's desired change(s)
and the causal linkages between the intervention(s) and the intended Country Programme outcomes.
As part of this analysis, the implementation of the Country Programme over the evaluation period will
also be examined, covering UNICEF's capacity to adapt to the changing context in Lesotho; its
responsiveness to changing needs and priorities will also be looked at. Where possible and
appropriate, the evaluation should seek to obtain evidence as to what may or may not have occurred
in the absence of UNICEF's programme.
The effectiveness of UNICEF's Country Programme will be analysed to understand the extent to
which the Country Programme achieved (or is likely to achieve) its intended objectives. This will
include an assessment of the achieved results and the extent to which these results have contributed
to the intended CPD objectives. In this process, positive and negative, direct and indirect, and
unintended results will be identified, as well as the contribution of programme strategies to the
development of these results.
To better understand UNICEF's performance, the specific factors that influenced performance –
positively or negatively – and the sustainability of results in Lesotho will be examined. In addition to
country-specific factors that may explain UNICEF's performance; the utilization of resources to deliver
results (including managerial practices); the extent to which LCO fostered partnerships and synergies
113 United Nations Evaluation Group, ‘Norms and Standards for Evaluation’.

with other actors; and the integration of equity and gender in the design and implementation of the
CPD are some of the aspects that will be assessed.
It is expected that the CPE apply a strong equity and gender focus by: i) including equity and gender
in evaluation criteria and evaluation questions; ii) making evaluation methodology, data collection and
analysis methods equity- and gender-responsive; and iii) reflecting equity and gender analysis in
evaluation findings, conclusions, concrete recommendations and action points that can be addressed
in the design of the next CPD, both for a better integration of equity and gender in the office and
programming efforts, and for strengthened results for children.
The CPE should rely on a mix of quantitative and qualitative information that will need to be
triangulated. Primary data gathering from implementing partners via key informant interviews and/or
focus group discussions is highly advisable. Participatory methods, especially those involving
adolescents and children, should be considered along with any potential ethical issues and
approaches (see section 10 below).
The stakeholders for this evaluation are relevant government partners, NGO partners implementing
programmes with UNICEF through cooperation agreements and rights holders who are targeted by
UNICEF programmes. A stakeholder analysis that goes beyond government and NGO implementing
partners to ensure the views of all relevant stakeholders are incorporated in the evaluation and the
reconstructed theory of change will be part of the approach and will be undertaken during the
inception phase.
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation approach will have to be adaptive to the evolving
situation.114 For now, it is expected that the inception phase will likely need to be conducted remotely,
and how to proceed with data collection will be assessed during the inception phase.
Assessment of data availability and data constraints
As part of the inception phase, the evaluator will conduct an assessment to ascertain the available
information, identify data constraints, and determine the data collection needs and methods. The
methodology should be aware of and be prepared to take advantage of the accumulated and in-
process evidence generated through research, studies, surveys and evaluations conducted within the
UNICEF Lesotho Country Programme.
With respect to indicators, the CPD results framework is updated annually during the annual reporting
to show progress towards outputs. A Country Office Annual Report (COAR) is produced annually,
covering all the programme components and implementation strategies and their status. Other
relevant programmatic surveys and studies will be availed to the evaluator.
The following secondary data will be reviewed, among others: background documents on the national
context; documents prepared by international partners during the period under review and documents
prepared by UN system agencies; programme plans and frameworks; progress reports; monitoring
self-assessments such as the UNICEF Country Office Annual Reports; national surveys (e.g., MICS);
national reports; and evaluations conducted by the country office and partners. Sex-disaggregated
data will be collected, where available, and assessed against programme outcomes.
114 For UNICEF guidance on undertaking evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic, please see the UNICEF
Technical Note on Evaluation and the COVID-19 response: <www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/2804>.
81
This evaluation will take place during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The evaluator will maintain
continuous consultations with the Country Office and the United Nations Department of Safety and
Security (UNDSS) regarding the preparation of the in-country mission to determine the feasibility of
accessing project sites and carrying out in-person meetings with key stakeholders during the data
collection phase. UNICEF will facilitate, wherever feasible, the contact of the evaluator with staff that
have transferred from the LCO to other duty stations or employers.
Data collection methods
The evaluation will use data from primary and secondary sources, including a desk review of
documentation and information as well as interviews with key informants. A multi-stakeholder
approach will be followed, and interviews will include government representatives, civil society
organizations, private sector representatives, UN agencies, multilateral organizations, bilateral donors
and rights holders under the programme. Focus group discussions may be used to consult different
groups of rights holders and duty bearers as appropriate.
At the time of commissioning, it is uncertain when, or if at all, face-to-face data collection will take
place. Sufficient flexibility has been built into the Terms of Reference to allow for adjustment and
immediate feedback during the course of the evaluation. While face-to-face contact may not be
possible, the evaluation may also rely on remote data collection through remote meetings and remote
interviews (phone calls and online conferencing calls). This may be supplemented by online/email
questionnaires and surveys or computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) according to the
necessity.
It is expected that programme sites in two to three select districts where UNICEF has a concentration
of initiatives (in several programme areas), as well as those where critical projects are being
implemented, will be considered for field visits, if allowed. Coverage should include a sample, as
relevant, of both successful initiatives and those reporting difficulties where lessons can be learned,
both larger and smaller initiatives, as well as both completed and ongoing initiatives. The evaluator
should propose alternative working modalities should international travel and/or domestic travel not be
permitted.
Validation. The evaluation will use triangulation of information collected from different sources and/or
by different methods to ensure that the data is valid.
Stakeholder Involvement. A participatory and transparent process will be followed to engage with
multiple stakeholders at all stages of the evaluation process. During the inception phase a
stakeholder analysis will be conducted to identify all relevant UNICEF partners, including those that
may have not worked with UNICEF but play a key role in the outcomes to which UNICEF contributes.
This stakeholder analysis will play a key part in informing the reconstructed theory of change, serving
to identify key informants for interviews during the main data collection phase of the evaluation, and
will examine any potential partnerships that could further improve UNICEF's contribution to the
country.

Data archive: Data gathered in the exercise is transferred in an organized archive that will permit
follow-on users to replicate or extend the analysis. Suitable care to be taken in assuring the
anonymity of respondents and documentation in inception and final reports.
Monitoring work progress on deliverables which are not listed in the Terms of Reference will be
periodically required.
The format of and page limits for the final deliverables will be decided in the inception period. A high
value will be placed on products that are concise and communicate well with different audiences.
Thus, the final products should be edited and produced to include infographics and print layout in an
easy to read format.
Management Arrangements and Quality Assurance
The evaluator will be recruited by and report to the ESARO Evaluation Section under the overall
oversight of the ESARO Regional Director. For the day-to-day management of the CPE, the
Evaluation Section will appoint an Evaluation Manager who will be accountable to the Regional
Evaluation Adviser. Quality assurance will be provided by UNICEF's Evaluation Office.
LCO will appoint an Evaluation Focal Point who will act as the primary liaison with the Evaluation
Manager and will facilitate the data collection and evaluation process at the country level.
The Evaluation Manager will work with LCO to constitute an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG),
comprising key stakeholders of the CPE, including government counterparts; several senior LCO and
ESARO staff members; select development, civil society and private sector partners; and, if possible,
adolescents. The ERG's responsibilities are described in the ERG terms of reference. The ERG has
an advisory capacity whose primary role is to review evaluation milestones (terms of reference,
inception report, draft evaluation report) and to provide comments. The ERG Secretariat will maintain
a written record, as part of an audit trail, of all ERG comments, which the evaluator is expected to
respond to in writing (agree – actions taken; disagree – justification).
The ERG will, by default, be chaired by the Evaluation Manager. Upon the request of the LCO
Representative, the ERG may be chaired by the Regional Evaluation Adviser or the Regional
Director.
Reports are also required at each payment schedule. Inception report and draft final report will be
subject to a satisfactory rating by an external quality assurance facility, using quality assurance
checklists provided in Annexes 3 and 4, before payment can be made.
Ethical Considerations
The evaluator should adhere to the following UN and UNICEF norms and standards and is expected
to clearly identify any potential ethical issues and approaches, as well as the processes for ethical
review and oversight of the evaluation process in their proposal, owing to the envisaged participation
of human subjects in the evaluation. Copies of all these documents will be provided upon request:
UNEG Standards for Evaluation in the UN System
UNEG Norms for Evaluation in the UN System, including impartiality, independence, quality,
transparency, consultative process
Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations and the UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in research,
evaluation, data collection and analysis will guide the overall process
UNICEF adapted evaluation report standards and GEROS
85
The evaluation should incorporate the human rights-based and gender perspective and be based on
results-based management principles and logical framework analysis.
Expected Background and Experience of the Evaluator
It is envisioned that the CPE can be completed by one experienced individual. However, if the
consultant proposes a team, the number of team members shall be determined by the consultant, as
considered to be most suitable for the successful completion of the assignment, and the level of
involvement of each team member must be specified in the proposal. However, UNICEF will not be
involved in the contractual and financial agreement between the team leader and team members.
The consultant shall minimally meet the following requirements:
• Advanced university degree in one or more of the disciplines relevant to evaluation (social
policy, economics, demography, anthropology, public health).
• Minimum of ten years of experience in conducting similar or related strategic programme
evaluations or evaluative reviews, including proven track record of evaluation or evaluative
review of similar large multisectoral and multi-stakeholder Country Programmes supported by
United Nations or UNICEF.
• Demonstrated expertise in evaluating institutional support systems including operations and
the human resource function.
• Knowledge of programming theories and strategies employed in each of the programme
outcome components.
• A work record in a Middle Income Country in Africa.
• Excellent command of English, with a proven ability to prepare high-quality reports.
• Strong quantitative and qualitative analytical skills.
• Demonstration of capacity to carry out the CPE and complete deliverables.
• The evaluator must submit samples (at least two) of similar work they have conducted.
• Significant advantages:
• Proven ability to develop attractive evidence products that present complex information via
infographics and other communication means.
• Knowledge of the social, economic, and political context of Lesotho.
• Record of top ranked evaluation reports by GEROS.
Administrative issues
This consultancy will be carried in 60 working days. The individual consultant is expected to provide
their own space and equipment to carry out the work.
As per UNICEF Division of Financial and Administrative Management (DFAM) policy, payment is
made against approved deliverables. No advance payment is allowed unless in exceptional
circumstances against bank guarantee, subject to a maximum of 30 per cent of the total contract
value in cases where advance purchases, for example for supplies or travel, may be necessary.
The candidate selected will be governed by and subject to UNICEF’s General Terms and Conditions
for individual contracts.
