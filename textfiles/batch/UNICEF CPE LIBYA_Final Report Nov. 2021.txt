Executive summary
The UNICEF Libya Country Programme (2019-2020) evaluation (CPE) follows the UNICEF 2018 evaluation
policy and uses the evaluation criteria of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It addresses the criteria of relevance, efficiency,
effectiveness for developmental activities and connectedness from the humanitarian area. An additional
criterion, comparative advantage and strategic positioning, has been added. The CPE focuses on the key
Country Programme outcomes and outputs, and progress is measured at the highest possible level of the
results chain. The evaluation was conducted in a participatory manner, ensuring the involvement of a wide
sample of key stakeholders, during all phases of the evaluation. The evaluation was human rights-based,
gender sensitive and equity focused.
The evaluation used a mixed methods approach. As a result of travel restrictions linked to COVID-19, the
collection of data by the evaluators was desk-based. These restrictions also affected the evaluation design
and rationale. The evaluation questions were addressed through evidence collected by the desk review of
key internal and external documents. The evaluation team collected primary qualitative data from
stakeholders using key informant interviews and an online survey. The data collected were, to the extent
possible, triangulated and validated – three or more sources of information were typically used to
substantiate a finding.
Limitations that affected the implementation of the evaluation include the following: i) travel restrictions due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevented the team from visiting Tunis, ii) the security and conflict
situation in Libya which precluded the use of third-party data collectors and limited access to stakeholders;
iii) non-availability of data and key indicators; iv) internal and external developments affecting the timeframe
of the evaluation and delaying finalization of the report.
Main Findings of the Evaluation
Relevance: The 2019-2020 Country Programme is grounded on assessments and analyses that remain
pertinent. It was built on a strong cross-sectoral strategy, combining service delivery and emergency
assistance with system support and environment building. The Country Programme has provided a
consistent framework for integrating the UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) objectives and
results. It is strongly aligned with the United Nations Strategic Framework (UNSF) 2019-2020, the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the humanitarian, development and peace nexus. The
sectoral strategies are aligned to those of the Libyan government. Humanitarian assistance is delivered in
partnership with line ministries, municipalities, and non-governmental organisations.
Although the already-challenging Libyan context became even more complex because of the COVID-19
pandemic, the programme adapted well to changing circumstances and capitalized on available
opportunities. A timely response to increasing risks of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) demonstrated the
ability to respond to challenges that were not initially a part of the Country Programme. There were also
missed opportunities, however. Programming for adolescents and youth is seen by the evaluation as an
area of weakness. The evaluation found no evidence of gender analysis underpinning the Country
Programme. Indicators were disaggregated by gender, and boys and girls took part equally in activities, but
it is not clear how gender considerations were incorporated in the programming.
Efficiency: A key strategy to achieve integrated results was to establish and operate community centres
(Bayti centres) that provide multi-sectoral services, with a focus on the most vulnerable children. In practice,
however, the potential for the Bayti approach was not fully used. Bayti centres have almost exclusively
hosted child protection and non-formal education activities and more could be done to fully integrate other
sectors into the model, through strengthening referrals to existing structures providing, for example, health
and nutrition services or hosting ad-hoc health and nutrition initiatives, e.g., screening, vaccination.
viii
Communications were used to strengthen the UNICEF brand and to build alliances and partnerships for
change through public engagement. This was done by positioning UNICEF social media accounts as a
credible and reliable source and partnering with the private sector and local implementing partners on
communication campaigns to promote behaviour changes as, for example, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.
Advocacy efforts by UNICEF work through many channels including the United Nations Country Team, the
sectoral and working groups and global and regional advocacy initiatives. However, no consistent child
protection advocacy plan or joint child protection advocacy strategy was developed with United Nations
sister agencies or the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT). In addition, advocacy strategy was not
coordinated with international NGOs or within the Child Protection Working Group and Protection Sector.
There are, however, many examples of successful coordination of advocacy efforts, including the work of
UNICEF with the Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Network: advocacy that led to the
creation of a staffed nutrition unit in the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to monitor and address
issues of malnutrition; joint advocacy with WHO and IOM, among others, with government and
municipalities for strengthening the extended immunization programme and the Public Health Centre (PHC)
system; and Child Protection advocacy to end violence against children, develop alternatives to detention
for children in contact with the law, establish transitional centres for detained migrant children, activate a
formal monitoring and reporting mechanism, and release and reintegrate children associated with armed
forces and armed groups.
There is an apparent disconnect between the approach to NGO partners in the emergency response and
in the development component of the UNICEF programme. Communication flows with partners and donors
have been challenging, mainly due to staff turnover and heavy administrative procedures. In the emergency
response, partnerships focus on service delivery. UNICEF provided technical training either directly carried
out by UNICEF or through international NGOs. National partners, however, expressed the need of a
structured approach to their capacity development that also includes building their capacities on strategic
planning, management and fundraising.
The 2018 budget and human resource structure was expanded considerably due to the deepening
humanitarian crisis in Libya and the need to address capacity gaps of the Country Office. The initial focus
of this programme was on bringing in international staff. However, due to funding shortfalls and challenges
in hiring, about a third of the positions were still vacant at the end of 2020. This created significant
challenges since national staff may not have sufficient international and UNICEF institutional experience.
Nonetheless, the national staff is expected to provide continuity until international staffing is completed.
While this poses an opportunity for capacity building, several circumstances have limited effective
dissemination of face-to-face support and experience from the more experienced international professional
staff to the younger staff.
Bureaucratic processes and granting procedures created delays throughout 2019, with limited
improvements in 2020. Contracting processes with partners took over six months from negotiation to the
signature of Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCAs), which posed a challenge for the emergency
response. Delays in releasing the funds constrained the implementation capacity of national NGOs that rely
on UNICEF funding. Multiple office locations, costly staff accommodation arrangements and constant staff
movement back and forth between Tunisia and Libya resulted in operating costs that were much higher
than planned. Heightened conflict and insecurity in Libya have long impeded UNICEF staff from undertaking
regular field monitoring visits to programmes implemented by the partners. Consequently, the Libya Country
Office has, since 2016, engaged the services of third-party monitoring organizations.
Effectiveness: UNICEF provided humanitarian assistance during the period evaluated as well as more
limited development assistance. Overall, the sectoral targets of the humanitarian assistance were broadly
achieved. UNICEF support for sector coordination and working groups helped to deliver better results for
children, while partnering with local authorities in municipalities helped to deliver services at local level.
ix
However, efforts fell significantly short of the overall needs identified and evidence generation was
challenging. The main sectoral results include the following:
• UNICEF strengthened national WASH systems and provided humanitarian support in response to
needs, contributing to the realization of SDG 6 and the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019.
Targets were surpassed largely as a result of the humanitarian response to displaced and conflict-
affected populations. UNICEF also contributed to an enabling environment for WASH through
support for the first National Assessment of Water Systems in Libya. This will serve as an important
knowledge base for the government and partners’ investment in the development of water
infrastructure.
• As a result of the emerging humanitarian situation, UNICEF scaled up to provide lifesaving
assistance to the most vulnerable. UNICEF coordinated with WHO to strengthen the capacity of
immunization centres, although additional capacity-building is needed to improve monitoring at the
municipal level. Effectiveness of the training model relies on post-training mentoring for the
trainees, as well as access to health facilities which in some areas is challenging.
• Relatively few children have received basic or emergency nutrition services compared to needs.
The key challenge remains the lack of reliable data on the nutritional status of children and women.
A Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) Nutrition Survey
was planned in Q1 2020 to bridge the data gaps. While SMART surveys are usually undertaken
in fragile and conflict countries, it was assessed that security risks were too high and a
postponement was foreseen.
• UNICEF worked closely with the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its partners to ensure minimum
disruption to education. A key success of the education programme was the timely response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Progress toward the Country Programme outcomes was on track
through the end of 2020. Some key 2019 targets were exceeded. In particular, the number of
teachers trained was significantly higher than planned, creating the potential to provide services
to more children than originally planned.
• UNICEF made substantial progress in ensuring that girls and boys in Libya were better protected
from violence, abuse and exploitation. The progress of child protection programme toward the
Country Programme outcomes is on track. As of June 2020, the Country Programme output
indicators were largely or fully achieved. The system support component of the child protection
programme – although substantially on track – has suffered from the escalating conflict. However,
UNICEF has made progress in strengthening national systems for monitoring, reporting and
responding to violations of children's rights.
Gender has not been fully mainstreamed in the delivery of the Country Programme and there is limited
evidence that interventions were designed considering the different needs of boys and girls. The office did
generate some gender disaggregated indicators but not in a consistent manner across sectors, although
there are positive examples in the implementation of the programme. Insufficient disaggregation of
vulnerable groups in programme reporting makes it difficult to analyse how different groups have benefitted.
The main challenges to the effectiveness of the Country Programme include the following: i) COVID-19 has
limited access to beneficiaries and support systems; ii) during 2019, the five national information systems
roll outs were delayed, as challenges proved greater than anticipated; iii) insufficient coordination and
limited internal technical capacity constrained the leadership provided by UNICEF for child protection.
Connectedness: To address disconnects between the humanitarian and the developmental programmes,
the United Nations Programme Management Team led the process to agree on a strategic nexus approach
for Sabha and to identify collective outcomes to be achieved by 2023. Recent political developments in the
country offer the opportunity for the United Nations Country Team and UNICEF to reconsider
connectedness between humanitarian and development priorities and develop appropriate strategies.
However, the UNICEF Libya Country Programme Document 2019-2020 provides only scant reference to
the nexus framework and the UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children 2019 does not mention it at all.
x
The 2020 appeal notes the importance of reinforcing the linkages between humanitarian and development
programming through giving priority to coordination and capacity building for partners, including local
authorities. The most relevant contribution to connectedness is through the “Stabilization” programme with
a focus on working directly with local authorities while still involving central authorities. The newly developed
arrangement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for a two-year (2020-
2021) global blueprint for joint action, titled “A Fair Deal for Refugee Children”, also focuses on improving
the response in the priority areas of education, WASH and child protection, and represents a contribution
to the SDGs in these areas.
Comparative advantage and strategic positioning: UNICEF Libya worked with many stakeholders at all
levels. With the central government, it has agreed workplans, provided an evidence basis for
implementation, and developed national level strategies. With municipalities, it has implemented practical
programmes across the nexus providing services for host communities and refugees. It has established a
relationship with donors, along with solid partnerships with international and national non-governmental
organisations (NGOs). UNICEF Libya is well embedded in the United Nations country team. However, the
Libya Country Office has moved only recently towards implementing the nexus. The “Stabilization”
programme has created an integrated approach to service delivery that could be expanded to other areas
and to municipal service provision, but the comparative advantage of UNICEF has not been fully used to
build and leverage synergies among stakeholders (ministries and civil society, for example) and with donors
and the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), for example, on Children Associated with
Armed Forces and Armed Groups (CAFAAG) and the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM),
especially on critical child protection issues. The role that UNICEF can play towards strengthening civil
society capacities should also be considered.
Conclusions
Conclusion 01: The Country Programme has been found highly relevant to the priority needs of children
in Libya. The Country Programme has taken available evidence into account, incorporating findings from
assessments, both multi-agency and by UNICEF, of humanitarian and development needs in the five
strategic areas. The reliability of the available evidence is not strong but the Country Programme responds
to this with a strong focus on evidence generation.
Conclusion 02: The Libya Country Office has demonstrated appropriate flexibility and initiative in
responding to changes. Programme priorities, resources and interventions were reviewed when in-country
needs increased, particularly in the humanitarian domain and from the perspective of the nexus logic. New
challenges stemming from shifting conflict lines, the advent of COVID-19 and worsening economic
indicators were addressed to the extent possible, given available resources and access constraints, through
increases in service delivery and humanitarian/risk awareness interventions.
Conclusion 03: Alignment with government priorities, and UNICEF global and regional priorities was
generally strong especially through the agreed work planning process. However, some sectors and
activities were not always able to keep government counterparts informed. Implementing partners were
chosen for their ability to deliver rather than on aligned strategic priorities.
Conclusion 04: Cross-sectoral approaches were planned but not always implemented in practice. Gender
and adolescents and youth programming are areas where improvements are needed.
Conclusion 05: The Libya Country Office is taking steps to improve cost efficiency such as reduction of
multiple office locations and making a greater investment in UNICEF national staff and implementing
partner capacities. The recent developments of the political situation in Libya might allow for relocating at
least part of the operation within Libya, thus contributing to cost efficiency.
xi
Conclusion 06: Operational efficiency was mixed, due to the demanding context of the operations and the
internal administrative requirements of UNICEF. The integrated approach proved to be challenging and
required additional capacities and a redistribution of responsibilities.
Conclusion 07: The Bayti approach was efficient in reaching the most vulnerable children and could be
further expanded to fully realise integrated services, through strengthening referrals to existing structures
providing, for example, health and nutrition services or hosting ad hoc health and nutrition initiatives, e.g.,
screening, vaccination.
Conclusion 08: Programme monitoring remained a challenge despite efforts by UNICEF to address third-
party monitoring issues and to follow up by revising implementation arrangements.
Conclusion 09: Advocacy and external communications were efficient approaches to draw attention to
child protection issues and support health and nutrition services.
Conclusion 10: The Country Programme made progress toward planned outcomes in all strategic areas
and improved the quality and supply of services. Conflict and insecurity were the main factors affecting
delivery of planned outputs were conflict and insecurity. These also affected the capacity of national
systems. UNICEF targeted marginalized groups but experienced challenges in reaching them; those
requiring more attention include children of detained or imprisoned women, children associated with armed
forces and armed groups (CAFAAG), marginalized adolescents and youth, children with disabilities and
preschool children.
Conclusion 11: As WASH is intrinsic to all other basic services, the importance of rehabilitating the
dilapidated system takes high priority; UNICEF should use its convening power and technical capacity to
support a coordination platform with the government and other stakeholders. Health system inputs have
been strong and well-coordinated with partners. The immunization training requires follow up at the
municipal level to ensure compliance.
Conclusion 12: Significant achievements were made in training teachers and other education staff.
However, some planned education results were not fully achieved due to deterioration of the education
system and impeded access in conflict-affected areas. The COVID-19 response related to education was
timely and produced positive impacts for children. The inputs for work with adolescents and youth do not
sufficiently reflect the importance of their role in the development and future of Libyan society and should
be strengthened in order to engage them productively and mitigate risks of the youth being drawn into the
conflict.
Conclusion 13: UNICEF made substantial progress in ensuring that girls and boys in Libya were better
protected from violence, abuse and exploitation through strengthening national systems for response and
including training on explosive ordnance risk, and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. However,
UNICEF globally, regionally and nationally has not exerted sufficient influence to coordinate stakeholders
to urge adequate funding and greater joint advocacy on difficult protection issues.
Conclusion 14: Gender is not well integrated in the programme. Knowledge about potentially marginalized
groups is weak and programming for them is challenging.
Conclusion 15: The development of information management systems (e.g., the DHIS and the EMIS)
experienced significant challenges, in terms of capacity of staff and support systems.
Conclusion 16: While UNICEF at the global level has a strong commitment to connect humanitarian and
developmental actions, at the country level this connection is still in a nascent state, both for the United
Nations team and UNICEF, except for coordinating the “Stabilization” programme interventions with
municipalities and the global blueprint with the UNHCR ‘A fair deal with children’.
xii
Conclusion 17: Recent political developments in the country present an opportunity to strengthen the
nexus approach within the UNICEF programme; for example, the Violence Against Children National Action
Plan (VAC NAP) offers a framework to link emergency child protection response to longer-term objectives.
Conclusion 18: The UNICEF Libya Country Office has collaborated effectively with diverse stakeholders.
The evaluation identified missed opportunities to lead on child rights agendas, with donors and as cluster
lead agency.
Recommendations
Recommendation 01: Strengthen programming to incorporate cross-cutting youth and gender themes
more effectively. Undertake a gender assessment of all strategic areas and develop a cross-sectoral gender
plan with partners; ensure that each sector addresses the situation of adolescents and youth relative to
their developmental needs.
Recommendation 02: Promote greater strategic planning opportunities with implementing partners
(national and international NGOs) to facilitate joint strategy and policy development. Elevate discussions,
collaboration and coordination with implementing partners to a more strategic level, beyond the negotiation
of implementation or the emergency strategies developed within the sector working groups. This will be the
best way to utilize their access to beneficiaries and their experience in addressing technical and cultural
challenges.
Recommendation 03: Assess whether (a) the Bayti approach can be expanded to integrate health and
nutrition services for migrant women, girls and boys; (b) a similar approach could be used to provide
services to children by the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA) and other relevant ministries; and (c) similar
approaches could be taken in building child hubs in schools.
Recommendation 04: Given recent political developments in Libya, reassess the possibility of relocating
components of the operation within the country. This will mean revisiting the staffing structure, the share of
national and international staff, the type of contracting, and the geographic location of the offices / hubs.
Recommendation 05: Keep track of the lessons learned and emerging good practices from the
implementation of the various third-party monitoring arrangements used by UNICEF in humanitarian
contexts, including in the other countries of the MENA region. Tracking successes and bottlenecks and
following good practices developed elsewhere will increase the efficiency of the Libya Country Office.
Recommendation 06: Continue to advocate on critical child protection issues such as activation of the
monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations, alternatives to detention for children in contact
with law (including migrants), alternative care systems for unaccompanied and separated children (UASC),
release and reintegration for CAFAAG, including regional mechanisms for CAFAAG from abroad.
Recommendation 07: Strengthen technical support and advocacy for coordination and investment of the
government’s own funds in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) system rehabilitation.
Recommendation 08: Ensure that reliable data are available for programming in health, education,
nutrition and protection. The challenges experienced to implement studies and to roll out information
systems will need to be analysed to identify and avoid bottlenecks.
Recommendation 09: Clearly identify the gaps in the current immunization programme and develop a plan
to strategically address them in the follow up programme. Aim to expand immunization to migrant
populations.
Recommendation 10: Develop a coherent UNICEF Libya strategy for adolescents and youth and advocate
for a national youth strategy.
xiii
Recommendation 11: UNICEF should use the nexus approach more systematically to ensure that
humanitarian responses build the capacity of partners to deliver services in humanitarian and
developmental contexts. The Country Programme Document (CPD) and the Humanitarian Action for
Children appeal (HAC) should be consistent in approach and mutually re-enforcing.
Recommendation 12: UNICEF Libya should provide leadership on the child rights agenda with Libyan
authorities and with donors and other international stakeholders.
Recommendation 13: UNICEF Libya should have an internal dialogue to determine how best to support
civil society capacity building and child rights.
Lessons learned:
Evidence generation: Evidence generation was a pillar of the Country Programme. The five national
information systems rollouts, including the Education Management Information System (EMIS), the District
Health Information System (DHIS), and the Justice for Children Information Management System (J4CIMS),
were delayed because challenges were greater than anticipated. In the critical effort to generate evidence,
collect data and improve data quality, the following elements need to be ensured to secure the investments
in the systems: (i) the capacity of community facilities to collect, process, and disseminate data, (ii) access
to electricity, data entry equipment and supplies, as well as to the internet, (iii) trained staff and oversight
on data integrity and skill usage by supervisors.
Third-party monitoring: For third-party monitoring to be effective, monitors need to have a solid
understanding of the nature of the UNICEF programming and of humanitarian work and good reporting
capacities. As third-party monitoring (TPM) is increasingly used by UNICEF in humanitarian contexts,
including in the MENA region, it will be important to share what works and what aspects prove difficult in
establishing TPM systems in Libya. This will contribute to distilling good practices within the organisation,
developing guidance and building tools to establish TPM systems in other countries. Sector-specific training
and standard requirements for adhering to humanitarian principles (including PSEA) should be included.
Equity: Cross-sectoral programming is more likely to succeed when staff and partners coordinate
effectively to plan and utilize equity focussed assessments, to secure investment of time and funds, and to
strengthen coordinated support for vulnerable groups, ensuring that key needs are considered across the
sectors. This lesson is particularly relevant for humanitarian action to serve the most vulnerable and where
a large percentage of the population is composed of adolescents and youth.

Introduction
1 Context
1.1 Background: Political, Economic and Conflict Developments
1. The operational environment in Libya is characterized by fragmentation and volatility across the
political, economic and security domains, posing important challenges for United Nations engagement.
The period of the Libya Country Programme Evaluation – from January 2019 to July 20201 – saw a
significant deterioration of the security environment, conflict in the Tripoli area and along the
Mediterranean coast, increasing economic crisis and mounting humanitarian needs. The COVID-19
pandemic added another complexity in early 2020. The combined impact of these crises has made the
operational environment in Libya challenging, though with some improvements over the past year as
outlined in box 1.
2. The economic downturn was exacerbated by the collapse of oil prices and the blockade of Libyan oil
terminals that lasted until late 2020. The Libyan Gross Domestic Product contracted by 31 per cent in
2020 due to the combined impact of these crises2, while the blockade of Libyan oil terminals for much
of 2020 cost the country as much as 11 billion USD in lost revenue.3
3. The negative economic outlook is likely to pose further medium and long-term challenges as Libya’s
financial reserves shrink and in-country needs increase. Fuel shortages, intermittent water supplies
and power generation have become the norm in many Libyan localities, while food price hikes linked
to border closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile currency exchange rates and a flourishing
black-market trade, have increased everyday hardships in the country. Electricity blackouts average 12
hours in the west and 14 in the south according to World Health Organisation (WHO) updates from
mid-July 2020, increasingly triggering demonstrations among local communities, while about 25 per
cent of public health care facilities are shut due to acute shortages of personnel.4 Such data reflects
the increased hardship in accessing health facilities across Libya, with previous estimates contained in
the 2020 Libyan Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) noting that 24 per cent of Libyans and 80 per
cent of migrants had reported hardship in accessing health services.5
Box 1 Libya: Political, economic and conflict developments (August 2020-September 2021 update)
Developments in and around Libya over the past year (August 2020-September 2021) have been characterised
by a marked decline in open conflict, a resumption of international diplomatic efforts and the emergence of a new
political entity, the provisional Government of National Unity (GNU), which is meant to oversee the country’s
progress towards new national elections scheduled for December 2021. These developments allowed for
significant improvements in the operational environment across Libya, as security risks decreased and renewed
international engagement provided new resources and support for the resumption of more direct forms of
engagement in the country. At the same time, many of the underlining security, economic and politico-institutional
challenges facing Libya persist. These range from the presence of foreign militias and mercenaries, the deep
institutional and intra-personal mistrust among Libyan elites competing over power and resources in the run-up to
elections and the absence of a real reunification of Libya’s key economic institutions, needed to ensure a true

damaged by the previous rounds of military clashes in and around the capital.
4. Deterioration in the delivery of basic services poses a daily risk to the lives and well-being of children.
Access to healthcare continues to decline, as does the quality of health services, leading to an increase
in communicable and non-communicable diseases as well as malnutrition. Those affected by conflict,
including migrants, face significant barriers in accessing all services, including healthcare due to
inadequate medical supplies, staff, discriminatory treatment, and high costs. Water and sanitation are
rapidly becoming critical issues and the conflict continues to put the existing infrastructure at risk. Libya
has traditionally had high primary and secondary school enrolment rates, but the conflict has disrupted
education in some parts of Libya, damaging infrastructure and lowering quality. Violence in schools is
believed to be high. The disconnect between the education system and the labour market has
increasingly become a concern, given the high youth unemployment rate.
5. Libya represents a situation of serious concern for children, with the armed conflict leading to grave
violations against children. Children on the move and children affected by armed conflict are particularly
vulnerable to violence. Women and girls have traditionally had limited participation in the public sphere
and continue to face discrimination in law and practice. Gender-based violence is reportedly
widespread.
6. Throughout Libya, some population groups are significantly more vulnerable because of reduced
access to quality basic services and protection. Particularly vulnerable groups include conflict-affected
children and their families (displaced persons, returnees, and persons living in areas affected by
conflict), migrants and refugees, children and families living in certain geographic areas and members
of ethnic minorities, among others. In addition to limitations imposed by conflict and insecurity, the rights
of children and women are impacted by elements in the Libyan legal code – especially the penal code
– which are not in line with Libya’s international obligations as expressed in the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW).
7. Adolescents and youth are among the most vulnerable populations in Libya. Young people, especially
young women, have limited opportunities for social, economic, and civic engagement. Repeated
displacement and insecurity disrupt the social fabric, increasing social isolation and limiting
opportunities for education, mentoring and social engagement. Youth unemployment rates are high.
Poor quality education, limited vocational training, limited employment opportunities, and a weak
protective environment are believed to be push factors for young people’s engagement in high-risk
behaviours, including association with armed groups. Though accurate data are unavailable, there are
regular reports of child recruitment. In the most disadvantaged regions of the south, where half of the
confirmed cases of COVID-19 are located and where international access and involvement is more
limited, recent developments have contributed to an increase in poverty levels and humanitarian needs.
8. The January 2020 Libya HNO estimated that 1.8 million people had been affected by continued crisis,
roughly equivalent to 26 per cent of the Libyan population of 6.7 million.6 These data were published
prior to the increase in fighting in April-May 2020 and the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HNO
2020 estimated that of 893,000 people in need, roughly 39 per cent had acute humanitarian needs
requiring some form of assistance, a nine per cent increase compared to 2018. Approximately 30 per
cent are children under the age of 18 (176,000 boys and 91,000 girls), with girls accounting for 34 per

cent of children in need, while men and boys account for 66 per cent of people in need. This gender
disparity reflects the largely male (93 per cent) migrant population in Libya.
9. A majority of recent internally displaced persons have moved to the East (Benghazi and Ejdabia
especially), while a smaller fraction have transferred to the West. A majority of internally displaced
persons are staying with relatives, friends or host families, while an estimated 13 per cent have sought
refuge in collective shelters set up by local authorities. Returning internally displaced persons are
particularly at risk due to the large quantities of unexploded ordnance (UXO), mines and improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) still present in the Tripolitania area, with the Libyan Mine Action Centre
(LibMAC) having recorded 138 casualties, including 81 civilians, among which children, due to this
material since April 2019.7 The municipalities hosting the greatest number of internally displaced
persons are Tajoura and Suq Aljumaa in Tripoli, the city of Sebha in the southwest and Benghazi in the
east.

10. Migrants and refugees have also been impacted by the fighting and worsening operational environment
in Libya. Departures from western Libya to Europe have increased, as has the rate of interceptions by
the Libyan coast guard. United Nations programs aimed at facilitating voluntary repatriation of migrants
and refugees stranded in Libya back to their home countries have declined due to COVID-19
restrictions. In March 2020, 636,000 migrants were identified in Libya, out of whom 44,520 were

children (including 10,684 who were separated or unaccompanied, and at high risk of exploitation and
abuse).9
11. International donors have initially been cautious in increasing financial support, given competing needs
in other states such as Yemen and Syria, as well as Libya’s categorization as an upper-middle-income
country, its vast hydrocarbon wealth and the broader political and security uncertainty. As of 30 June,
51.2 per cent of requirements of the 2020 United Nations Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) appeal
for Libya, totalling 139 million USD, was still unmet.10 However, by the end of the year, the international
community ended up providing 90 per cent of funds requested under the 2020 HRP appeal11.
1.2 The Libya Country Programme of Cooperation (2019-2020)
12. Prior to 2011, the UNICEF programme for Libya consisted of upstream technical guidance and
advocacy. The Revolution in 2011, the outbreak of armed conflict in 2014, and the subsequent
deterioration of basic service delivery made it necessary for the Country Office to expand its
programming to respond to emerging needs, increasing both human resources and funding. The
previous UNICEF CPD covered 2013 - 2014 and was extended four times, until 2018.
13. The new CPD 2019 - 2020 marked a shift in programming. For the first time in four years, UNICEF was
able to fully develop a holistic results framework and monitoring system, aligned with its new CPD. The
CPD (2019-2020) was developed in close collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and other relevant
line ministries. The government formally endorsed the CPD in June 2018 and the Executive Board
approved it in September 2018. The CPD is fully aligned with the UNSF for Libya (2019-2020) and was
presented to the government and member states in conjunction with the Country Programmes of the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
1.2.1 Objectives of the Country Programme
14. The Country Programme was defined taking into consideration the humanitarian-development nexus
logic. It prioritizes system support and multi-sectoral service delivery, underpinned by evidence
generation and in support of evidence-based policy making. The cross-cutting priority areas of children
on the move, gender, youth and adolescents and emergency preparedness have been built into the
programme. The Humanitarian Action for Children complements the CPD to respond to increased
humanitarian needs.
15. The goal of the CPD is to contribute to national efforts enabling all children and adolescents in Libya,
especially those who are most vulnerable, to have their rights progressively fulfilled and to develop to
their full potential in an inclusive and protective environment. For this purpose, UNICEF supports
equitable, child-friendly basic service delivery in targeted municipalities. It also works to strengthen the
protective environment for children and contribute to the development of an enabling environment. This
helps the government and civil society organisations to improve their capacity, systems and services
to fulfil their obligations under the CRC through cross-sectoral programme components.

16. UNICEF has adopted an integrated program approach in Libya, comprised of three main outcome
areas: (1) improving access and strengthening basic service delivery, including through humanitarian
assistance; (2) strengthening the protective environment for children and youth; and (3) building
evidence-generation and capacity for evidence-based policy development and budgeting. While there
is no formal theory of change for the Country Programme, sector-specific theories of change were
developed in 2018 for the five strategic areas of the programme. However, they may be outdated given
the rapidly changing circumstances since their development.
Box 2 Strategic areas of programming
• Child Survive and Thrive includes four result areas: (a) vulnerable girls and boys, adolescents and their
families have access to water, sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and health services in targeted municipalities; (b)
girls and boys 0-59 months are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases, with special attention to polio
and measles in targeted municipalities; (c) learning and evidence on childhood poverty, vulnerability, public
finance and social protection is generated to inform child-centred social sector policies and budgets; and (d)
basic service providers at the national and subnational level have increased capacity to develop and prioritize
equity-focused, evidence-based policies and budgets and are better able to respond to emergencies. It also
includes all the identified cross-cutting issues.
• Child Protection interventions aim to support the following results: (a) community-based child protection,
psychosocial, and reintegration services are available for vulnerable boys and girls, including survivors of all
forms of violence, children with disabilities, children on the move and children associated with armed conflict in
targeted municipalities; (b) child-friendly justice institutions and services are available for boys and girls in
contact with the law in targeted municipalities; (c) boys and girls, parents, teachers and communities have
improved awareness of the risks of violence against children, and available child protection services; (d) national
systems for monitoring, reporting and responding to violations of children’s rights are strengthened, including
technical capacity, information management, and referral; and (e) basic service providers at the national and
subnational level have increased capacity to develop and prioritize equity-focused, evidence-based policies and
budgets and are better able to respond to emergencies. Cross-sectoral programme components are also
supported.
• Education interventions are focused on the following: (a) vulnerable girls, boys, adolescents and youth have
increased access to inclusive, good quality formal and non-formal education; (b) vulnerable adolescents and
youth have increased awareness of and access to Technical Vocational Education and Training and life skills
programmes in targeted municipalities. The focus includes cross-sectoral and multisectoral components.
• Social Policy includes the following results areas: (a) learning and evidence on childhood poverty, vulnerability,
public finance and social protection are generated to inform child-centred social sector policies and budgets; (b)
basic service providers at the national and subnational level have increased capacity to develop and prioritize
equity-focused, evidence-based policies and budgets and are better able to respond to emergencies. Cross-
sectoral programme components are also included. The focus on social policy was scaled up recently with the
hiring of a consultant.
• Youth interventions intersect with the education and child protection strategic areas and also cover the following
components on cross-sectoral and multisectoral results: (a) vulnerable adolescents and youth have increased
social and economic inclusion in their communities and engage in dialogue and peace-building in targeted
municipalities; (b) learning and evidence on childhood poverty, vulnerability, public finance and social protection
is generated to inform child-centred social sector policies and budgets; and (c) basic service providers at the
national and subnational level have increased capacity to develop and prioritize equity-focused, evidence-based
policies and budgets and are better able to respond to emergencies.
17. The delivery of humanitarian activities is based on the HAC. The HAC is aligned with the interagency
Humanitarian Response Plan for 201912.
12 The strategic framework of the HRP focuses on WASH, shelter and non-food Items, food security, education, and
cash assistance. Protection is also central to the response plan.

1.2.2 Partnerships, Operational Modalities and Human Resources
18. The onset of increased conflict in 2019 was met with stronger resource mobilization efforts, followed
by two adjustments in the Budget Ceiling (reaching US$68,547,059 for 2019 – 2020 period). In 2019,
UNICEF received funding from the European Union, the European Union Trust Fund, Germany, Italy,
Korea, the US State Department, Malta and CERF. However, the UNICEF funding appeal for 2019 of
USD 23.4 million fell short of expectations, with a 63 per cent funding gap registered on 31 December
2019.13 The UNICEF funding appeal for 2020 scaled requests down to about USD 19.85 million, with
33 per cent earmarked for child protection, 29 per cent for education, 21 per cent for WASH and 12 per
cent for health.14 As of March 2020, there was a funding gap of 79 per cent for the 2020 HAC appeal.15
19. To enable the delivery of the increased programming, UNICEF expanded to 58 staff (a 46 per cent
increase) in 2019. However, with the escalation of armed conflict in April, UNICEF reduced the
presence of international staff in Tripoli. UNICEF Tunisia hosted the Libya Country Office as a
temporary measure. By the end of 2019, five UNICEF national staff members were displaced from their
homes. UNICEF decided to vacate all units in the temporary office premises by February 2020 because
of on-going security concerns and high-cost implications. Following an attack on United Nations
personnel in Benghazi, which killed three United Nations staff members, UNICEF and other United
Nations agencies reduced their presence in Benghazi to around 62 staff, including 21 international staff,
under flexible work arrangements.
20. During 2019, UNICEF strengthened its comprehensive approach to partnership building with key
ministries, municipal councils, civil society organisations, United Nations agencies and donors. During
the first quarter of 2019, UNICEF developed ten sectoral Annual Work Plans with its government
counterparts16 as the foundation for implementing its Country Programme. UNICEF partnered with 14
national organisations17 and worked closely with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya
(UNSMIL), the Office of the Resident Coordinator and all United Nations agencies.
21. UNICEF has strengthened many of its monitoring, coordination, and implementation mechanisms to
adapt to the current context. UNICEF continued to develop the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfer
(HACT) framework. In 2019, UNICEF undertook 19 micro-assessments (including annual assurance
activities and programmatic visits) and 16 spot-checks. Moreover, UNICEF contracted third-party
monitors to monitor programme delivery in areas that were hard for UNICEF staff to reach. Two

programme evaluations were initiated in 2019, and the European Union Trust Fund (EUTF) evaluation
was completed in 2020.
22. The geographic scope of the Country Programme covers the entire country or 99 municipalities18. For
the Stabilization program, described above, UNICEF targeted 24 municipalities, with nine in the
southwest central areas and including highly populated urban areas.
2 The Evaluation Rationale, Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Users
23. The UNICEF Libya Country Programme (2019-2020) evaluation follows the UNICEF 2018 evaluation
policy. The evaluation has an accountability function and will provide impartial and independent
evidence for the next programming cycle.
24. The general objective of the independent evaluation is to assess the degree to which the conceptual
framework and strategies are relevant and effective, to contribute to a possible Mid-Term Review (in
the event of the extension of the CPD) and to the new Country Programme Document.
25. The specific objectives of the evaluation are:
• To evaluate if the current Country Programme Strategy (including the humanitarian-development
nexus approach) remains relevant and sufficiently flexible to respond to the emerging conflict
dynamics and the possibility of a protracted conflict situation with fluctuations in the intensity of the
conflict in different geographical locations;
• To evaluate the programme implementation modalities for effectiveness to ensure that UNICEF is
responding to the most pressing needs of children and their families, targeting the most vulnerable
children in the most affected locations.
• To evaluate the operational modalities for effectiveness, particularly regarding operational flexibility,
adaptability to the evolving context and the operational structure (geographical distribution, remote
management modalities, allocation of human resources, etc).
26. The primary audience is the UNICEF Libya Country Office, especially senior management and staff
(e.g., Programming, Monitoring and Evaluation, Planning, Operations) who will benefit from sufficient
analytical evidence to acquire a better knowledge of the overall picture and results, to ultimately improve
future strategic planning, programming and partnerships. The secondary audience includes mainly
partners from government and the United Nations, development partners, implementing partners,
NGOs, other civil society actors, as well as beneficiaries, children and young people concerned with
the issues evaluated – especially those who are actively participating in the Country Programme. Other
UNICEF staff, not directly covered by this evaluation, may be considered as a secondary audience.
27. The scope of the evaluation includes key results achieved and strategies applied within the current
UNICEF Country Programme and HAC appeal, including programme implementation and
management, crosscutting issues, cross-sectoral and multisectoral initiatives, as well as the nexus
between development and humanitarian areas. The evaluation covers the period from January 2019
18 UNDP Libya Rapid Diagnostic of Local Governance 2015, pg.11 - Following the adoption of Law 59/2012, the Cabinet
instituted the creation of 99 municipalities with Decree No. 180/2013 – 23 of them corresponding to capitals of the
former shaabiyat. During 2013 and 2014, 85 municipal councils were effectively elected under supervision of the Central
Committee for Municipal Council Elections. Where elections did not take place yet, ad hoc local councils, inherited from
the revolution period in 2011 and selected by popular acclamation or through other non-official electoral processes,
remained in place.
8
into May 2020 The geographic scope of the evaluation includes areas covered by the programme at
the national and local levels.
3 Evaluation Approach and Methodology
28. The evaluation largely follows the evaluation criteria19 of the Development Assistance Committee
(DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It covers the criteria
of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness for developmental activities and connectedness from the
humanitarian area. An additional criterion, comparative advantage and strategic positioning, has been
added to address one of the points from the scope section of the Terms of Reference (ToRs), which
requires the evaluation to “include a substantive reflection on the strategic direction of the UNICEF
programme in the context of the current political tensions and renewed conflict”. The full list of questions
is described in Annex 5: Evaluation criteria and questions.
29. The report closely follows the Revised Evaluation Policy of UNICEF (2018) which adheres to United
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) norms and standards and takes into consideration the Global
Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) standards of the UNICEF Quality Assurance process
and its review template. The evaluation inception report was reviewed and approved by the Ethics
Review Board.
3.1 Evaluation Approach
30. The Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) focuses on the key Country Programme outcomes and
outputs, and progress is measured at the highest possible level of the results chain. The evaluation
was conducted in a participatory manner, ensuring the involvement of a wide sample of key
stakeholders, during all phases of the evaluation. The evaluation was human rights-based, gender-
sensitive and equity-focused20.
31. The evaluation team used the following UNEG guidance: the 2010 UNEG Quality Checklist for
Evaluation ToR and Inception Reports, the 2010 UNEG Quality Checklist for Evaluation Reports, the
2016 United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards, and the 2017 UNICEF-Adapted
UNEG Evaluation Report Standards, which provide guidelines for evaluators to assure quality in the
preparation of evaluation reports.21 More details regarding the evaluation approach are provided in
Annex 4.
3.2 Evaluation Methodology
32. The evaluation used a mixed methods approach. Given travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19
pandemic, the evaluators agreed with the Steering Committee that data collection would be desk-
based. The evaluation methods used were thus carefully weighed against these constraints.
19 In keeping with the Terms of Reference for the evaluation, the OECD DAC criterion of sustainability was not included.
20 The key guidance used was the 2014 UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in
Evaluation, which guides and promotes the integration of human rights and gender equality in evaluation practice, the
2012 UNICEF Guide on Evaluation for Equitable Development Results, and the 2011 UNICEF Guide on How to design
and manage equity-focussed evaluations. The 2018 OHCHR Guidance on Human Rights-Based Approach to Data
was useful with respect to data collection.
21 The key material is on this page: https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/resource

Information was triangulated to improve the reliability of the findings and the relevance and ease of
implementation of the recommendations.
33. The evidence to answer evaluation questions was collected through the desk review of key internal and
external documents, with guidance provided by the regional office and the Country Office. The desk
review included: available geospatial data, government surveys and other relevant information on the
country, government strategies and policy documents, the UNSF documentation, the Humanitarian
Response sitreps and reports, UNICEF programme documents, evaluations, Annual Reports, and
monitoring reports. See Annex 2: List of background documentation and references.
34. The evaluation team collected primary qualitative data, e.g., opinions and recommendations from
stakeholders using two main methods, key informant interviews and an online survey. Key informant
(KI) interviews (74) provided a deeper understanding of UNICEF and provided the basis for
recommendations. These qualitative and in-depth interviews were implemented for each programme
component; ii) online survey tools were created to reach four sets of potential respondents: UNICEF
staff, UNICEF implementing partners, other UNICEF partners and Development and Humanitarian
Partners and donors. Stakeholders in the Libya Country Programme were reached through key
informant interviews and an online survey. These are presented in Annex 1.
35. The information and data collected were, as far as possible, triangulated and validated – three or more
sources of information were typically used to verify and substantiate a finding. For further details, see
Annex 4.
3.3 Ethical Considerations
36. The evaluation was subject to a formal process of ethics review. This review was conducted in
accordance with relevant UNICEF guidance on ethical standards and in accordance with the UNEG
Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (see Annex 4).
3.4 Limitations
37. Limitations that affected the evaluation are detailed in the table below and include security and access
issues, data collection and analysis issues, and evaluation resources issues.

4 Evaluation Findings
4.1 Relevance
4.1.1 Relevance of the Country Programme to Priority Needs
38. The 2019-2020 Country Programme was grounded on general and sector-specific assessments and
analysis, including consultations with government counterparts at all levels. In particular, the Situation
Analysis on Women and Children in Libya (February 2018)22 commissioned by UNICEF, describes
major causes and drivers of child rights shortfalls and inequities. The findings of this analysis are
largely still pertinent. The overarching recommendation of the situation analysis is to support the Libyan
government in realising children’s rights while continuing to provide assistance to meet the urgent
humanitarian needs. In essence, the report suggests that since development and humanitarian needs
are inextricably interwoven in the context of Libya, UNICEF assistance should address both levels.
39. The Country Programme was built on the complementarity and continuum between a service delivery
/ emergency assistance perspective and an environment building / system support developmental
perspective. The Country Programme provided a consistent framework for integrating Humanitarian
Action for Children (HAC) objectives and results and linked humanitarian action with developmental
needs in a nexus logic.23 The Country Programme Document was also informed by the findings of the
main interagency assessments (i.e., the Joint Country Assessment 2017; the Humanitarian Response
Plan 2018; the Multi-sector Needs Assessment24; and the OCHA Humanitarian Overview).
40. In addition to the Situation Analysis on Women and Children in Libya, other sector-specific analysis
fed into the development of the Country Programme. These were:
• an assessment of water quality in Libyan schools was implemented in 2017, sampling 140
schools served by different water sources including well water, desalinated, and rainwater. The
survey found that 67 per cent of the schools had a limited drinking water source and the vast
majority had limited sanitation services. The average number of students to a functional toilet
was 71 (compared to the Ministry of Education standards 25/1). Hygiene services were very
inadequate and water quality testing indicated the presence of bacteria. This assessment led
to the inclusion of rehabilitation of WASH in schools in the Country Programme;
• the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey carried out by WHO in
2016-2017 covered all public health facilities in Libya and determined that 17.5 per cent of
hospitals were closed, and 20 per cent of public Primary Health Centres (PHCs) were non-
functional. While the general readiness score for the provision of basic services by functioning
hospitals was 69 per cent, the general readiness score for primary health care facilities was
only 45 per cent, indicating that the capacity to provide basic health services in these facilities
was severely constrained. Over one-third of municipalities could not provide child health care
to their constituents. Based on this assessment, WHO developed a country cooperation
strategy with four pillars, to which UNICEF contributes through the Country Programme, with

the development of the District Health Information System (DHIS) and by strengthening the
PHC system in 24 municipalities;25
• three assessments were carried out for education: the REACH Multi Sector Needs Assessment
2018; the NRC Education Assessment in Tripoli 2017; and K4D Girls’ Educational Needs in
Libya 2018. These were all conducted in coordination with the Tripoli-based Ministry of
Education26;
• the Violence Against Children (VAC) study was carried out in 2017, although it was not
published;
• the development of the Child Protection strategy was informed by studies commissioned by
UNICEF27 such as the UNICEF Legislative Analysis of Child Protection in Libya; “Child Well-
Being in Libya A Multidimensional Poverty Analysis using PAPFAM 2014”; ‘Study on Violence
against Children in Libya; Mapping and Assessment of Family and Child Protection Units;
IMPACT Solitary Journeys of Unaccompanied and Asylum Seeking Children; CORAM
international technical assistance to support the strengthening of the child justice system - Desk
Review 2018; and CESVI Education and Child Protection Assessment of Mixed Migrant
Communities in Tripoli and Misrata.
41. Drawing on these assessments, UNICEF built a strong cross-sectoral strategy in its Country
Programme, while at the same time noting the sector-specific strategies and linkages with sector-
specific stakeholders in the government and other organizations. The original CPD planning included
a dedicated cross-sectoral budget line with support for intersectoral monitoring. The cross-sectoral
aspect of planning highlighted UNICEF global guidance as reflected in the UNICEF Strategic Plan
2018-2021.28
4.1.2 Addressing the Needs
42. The UNICEF programme has largely remained relevant in terms of the sectors and targeted
populations. The rapidly evolving context, challenges in access and the difficult political situation in
different parts of the country have often constrained the possibility to address the most acute needs.
This has also affected capacity for assessments and evidence generation, as well as the reliability of
data collected.
43. An example of that is the access to the south of the country. Access was limited by a number of factors,
including insecurity, lawlessness, long distances between municipality centres and high costs of
transportation. This made it more difficult to access the most vulnerable. In 2019, UNICEF made plans
to further strengthen its presence in the east and increase its footprint in the south as a way of
improving the provision of humanitarian assistance. UNICEF also made efforts to advance the
geographical focus of education programming toward the east during ongoing conflict. However,
coverage of the south of the country, particularly the southeast, remained insufficient.29

44. As noted in the HNO, the geographic focus of the strategic sectors was not fully aligned with the
severity of needs as identified in 2019 or in 2020. However, the HNO noted that other assistance actors
may have covered some of the needs30 in the main sectors:
• Health and Nutrition: As of late 2019, the distribution of humanitarian assistance and operational
presence was disproportional, focusing on the Tripoli area. Other districts and municipalities were
not covered by humanitarian health services for various reasons, including security, lack of
funding, and poor prioritization. Nonetheless, the health needs in those areas were well-
recognized. 31
Figure 2 Education needs
• Education: Responses in the
education sector were concentrated in
the west (Tripoli, Almagreb, Sirt,
Zwara, Azzawiya, Al Jabal Al Gharbi
and Misrata mantikas), the east
(Benghazi, Derna, AlKufra and
Ejdabia) and the south (Sabha, Ubari
and Murzuq mantikas). As noted in the
HNO maps, the geographic focus was
not fully aligned with the severity of
education needs as identified in the
2019 and 2020 HNO.
• Child Protection: The geographic
focus of the child protection
programme beyond the system support
Figure 3 Child Protection needs
is narrow compared to the severity of
the child protection needs across the
country as illustrated in the Protection
Severity map where 27 per cent of
those in need are children. Coverage
under UNICEF Child Protection
programme is also inadequate,
particularly in the southern areas
where the needs are the greatest (see
annexes). In 2020, the child protection
programme coverage evolved to
address the protection needs of many
internally displaced persons in the
west (Benghazi, Tobruk and Ejdabia) as result of the escalating conflict in April and August 2019.
45. The EU “Stabilization Programme” was topped up in 2020 by 4 million Euros, enabling UNICEF to
increase targeting of the south and east and to move from service delivery / emergency to gradual
capacity building. The Stabilization programme acted as a catalyst to focus on 24 municipalities located
along migration routes throughout Libya32. Discussions were held with mayors; assessment missions

were carried out to verify needs and to ensure an effective response. The inception period was
extended to ensure agreement on inputs by all parties.
4.1.3 Alignment with Stakeholders
46. The Country Programme was developed in coordination with partner United Nations agencies, under
the framework of the United Nations Strategic Framework (UNSF) for Libya (2019-2020, extended to
2021). The strategic areas are aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Education
Strategy contributes to the realization of SDG 433 and SDG 1634, the Child Protection strategy to SDG
16; WASH strategy to SDG 6, and Health strategy to SDG 3. The UNICEF Country Programme shares
indicators with the UNSF; UNICEF contributes bi-annually to the update of the relevant UNSF
indicators. The Country Programme is strongly aligned with UNSF 2019-2020, the SDGs, and the
humanitarian, development and peace nexus framework.
47. The contribution of UNICEF to the Interagency Humanitarian Response Plan is defined by HAC 2019
and HAC 2020. In 2020, UNICEF led the establishment of an inter-agency Rapid Response Mechanism
for sudden-onset emergencies and for delivering assistance in hard-to-reach areas.
48. The sectoral strategies were aligned to Libyan government strategies / the ministerial strategic
documents. In 2019, UNICEF developed ten Annual Work Plans with government counterparts, a
remarkable achievement in a context of fragmented governance. Government strategies in many cases
are outdated, have not been fully implemented, or are missing altogether such as a youth development
strategy. Thus, the agreements also represent joint strategic direction for the ministries in working with
UNICEF, partners and donors. Humanitarian assistance is delivered in partnership with line ministries,
municipalities, and NGOs.
49. Water and Sanitation: At the national level, UNICEF partners with the General Water Resources
Authority (GWRA), including the institutions charged with the provision of water and the management
of sewage that work under its umbrella (i.e. the Great Man-Made River Project including the Great Man-
made River Authority and the Utilization Authority, the General Company for Water and Wastewater;
and the General Company for Water Desalination). UNICEF works closely with the Ministry of Planning
and with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), particularly regarding water quality.
50. Health and Nutrition: Since 2012, the efforts of the Government of Libya aimed to improve equitable
access and the quality of health services as well as access to psychosocial support and protection of
vulnerable groups, such as children and internally displaced persons. Different health policies were
reviewed/developed prior to the adoption of the National Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and
Adolescent Health Strategy in 2018, with the support of WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA.
51. Education: The UNICEF education strategy is based on inputs and discussion with the Ministry of
Education35. However, alignment in the education sector is more limited and the recommendation from
the Situation Analysis on Women and Children in Libya (February 2018)36 to develop an inclusive
education sector policy has made little progress.
33 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
34 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build
effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels

52. Adolescents and Youth (intersecting Child Protection and Education). The draft national Youth
Strategy supported by UNICEF, “Towards Resilience and Social Inclusion of Adolescents and Young
People in Libya”, has not yet been passed by the government.
53. Child Protection The UNICEF child protection strategy is consistent with the government’s strategic
priorities for children, and those of the line ministries and other institutions taking part in the National
Action Plan to End All Violence against Children in Libya (Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Planning,
Ministry of Media and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, High Judicial Institute and Higher Council
for Children).
54. The “Stabilization” programme went through a long inception process in order to consult with government
ministries and to identify needs of the 24 municipalities.37 For education and health activities, UNICEF
coordinated closely with respective line ministries. Following an agreement with line ministries and technical
partners on activities to be implemented, UNICEF with AICS and UNDP presented the activities for each
municipality to the Ministry of Local Governance for technical review. There were three related steps: 1) a
Steering Committee meeting on 25 June 2019 led by the Ministry of Local Governance to decide on all
actions to be implemented in the targeted municipalities; 2) support from UNICEF for seven boreholes in
flood-affected communities in Ghat; 3) agreement between UNICEF and the Ministry of Education on an
education package and agreement between UNICEF and the Ministry of Health on a health package. For
WASH activities, the “Stabilization” programme supported high level water management strategies38,
mostly created before the conflict, in the 24 targeted municipalities. In March 2019, mayors of the
municipalities endorsed both UNICEF-UNDP's WASH work plan and the list of supplies to be procured
which were also vetted with the General Company of Water and Wastewater (GCWW).39 The General
Authority for Water and Wastewater was later included in planning discussions. The Stabilization
programme involved the Ministry in gaining agreement but the third-party implementer (Expertise France)
did not always consult the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Ministry of Education regarding programme
decisions.
55. The local (i.e. Libya-based organizations) and international implementing partners of UNICEF were
selected on the basis of their areas of expertise and experience, as well as their compatibility with UNICEF
partnership guidance, thus ensuring, in principle, strategic alignment. However, planning discussions with
UNICEF were largely based on implementation details rather than jointly determined objectives of the
humanitarian strategy. Organizations with greater access than UNICEF to beneficiaries note that the
relevance of UNICEF interventions could be further strengthened through joint planning and consideration
of their experience in addressing technical and cultural challenges.
4.1.4 Responsiveness to Changes
56. The rapidly evolving situation in Libya required the Country Office to continuously adapt to emerging
challenges and changing circumstances, and to capitalize on opportunities. UNICEF leveraged its
coordination role in the WASH and education sectors, and the child protection sub-sector (and its support

(October 2019),
38 The National Strategy for Integrated Water Resources Management (2000-2025) is the main guide on water
management in Libya. It was formulated in 1999 and approved in May 2005 with the aim to stop water deficits and
water quality deterioration in order to set a base for sustainable development. This led to the National Program for
Water Supply and Sanitation, aiming to provide access to safe water supply and sanitation to all Libyans through
identification of all communities in need of reticulated systems, enhancement or upgrade of such systems. The National
Strategy for Sustainable Development was formulated in 2008

for scaling up the nutrition working group within the health sector) to address changing needs through joint
assessments and analysis, and fostering agreement on shared priorities. For example, as the Education
Working Group lead40, UNICEF facilitated timely rebalancing of the education programme towards
emergency needs as they arose (second half of 2019 and COVID response in 2020).
Figure 4 Education sector, COVID response timeline
57. Other examples of response to contextual changes, including political developments and increased armed
conflict, include the following:
• Providing child, maternal and neo-natal supplies and medicines to primary health care facilities in Q4
2019, supporting conflict-affected or displaced persons in western and southern Libya and benefitting
over 42,000 people (e.g.Tripoli, Aljfara, Msellata, Garrabolli, Tajoura and Murzuq).
• Providing ten health facilities sufficient supplies and medicines to support 36,500 conflict-affected
people (far surpassing the original 2019 target) in response to increased violence in Western Libya
and Murzuq which increased needs in health facilities.
• Distributing refrigerators to ensure the quality and capacity of cold chain vaccine maintenance in 37
municipalities in the east, west and south.41
• Providing emergency nutrition services to vulnerable children and pregnant and lactating women in
ten detention centres in western Libya as well as the Gathering and Departure Facility in Tripoli - 800
children (aged 6 to 59 months) received life-saving nutrition services and screening, while almost 3,700
children and pregnant and lactating women received micronutrients and 70 malnourished detainees
received Ready to Use Therapeutic Food.
• Supporting catch-up classes after the suspension of the school year in April 2019, support to MoE to
conduct exams in July 2019 42 and the Joint Education Needs Assessment in October 2019.
• Scaling up Psychosocial Support beyond the Bayti centres in schools, thanks to the synergies with the
education programme43.

• Placing more priority on the GBV response, even though GBV was not identified as a core priority in
the Country Programme and in the Child Protection Programme Strategy Notes, through Bayti centres
and establishing Safe Girls Spaces to provide GBV prevention and response services44.
• With the arrival of COVID in Libya, rebranding and modification of previously planned interventions,
especially in WASH, with enhanced communication on viral spread. The timely development of the
COVID response plan within the Education Working Group led by UNICEF is an example of the
relevance and efficiency of the approaches.
• The onset of increased conflict in 2019 was met with stronger resource mobilization efforts, followed
by two adjustments in the Budget Ceiling
• A report published in March of 2019 by Médicins Sans Frontières, described the nutrition situation for
300 detained migrants located in a detention centre (DC) in Sabaa, with uneven access to medical
and humanitarian support. Sabaa DC was one of seven DCs at the time, with one third of its inhabitants
under the age of 18. Nutrition monitoring by MSF found increasing levels of severe and moderate
acute malnutrition, with 24 per cent of migrants underweight. UNICEF responded through distribution
of high energy biscuits and advocacy with government for improved nutrition conditions.
• Activation of the informal Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism45 (MRM) on grave violations 46 in April
2019, following escalation of the conflict in late 201847 when the Country Programme was already
approved by the Executive Board. In response to the escalating violence and continued violations of
the International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law, UNICEF decided in January 2019 to
activate the MRM on the six grave violations. To this end, UNICEF first undertook a feasibility study,
risk analysis and mapping of key stakeholders. A Child Rights Network of 80 Civil Society
Organisations (CSOs) was established and specialized training was provided to 25 child rights
monitors, 55 government officials, national NGOs and child protection sector partners. An informal
MRM was initially activated in April 2019. UNICEF monitors and verifies cases and information
gathered though the Child Rights Network, UNHCR Protection database, International Organisation
for Migration (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) system, United Nations Mine Action Service
(UNMAS) and the GBV Information Management System (GBV-IMS). Verified cases are referred
through the child protection and GBV referral mechanisms and UNSMIL. In 2019, 113 cases of grave
violations were verified. Voluntary quarterly reporting for the “Global Horizontal Note” (GHN)
addressed to the Security Council and continued advocacy with UNCT, RC, member states, security
council and ambassadors, resulted in the request from Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for Children and Armed Conflict to meet with leadership of UNICEF, UNSMIL and the Deputy
Special Representative of the Secretary-General to discuss grave violations in 2020.
4.1.5 Integration of Cross-Cutting issues
58. This section looks at the integration of cross-cutting issues, focusing on gender but including emergency
preparedness and response, and children on the move. The evaluation found no evidence of gender
provided capacity development for social workers from MoE, MOSA and MoH on basic psychosocial support concepts,
including referral to specialized protection services as well as the use of recreational kits
44 HAC 2020 targets 15,000 children and women accessing gender-based violence risk mitigation, prevention or
response interventions
45 The Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) was established by Security Council Resolution 1612. Through
this and subsequent related resolutions, UNICEF is mandated to support monitoring and reporting on grave child rights
violations to the Security Council.
46 Grave violations include killing and maiming of children; recruitment or use of children as soldiers; sexual violence
against children; abduction of children; attacks against schools or hospitals; denial of humanitarian access for children.
47 Battle of Tripoli (27th of August- 25th of September 2018). The indiscriminate attacks and shelling resulted in loss of
many civilian lives including children, women, families and humanitarian workers. Thousands of civilians were trapped
in conflict zone areas and were not given safe routes to evacuate the conflict areas; civilian infrastructure was targeted
and humanitarian actors were denied access to the most vulnerable population. (Libya Protection Sector Update on
the Protection Situation in Tripoli 24 September 2018.pdf)

analysis underpinning the Country Programme. Indicators were disaggregated by gender, and boys and
girls took part equally in activities, but it is not clear how gender considerations were incorporated in the
programming. Results of the on-line survey further suggested that adolescents and youth programming and
gender were areas in need of improvements. However, some components of the programme did show
timely responses to challenges as they were identified. For instance, increasing GBV risks were not initially
included in the Country Programme, but the GBV aspects of the child protection programme were
developed and outlined in the GBV action plan48.
59. Emergency preparedness and response, and children on the move are cross-cutting priorities for the
sectors. For example, in the child protection programme the 28 target municipalities have been selected
based on the high presence of children on the move and conflict-affected populations49. As such, in addition
to targeted interventions (i.e., alternatives to detention and rehabilitation of children associated with armed
groups) all child protection programmes target these vulnerable groups. The needs of younger children (0
to 6 years of age) receive less attention from the programme.
60. Child Rights are at the core of the child protection programming with an emphasis on building the capacity
for reporting on the CRC for government and to develop shadow reports for civil society organisations50.
Integration with humanitarian principles is specified in the 2019 and 2020 HAC and the joint Humanitarian
Response Plans. The scope and geographic focus reflect and expand the priorities and targets set in the
HRP 201951 to include host communities.
61. The Annual Management Plan March 2019 outlines strategies to achieve Priority Result #4: Emergency
preparedness and the response capacity of partners were improved to provide lifesaving assistance to
vulnerable children and to upgrade facilities. Relevance to the emergency context was strengthened by
actions taken in 2019 to enhance preparedness, as well as by the examples mentioned below:52
• Capacity building of line ministries in emergency preparedness and response essentials: an example
is the National Action Plan to End All Violence against Children in Libya signed by the Ministry of Social
Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of
Health, Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Media and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, High Judicial
Institute and Higher Council for Children. The plan includes prevention and emergency response
actions such as the Explosive Ordnance Risk Education, community awareness on violence against
children and psychosocial support/psychological first aid and GBV mitigation and prevention.
• Strengthen emergency response capacity: an example in health is facilitating the introduction of
monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine (mOPV) cold chain logistics and vaccine management as part of
preparedness plan for a polio outbreak. Additionally, UNICEF supported NCDC staff in attending the
ToT training on Interpersonal Communication for Immunization and Behavioural Communication
strategies for global epidemics.
• Strengthen sector coordination for improved humanitarian programming in education, WASH, child
protection, health, and nutrition

target is higher than the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan projections because UNICEF targeted additional vulnerable
populations from host communities.

• Establish a field office in Benghazi to expand presence throughout the country and to support the
emergency response across the east of Libya. However, after the attack on United Nations personnel
in August 2019, many staff were withdrawn from Benghazi.53
• Strengthen the presence in Sebha in accordance with humanitarian principles through the
“Stabilization” programme.
• Scale up humanitarian programmes and response in hard-to-reach areas through selective partnership
with LRC and other national NGOs – Partnerships with Libya Red Crescent, Emdad and Libyan
Societies, among others, helped to reach areas and beneficiaries not easily accessible to UNICEF
directly.
• Ensure that the minimum quantity of emergency supplies is pre-positioned and coordinated interagency
RRM response is implemented - During 2019, UNICEF established a warehouse in Tripoli to support
programme delivery and allowed UNICEF to preposition emergency supplies.
• Strengthen humanitarian situation monitoring, programme monitoring and feedback from the
beneficiaries to improve, strengthen and make the programme more relevant.
• Preparedness and prevention are addressed throughout the child protection programme. Examples are
the VAC NAP including prevention and response actions, the Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (also
included in the Rapid Response Mechanism), community awareness on violence against children and
psychosocial support / psychological first aid and GBV mitigation and prevention.
4.1.6 Relevance: Conclusions and Recommendations
62. Conclusion 01: The Country Programme has been found highly relevant to the priority needs of children
in Libya. The Country Programme has taken available evidence into account, incorporating findings from
assessments, both multi-agency and by UNICEF, of humanitarian and development needs in the five
strategic areas. The reliability of the available evidence is not strong, but the Country Programme responds
to this with a strong focus on evidence generation.
63. Conclusion 02: The Libya Country Office has demonstrated appropriate flexibility and initiative in
responding to changes. Programme priorities, resources and interventions were reviewed when in-country
needs increased, particularly in the humanitarian domain and from the perspective of the nexus logic. New
challenges stemming from shifting conflict lines, the advent of COVID-19 and worsening economic
indicators were addressed to the extent possible, given available resources and access constraints, through
increases in service delivery and humanitarian / risk awareness interventions.
64. Conclusion 03: Alignment with government priorities, and UNICEF global and regional priorities was
generally strong especially through the agreed work planning process. However, some sectors and
activities were not always able to keep government counterparts informed. Implementing partners were
chosen for their ability to deliver rather than on aligned strategic priorities.
65. Conclusion 04: Cross-sectoral approaches were planned but not always implemented in practice. Gender
and adolescents and youth programming are areas where improvements are needed.
66. Recommendation 01: Strengthen programming to incorporate cross-cutting youth and gender themes
more effectively. Undertake a gender assessment of all strategic areas and develop a cross-sectoral gender
plan with partners; ensure that each sector addresses the situation of adolescents and youth relative to
their developmental needs.
53 https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/08/1044111
21
67. Recommendation 02: Promote greater strategic planning opportunities with implementing partners
(national and international NGOs) to facilitate joint strategy and policy development. Elevate discussions,
collaboration and coordination with implementing partners to a more strategic level, beyond the negotiation
of implementation or the emergency strategies developed within the sector working groups. This will be the
best way to utilize their access to beneficiaries and their experience in addressing technical and cultural
challenges.
4.2 Efficiency
4.2.1 Programmatic Approaches
68. The Libya Country Programme uses integrated programming as evidenced by the fully cross-sectoral
results and resources framework (RRF) which accompanies the CPD (2019-2020).54 All of the outcomes
and many of the outputs require inputs from more than one sector. This shift away from a sectoral approach
requires substantive collaboration among sections during programme design, implementation and
monitoring. To ensure smooth collaboration, chiefs of sections and relevant staff have developed an output-
based cross-sectoral coordination plan that identifies: (a) the results owner; (b) the budget holder for each
output; and (c) contributing sectors and the manner of their engagement in each activity. In 2019, the WASH
and health and nutrition sectors were united under a Child Survival and Development section and
Adolescents and Youth was incorporated into the Education section.
69. The Annual Work Plan (March 2019) describes Priority Programme #1: Improved basic service delivery
(i.e. education, child protection, health, nutrition, and WASH) in 24 target municipalities through integrated
programming using the convergence approach, including a focus on the second decade of life.55 However,
the implications of the integrated approach both at the municipality level and internally in the office had
been underestimated. Reaching agreements with 24 municipalities on different areas of intervention took
considerable time and effort, and required additional skills and responsibilities from staff as well as
reorganizing the budgeting and reporting requirements.56
70. One of the key strategies to achieve integrated results included establishing and operating community
centres (Bayti57 centres) that provide multi-sectoral services, with a focus on the most vulnerable children.
In practice, however, the potential for the Bayti approach was not fully used. Bayti centres have almost
exclusively hosted child protection and non-formal education activities and more could be done to fully
integrate other sectors into the model. Integration could be pursued through strengthening referrals to
existing structures to provide, for example, health and nutrition services or through hosting ad hoc initiatives
(e.g., health and nutrition screening, vaccination) as appropriate.
71. Another important approach employed in Libya is the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM). In 2019,
UNICEF spearheaded the establishment of this mechanism to respond to the needs of internally displaced
persons and migrants affected by the conflict in and around Tripoli. In 2020, UNICEF planned to give priority
to the integration of cash assistance under the RRM, to empower vulnerable households to prioritize
assistance according to their needs. Implementation of the Harmonized Approach for Cash Transfer
(HACT) was made a priority in 2019. The HACT Assurance Plan was adjusted to support the

made to improve staff compliance with mandatory trainings. Additionally, 46 per cent of staff received external training

implementation of the new Country Programme with 19 micro-assessments and 16 spot-checks that started
in 2019. The HACT Assurance Plan was expected to be finalized in Q2 2020. During 2019, two capacity
building events were held on the HACT essentials for staff and partners. Programme monitoring was done
by third-party monitors – service providers using E-Tools. 58
Emergency preparedness and response are integrated into all components of the programme and are the
shared responsibility of all Country Office staff. While integrated programming in the Libya Country Office
is progressive compared to other offices, there are mixed results. Themes that should be cross cutting such
as gender and youth, have not received needed emphasis (as described in the previous section).
4.2.2 Advocacy and Communications
72. UNICEF interventions are aimed at strengthening the UNICEF brand, and building alliances and
partnerships for change through public engagement by: i) positioning UNICEF social media accounts as a
credible and reliable source frequently used by media outlets, ii) partnering with the private sector, iii)
partnering with local implementing partners, i.e., scouts for child rights campaigns, the NCDC for anti-
COVID-19 measures and Free Fields Foundation (3F) for explosive risk reduction education campaigns.
73. Significant growth in social media followership and engagement was achieved by publishing more than five
multi-lingual posts on Facebook and Twitter per week and by committing to evidence-based information. A
visibility analysis in different languages confirmed that people are more aware of the issues pertaining to
children.
74. Communications were used as a strategy to promote behaviour changes related to achieving programmatic
results. For example, WASH messages are distributed through schools and in communities (e.g., on health,
hand washing, conserving water) often alongside improvements in the WASH systems that would improve
the efficiency of those communications. Communications were also key in adapting the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. An example of that is the COVID-19 response plan developed with the Ministry of
Education. UNICEF supported recording and broadcasting over 400 lessons in support of distance
education during the time of school closures.
75. UNICEF promotes advocacy to raise awareness and increase knowledge regarding the challenges facing
the government and society at both the national and regional level. Through robust regional advocacy
efforts, the Libya Country Office and the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (MENARO) called
on all parties in conflicts in the region to end the six grave violations on children59, and emphasized the
need for children to be at the centre of recovery, reconstruction and social cohesion programming.60
Examples of advocacy efforts in Libya were: advocacy to support national resources to improve WASH
systems and facilities, including support for a nationwide WASH survey, and creation of a nutrition unit in
the NCDC to monitor and address issues of malnutrition. The latter resulted in a staffed nutrition office
within the Ministry of Health (MOH). UNICEF also advocated with WHO and IOM, among others, and with
government and municipalities for strengthening the extended immunization programme and the PHC
system. Strong promotion for setting up the information systems needed to collect health, nutrition and
education data on a regular basis moved development of the DHIS and EMIS to the rollout phase. On child
protection, UNICEF continued its advocacy toward government for the purpose of ending violence against
children, developing alternatives to detention for children in contact with the law, and establishing
transitional centres for detained migrant children61. UNICEF also advocated for the activation of a formal
58 Ibid.
59 Instrumental to this was the establishment of the Informal Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism in 2019
60 MENARO Regional Office Annual Report, 2017
61 These centres will hold children no longer than three months, during which long term solutions will be identified on a
case-by-case basis and in accordance with their best interest by the Panel for Best Interest Determination (co-chaired
23
Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism and for release and reintegration of children associated with armed
forces and armed groups.
76. The advocacy efforts of UNICEF also worked through the United Nations Country Team, and the sectoral
working groups and global and regional advocacy initiatives. However, there was not a consistent child
protection advocacy plan, nor was there a joint child protection advocacy strategy with the other United
Nations agencies or at HCT. Although examples of joint advocacy and communication exist62, these
seemed to be more reactive than proactive. In addition, joint advocacy was not discussed / planned in HCT
meetings, which were described as operating more as venues to share information on each other’s
programming than as opportunities for joint strategies and advocacy. There was also a lack of coordinated
advocacy strategy with international NGOs and within the Child Protection Working Group and Protection
Sector.
77. Advocacy approaches were significantly strengthened (i.e., mentioned much more frequently) in the
February 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan when compared to the 2019 Humanitarian Response Plan.
UNICEF promoted more efficient advocacy efforts through coordination mechanisms: the Protection from
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Network members agreed on a mechanism, not yet in place, to
address community-based complaints. Response monitoring will be regularly discussed by HCT and the
Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) to identify if and where course correction or adjustments are
required to the response. Response monitoring will also be used to inform partners, donors and other
stakeholders, as well as to support advocacy efforts.63
78. There were long delays in UNICEF communications with donors and implementing partners. Examples
include long response times to donor representatives who needed to submit regular updates to their
governments, although this improved in the last part of 2019 when the Country Office clarified reporting
dates, defined stricter reporting deadlines, and designated focal points and channels for donor
representative communications. In the implementation of the COVID-19 response for Child Protection.
Implementing partners faced periodic delays in getting answers to questions raised by their organizations
and the communities where they work, which caused tensions in the relationships. The main reasons for
these delays have been staff turnover and heavy administrative and contract management procedures.
4.2.3 Partnerships
79. In general, the capacity of government institutions to deliver quality services was weakened over the period
of intense conflict. However, the staff with which UNICEF communicated on a regular basis were generally
technical staff whose expertise would be considered valuable to a working administration. UNICEF work
plans with government partners were monitored by both parties.
80. All ministries, however, reported intermittent engagement with UNICEF, with periods of intense joint work
and periods of weak or no collaboration. The partnerships with the government contributed to progress
toward the achievement of Country Programme outcomes, as described in the relevance and effectiveness
sections. Some examples of the value of the partnerships are as follows:
by IOM, UNHCR, and UNICEF). While UNICEF received approval to establish the first transitional centre from
DCIM/MOI, it was still awaiting approval from municipalities, despite advocacy efforts including from the United Nations
Humanitarian Coordinator and the EU Ambassador to Libya.

• Partnership with the Ministry of Education resulted in the rollout of the EMIS, teacher training on
Education in Emergencies, and Life Skills / Adolescent Education in partnership with the Arab Institute
of Human Rights
• The sharing of technical knowledge was beneficial, as reported by government stakeholders working
on WASH.
• The active involvement of the NCDC in the extended immunization programme helped to forge
partnerships among the assistance actors, such as UNICEF, WHO and IOM.
• The partnership with the Ministries of Education, Social Affairs and the Interior as well as the HCC
helped in strengthening the technical capacities of the Child Protection Department.
• The government (GNA) adopted a five-year National Action Plan to End All Violence against Children
in Libya. It was endorsed by line ministries and other institutions (namely, Ministry of Social Affairs,
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health,
Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Media and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, High Judicial Institute
and Higher Council for Children). This is an essential step in addressing the significant child protection
gap in Libya. The National Action Plan aims to fight violence against children by supporting the
development of a coordinated and accountable child protection system in Libya, in line with Libya’s
international and regional human rights obligations and best practices.
81. Libyan civil society is recent (the older NGOs were created in 2011) and is aware of its limited capacity.
There is an apparent disconnect between the approach to NGO partners in the emergency response and
in the development component of the UNICEF programme. In the emergency response, partnerships focus
on service delivery. UNICEF, however, made an effort to develop the technical capacities of these partners
through technical training (e.g., on child protection, PSS, child-friendly teaching methodologies, MRE) either
directly carried out by UNICEF or through international NGOs. UNICEF also built the capacity of national
NGOs in contract management and monitoring. National partners, however, expressed the need of a
structured approach to their capacity development that would also include building their capacity for
strategic planning, management and fundraising. The advent of third-party monitoring further reduces the
opportunity for coaching and on the job mentoring by UNICEF. These opportunities were highly valued and
considered an extremely formative practice.
82. In the development component of the programme, capacity development of national NGOs aimed at
developing the capacity for monitoring child rights and building the CRC shadow report. The process was
more structured although still focussing only on technical capacities. INGOs were contracted to deliver
services and support UNICEF with their technical expertise. Examples are the Norwegian Refugee Council
(NRC) with their Non-Formal Education (NFE) package, INTERSOS with setting standards for the Bayti
approach, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to support the setting up of GBV interventions.
However, partnership with international NGOs seemed to suffer from limited joint strategic planning.
83. The INGO Forum further highlighted the need and opportunity for building synergies in a structured
approach to developing capacity within Libyan civil society that would also improve the efficiency of UNICEF
service delivery through partners. As part of the engagement with the private sector, UNICEF teamed up
with a well-recognised retail chain in the field of optics in Libya to carry out comprehensive vision
examinations on more than 30,000 students in schools and other child-centred facilities under the direct
supervision of the National Centre for Disease Control and the School Health Department of MoE. UNICEF
plans to run global campaigns and advocate for Generation Unlimited.64
64 Generation Unlimited (GenU) is a global multi-sector partnership to meet the urgent need for expanded education,
training and employment opportunities for young people, aged 10 to 24, on an unprecedented scale.
25
4.2.4 Human Resources
84. The Country Programme Management Plan (CPMP, 2018) noted the importance of programme expansion.
Reflecting both the deepening humanitarian crisis in Libya and the capacity gaps of the CO, the 2018
budget and human resource structure expanded considerably to ensure adequate technical expertise and
capacity. As a result of capacity gaps, the programme expansion was initially focused on bringing in
international staff. However, due to funding shortfalls and challenges in hiring, at the end of 2020 about a
third of the positions were still vacant. About 80 per cent of staff members were funded through emergency
funding. To address the challenge, the office hired a significant number of temporary staff and consultants.
85. The gaps resulted in significant challenges as, for example, the Chief of Child Protection was acting as
Country Programme Working Group Coordinator, GBV Co-coordinator and PSEA Technical Working Group
Coordinator. GBV expertise was also lacking in the sector. The use of temporary staff and consultants
without full access to UNICEF internal systems limited their efficiency.
86. During the two-year period, the Country Office focused on building national staff capacity to allow for
decreased international presence post-2020, with an objective of reaching a two to one ratio of national to
international staff by the end of the period. This would minimize the access and language challenges in
Libya. However, other significant challenges emerged, include the recruitment constraint that the lists of
potential national staff are provided by the government, which may result in national staff without sufficient
international and UNICEF institutional experience.
87. Another major challenge for efficient programme delivery is that the Country Office is a young office both
in average age and organisational experience within UNICEF. Most staff have not been there for more than
one year. While international staff get relocated, the national staff is expected to provide continuity over
time. This creates an opportunity for capacity building, but several circumstances limit the effectiveness of
face-to-face support and the ability of younger staff to benefit from the experience of more experienced
International Professional staff. For WASH, national staff managing the sector may not be technically
trained or experienced engineers, and strong expertise is needed to help navigate the complex WASH
system in Libya and to provide technical support in coordination with government engineers.
88. There are also limitations to training female staff in Tunisia or other countries because of an unwritten rule
that women cannot leave the country without a chaperone, and training in Tripoli carries security concerns.
Moreover, training and relocation of local staff to Tunisia also poses challenges due to the impossibility of
bringing family members. Thus, women are much less represented in events or training even though in-
person training is valued more by participants than virtual training.
89. Other challenges include uncertainty about location, varying office spaces, and multiple office locations:
Tripoli and the outpost office in Tunis as well as the United Nations Hub in Benghazi. Most implementing
partners are located in Tunisia. This physical “separation” has weakened team cohesion.
4.2.5 Management and Operational Capacities
90. Contracting processes take over six months from the beginning of the negotiation of the proposal to the
signature of the Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCAs) following UNICEF standard procedures for
grant management, posing a challenge for emergency response. Delays in signing PCAs and releasing the
funds have particularly constrained the implementation capacity of national NGOs that rely on UNICEF
funding.
91. Bureaucratic processes and granting procedures created delays and confusion throughout 2019, with
limited improvements in 2020. There were delays in replies, specifically concerning grants, and UNICEF
26
was slow to respond to agreements and signing projects, with some delays likely related to the bureaucracy
in the United States or Jordan MENA office. There is a need to speed up project procedures and to continue
to implement projects, taking into account the conditions of the partners. A main weakness of the
partnership between IPs and UNICEF is the insufficient funds to meet the needs and expectations of the
stakeholders, requiring stronger resource mobilization efforts.
92. The ongoing conflict posed a number of operational challenges. Multiple office locations, costly staff
accommodation arrangements and constant staff movement back and forth between Tunisia and Libya
resulted in much higher than planned operating costs. The factors that impact operating costs for the Libya
Country Office were as follows: (a) the return of International Personnel to Libya significantly increased the
cost of international professional staff as a result of the “E” duty station classification (4 week R&R cycle)
and higher cost of accommodation due to limited security cleared options, and heavier logistical and
administrative resources to adhere security requirements; (b) to ensure effective delivery of the expanded
programs (particularly with regards to education, child protection, health and nutrition, and youth and
adolescents), there was a significant increase in high quality technical staff; and (c) there was an expansion
of the local staff base to support the expanded operation and to build capacity. The heavy investment in
office infrastructure was necessary to support a larger presence in Libya and increased demand on
logistical and administrative support (e.g., visas, travel, security restricted movement). Although the
situation requires flexibility, the decision to push for the closure of the UNICEF Libya office in Tunisia in
2018 was not the best option. Given recent political developments in Libya, more options may be available
in the near future, including relocating at least part of the operation within Libya.
4.2.6 Monitoring Systems
93. To enhance efficiency, the Libya Country Office uses eTools, an online platform that aims to strengthen
management for results. The eTools platform simplifies office processes related to partnership
management and programme monitoring. This helps UNICEF staff focus on achieving results in all
programme contexts.65 UNICEF Libya uses all eTool modules: i) Partnership Management, which serves
as central repository for CSO partnerships; ii) Trip Management, which centralises staff monitoring activities
related to implementing partners; iii) Third-Party Monitoring, which receives and manages data from third-
party monitors; iv) Financial Assurance, which manages engagement activities with external auditors.
checks and micro assessments, and shares progress and auditor reports with UNICEF. Through
Dashboards, eTools brings together cross-cutting data from programmes into a set of analytical tools to
help staff make programme management decisions.
94. In September 2019, Libya became one of the few country offices to launch a Partner Reporting Portal
(PRP)66. The Programme Cooperation Agreements (PCA) are operationalised by signing Programme
Document(s). In the case of a sudden onset or rapid deterioration of a humanitarian crisis, offices use the
Humanitarian Programme Document to fast-track humanitarian response. For countries where eTools is
mandatory, the programme document signed by both parties is managed in the Partnership Management
Portal (PMP). Previously, instead of using a portal, partners sent documents weekly. Now, while there is
still room for improvement, data is less scattered for implementing partners, and quarterly reports are
provided.
95. In the framework of the CPD, to improve national information systems, UNICEF works with the Bureau of
Statistics and Census, line ministries and subnational authorities to implement information management
systems, potentially including innovative technologies that allow for rapid collection of information.
65 http://etoolsinfo.unicef.org/
66 What is the Partner Reporting Portal (PRP)? UNICEF.
27
96. UNICEF use an Information Management System (IMS) with which the Office defines how, when (or how
often), where and by whom: data is collected, validated, stored and protected, reviewed and cleaned,
analysed, where data/ information is reported/visualized, and where information is available to inform
programming. Ultimately, the data will produce the numbers needed for the Logical Framework of any
humanitarian or development programme. The system allows better follow up of programme progress; it
support transparency and accountability, improving ‘management for results’ at all levels.
97. The LCO has decided to use the ActivityInfo software platform to improve data processing by UNICEF
partners. This system directly processing their collected data into the UNICEF main database using specific,
and customized forms. This way, the entire step of combining weekly reports, validating the data and re-
processing it is eliminated. This system was in the development phase in 2020. Partners were kept informed
on the IMS of progress in rolling out the new system in order to ensure their participation and buy-in.67
98. As noted in the CPD, equity-based monitoring of results tracks progress made by UNICEF in addressing
bottlenecks, in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly its pledge to
“leave no one behind”. The Country Programme results and resources framework and monitoring and
evaluation plan serve as the overall framework for disaggregated monitoring of outcomes and will directly
contribute to results under the UNSF. In the CPD, due to insecurity, UNICEF planned to continue using
third-party monitoring to ensure that programmes reached the intended populations of boys and girls in
hard-to-reach locations. Over the programme period, when and where feasible, UNICEF aimed at
increasing the presence of UNICEF staff in programme locations. A total of 140 third-party visits were
undertaken in 2019.
99. Monitoring programme results has been a key concern across the years. Heightened conflict and insecurity
in Libya have long impeded UNICEF staff from undertaking regular field monitoring visits to programmes
implemented by the partners68. Consequently, the Libya Country Office has, since 2016, engaged the
services of third-party monitoring organizations to undertake field monitoring visits on its behalf, ensuring
that programme monitoring is done in line with the HACT framework.
100. The third-party monitoring system has been established with varying degrees of success. In 2017 and 2018,
the field monitoring activities of UNICEF were undertaken by an international NGO. In addition to the cost,
there were, however, numerous problems encountered by both UNICEF and the NGO, including:
• High turnover in the management and staff of the NGO, thus requiring substantive investment in their
capacity development and close follow up and implementation of HACT by UNICEF. This led to an
untenable situation where the monitors were themselves being monitored.
• The international NGO had limited access across Libya (particularly in the East and in conflict-affected
areas) and therefore began subcontracting their monitoring activities to a local NGO - for example in
Benghazi.
• By the end of the PCA, and due to the departure of the latest director, there was poor management of
the NGO, and a clear lack of responsiveness from them.
67 LCO Information Management System – Plans for 2020, Yahia Elrayes, 20 September 2019
68 Third-Party Programme Monitoring for Libya Country Office, Discussion Paper for CMT, 25 February 2020
28
101. To address the above issues, UNICEF changed the modality of third-party programme monitoring
implementation from an NGO to a service provider69 which addressed most of the access issues. However,
the quality of monitoring, both in terms of reporting and capacity of the monitors to understand the essentials
of humanitarian work, remained poor.
102. UNICEF then decided to use a mixed monitoring modality, with a programme team to manage independent
monitors provided by a service provider. This modality retained the monitoring management responsibility
within UNICEF. At the time of the evaluation, UNICEF was about to hire an international consultant
specialized in programme monitoring to support the setting up of the monitoring team, review the existing
monitoring tools, train the CTG consultants and the UNICEF Programme Associate, and provide oversight
of the process for at least one month. This modality should allow UNICEF to make significant savings.
103. With respect to HACT, UNICEF follows the required procedure.70 UNICEF also follows the procedure that
establishes requirements for UNICEF country and regional offices implementing programme interventions
through partnerships with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).71
104. Midyear and annual reviews explored new opportunities and risks to ensure that the programme remains
relevant to the evolving context. The reviews assessed progress in the framework of the humanitarian-
development-peace nexus agenda. A continuous assessment of barriers and bottlenecks further informed
adjustments to programme strategies.
105. Monitoring and accountability mechanisms were implemented to facilitate direct feedback from
beneficiaries, including a youth accountability mechanism (to be developed with UNSMIL and other United
Nations organizations), key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Monitoring results directly
fed into programme learning and strategic realignment of activities and implementation strategies.
4.2.7 Efficiency: Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusion 05: The Libya Country Office is taking steps to improve cost efficiency such as reduction of
multiple office locations and making a greater investment in UNICEF national staff and implementing
partner capacities. The recent developments of the political situation in Libya might allow for relocating at
least part of the operation within Libya, thus contributing to cost efficiency.
Conclusion 06: Operational efficiency was mixed, due to the demanding context of the operations and the
internal administrative requirements of UNICEF. The integrated approach proved to be challenging and
required additional capacities and a redistribution of responsibilities.
69 UNICEF published an invitation to bid and selected ELKA, a Tunisian - Libyan company, through a competitive
bidding process. The contract was worth US$150,000 for 153 programmatic visits, 98 beneficiary feedback and 4 rapid
assessments.

Conclusion 07: The Bayti approach was efficient in reaching the most vulnerable children and could be
further expanded to fully realise integrated services, through strengthening referrals to existing structures
providing health and nutrition services or hosting ad hoc health and nutrition initiatives, e.g., screening,
vaccination.
Conclusion 08: Programme monitoring remained a challenge despite efforts by UNICEF to address third-
party monitoring issues and to follow up by revising implementation arrangements.
Conclusion 09: Advocacy and external communications were efficient approaches to draw attention to
child protection issues and support health and nutrition services
Recommendation 03: Assess whether (a) the Bayti approach can be expanded to integrate health and
nutrition services for migrant women, girls and boys; (b) a similar approach could be used to provide
services to children by MoSA and other relevant ministries; and (c) similar approaches could be taken in
building child hubs in schools.
Recommendation 04: Given recent political developments in Libya, reassess the possibility of relocating
components of the operation within the country. This will mean revisiting the staffing structure, the share of
national and international staff, the type of contracting, and the geographic location of the offices / hubs.
Recommendation 05: Keep track of the lessons learned and emerging good practices from the
implementation of the various third-party monitoring arrangements used by UNICEF in humanitarian
contexts, including in the other countries of the MENA region. Tracking successes and bottlenecks and
following good practices developed elsewhere will increase the efficiency of the Libya Country Office.
Recommendation 06: Continue to advocate on critical child protection issues such as activation of the
monitoring and reporting mechanism on grave violations, alternatives to detention for children in contact
with law (including migrants), alternative care systems for UASC, release and reintegration for CAFAAG –
including regional mechanisms for CAFAAG from abroad.
4.3 Effectiveness
106. UNICEF provided humanitarian assistance during the period evaluated (2019-2020) as well as more limited
development assistance. The following paragraphs present a summary of the progress made in the various
sectors, also mentioning a sampling of the available process indicators.
Overall, the sectoral targets of the humanitarian assistance were broadly achieved. However, they fell
significantly short of the overall needs identified. A more detailed description of the achievements is covered
in the next section (4.4 Connectedness). Evidence generation has been challenging with nine out of 20
planned studies being on track.
4.3.1 Sectoral Results
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
107. Implementation of WASH interventions for the period of 2019 contributed substantially to overall WASH
sector responses as shown in the figure below.72 Although the achievements are significant, many
challenges were difficult to address in the context.
72 Libya Consolidated Emergency Report, 2019, UNICEF March 2020.

Table 1 WASH Sector Response
108. Contributing to the realization of SDG 6 and the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2019, UNICEF
strengthened national WASH systems and provided humanitarian support in response to needs. In support
of service delivery, UNICEF provided water and sewage pumps and supplies, benefiting 48,000 people.
Additionally, UNICEF and partners rehabilitated WASH facilities in three health clinics, benefiting 18,000
persons and reducing the risk of infectious disease. During 2019, UNICEF provided the most vulnerable
children and their families with adequate, safe WASH assistance in Ghat, Sebha, Tripoli, Zintan, Ajdabia
and Benghazi. UNICEF reached a total of 290,582 people with WASH assistance, including the provision
of safe drinking water to 65,371 people against an annual target of 60,000, sanitation services to 184,115
people and hygiene promotion through hygiene kits distribution to 42,696 people (against an annual target
of 30,000).73
109. Targets were surpassed largely as a result of the humanitarian response to displaced and conflict-affected
populations. These interventions contributed significantly to the prevention of waterborne and skin
diseases; for example, no notable disease outbreaks were reported during the period.
110. UNICEF supported timely activities to meet basic WASH needs in Detention Centres and temporary
Collective Centres for internally displaced persons in the Greater Tripoli area. UNICEF rehabilitated WASH
facilities in schools and health centres, contributing to a clean environment and a reduced risk of infectious
diseases. To support system building, UNICEF provided five sewage pumps, five generators for wastewater
treatment plants and eight water pumps (benefiting 48,000 people) in West Libya and Tripoli. Additionally,
UNICEF worked on the first national assessment of water systems in Libya. 74
111. For 2019-2020, UNICEF Outcome Indicator 1.a ‘Proportion of the population using safe drinking water’ and
UNSF results indicator Output 3.2/Indicator 5: ‘Number of people with sustained access to safe drinking
water, through United Nations supported programs’ were targeted at 70 per cent. A UNICEF and
government assessment estimated that a baseline of 65 per cent of the population had access to safe water
through the water network. Through the contribution of UNICEF and other stakeholders to WASH, the
estimate rose to 66.5 per cent of the population by the end of 2019. The Libya REACH Joint Multi-sector
Needs Assessment (October 2019)75 indicated the percentage of households that did not have a sufficient
quantity of drinking water to meet its daily needs at least once over the 30 days prior to data collection (a
73 Country Office Annual Report, 2019; Updated numbers found in the UNICEF Libya Consolidated Emergency Report,

slight change from 20 per cent in 2018 to 30 per cent in 2019 was recorded). The lack of greater progress
may indicate deteriorating access to water due to the conflict, blockading of water flows to the Tripoli area
during the fighting, maintenance issues and system failures. Overall, the limitations on the data in the
conflict context include the possibility of both undercounting and overcounting. 76
Box 3 UNICEF WASH response to the South Libya Ghat floods in 2019
From 28 May till 6 June, 2019, a wave of heavy rainfall and thunderstorms hit the southwestern region of Ghat, causing
flooding and damage in several locations of the region. The floods affected over 20,000 people with over 5,075 people
displaced, many resorting to use of schools for temporary shelter. UNICEF with implementing partners Emdad and
Libyan Society responded with timely assistance to the affected population. The partners helped in providing mobile
water tanks and water vessels for affected families, and promoted good hygiene habits, including clean toilets. With
UNICEF assistance, 3,014 people received safe drinking water and benefited from provision of water treatment tablets
to prevent water-borne diseases. Additionally, in coordination with NCDC, UNICEF conducted fumigation (due to
reports of Leishmaniasis) and a waste cleaning campaign as part of the response to the Ghat flood.
112. Based on planning carried out in 2019, in 2020 UNICEF supported WASH in 24 municipalities through the
Stabilization programme and negotiations with municipal leaders in view of their expressed needs, and in
partnership with the General Company and General Authority. Supplies and equipment provided with
support of UNICEF were mostly imported from Europe, including generators, chlorine, water quality test
kits, and wastewater pumps. The municipalities committed technical budgets for maintenance.
113. UNICEF contributed to an enabling environment for WASH through support for the first National
Assessment of Water Systems in Libya that will serve as an important knowledge base for investment by
the government and partners in water infrastructure development. The assessment was carried out by a
consultancy firm and covered the entire water system and its major components. For both developmental
and humanitarian purposes, this output should contribute significantly to understanding where investment
is most needed to improve the supply of water as well as effective disposal of waste. It will increase
knowledge for all stakeholders of the very complex system of WASH in Libya and should ultimately lead to
improvement in the quality of WASH services.
114. A joint WASH assessment planned for May 2019 did not take place due to contextual issues. However,
UNICEF conducted an assessment in nine Detention Centers (DCs) followed by minor rehabilitation to
WASH services and distribution of hygiene kits and planned pre-positioning of supplies with the
government. In preparation for implementing the “Stabilization” programme77, UNICEF and UNDP verified
needs with targeted municipalities.
Health78
115. As a result of the emerging humanitarian situation, including the conflict in Tripoli and Morzuq and flooding
in Ghat, UNICEF drastically scaled up to provide lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable. Most notably,
76 Updated list of indicators, June 2020
77 In 2018, UNICEF teamed with UNDP and Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) and the Ministry of
Local Governance to implement a “Stabilization” programme (Recovery, Stability, and Socio-economic Development
in Libya, 2018-2021) funded by the EUTF that represents approximately 10 million Euros over 3 years (2018-2021) for
UNICEF out of a total budget of 50 million Euros.

during 2019, UNICEF provided 460,501 children and adults with health care assistance, contributing
significantly to cover health needs.

116. The year 2019 was very productive for the immunization program. UNICEF, in coordination with WHO,
contributed to strengthening the capacity of 700 immunization centres to conduct quality immunization
sessions. An Annual Work Plan was developed with NCDC to strengthen cold chain support and inventory,
to build the capacity of relevant staff, and to conduct awareness raising on the importance of childhood
vaccination and quality assurance. Key achievements for 2019 include strengthening cold chain capacities
in 240 health facilities, building the capacity of 90 vaccine supervisors on vaccine and cold chain
management; and the initiation of a Nationwide Cold Chain inventory to ascertain the current status of the
cold chain system in the country.
117. UNICEF supported capacity development for the immunization programme. The Health Sector Bulletin
December 2019 featured an article on ‘Cold Chain Logistic and Vaccine Management and Routine
Immunization Microplanning Training of Trainers Workshop’ coordinated with NCDC, MoH, UNICEF and
WHO which targeted vaccine supervisors focusing on 90 draft district microplans. The vaccine supervisors
use the D4A application to implement the Cold Chain inventory.
118. Not all trained trainers were able to share their knowledge due to skill and time restrictions. The training
addressed some of the issues but to be more effective will need monitoring capacity at the municipal level
to ensure procedures are followed. The overall effectiveness of the training model relies on post training
mentoring for the trainees. The success of the model also requires access to the health facilities which is
challenging in some areas such as the south, which is among the neediest of geographic areas. The long
distances between facilities in the south is compounded by a shortage in fuel; initially the budget did not
cover the fuel requirements for monitoring and delivery of supplies. The government could not provide
support, so funds had to be obtained from donors.
119. As maintenance of the cold chain equipment (CCE) is critical to the efficacy of the vaccination. The CCE
temperatures at health facilities and subcounty stores are manually tracked and recorded using the Fridge-
tag 2 (FT2), a continuous temperature monitoring logger.79 The tag is not regularly monitored by
supervisors.
79 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927831/
WHO guidelines recommend storing vaccines between 2°C and 8°C at all levels of the cold chain because exposure
to heat or cold outside that range can adversely affect the immunological properties of the vaccines and thus reduce
33
120. Regarding the availability and quality of vaccines, the NCDC oversees their supply, and receives
management support from UNICEF, IOM and WHO. This needs to be coordinated between authorities in
the west and east. A further challenge is the weak capacity to document numbers of children who need or
are receiving vaccinations.
121. In 24 targeted municipalities, UNICEF implements a comprehensive maternal, newborn and child health
care package in selected health facilities. The package includes capacity building, essential supplies, data
management, health promotion and monitoring and WASH in health facilities. Additionally, lifesaving
equipment is being provided to 670 health centres at different levels (nearly 50 per cent of all health centres
in the country), jointly implemented with UNDP and the Italian Cooperation. In partnership with WHO,
UNFPA and IOM (through CERF funding) a primary health care package was provided to 14 health facilities
in the east, west and south (10 Primary Health and 4 Secondary Care General hospitals).
122. Delays in providing inputs were experienced by all partners due to contextual factors; more progress was
made in 2020. A proportion of the health facilities (670 health centres which include hospitals and clinics)
were upgraded according to pressing needs but complete rehabilitation took place only for WASH. For
health centre rehabilitation, it was necessary to go through a bidding process which took time. The health
authorities in Tripoli released the needed supplies, which only recently reached the health facilities.
However, improved coordination between central authorities and municipal health administrators and
district officers is required for accurate reporting and planning.
123. While UNICEF in collaboration with Ministry of Health and the World Food Programme (WFP) planned to
implement the Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) nutrition
survey80 in 2018, the survey could not be conducted due to a lack of a funding commitment from the Ministry
of Health (MoH). Following a concept note of July 2019, UNICEF procured all the required instruments and
anthropometric tools for data collection and signed an agreement with the international NGO
Action Contre la Faim (ACF) to undertake training of Master Trainers. However, thus far, the conflict and
security context has prevented the nationwide survey from taking place.
Nutrition
124. The updated UNICEF nutrition indicators (corresponding UNSF indicators Output 3.2/Indicator 7: Number
of people accessing sufficient and nutritious food, through United Nations supported programs) are found
on the chart below indicating that relatively few children have received basic or emergency nutrition services
compared to potential needs as noted in the background section.81
their potency. The FT2 has a number of documented problems related to users’ lack of knowledge on its use, how to
read and interpret FT2 readings, and how to initiate action in response to temperature excursions.
80 SMART provides a standardized methodology of undertaking surveys to collect information on the two most vital,
public health indicators in assessing the severity of a humanitarian crisis: the nutritional status of children under-five
and the mortality rate of the population. ACF Canada is the global convenor, but the survey would be managed by ACF
Libya.

Table 3 Nutrition Health
125. For nutrition, UNICEF coordinates with NCDC, WFP, IOM and implementing partners. To prevent nutrition-
related morbidity and mortality among children and women, UNICEF provided High Energy Biscuits (HEB),
Micronutrients and Emergency Food Rations and Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), benefiting
11,605 children, pregnant and lactating women in partnership with IOM, UNHCR and MSF, against an
annual target of 11,000. For the 24 targeted municipalities in the Stabilization programme, UNICEF
provided MUAC tapes and distributed supplies for hemoglobin testing. UNICEF did not carry out a Vitamin
A campaign in 2019 for children under two but a campaign was planned for 2020.82
126. Until 2019, the NCDC did not have a nutrition focal point but now the nutrition unit is established with four
professional staff, and nutrition is reportedly becoming more important in the NCDC approach. The
persistent advocacy provided by UNICEF and its support for development of the unit resulted in a staffed
and furnished office space and establishment of a nutrition working group which started up recently and
aims to include partners such as WHO and WFP to link health and food security. Further nutrition indicators
will be included in the DHIS.
127. Implementing partners assist with distribution of HEB and micronutrients and distribute the HEB to detention
centres (DCs) in Zintan, Zawiya, Tripoli, Khoms, Misurata, Sirte, among others. Generally, the HEB are
only distributed to children and women and no distributions are made to men in the DC. The DC get very
poor quality, sometimes only bread and water and the situation has become direr during the COVID-19 as
catering companies are no longer active. The migrants living among Libyan society do not receive food
assistance in the urban areas. The diet of many Libyans lacks protein and micronutrients, leading to anemia
and weak muscle mass, according to unpublished results from NCDC research. Limited access to food
during the crisis may have exacerbated these conditions.
128. The RUTF distribution has no follow-up by health staff which would allow measuring progress in weight
gain among the children targeted and checking whether those children actually received the RUTF. The
RUTF has been used as an emergency life saving measure, however, its use could be monitored if
conditions were conducive for a developmental approach. Distribution of micro-nutrients to pregnant and
lactating women may not have been followed up for effectiveness.
129. As described in the relevance section, the key challenge remains the lack of reliable data on the nutrition
status of children and women. A Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions
82 In infants and children, vitamin A is essential to support rapid growth and to help combat infections. Inadequate
intakes of vitamin A may lead to vitamin A deficiency which can cause visual impairment in the form of night blindness
and may increase the risk of illness and death from childhood infections, including measles and those causing diarrhea.
35
(SMART) Nutrition Survey was planned in Q1 2020 to bridge the data gaps; however, the survey was
postponed due to ongoing conflict and security issues.
130. UNICEF and its RRM partners managed to reach more than 32,000 individuals (6,500 HHs) with an
integrated minimum life-saving package of assistance (Food, NFIs) for internally displaced persons and
migrants affected by the crisis. UNICEF hired a third-party monitoring company to support post-distribution
monitoring; based on reports, UNICEF decided to diversify its package of assistance to include blankets,
baby kits and recreational items for children. This will enable UNICEF to reach more children with a more
inclusive package83.
131. The RRM was bolstered by a newly developed arrangement with UNHCR for a two-year (2020-2021) global
blueprint for joint action. Titled ‘A Fair Deal for Refugee Children’, it focuses on improving the response in
the priority areas of education, WASH and child protection, and represents a contribution to the SDGs in
these specific areas. This blueprint aims to see transformative results and valuable learning achieved in 8-
10 focus countries.
Education and Adolescents and Youth
132. In 2019, UNICEF worked closely with the Ministry of Education and its partners to ensure minimum
disruption to education, this included a catch-up programme to ensure that learners could take part in the
official exams in July 2019, support to MoE in rolling out the exams and a back to learning campaign. The
Back-to-Learning campaign was launched and support was provided to summer school during the conflict
period to provide children with a sense of normalcy while maintaining ongoing work with partners in areas
that were not impacted by the ongoing conflict. To this end, 9,191 Libyan and non-Libyan children and
youth (4,546 boys and 4,645 girls) benefited from non-formal education (catch-up classes and life skills
sessions) and formal education (against an annual target of 64,000). To support non-Libyans’ skill
development, Arabic materials on life skills were translated into both English and French.
133. During 2019, 691 young men and women benefited from Technical Vocational and Education Training and
2,299 young men and women were provided with skill development opportunities, including planning civic
engagement, which was to be rolled out in 2020. 20 schools were rehabilitated, including 10 schools in the
west, 7 schools in the south and 2 schools in the east, benefitting 19,480 children (9,527 boys and 8,953
girls), against a target of 50,000. During this period a total of 954 teachers and education staff were trained
on education packages and EMIS (43 persons), against a target of 600.84

134. Key achievements in 201985 included signing an Annual Work Plan with the Ministry of Education (MoE) for
capacity development of teachers and other education personnel and finalising the development of the
Education Management Information System (EMIS - Phase II). Despite being seriously challenged by
contextual factors in 2019 and 202086, progress towards the Country Programme outcomes was on track
through the end of 202087. Some of the 2019 key targets were not achieved88 (i.e. number of children
accessing formal and non-formal opportunities and children receiving psychosocial and recreational
activities in schools and learning spaces in the school year 2018-2019) due to the outstanding operational
challenges faced by UNICEF and its partners in the implementation of the programme89. Others were
overachieved. In particular, the number of teachers trained was significantly higher than planned, thus
potentially having a positive impact on a higher number of children than originally planned.
135. As part of development of the Education Management Information System (EMIS Phase II), UNICEF trained
43 (11 women and 32 men) education staff from MOE, including the Technical and Vocational Education
Training (TVET) department (west, east, south), on the use of indicators and EMIS in education planning.
Progress was made through engagement with ministerial counterparts in both the east and west, which led
to joint participation of representatives of the two ministries in the EMIS training and in 2020 to joint
participation in the Education Working Group90. The successful joint participation was based on continuous

89 As a result of the spike in conflict in April 2019, the academic school year was suspended one month early in conflict-
affected areas, impacting approximately 122,088 children across nine municipalities. At one point, 21 out of the 47
collective shelters housing displaced persons were schools in Tripoli. In addition, teachers’ massive strike for two weeks
at the beginning of the school year 2019-2020, and further deterioration of the security situation in late 2019 impacted
the capacity of UNICEF and its partners to deliver.

advocacy efforts with stakeholders in Tripoli, Benghazi and with municipal authorities. The EMIS is now
ready to be handed over to the MoE, however, similar to the DHIS, effective use of EMIS for data analysis
and decision making is challenged by weak data entry. (See further discussion below.)
136. Other capacity development support included training of 954 education personnel (355 males and 599
females), including teachers and other education personnel in Education in Emergencies, child centred and
protective pedagogy, psychosocial support, and child safeguarding.
• UNICEF supported the training of 140 education personnel and community member on the Life Skills
Citizenship Education (LSCE) framework, as part of the ongoing work to mainstream LSCE in four
municipalities ‘Towards Resilience and Social Inclusion of Adolescents and Young People in Libya’.
This was the first time that the Life Skills and Citizenship Education Framework for the Middle East and
North Africa was introduced in Libya.
• A training of trainers (TOT) on Education in Emergencies (EiE) was concluded in December 2018 and
during 2019 cascade training for EiE reached 288 teachers across Libya. UNICEF and partners also
trained 13 migrant teachers (9 females and 4 males) in Tripoli on Child Safeguarding, Teachers in Crisis
Context and Basic Literacy and Numeracy to support non-formal education for children on the move. A
total of 9,191 children received formal and non-formal education services and 24,369 children were
reached with school supplies.
137. Light rehabilitation of 20 schools across Libya was completed, despite the challenging environment. This
benefitted 19,480 children (9,527 boys and 8,953 girls) against a target of 50,000.
138. A key success of the education programme was the timely response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March
2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic UNICEF promptly supported the Ministry of Education in
recording and broadcasting more than 400 lessons through various means (i.e. radio, tv and online). This
provided school children with distance education opportunities to learn despite the disruption of education
services.
139. UNICEF work with Adolescents and Youth continued to seek the means to engage them productively and
to reach the most marginalized for the purposes of productive engagement in society and finding a
livelihood, and mitigate risks of the youth being drawn into the conflict. Work with developing platforms and
social media connections faced issues in acceptance by both youth and UNICEF. The movement of
adolescents and youth, and the downsizing of dedicated staff, to be incorporated into the Education section
did not affect the achievement of ongoing work; however, only 10 per cent of requested funds for TVET
were received in 2019 and less than 50 per cent for inclusion and peacebuilding. In 2020, only 15 per cent
was received for TVET and 22 per cent for inclusion and peacebuilding, in comparison to a large education
budget.
140. As a result of the upsurge of conflict in April 2019, the academic school year was suspended one month
early in conflict-affected areas, impacting approximately 122,088 children across nine municipalities. At one
point, 21 out of the 47 collective shelters housing internally displaced persons were schools in Tripoli.
UNICEF rolled out summer school classes to support 927 children (437 boys and 490 girls), including 372
displaced children, to make up missed schooling and enable children and youth to pass the end of year
exams, held in July 2019. UNICEF provided support to the MoE to print exams and provide necessary
materials. Additionally, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, UNICEF launched the ‘Back to
Learning’ Campaign to ensure that schools across Libya had the necessary learning materials: 13,340
children were reached with supply distribution. UNICEF and its implementing partners provided non-formal
education sessions through mobile team and community centres.
38
141. A number of assessments and consultations took place on the situation of adolescents and youth, reflecting
their importance in the development and future of the Libyan society. Among them are the ‘Libyan Youth
Today: Challenges and Opportunities’91 and a national consultation92. UNICEF conducted a draft Violence
Against Children (VAC) study (unpublished, 2017). These reports underpinned and contributed to the pilot
project ‘Towards Resilience and Social Inclusion of Adolescents and Young People in Libya’, funded in four
municipalities by the EU from 2017-2019. The project also drew upon an ‘Adolescent Vulnerability
Assessment: A framework for Measurement and Priority Setting for UNICEF Libya’93 which describes the
target age groups and the developmental issues of each. The pilot project has not been replicated since,
but the “Stabilization” programme addressed issues affecting Adolescents and Youth in targeted
municipalities.94
Child Protection
142. UNICEF made substantial progress in ensuring that girls and boys in Libya were better protected from
violence, abuse and exploitation. Overall, the progress of the child protection programme toward the
Country Programme outcomes was on track95 and as of June 2020 the Country Programme output
indicators were largely or fully achieved. In 2019, the child protection in emergency response significantly
scaled up to respond to the escalating conflict in April and August. This resulted in most of the targets being
exceeded as per the figure below96.

Table 5 Child Protection Response
143. Key achievements in 201997 included the long-awaited adoption of a five-year National Action Plan to End
All Violence against Children in Libya 2020-2025 (VAC NAP) by the Libyan government, an essential step
in addressing the significant child protection gap in Libya. The National Action Plan aims to address violence
against children by supporting the develop of a coordinated and accountable child protection system in
Libya, in line with Libya’s international and regional human rights obligations and best practices.
144. The system support component of the child protection programme, although substantially on track, suffered
from the escalating conflict in April and August 2019 and from the increasingly complex institutional
environment. This led to delays in the adoption of the VAC NAP and consequent delays in the C4D
programming for behaviour change. An increasingly complex operating environment also delayed the
Justice for Children component. Establishment of transitional centres for migrant children approved by
DCIM/MOI was not endorsed by municipalities, despite advocacy efforts from the United Nations
Humanitarian Coordinator and the EU Ambassador to Libya. The development of the Justice for Children
Information Management System was also delayed.
145. Within the framework of the National Action plan to End Violence against Children, in consultation with the
Ministry of Interior, UNICEF finalized the Annual Work Plan on justice for children, including an Assessment
to identify gaps in the justice system, and a mapping and assessment exercise of Family and Child
Protection Units in Libya. The Family and Child Protection Units are central to the realization of the National
Action plan, with the objective of establishing a central community-based body that acts as a one-stop shop
for child-friendly justice and support services for children in contact with the law.
146. In 2019, UNICEF and its partners provided 89,270 children (44,608 boys and 44,662 girls) with community
and school based psychosocial support. 7,808 vulnerable children (3,508 boys, 4,300 girls), including
internally displaced persons, returnees and conflict-affected children well as migrant and refugee boys and
girls were provided with critical protection and GBV specialized protection services in targeted municipalities
(including Tripoli, Benghazi, Sebha and Zintan). Another 81 children (18 girls, 63 boys) in Al Zintan center
(from the same caseload of children and adolescent released from armed groups in 2017) against an annual

target of 180; 499 children (301 boys and 198 girls) were referred to specialized services to prevent and
respond to issues associated with recruitment into armed groups and other grave violations.
147. Ten Bayti centres and community centres were established across Libya to provide vulnerable children with
child protection services, including case management, psychosocial support (including for gender-based
violence) and life skills, as well as non-formal education and health services. The centres have also
enhanced access to services for migrants, refugees and IDP’s in urban settings.
148. To respond to the escalating violence, UNICEF scaled up the programme in Misrata and Tawergha to
support survivors of GBV. UNICEF also worked with partners to develop a coordinated, inter-sector GBV
case management system (including building the capacity of relevant service providers) and to roll out GBV
IMS. Awareness raising and behaviour change on key child protection risks and GBV reached up to 22,917
individuals, including children (7,083 boys and 8,112 girls), parents and community members.
149. Support to children associated with armed forces or armed groups (CAFAAG) suffered a setback due to a)
increased armed conflict decreased the interest in release of children and youth from armed groups and
increased recruitment also from abroad; b) CAFAAG were not included in the strategic focus of key donors
such as EU and Canada despite advocacy and submitting four proposals to different donors UNICEF did
not succeed to pursue its CAFAAG strategy and continue the CAFAAG intervention ongoing since 2018.
150. Technical capacity development of child protection actors has also seen considerable investments, with
862 child protection service providers (274 men and 588 women) reached with capacity development,
including government, local partners and child rights actors. To support the State and Shadow Reporting
process on child rights, 118 members of civil society, child rights activities and the government were
reached though 4 workshops on Child Rights.
151. UNICEF has also advanced in strengthening national systems for monitoring, reporting and responding to
violations of children's rights. This included:
• Establishing an informal Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) system: through the informal
MRM system, UNICEF was able to monitor, report and verify cases of grave violations (more than 100
cases reported and 55 cases verified) and contribute to quarterly Global Horizontal Notes and key
annual reports. Cases were also referred through UNICEF and UNSMIL for assistance.
• Establishing a Child Rights network, composed of child rights experts, civil society organizations, active
working groups and other partners established, on the base of the “Mapping of Libyan Civil Society
Organizations working in the field of Human Rights and Children Rights: Challenges and Needs”98.
• Capacity development for field monitors of UNSMIL on reporting of grave violations and developing
capacity-building modules for staff and partners as well as key ‘neutral’ entities who could contribute to
documenting grave child rights violations and providing response services to child victims.
• Continued advocacy at national, regional and the HQ levels, calling on all parties to abide by
International Humanitarian Law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its protocols. For
this purpose, UNICEF made contributions to statements at the Human Rights Council. During 2019,
UNICEF carried out four trainings on promoting child rights and grave violations against children with
civil society organization, child rights monitors and governments representatives. The workshops
supported the drafting of the State Party report and Shadow report to the CRC.

Children Rights: Challenges and Needs” 2019

• Research on Children Associated with Armed Groups in Libya, including both a literature review and
primary data collection was undertaken and will help to provide key information on the prevalence of
children’s association with armed groups, and on drivers / risk factors associated with involvement in
armed groups.
152. To mitigate the risks and vulnerabilities arising from the conflict, UNICEF began emergency Explosive
Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) for children, adolescents and caregivers in Tripoli and Tawargha in 2019,
reaching out to internally displaced children and their caregivers in collective centres and shelters, child
friendly spaces and Bayti centres, as well as schools, universities, clinics and other public gathering spaces.
This was done in close co-operation with the Libyan Mine Action Centre (LibMac), in partnership with Free
Fields Foundation (3F), and in collaboration with grassroots organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Girl
Guides Association and the Libya Red Crescent (LRC). Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE)
appropriate for children was provided for 15,062 [7,812 children (4,182 boys, 3,630 girls) and 7,250 adults
(4,656 men, 2,564 women) conflict-affected individuals. Additionally, 10,000 IEC materials have been
handed over to LibMAC for dissemination; 55 staff were trained and accredited to undertake EORE for
children and communities. Key MRE messages have been integrated in the RRM targeting 200 displaced
households from Murzuq in Tripoli. Finally, an MRE/EORE radio spot has been produced and broadcasted
by two local Radio channels to encourage citizens to report UXOs and ERW, reaching an estimated
245,000 indirect beneficiaries (125,000 males, 120,000 females).
Social Policy
153. The Social Policy strategic area was planned to cover (a) learning and evidence on childhood poverty,
vulnerability, public finance and social protection is generated to inform child-centred social sector policies
and budgets; (b) basic service providers at the national and subnational level have increased capacity to
develop and prioritize equity-focused, evidence-based policies and budgets and are better able to respond
to emergencies; as well as cross-sectoral programme components. Due to the upsurge of conflict in 2019
and the challenges in working with government to develop policies and budgets, focus on this area was put
on hold and intensive work began more recently with hiring of a regional consultant.
4.3.2 COVID-19
154. UNICEF adapted its implementation modalities to the COVID-19 pandemic. Modalities of work for the
service delivery component of the programme were promptly adjusted to limit the risk of transmission. An
example was development of Whatsapp groups and networks to continue with child protection and PSS
activities and establish prevention measure in the Bayti centres. An overriding concern was the inherent
capacity of government partners to promote behaviour change communications independently. For
example, the NCDC lacks sufficient experience and relies on UNICEF as the lead agency for overall
communications support. There is a need for a national health awareness campaign, and also support for
development of the National COVID-19 Response Plan. In addition, taking the lead in assisting NCDC on
COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), UNICEF delivered COVID-19
communications such as posters, billboards, and videos. UNICEF also supported the MoE to develop a
COVID-19 response plan, recording over 400 lessons, and broadcasting on TV or through the web, to
ensure maximum coverage.
4.3.3 Challenges and Enabling Factors
155. The achievement of the Country Programme outputs in both 2019 and 2020 was affected by limited access
due to conflict and insecurity, Libya’s institutional fragmentation and limited capacity, policies and strategies
of national systems and challenges related to staffing. An example is the gradual decay of the water and
42
sanitation system in Libya that led to additional humanitarian needs and affected the health and education
sectors.
Box 4 Water and sanitation system in Libya
The water and sanitation system in Libya has been neglected since 2009 in terms of upgrading the technology, both
for improving service coverage and for environmental protection. A shortage of engineering capacity, due to previous
reliance on international technical and financial investments, were curtailed by increasing conflict and uncertainties.
Since 2009, the inputs from the government have mainly been for maintenance and trying to prop up the system.
From a developmental perspective, bringing the system up to high standards requires investment of substantial
amounts of funds. From a humanitarian perspective, the decay of the system over time has contributed to greater
humanitarian needs. Further complexities occurred from damages, some purposely inflicted in periods of conflict, as
well as closures linked to the conflict and aimed at increasing pressure on local communities across political and
conflict lines. UNICEF has advocated with the WASH system stakeholders in the government to draw attention to
needs for investment in replacing the obsolete systems; however, this is a sensitive topic at present when the focus
is on the issues surrounding the conflict.
156. The COVID-19 pandemic restricted a number of factors critical to implementing the Country Programme.
These are generally centred around access to beneficiaries and support systems, as detailed in the May
2020 Humanitarian Access report.99 The report mentions over 1,000 access constraints half of which deal
with the health and protection sectors.
157. UNICEF continues to work with the government to build a foundation of evidence to allow for evidence-
based policy making and programming and thus improved service delivery, with a focus on the development
of sustainable information management systems and the situation of the most vulnerable. During 2019,
UNICEF continued to prioritize both direct evidence generation and strengthening national institutions and
mechanisms for evidence generation. The five national information systems rollouts (including EMIS, DHIS,
and J4C IMS) were delayed due to an underestimation of the challenges. These include the general lack
of familiarity with electronic data systems, power outages and network connection challenges. The utility of
the systems was not explained clearly enough for all stakeholders to support the rollout of the systems.
This had an effect on the ability of the Country Office to generate evidence for children.
158. Insufficient coordination and limited internal technical capacity constrained the leadership provided by
UNICEF for Child Protection, which may have reduced the ability to influence the national agenda. The
variety of partners as well as the sensitivity of key child protection issues (e.g., GBV, CAFAAG, MRM)
requires dedicated in-house capacity to fully exert leadership. This was compounded by lack of dedicated
coordination capacity with international NGOs co-leading the working groups. This lack of capacity affected
the ability to advocate and raise funds.
159. UNICEF support for sector coordination and working groups enabled the delivery of better results for
children. UNICEF invested in strengthening its leadership role in the education sector working group
through leading on developing a Joint Education Needs Assessment (JENA) together with the Global
Education Cluster. UNICEF provided a full-time WASH sector coordinator. In April 2020, the final strategy
of the WASH sector (April to December) was unanimously endorsed by sector partners for Covid-19 and
two areas to be supported by sector partners under the overall Health Response plan100. UNICEF continued
to lead the Child Protection Working Group, the Inter-Sector Case Management Task Force and co-lead
with UNFPA Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Working Group. This enabled UNICEF to roll out the GBV IMS
more easily and coordinate with UNHCR and IOM on the refugee and migrant response and UNDP and

UNODC on the Justice for Children Programme. UNICEF works closely with the UNSMIL team on the MRM
file and reporting to SRG Children and Armed Conflict. UNICEF also leads the PSEA Task Force within the
HCT. In the context of the Education Working Group – UNICEF participated in the Joint Education Needs
Assessment 2019)101 and a Secondary Data Review (SDR)102 in October 2019.
160. Partnering with local authorities in municipalities enabled the delivery of services at the local level. National
NGOs were essential partners to implement both developmental and humanitarian outputs and to access
beneficiaries through their networks and local knowledge, dealing with challenges in delivery of supplies,
for example, sometimes facing difficulties in passing checkpoints. Many have agreements with a number
of assistance providers for delivery of services including UNHCR, IOM and WFP and international NGOs.
However, implementing partners are impacted by delays in agreements that threaten their ability to maintain
skilled and trained staff. They would benefit from more visibility leading to the ability to continue operating
in the longer term.
4.3.4 Unintended Effects
161. There is no specific evidence of unintended effects.
4.3.5 Gender, Inclusion, Equity
162. Gender was not fully mainstreamed in the delivery of the Country Programme and there is limited evidence
that interventions were designed considering the different needs of boys and girls. The Country Office did
generate some gender disaggregated indicators but not in a consistent manner across the sectors, although
positive examples in the implementation of the programme do exist. In education, boys and girls participated
equally in programming; in WASH, toilets for males and females were separated; the distribution of HEB
favoured women and children.
163. Although UNICEF attempts to disaggregate vulnerable groups in programme reporting, the proportion of
marginalized children (e.g., migrants, internally displaced persons, refugees, conflict-affected, children with
disabilities, children serving in armed groups, minorities, the poorest of the poor, out-of-school children) in
relation to needs may not be disaggregated making it difficult to analyse how different groups have
benefitted. Despite that, there are clear signs that some of the most vulnerable need further attention as,
for example, children of detained or imprisoned women, children associated with armed forces and armed
groups (CAFAAG), marginalized adolescents and youth, children with disabilities and preschool children.
164. There are some documented unmet needs such as access to formal education for migrants, including the
negotiation of their schooling requirements in Libya, and acknowledgement of their qualifications from past
schooling.103 The 2019 conflict resulted in increased needs for nearly 65,000 people who had to flee their
houses in the southern area of Tripoli. Among them, families who preferred to stay with their relatives, rather
than be sheltered with others in schools or other facilities, were less likely to receive assistance.
165. The focus of service delivery on 24 municipalities excludes other areas of the country. However, the needs
of some groups, such as internally displaced persons hosted in schools in Misurata and non-displaced
families who suffer sub-standard living conditions exceed the capacity of humanitarian assistance.

166. To provide Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA)104, UNICEF held full accountability
through training for all staff members, and training for ten Bayti centres, national focal points as well as
Protection, Education and Emergency partners. The GBV services programme through UNICEF partners
is currently supporting a number of municipalities in east and west of Libya (e.g., Mistrata, Tawergha,
greater Tripoli, Benghazi, Sebha). As part of the HCT, UNICEF leads the PSEA Task Force and all network
members finalized a checklist to ensure compliance with PSEA standards. Steps yet to be taken include
development of the PSEA SOPs, capacity building for case management, and mobilizing resources for a
dedicated PSEA hotline. The full rollout of the PSEA framework faces challenges such as government
procedures not being in place, limited resources, community hesitancy to report cases and weak
investigation capacities among national partners. The evaluation did not find evidence of PSEA being
addressed in third-party monitoring.
4.3.6 Effectiveness: Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusion 10: The Country Programme made progress toward planned outcomes in all the strategic
areas and improved the quality and supply of services. Conflict and insecurity were the main factors
affecting delivery of planned outputs. These also affected the capacity of national systems. UNICEF
targeted marginalized groups but experienced challenges in reaching them; those requiring more attention
include children of detained or imprisoned women, children associated with armed forces and armed groups
(CAFAAG), marginalized adolescents and youth, children with disabilities and preschool children.
Conclusion 11: As WASH is intrinsic to all other basic services, the importance of rehabilitating the
dilapidated system takes high priority; UNICEF should use its convening power and technical capacity to
support a coordination platform for government and other stakeholders. Health system inputs have been
strong and well-coordinated with partners. The immunization training requires follow up at the municipal
level to ensure compliance.
Conclusion 12: Significant achievements were made in training teachers and other education staff.
However, some planned education results were not fully achieved due to deterioration of the education
system and impeded access in conflict-affected areas. The COVID-19 response related to education was
timely and produced positive impacts for children. The inputs for work with adolescents and youth do not
sufficiently reflect the importance of their role in the development and future of Libyan society and should
be strengthened in order to engage them productively and mitigate risks of the youth being drawn into the
conflict.
Conclusion 13: UNICEF made substantial progress in ensuring that girls and boys in Libya were better
protected from violence, abuse and exploitation through strengthening national systems for response and
including training on explosive ordnance risk, and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse. However,
UNICEF globally, regionally and nationally has not exerted sufficient influence to coordinate stakeholders
to urge adequate funding and greater joint advocacy on difficult protection issues.
104 UNICEF is committed to ensuring that all children and adults are protected from sexual exploitation and abuse
across all of UNICEF programming. Every UNICEF office contributes to achieving the above benchmarks by embracing
a whole-of office approach, including through: the development of a Country Office Action Plan under the leadership of
senior management with contributions by Human Resources, Ethics, Operations and all Programme sectors; the
designation of a PSEA Focal Point within each CO, including field offices; the mandatory completion of PSEA training
for all UNICEF personnel and partners; and the active contribution to an inter-agency approach under the leadership
of the Humanitarian Coordinator (Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action – revised draft 15th of May
2020)
45
Conclusion 14: Gender is not well integrated in the programme. Knowledge about potentially marginalized
groups is weak and programming for them is challenging.
Conclusion 15: The development of information management systems (e.g., the DHIS and the EMIS)
experienced significant challenges, in terms of capacity of staff and support systems.
Recommendation 07: Strengthen technical support and advocacy for coordination and investment of the
government’s own funds in WASH system rehabilitation.
Recommendation 08: Ensure that reliable data are available for programming in health, education,
nutrition and protection. The challenges experienced to implement studies and to roll out information
systems will need to be analysed to identify and avoid bottlenecks.
Recommendation 09: Clearly identify the gaps in the current immunization programme and develop a plan
to strategically address these in the follow up programme. Aim to expand immunization to migrant
populations.
Recommendation 10: Develop a coherent UNICEF Libya strategy for adolescents and youth and advocate
for a national youth strategy.
4.4 Connectedness
167. Connectedness is concerned with the implications of humanitarian programming for development. It refers
to the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP)105
definition of this criteria: “the extent to which activities of a short-term emergency nature are carried out in
a context that takes longer-term and interconnected problems into account”. This criterion replaces the
sustainability criterion used in development evaluations.106
168. In UNICEF, this is manifested in the nexus approach and demands that the capacity of national institutions
to fulfil their core human rights obligations be given priority as part of a process to strengthen national
systems, capacity and infrastructure. The nexus approach aims to reduce conflict drivers while enhancing
resilience.107 As per the CRC (1989), UNICEF is required to work in the nexus. UNICEF set out institutional
commitments to humanitarian-development programming in the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and several
policy documents including a ‘Procedure on linking humanitarian and development programming’ (UNICEF,
2019) and an ‘Update on UNICEF humanitarian action’ (UNICEF, 2019).108
169. The United Nations system and UNICEF in the UNSF state three outcome objectives: (a) core government
functions will be strengthened and Libyan institutions and Civil Society, at all levels, will be better able to
respond to the needs of the people; (b) economic recovery in Libya will be initiated thanks to better Public
Financial Management (PFM) and economic, financial and monetary policies that will stimulate investment,
private sector development and job creation; and (c) relevant Libyan institutions improve their capacity to
design, develop and implement public and social policies that focus on quality social services delivery for

all women and girls, men and boys (including vulnerable groups, migrants and refugees). These are not
directly related to the nexus approach or good connectedness of humanitarian and developmental actions.
170. The 2019 HRP outlines the following two strategic objectives: (a) provide and improve safe and dignified
access to essential goods and critical public services in synergy with sustainable development assistance;
and (b) enhance protection and promote adherence to International Humanitarian Law, International
Human Rights Law, and International Refugee Law. The first objective hints at an integration of
humanitarian and developmental activities. There is more explicit mentioning of the nexus in the 2020 HRP
which states that priorities for the migrant and refugee response in 2020 will focus on: i) the provision of
life-saving and protection assistance, including through coordinated advocacy for and response to the
release of detained migrants and refugees from detention centres; ii) support to local authorities and
partners to respond to the needs of migrants and refugees through capacity-building, strengthening of
partnerships and coordination; and iii) strengthening the humanitarian action, broader migration
management, development, and peace nexus.109 The second and third priority, in particular, will improve
the connection between humanitarian and developmental activities.
171. The UNICEF Libya Country Programme Document 2019-2020 gives almost no references to the nexus
framework and the UNICEF HAC 2019 does not mention the nexus at all. The 2020 HAC appeal notes the
importance of reinforcing the linkages between humanitarian and development programming, through
prioritizing coordination and capacity building for partners, including local authorities.
172. Issues of access and governance affect the ability to deliver supplies and services through partners in
Libya. However, the choice not to extend the engagement with NGOs to address their capacity in a more
strategic level misses the opportunity to build civil society capacity during the humanitarian crisis as
discussed above under efficiency. These is also a missed opportunity for joint advocacy to donors for
funding dedicated resources for coordination and development of a joint civil society capacity development
strategy to support national NGOs.
173. The most relevant contribution to connectedness is through the “Stabilization” programme with a focus on
working directly with local authorities while still involving central authorities. This includes:
• Rehabilitation of WASH facilities in 10 schools and 10 health centres;
• Provision of education activities and education facilities
• Centre based specialized child protection and psychosocial support services to children
• Youth response.
174. The newly developed arrangement with UNHCR for a two-year (2020-2021) global blueprint for joint action,
titled ‘A Fair Deal for Refugee Children’, focuses on improving the response in the priority areas of
education, WASH and child protection, and represents a contribution to the SDGs in these specific areas.
This blueprint aims to see transformative results and valuable learning achieved in between eight and ten
focus countries – Libya included- and seeks to bridge the humanitarian-development nexus by working to
strengthen national systems to be inclusive of refugee children and their families. The inclusion of millions
of refugee children in the areas of education, WASH and child protection will be underpinned by efforts to
strengthen these national systems and a renewed focus to advocate for refugee’s full social and economic
inclusion in national policy and plans. The blueprint builds on the comparative advantage of each of the two
organisations.
175. Stakeholders at many levels have recognized disconnects between the humanitarian and the
developmental programmes. To address this, the United Nations Programme Management Team led the
109 Humanitarian Response Plan for Libya, February 2020
47
process to agree on a strategic nexus approach for Sabha as well as on the identification of collective
outcomes to be achieved by 2023. For example, the health sector coordination mechanism has recognized
the need to strengthen the nexus by moving toward the ‘humanitarian’ and ‘development’ priorities being
equally addressed and funded in health since funding is generally structured to support short-term
interventions, through pushing from a pure emergency to a more strategic rehabilitation/development
logic.110 Recent political developments in the country offer the opportunity for the United Nations Country
Team and UNICEF to reconsider connectedness between humanitarian and development priorities and
develop appropriate strategies.
4.4.1 Connectedness: Conclusions and Recommendations
176. Conclusion 16: While UNICEF at the global level has a strong commitment to connect humanitarian and
developmental actions, at the country level this connection is still in a nascent state, both for the United
Nations team and UNICEF, except for coordinating the “Stabilization” programme interventions with
municipalities and the global blueprint with the UNHCR ‘A fair deal with children’.
177. Conclusion 17: Recent political developments in the country present an opportunity to strengthen the
nexus approach within the UNICEF programme; for example, the VAC NAP offers a framework to link
emergency child protection response to longer-term objectives.
178. Recommendation 11: UNICEF should use the nexus approach more systematically to ensure
humanitarian responses build the capacity of partners to deliver services in humanitarian and
developmental contexts. The CPD and the HAC should be consistent in approach and be developed to
mutually re-enforcing.

Box 5 National Action Plan to Prevent and Respond to Violence Against Children in Libya 2020-2025
In 2019, UNICEF worked alongside with the Libyan Government (GNA), to develop a National Action Plan to Prevent
and Respond to Violence Against
Children in Libya 2020-2025 (VAC
NAP). A series of workshops and
consultations led to the
formulation of a theory of change
on Violence Against Children in
Libya. On that basis, a National
Action Plan was developed,
including key relevant line
ministries and institutions. The
VAC NAP contains six outputs
and 25 activities/strategies
designed to achieve the intended
outcome “to prevent all forms of
violence against girls and boys in
all settings in Libya (i.e., in the
home, education settings,
institutional settings and
community) and to rehabilitate
victims of VAC into the
community, by 2025.”
As a result of this process
UNICEF has signed annual work
plans with the Ministry of Interior,
to assess and expand the Family and Child Protection Units, the Ministry of Social Affairs for capacity development for
social workers and strengthen case management; with the Ministry of Education to mainstream Psychosocial Support
and Child Protection in schools, and with the Higher Council for Children.
4.5 Comparative Advantage and Strategic Positioning
179. Some of the likely UNICEF Libya comparative advantages emerge from the above sections. UNICEF Libya
has worked with many stakeholders at almost all levels. With central government authorities, it has agreed
workplans and engaged on supplementing evidence and developing strategies at national level. With
municipalities it has implemented practical programmes across the nexus to provide services for host
communities and refugees. It has established solid partnerships with international and national NGOs.
UNICEF Libya is well embedded in the United Nations country team and contributes to the development of
humanitarian assistance and development assistance while leading coordination in the WASH, Nutrition
and Education sectors and Child Protection Area of Responsibility within the Protection sector.
180. UNICEF, as a global organization, has more developed systems and theories to connect humanitarian
assistance with its developmental activities through its nexus approach. However, only recently the Libya
Country Office moved towards implementing the nexus. In particular, the “Stabilization” programme has
created an integrated approach to service delivery that could be expanded to other areas and to municipal
service provision.
181. UNICEF is a child rights organization and can advocate for child rights with authority. In Libya, the Country
Office has used this moderately and focussed instead on affecting positive changes for children through
direct implementation, evidence generation for authorities and strategic assistance.
49
182. The comparative advantage of UNICEF has not been fully used to build and leverage synergies among
different stakeholders (ministries and civil society for example) and with donors and UNSMIL (for example
on CAFAAG and MRM), especially on critical child protection issues. The lack of a distinctive child
protection advocacy strategy - ranging from communication with communities, community mobilisation and
participation, to persuasion of governments and donors, synergetic engagement with civil society and
international denunciation - illustrates the limited UNICEF investment on leadership.
183. Given that the government is unlikely to be able to provide reliable services for citizens and refugees in the
next years, the nexus approach will be of particular importance and UNICEF, having good relations with
most stakeholders, will be in a position to play a key role in the next strategic framework. The role that
UNICEF can play towards strengthening civil society capacities should be considered as well.
184. With regards to human rights advocacy, UNICEF will need to reflect on the appropriate balance between
being very vocal about child rights and working more collaboratively with all stakeholders and advocating
from within the system.
4.5.1 Comparative Advantage and Strategic Positioning: Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusion 18: The UNICEF Libya Country Office has collaborated effectively with diverse stakeholders.
The evaluation identified missed opportunities to lead on child rights agendas, with donors and as cluster
lead agency.
Recommendation 12: UNICEF Libya should provide leadership on the child rights agenda with Libyan
authorities and with donors and other international stakeholders.
Recommendation 13: UNICEF Libya should have an internal dialogue to determine how best to support
civil society capacity building and child rights.

5. Lessons Learned
185. This section highlights what appear to be the most important overall lessons for UNICEF in Libya, which
are also lessons that UNICEF institutionally might learn from contexts that share similar features. Three
main lessons learned emerged from the evaluation:
186. Evidence generation: Evidence generation was a pillar of the Country Programme. The five national
information systems rollouts (including EMIS, DHIS, and J4CIMS) were delayed because challenges were
greater than anticipated. These included the general lack of familiarity with electronic data systems, power
outages and network connection challenges. In addition, the utility of the systems was not explained clearly
enough to all stakeholders to support rollout. This affected the ability of UNICEF to generate evidence for
children.
187. In the critical effort to generate evidence, collect data and improve data quality, the following elements need
to be ensured to secure the investments in the systems: (i) the capacity of community facilities to collect,
process, and disseminate data, (ii) access to electricity, data entry equipment and supplies, as well as to
the internet, (iii) trained staff and oversight on data integrity and skill usage by supervisors.
188. Third-party monitoring: In a context where access is seriously constrained, monitoring programmatic
results is a key challenge. The Country Office put considerable efforts into establishing monitoring systems
that respond to such challenge, testing out various modalities of third-party monitoring arrangements (i.e.,
through NGOs, through service providers, and mixed modality). For third-party monitoring to be effective,
monitors need to have a solid understanding of the nature of UNICEF programming and of humanitarian
work and good reporting capacity.
189. As third-party monitoring is increasingly used by UNICEF in humanitarian contexts, including in the MENA
region, it will be important to share what works and what aspects prove difficult in establishing TPM systems
in Libya. This will contribute to distilling good practices within the organisation, developing guidance and
building tools to establish TPM systems in other countries. Sector-specific training and standard
requirements for adhering to humanitarian principles (including PSEA) should be included.
190. Equity: Planning by UNICEF demonstrated strong use of available assessment data. However, an updated
gender assessment and analysis involving all programmatic areas and partners was needed to support
programming and inform on ever-changing group and location-specific gender dynamics. The adolescents
and youth focus in Libya is clearly highlighted vis-à-vis their vulnerabilities, but the emphasis on addressing
their needs was diluted as a cross-cutting strategy among staff and partners, with no national strategy. It
achieved a limited reach and requires more generous funding and stronger feedback regarding activities
targeting them in the communities.
191. Cross-sectoral programming is more likely to succeed when staff and partners coordinate effectively to plan
and utilize equity focussed assessments, to secure investment of time and funds, and to strengthen
coordinated support for vulnerable groups, ensuring that key needs are considered across the sectors. This
lesson is particularly relevant for humanitarian action to serve the most vulnerable and where a large
percentage of the population is composed of adolescents and youth.

Annex 4: Additional Information on the Evaluation Approach and
Methodology
Given the strategic nature of this evaluation, its focus is not on evaluating activities, but rather on evaluating
outcomes and outputs specified in the Programme Strategy Notes. The ToCs for the five strategic areas
were used as part of the analysis, particularly of the effectiveness criterion. The team assessed the ToCs
in terms of their assumptions and hypotheses and UNICEF contributions to result; it also considered the
need for updated ToCs.
The evaluation identified the contribution of UNICEF to the changes in relation to the humanitarian
development nexus in the CPD, largely through planned and implemented outputs leading to outcomes that
can be attributed to UNICEF. The evaluation also identified specific interventions which may have
contributed to any observable change.
The evaluation was carried out through a combination of participatory techniques, such as virtual key
informant interviews, an online survey directed to UNICEF staff and partners, virtual briefings, and joint
reviews of the inception and evaluation reports. In the inception stage, participation and utilization focus
were ensured through discussions with the MENA Regional Office Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor and
the country office staff (e.g., the Special Representative, the Deputy Representative, the Monitoring and
Evaluation Specialist, the chiefs of sections such as Child Development and Survival, Education, and Child
Protection) on their expectations and the potential future uses of the evaluation findings. The Evaluation
Steering Committee members participated through briefing and debriefing workshops, and some of them
have served as key informants.
In the data collection phase, the evaluation involved the participation of UNICEF staff, implementing
partners and stakeholders, such as government and local institutions, other United Nations agencies, civil
society, NGOs, donors, and other development partners, within the limits of time constraints and the remote
modality of the evaluation. The participatory approach took into consideration the views of secondary duty-
bearers in contributing to protecting and promoting children’s rights. It included discussion of past
experiences as well as ideas for the future. Time considerations prevented the collection of information
from groups of final beneficiaries / rights-holders (children and women).
In the analysis and reporting phase, feedback on the evaluation report was obtained from stakeholders
through discussions following the presentation of preliminary findings during the evaluation debrief held
virtually, and through the dissemination of the draft report, as appropriate.
The evaluation paid particular attention to: i) a disaggregated assessment of programme results; ii) an
analysis of Libya Country Office strategies and interventions to address the structural causes of inequities
and disparities across various groups; iii) an understanding of how programmatic outcomes addressed the
shortfalls and disparities in accelerating progress towards the fulfilment of children’s rights.
The evaluation assessed to what extent an equity focus was included by UNICEF in the design and
implementation of the Country Programme as a way to understand and address the root causes of inequity,
and to inform the provision of access to education, health care, protection and social inclusion services.
The equity perspective considers worst-off groups, such as refugee and migrant children, street children,
the children of school dropouts, and those with disabilities. More specifically, this approach assesses how
and to what extent equity was considered as a way to bring a positive focus on the most vulnerable children
and parents, including children with disabilities, enabling them to benefit from progress towards the SDGs.
60
The evaluation team analysed the involvement of girls and boys, women and men in programme
components, whether as active participants or mere recipients. This includes assessing: i) the use of gender
participatory planning and participatory monitoring and evaluation when designing and implementing sub-
projects, interventions and initiatives, and, if feasible given the complex context and data availability
challenges, ii) the application and use of skills and knowledge learned to improve socio-economic
conditions and increase the participation of girls and women as beneficiaries.
Since no face-to-face interactions with beneficiaries could take place, the evaluation used secondary data
from the available documentation, such as evaluations and reviews. These assessed gender sensitivity in
depth, including changes in participation and living standards for girls and women. The secondary data was
used as a basis for discussion and collection of primary data in the form of opinions from key informants.
The written set of questions directed to UNICEF staff and partners also contained questions on cross-
cutting issues, including gender sensitivity.
The combination of secondary data, key informant briefings and opinions, and responses to the written set
of questions provided sources for triangulation and validation and helped to ensure attention to differences
and diversity, inclusion, and gender equality. The strategic direction and the recommendations were also
informed by the power relations among the actors in the current governance context as they directly relate
to UNICEF contributions. The key guidance for this purpose was the ‘UNEG Guidance on Integrating
Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation’.
Through the data collection methods described, the evaluation team gave special attention to data
disaggregated in terms of women, girls, men and boys to allow validation of findings by gender and age
groups. Data collection was a one-time exercise during the planned time frame with no further follow-up.
The evaluation team was supported by the services of an Arabic-speaking interpreter. Prior to the data
collection, the evaluation team provided oral and written guidance to the interpreter, including ethical
guidance, non-disclosure of the sources of data collected (see section 5.6), and the objectives of the
evaluation and the evaluation questions.
Key informant interviews were organized with the support of the Libya Country Office based on an agreed
sampling plan with the evaluation team. The interview guide was provided to key informants prior to the
interviews. Interviewees received assurances of confidentiality from the evaluation team prior to the
discussions and were asked to read and sign the letter of informed consent presented below. Interviewees
often provided consent verbally in order not to slow down the process. The contents of interviews and
meetings were framed by the list of evaluation criteria and questions. The interviews were semi-structured.
They relied on a list of issues to be discussed but interviewers framed the questions spontaneously to
encourage a free flow of ideas and information.
In keeping with the Steering Committee request for simple data collection tools, the on-line surveys were
short, containing 12-15 questions, some of which were open-ended. The models have been used
successfully in other UNICEF evaluations in the MENA region and were modified for this evaluation. The
survey was administered through Survey Monkey, which allowed the results to be analysed in various ways.
Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured. The administration of the survey required strong buy-in by the
Libya Country Office with high level encouragement for staff and partners to participate. The complementary
use of key informant interviews and the on-line survey was helpful to collect opinions from more than one
informant in the same organisation. As recommended by Steering Committee members, attempts were
made to include the cluster leaders and implementing partners, and to reach municipal leaders who are
critical stakeholders given the fragmentation of the country.
The evaluation matrix guided the data collection process to find specific evidence for each evaluation
criterion and question, with hypotheses, assumptions, indicators or success standards, sources of
61
information, and data collection methods (see Annex 6: Evaluation matrix). The focus was on knowledge
gaps and higher-level strategic areas of the CPD.
The analysis of documents, survey replies, meetings, and interviews used the ‘before’ and ‘after’
parameters to understand what changed before and following UNICEF interventions. This analysis also
sought explanations other than the Country Programme interventions for the changes identified, and tested
their plausibility.
Regarding the attribution of output-level results to UNICEF and the analysis of the contribution of UNICEF
at the outcome level, the evaluation team used contribution analysis to explore the cause-and-effect
relationship, as described above. This helped to determine if there was a tangible contribution of UNICEF
to expected outcomes, whether the achievement of outputs can be attributed to UNICEF, and whether
these influenced progress toward national development priorities and children’s and women’s needs and
rights.
Ethical considerations
The following guidance documents were used as needed:
• UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis
(Division of Data, Research and Policy (DRP), (CF/PD/DRP/2015-001), 1 April 2015)
• Guidance Document for the Protection of Human Subjects’ Safety
• Guidance Document for the Protection of Human Subjects’ Identities
• Guidance Document for Protection of Research Data
• Guidance Document for Informed Consent
• Criteria for Ethical Review Checklist
• Informed Consent Form Example
• Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC), Childwatch International Research Network, Centre
for Children and Young People, Children’s Issues Centre, and UNICEF, 2013
The Evaluation was carried out in accordance with ethical issues and considerations from the United
Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), including:
• UNEG Ethical Guidelines
• UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the United Nations system,
as well as the OECD/DAC evaluation principles, guidelines and quality standards.111
The UNEG ethical standards that guided the evaluation include the obligations of evaluators
(independence, impartiality, credibility, freedom from conflicts of interest, accountability), and the ethical
safeguards for participants appropriate for the issues described (respect for dignity and diversity, right to
self-determination, fair representation, compliance with codes for vulnerable groups, confidentiality, and
avoidance of harm).
The UNEG ethical considerations incorporated in these meetings are the following:
• Confidentiality: The evaluators respected people’s right to provide information in confidence and
made participants aware of the scope and limits of confidentiality. They ensured that sensitive
111 See the 2016 UNEG Norms and Standards (http://www.uneval.org/document/detail/1914), as well as the UNEG
Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the United Nations system (http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/100), and
the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (http://www.unevaluation.org/ethicalguidelines).
62
information cannot be traced to its source so that the relevant individuals are protected from
reprisals.
• Avoidance of Harm: There is always the potential that evaluations can have a negative effect on
those who participate in them or those who are the subject of evaluation. Therefore, the evaluators
sought to minimize risks to, and burdens on, those participating in the evaluation; and to maximize
the benefits and reduce any unnecessary harms that might occur from negative or critical
evaluation, without compromising the integrity of the evaluation.112
The methodology adopted did not require consultation and collection of primary data from children.
However, stakeholders and civil society actors were consulted. As per the Ethical Review Board’s
recommendations, all subjects for interviews and participation in the survey were offered an informed
consent agreement. Potential risks to subjects or to the integrity of the evaluation were addressed as
follows:
• To limit the potential that the subjects’ responses were affected by any of the risks, it was ensured
that their participation was by choice and confidential, both for the survey and the key informant
interviews.
• Evaluators did not request information or opinions where public disclosure could limit future
freedoms and access to services.
• The involvement of the key informants was predicated by assurances of confidentiality that were
included in the survey introduction and the interview guides. The evaluation team ensured follow-
through on these assurances, and the information received remained confidential to the evaluation
team.
• The names of key informants and survey respondents were kept separate from the responses. The
responses were included in the evaluation matrix format with reference only to secondary sources.
The Informed Consent form for key informants and survey respondents is included below. The team
collected the forms, copies of which were left with respondents.

Effectiveness
Evaluation Hypothesis to be tested with regard to Effectiveness: UNICEF programme outputs were delivered and they contributed to progress toward the
stated programme outcomes by supporting an enabling environment and improving supply and quality of services.
EQ 7. To what extent were programme outputs (short-term/intermediate results) delivered and did they contribute to progress toward the stated programme outcomes,
e.g., supporting an enabling environment, and improving supply and quality of services.
EQ 8. To what extent did different groups, including women, girls and boys, children and youth (with the focus on the most marginalised) benefit from the
Country Programme?
EQ 9. What are the major factors influencing the achievement (or not) of Country Programme Document(s) outputs? (e.g., external factors – political, social
economic etc, internal factors – quantity, quality, timeliness of delivery, etc) and what influence did these factors have on achievement (or not) of the Country
Programme?
Were there any positive or negative unintended effects?
EQ 10. To what extent do the achieved results take into account gender, youth and respect for the human rights agenda, the Child Rights Convention and humanitarian
principles?

Comparative Advantage and Strategic Positioning
Evaluation Hypothesis to be tested with regard to Comparative Advantage and Strategic Positioning: UNICEF has used its comparative advantage in the
national context to strategically position its Country Programme.
EQ 12. What is the comparative advantage of UNICEF in the national context?
EQ 13. Did the CP help to strategically position UNICEF in the national development and humanitarian context ? (with national institutions, United Nations partners,
other development partners, Academia, and NGOs)
EQ 14. How should UNICEF position itself in the country, in the next CP, in response to national needs, changes and emerging issues, and given
the results achieved so far?
EQ 15. What are examples of high level, upstream policy/advocacy work? Where was UNICEF most and least influential? What upstream work should definitively
take place in the next CP? Should UNICEF continue to implement some targeted pilot / small-scale projects that have the potential to be replicated by local and
national institutions?
