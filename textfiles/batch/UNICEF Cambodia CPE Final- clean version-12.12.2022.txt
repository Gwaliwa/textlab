EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. This report presents the UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme 2019-2023 Evaluation
(hereinafter: CPE) which assessed UNICEF’s performance in Cambodia across the period
between January 2019 - June 2022. The evaluation has a summative perspective of Country
Programme (CP) implementation in the period between 2019-2021, and formative perspective
for the period of 2022 onward. The report contains the key findings, conclusions, and
recommendations of the CPE.
2. The UNICEF Cambodia CP focuses on five key programmatic areas: 1) Health and Nutrition, 2)
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), 3) Education, 4) Child Protection, and 5) Social Policy and
Public Financing for Children, as well as the internal programme effectiveness area. The CP
works on three levels: (a) upstream: national; (b) midstream: subnational; and (c) downstream:
community. This CPE looks at the programme as a whole with a deep-dive review of Health and
Nutrition, WASH, and Education, while multiple sectoral evaluations informed the Social Policy
and Child Protection sectors contributions to the overarching CP results. The overall budget for
the Cambodia CP for the reference period has reached a total of US$80.3 million.
3. The evaluation followed the 2019 OECD Development Assistance Committee evaluation criteria
of relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability1, the Norms and Standards of the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG), and the 2018 UNICEF Evaluation Policy and the principles of ‘do no
harm’. The evaluation was theory-based and used a mixed-methods approach drawing on three
main sources of information: pre-existing documentation, pre-existing quantitative or
qualitative information and primary qualitative information. The immediate users of the
evaluation findings and recommendations include UNICEF Cambodia, the Royal Government of
Cambodia (RGC) including the Ministry of Planning and other line ministries, UNICEF East Asia
and Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO), the Cambodia United Nations Country Team (UNCT),
development partners and donors.
The Main Evaluation Findings
4. UNICEF’s strategic positioning. UNICEF’s country strategies and areas of intervention are
aligned with, and continuously contribute to, Cambodia’s national development and sector
priorities, and Cambodia’s Agenda 2030. UNICEF’s support to the Decentralisation and
Deconcentration (D&D) process and engagement with civil society varied by sector. Gender
considerations are not seen as a priority in Government, but UNICEF has continued to advocate
for gender equality. UNICEF’s targeting and coverage is informed by a range of studies,
evaluations, and reviews and geographic targeting was generally appropriate. UNICEF's
sustained system-wide capacity building in multiple areas has helped lay the groundwork for
future reforms, although respondents indicated that UNICEF could have promoted more
equitable methods through its strategic positioning and advocacy role.
5. UNICEF identifying and responding to emerging needs. The choice of activities, target groups
and areas of intervention included in the CP were guided by national priorities and unmet needs
of children, following an equity approach, as identified by UNICEF’s and other actors’ analytical
work. UNICEF was adaptable to the evolving local context and needs throughout the CP
implementation. The importance of the role of Communication for Development, Private Sector
Engagement and Technology for Development in implementation of UNICEF’s CP has been
constantly growing.
6. UNICEF's comparative advantages. UNICEF's main comparative advantage pertains to
integrated upstream policy support and modelling of services in different sectors, contributing
1 Available at: https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/daccriteriaforevaluatingdevelopmentassistance.htm
to generating evidence and policy dialogue, supporting innovative tools and strategies. UNICEF
requires greater focus and prioritization of key areas, and review of its broad and demand-
driven portfolio, a rather generalist approach across sectors, and lack of strategies to engage at
subnational level.
7. Adequacy and effectiveness of steps to deliver in convergent approaches. UNICEF’s
sectoral interventions are very broad, covering a range of activities and interactions at central
level. UNICEF’s convergence efforts are on the rise but still not fully consistent between sectors.
UNICEF’s partnership approaches prioritize cooperation with government over, and sometimes
at the expense of, collaboration with other development partners.
8. Achievement of sector level results in Health and Nutrition, WASH, and Education.
UNICEF’s support in strengthening the implementation of high-impact Maternal, Newborn and
Child Health (MNCH) and nutrition services and interventions at national and sub-national level
is an important contribution to the national health system. UNICEF’s work to strengthen
nutrition programming, assisting in systems strengthening for maternal and child nutrition
provided through facility and community-based delivery mechanisms is also a significant
contribution. The WASH programme has made consistent efforts to build more capacity at
subnational level (focusing on rural WASH), showing a coherent balance of investment and
prioritization between national level policy guidance and policy implementation support
(national and sub-national levels). UNICEF contributed to an overall increase in the capacity of
state and non-state actors to develop and implement measures aimed at increasing access to
basic, safe, climate resilient water supply for people in schools and health care facilities in
targeted UNICEF districts. UNICEF has also contributed to enhanced Ministry of Education,
Youth and Sport capacity to navigate transformation of the quality, inclusiveness and relevance
of education policies and services, including by building on the capacity of its human resources
to plan, implement and monitor Education Strategic Plan targets. However, operationalisation
of ambitious educational reform plans at subnational level is slow and warrants consolidated
focus on priority areas. UNICEF’s support to the technical and system strengthening in areas
such as inclusive education, multi-lingual education and supporting the upscaling of positive
discipline training for teachers to address various issues has brought several positive short-term
results, though transformative potential is still limited. UNICEF’s contributions to the
enhancement of capacity of communities to demand accountability and relevant quality
education services have been minimal.
9. Active involvement with duty-bearers. UNICEF has actively engaged with duty bearers at
central level, leading to strong ownership of results. Engagement with duty bearers at
subnational level varied between thematic areas but is positive where it happened.
10. The CP integrated and utilised several strategies to deliver results. The evaluation found
that UNICEF has used appropriate programming at scale, and winning support for the cause of
children from decision makers, while developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for
children and the power of evidence to drive change.
11. Timeliness of UNICEF’s delivery of results. COVID-19 constraints, Cambodia’s challenging
topography, and other more structural factors hampered the timeliness of delivery of support
to the duty bearers and right holders. UNICEF’s adaptable management boosted the timeliness
of support.
12. UNICEF’s contributions to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF),
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and UN COVID-19 Socioeconomic Response Framework
(SERF) were positive. UNICEF-supported system level strengthening and reforms across
education, social protection and child protection, health and nutrition and WASH contribute to
UNDAF, SERF and the SDG acceleration, despite persistent challenges. UNICEF’s COVID-19
response has been strong and appreciated by all interviewed stakeholders.
2
13. Factors influencing the achievement of CP results. CP focus and performance have
benefited from UNICEF’s office structure, evidence generation, combination of upstream and
downstream focus and adaptability and the Royal Government of Cambodia’s commitment and
positioning. Nevertheless, delivery of results was hindered by internal siloed approaches, and
external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
14. The sustainability of gains relating to programming at scale in vaccination, social protection, and
increased investments in various areas such as Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Mental Health
and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS). UNICEF is already supporting the Ministry of Health in the
integration of COVID-19 vaccination into routine immunisation programming, which could be
delivered with other essential primary health care services for the most vulnerable. The
unprecedented expansion of Cambodia’s social protection system during the pandemic has
provided the opportunity to develop new capacities among the national duty bearers, providing
a unique opportunity to temporarily expand social assistance during a crisis. Some key
informants indicated that UNICEF’s operational focus on GBV and MHPSS activities reaching out
to the most vulnerable and marginalized has opened a window of opportunity for policy
influencing and advocacy for equitable coverage, and may help intensify efforts in other
domains too, such as civil registration-returned migrants, refugees, etc.
The Main Evaluation Conclusions
15. Relevance. The CP design is aligned with national priorities, the UNDAF and the relevant SDGs.
UNICEF’s focus on the most deprived regions of Cambodia is appropriate. The CP integrated
gender considerations and responds to most needs of rights holders, though coverage of the
most vulnerable groups would have enhanced UNICEF’s added value in Cambodia. UNICEF
Country Office has created, cultivated, and maintained good relationships with the Royal
Government of Cambodia, enabling UNICEF to influence national discourse and policy
development, though to a lesser extent its operationalisation and implementation.
16. Convergence is still emerging. The design of the different sectors’ Theories of Change do not
reflect key thematic and cross-sector linkages, which hinders convergence. A multitude of
sectoral upstream and downstream interventions with funding constraints and siloed
approaches in implementation of activities are further reflected in vertical communication
issues between the Country Office (CO) and Zone Offices (ZOs). It is hard to assess the
effectiveness and impact of conceptualised converging programmes (e.g., The Cambodia
Integrated Early Childhood Development and Adolescent Development and Participation).
17. Comparative advantage. The two most significant strengths and value propositions of UNICEF
in Cambodia include its reputation as the go-to agency for system strengthening, policy support,
modelling, and filling gaps in education, child protection and social policy, WASH, and
increasingly health and nutrition, with an equity approach. This provides an opportunity for
tackling reform efforts more systematically at central and subnational levels. UNICEF also holds
substantial coordination, convening, and leveraging potential – both with the Government and
with development partners.
18. Effectiveness and sustainability. UNICEF’s output level results from system strengthening
efforts across all CP sectors (and the COVID-19 response) have been positive, though the
challenge remains to ensure that investments across these thematic areas transform into
sustainable outcome level results. There has been significant progress in improvement of policy
and regulatory frameworks thanks to UNICEF's support, but there are still gaps in terms of
conducive policy and the fiscal environment at all levels; operationalisation of regulatory
provisions and the models’ scale up.
19. UNICEF implemented several relevant and effective interventions in response to COVID-
19 under SERF. The utility of UNICEF’s mandate and efficient resource mobilisation approaches
3
in response to the pandemic led to the immediate rapid and effective response, providing
needed vaccination, child protection and social assistance, education and WASH support
services at scale to the Government and children. Such support to the most affected population
has to some extent mitigated the negative learning loss and health impact of COVID-19 across
Cambodia.
20. Factors affecting sustainability of results. The transformative potential and sustainability of
UNICEF’s results are muted to some extent by national absorption capacity limitations, UNICEF’s
fragmented approaches and recurring crises. By providing significant amounts of technical
assistance to national institutions, UNICEF has delivered on its promises, though longer term
sustainable transformative potential and impact of UNICEF contributions is muted because
even as programme interventions deliver outputs, the benefits of the programme interventions
often do not materialize with the affected populations. These suggest the need for more in-
depth accompaniment regarding institutional bottlenecks and procedures to bridge the gap
between policy guidance and policy implementation, identifying areas where UNICEF could add
value through a system strengthening approach across areas mentioned above.
Lessons Learned
21. Lesson 1. In countries where UNICEF’s sector reform interventions include strong evidence
generation and engagement in Public Financial Management, there is a greater
transformational potential for improving accountability and transparency of targeting and
access to services for the most vulnerable.
22. Lesson 2. Government sector institutions require long-term funding to support continuous and
comprehensive technical and financial support over time, often over multiple programme
cycles.
23. Lesson 3. Given the critical importance of essential services for children, including primary
health care and education, long term dedicated resources are needed at decentralized and
community levels to ensure a strong focus on quality, equity, and inclusiveness.
24. Lesson 4. Convergence requires organisational dedication, time, resources, and clear and
sound intervention logic.
25. Lesson 5. The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge but can also be an opportunity.
Key Recommendations
1. 21.. The next CP intervention logic should build on evidence of approaches that were
proven to bring results in sharpening organization’s focus on reaching the most
marginalized. This can be done by addressing core bottlenecks and barriers, including
emerging convergent approaches when relevant and building on lessons learned from
implementation of this cycle of CP and outstanding gaps within UNICEF’s thematic
areas. The new CSP Intervention logic should consider what can realistically be
achieved based on resource mobilization possibilities and definition of credible
assumptions that may curtail too high ambitions.
3. 42.. Develop and implement an institutional capacity strengthening strategy focusing on
areas where UNICEF can add value while considering the D&D reform needs
5. 63.. Support government fiscal planning and optimization processes across all UNICEF’s
sectors of focus, by expanding its interventions to support the government’s fiscal planning
in all targeted sectors.
4
7. 4. Continue strengthening strategic and operational support to the education sector.
Operational recommendations include the need to: undertake joint assessments to identify
needs and design joint and/or complementary inclusive education support interventions to
promote inclusive and accessible school environments with an explicit strategy and tactics
specifically for disability focus to address the complementary bottlenecks around
intervention-level and policy activities that prevent successful policy and intervention
products from reaching affected population; and to undertake joint assessments to identify
needs and design joint and/or complementary interventions to mitigate learning loss,
fostering holistic child development including social emotional learning
8. 5. Continue strengthening strategic and operational support to the health sector.
Operational recommendations include the need for continue cooperation with key
Government stakeholders (and potentially development partners) for a joint review of
current immunization programmes to prioritize the “Zero-dose” agenda and barriers to
uptake in immunization and other core child outcomes; to strengthen national and sub-
national data quality and timely availability data on zero dose children/communities; and to
continue cooperation with key Government stakeholders (and potentially development
partners) in strengthening specific approaches to maternal, newborn and child health and
immunization as part of Primary Health Care and Universal Health Care in a limited number
of geographic areas.
9. 6. Continue strengthening strategic and operational support to the nutrition sector.
Operational recommendations include the need to: strengthen evidence-based
communication and advocacy to explicitly visualize the scope and consequences of the
unaddressed management of SAM caseloads; 2) to intensify life-saving nutrition response
and coverage, including well-targeted social interventions in the areas with critical SAM levels;
3) with partners to develop a tool to identify critical areas to be prioritized for immediate
rapid assessments and rapid emergency response in humanitarian situations; and 4) to
strengthen multi-sector, multiple systems and cross-sectoral programming to prevent and
address the underlying causes of all forms of malnutrition including persistent child wasting.
10. 7.
Continue strengthening strategic and operational support to the WASH sector.
Operational recommendations include the need to: intensify efforts to move forward the
Climate Resilient Water and Sanitation agenda; to advocate towards reinforcing Climate
Resilient WASH Minimum Requirement in Schools (WinS MR); to support smart subsidy
strategies for accessing marked based sanitation services as well as supporting the
development of WASH financing strategy.

INTRODUCTION
1. This evaluation report presents the key findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the
UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme 2019-2023 Evaluation (hereinafter: CPE). In line with
UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS)2, the evaluation provides the CO
and other relevant UNICEF stakeholders with an independent assessment of UNICEF’s strategy
and portfolio of activities in the country. As per the Terms of Reference (ToR) (Annex 1) the
evaluation assessed UNICEF’s performance in Cambodia across the period between January
2019- June 2022 with the summative perspective of CP implementation in the period between
2019-2021, and formative perspective for the period of 2022-onward. The timing of the
evaluation will enable the CO and other stakeholders to use the main findings, conclusions, and
recommendations as input in the design of the new Country Programme (CP) 2024-2028.
2. The immediate users of the evaluation findings and recommendations include UNICEF
Cambodia, the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) including the Ministry of Planning and
other line ministries, UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO), the Cambodia United
Nations Country Team (UNCT), development partners and donors.
SUBJECT OF THE EVALUATION AND ITS CONTEXT
Country Context3
3. Cambodia is a constitutional monarchy located on the Indochinese mainland of Southeast Asia,
with a population of 15.5 million people, 51.3 percent of which are female.4 The country is
divided into four regions and 25 provinces, which are the country’s first-level administrative
divisions.5 The urban population represents 39.4 percent of the overall population.
4. Poverty: A significant proportion of Cambodians live on the verge of poverty and are vulnerable
to socio-economic and natural shocks.6 The most recent data indicate that approximately 18
percent of the population is identified as poor with poverty concentrated in rural areas (22.8
percent), particularly in the northeast and northwest of the country.7 Poverty rates have a
marked gender inequality and tend to be higher in rural areas.8 Cambodia sustained a steady
annual growth of 7.7 percent from 1998 to 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly
slowed the economy with growth falling by an estimated 10.1 percentage points compared to
the pre-pandemic coverage growth rate.9 The employment rate has also been negatively
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting stringent measures to stop transmission.
According to World Bank, about 45 percent of households continue to experience income
losses.10
5. Education: Primary enrolment is nearly universal with 91.9 percent net enrolment rates for
2021 dropping to 32.2 percent for upper secondary net enrolment.11 The gender gap in

education remains in primary and secondary education where completion rates are much lower
for boys compared to girls12. Inequality in basic education is still a major issue in Cambodia with
the literacy gap being higher in rural areas. There is also a gender gap in literacy rates (91.1
percent for males and 86.2 percent for females in 2019). 13 Despite high enrolment, the quality
of education is poor with nearly a quarter of students in Grade 3 unable to write a single word
in a dictation test.14 Children with disabilities, indigenous children, those living in rural areas,
those from poorer areas and those from poorer families face additional barriers to accessing
quality education. Learning outcomes are also threatened for working children aged 5-17 years
attending school (52.3 percent15 in the 2019/2020 academic year, 15 percent higher than in
2017)16. Child labour is also keeping around 800,000 children out of school: 47.7 percent of the
total working children, estimated by the National Institute of Statistics to be 18.2 percent of the
total country population aged 5-17 years children17).18
6. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH): Cambodia has made considerable progress in
reaching national WASH targets. Between 2015 and 2020, Cambodia achieved the second
largest increase in the world in access to at least basic sanitation at the household level and
largest decrease in rates of open defecation (16 percentage points for both indicators).19
However, despite these improvements, Cambodia is not on track to meet national and global
targets with a continuation of the annual rate of increase in basic sanitation in rural areas at 3
percent, and in the reduction in rural open defecation at 3.6 percent (since 2000).20
7. Cambodia achieved the ninth largest improvement in basic hygiene in the world between 2015
and 2020, with an increase of 7 percent points.21 However, with a 2020 baseline of 70.85 percent,
and continuation of the annual increase of 1.5 percent (recorded since 2010), the country is not
on track to reach the national target of universal basic hygiene in rural areas by 2025, nor the
global SDG target date of 2030.22 Absence of soap amongst 14 percent of rural households, and
handwashing facilities amongst 15 percent of rural households, particularly among the poor,
remain major bottlenecks.23 Updated data from the 2021 Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)24
indicates that of the three elements of WASH, access to drinking water in rural areas posed the
largest challenge, with an average annual rate of change of 0.9 percent since 2000 – slower than

targets will not be met until after mid-century.26

households.27 In sanitation, it is estimated that over 25 percent of the population is affected by
challenging environments, living in areas affected by floods, high ground water, and other
barriers to effective sanitation and faecal sludge management. Of that population, the majority
(62.5 percent) live in seasonally affected flood prone areas.28
9. WASH services in school have been interrupted by the impact of climate change,29 affecting
children’s school attendance and possibly academic performance through the damages of the
physical infrastructures and the contamination of water sources during floods, and the reduced
quantity of safe drinking water and water for flushing and cleaning purposes during droughts.30
10. Health and Nutrition: Health in Cambodia has shown significant improvement in the quality,
availability, and utilization of health services. As of 2021, total effective social health protection
coverage equates to about one-third of the total population.31 The maternal mortality rate
(MMR) has halved from 2007-2017, from 303 to 160 per 100,000,32 and continues to improve.
The latest data indicates an MMR of 154 deaths per 100,000 live births33 (i.e. four in every
thousand mothers died in childbirth). Over the same period, infant34 and under-five mortality
rates both improved by over 70 percent35. Additional reduction during the five years
immediately preceding the CDHS 2021-2022 results in an under-five mortality rate of 16 deaths
per 1,000 live births and an infant mortality rate of 12 deaths per 1,000 births. These
improvements are driven largely by increased antenatal and postnatal care, increased
immunization coverage and skilled birth attendance.36
11. Remaining challenges include, inter alia, provincial disparities and growing inequalities, high
neonatal mortality (mortality during the first month) which in Cambodia accounts for 66 percent
of infant deaths and 50 percent of under-5 deaths,37 a double disease burden of communicable
and non-communicable diseases (NCDs)38, and high rates of adolescent pregnancy
(approximately one in eight women (12 percent) of 15-19 years of age have become mothers or
are currently pregnant with their first child).39 Diarrheal disease also poses a significant health
risk to children in Cambodia and represents around seven percent of the country’s under-five
deaths.40
12. Inadequate Infant and Young Children Feeding (IYCF) practices leave many Cambodian children
at high risk of malnutrition during the early stages of life with Cambodia falling behind in: a)

achieving exclusive breastfeeding (EBF)41 targets with declining rates over time42 and b) the
target of reducing anaemia among women of reproductive age (47.1 percent of women aged 15
to 49 years affected).43 Preliminary results from the 2021-2022 CDHS show a substantial
decrease in stunting (moderate and severe) since 2014, down from “very high” to a national
prevalence of 22 percent (high)44 but with rising inequality.45 The percentage of children who
are wasted has remained unchanged at 10 percent (high).46At the same time, Cambodia has an
increased trend of overweight and obesity and diet-related diseases.47
13. Children, and Youth Protection: There is an increasingly robust legal framework and
expanded child protection services available in Cambodia.48 The Government has made
significant strides in the alternative care system, also adopting the Sub-Decree on the
Management of Residential care Centres in 2015 to regulate the residential care sector.49 The
Government has publicly committed to ending all forms of violence against children, becoming
the 26th Pathfinding Country in 2019. With the support of UNICEF, the Government developed
the ‘Action Plan to Respond to Violence against Children 2017-2021.50 Violence against children
remains a substantial problem with over half of respondents in 2013 (approximately 60 percent)
reporting experiencing emotional, physical or sexual violence during childhood.51
14. Climate and Disaster Risk: Cambodia is one of the more disaster‐prone countries in Southeast
Asia52, affected by floods and droughts on a seasonal basis with extremely high exposure to
flooding, potentially affect up to 25 percent of the population.53 A succession of droughts and
floods resulted in significant loss of life and considerable economic loss. In 2020 alone, “more
than two million people were exposed to flooding and some 800,000 people were directly
affected. Of these, an estimated 388,000 people with pre-existing vulnerabilities prior to the

disaster needed humanitarian assistance”.54 Other hydrometeorological hazards, including
floods, drought, heavy storms / typhoons, etc. also present threats.55
15. Gender and Disability: Cambodia is party to all core international human rights treaties
including the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW).56 In 2021, Cambodia ranked 103 out of 156 countries and 12th in the region out of 20
countries, dropping 14 places since its 2020 ranking.57 There are still gender social norms and
beliefs that restrict what women can do and be, accompanied by vastly unequal distribution of
unpaid domestic and care work, with women doing, on average, 90% of that work58.
16. According to the 2019 General Population Census of Cambodia (GPCC), there has been an
important undercount of the number of children, adult and older population with disabilities,
leading to an underestimated figure of 4.9 percent (4.2 male and 5.5. female) of Cambodia’s
population aged five years and above (out of which, 1.2 percent experience severe disability).59
This figure of disability prevalence is officially stated to be unrealistically low - the specific
questions on functional difficulties of children younger than five years of age were not asked in
the 2019 GPCC and the same applies to psychosocial disabilities.60 The CCA estimates people
with disabilities numbering around 310,000, whilst in the 2014 DHS survey, the percentage of
mild, moderate and severe disability was about two times higher than the 2019 GCCC
estimates.61 Other more general limitations are related to stigmatization or insufficient
reporting of functional limitations when collecting data on disability.
17. COVID-19: A total of 136,262 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,056 deaths were reported in
Cambodia between 27 January 2020 and 29 April 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting
measures had a devastating impact on Cambodia’s economic and social development. In 2020,
economic growth contracted for the first time in nearly a decade, with real gross domestic
product (GDP) estimated to have contracted by 3.1 percent.62 Public health expenditure
dropped from 6.43 percent of the total national budget in 2020 to an estimated 4.8 percent in
2021 (excluding COVID-19 extraordinary allocations), as the total 2021 national budget was
scaled down due to concerns over the expanding fiscal deficit. The national response was
substantial as detailed in Annex 2.
Subject of the Evaluation
18. UNICEF’s cooperation with the Government is articulated in the RGC–UNICEF Country
Programme (CP) 2019–2023. The CP was designed to contribute to Cambodia’s national efforts
to enable “all girls and boys, especially those most vulnerable and marginalized, progressively
enjoy their rights to survival, care, protection and participation, and develop to reach their full
potential”. The CP focuses on five key programmatic areas/pillars: 1) Health and Nutrition, 2)

WASH, 3) Education, 4) Child Protection, and 5) Policy and Public Financing for Children, with a
sixth programme area focusing on programme effectiveness.
Programme outcomes and outputs
19. The CP document (CPD)63 does not present an overarching intervention logic for the CP, but
intervention logics for individual programme areas are available (see Annex 3). The CPD
presents the results and resources framework showing the structure for implementation of
UNICEF’s mandate in Cambodia within the given period (See Annex 3). UNICEF planning
documents show an evolution of the CP outputs and Indicators over time, with revisions of the
framework and addition of several COVID-19 related indicators (See detailed overview of the CP
in Annex 3).
20. CP review 2021: UNICEF Cambodia undertook a programme review in 2021 with an aim to
better align the CP with the new UNICEF Strategic Plan (2022-2025) and the Gender Action Plan
(2022-2025), to help to assess UNICEF’s interventions in light of COVID-19 and emerging RCG
priorities, and to reflect on UNICEF’s adolescent programming and a zonal office review.
Emerging sectoral priorities and recommendations64 coming out of the CP Review are included
in Annex 3.
21. Programme delivery: The CP works on three levels: (a) upstream: national; (b) midstream:
subnational (provincial and district); and (c) downstream: community (parents, caregivers,
service providers, children, and adolescents). The UNICEF Cambodia’s main office is based in
the city of Phnom Penh covering national level and south-eastern & western provinces, and two
Zone Offices (ZO) cover Kratie and Siem Reap provinces (Figure 1). UNICEF’s work is
operationalised through Rolling Work Plan (RWP), which is signed between UNICEF and the
respective Ministry. For service delivery with NGO partners, UNICEF usually entered into
Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCAs), which fully scope the work, and are usually
developed in consultation with the different Ministries leading to the RGC sectoral responses.
Small-Scale Funding Agreements (SSFA) are also used to provide cash transfers to a Civil Society
Organization (CSO) for activities within the CP (regular and humanitarian response).

PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION -
Main Objectives and Users of the Evaluation
23. The evaluation had both summative and formative nature, assessing the past and ongoing
programme implementation and helping to inform future programming and in particular, the
design of the next CPD. As outlined in the ToR, the CPE had the following main objectives:
• Assess the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of the CP, with a strong cross-cutting
focus on equity, human rights, disability, and gender equality and with a focus on specific
programme areas which have not been subject to evaluation65.
• To identify key challenges that constrain or catalyst and that accelerate or enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of CP implementation and performance.
• To assess the ability of the CP to respond and adapt to changing contexts (including but not
limited to COVID-19), new emerging issues, and national priorities.
• Support an accountability objective by providing an independent assessment of progress
towards expected results of the country programme, and the programme’s contribution to
national development results and UNICEF’s contribution to UNDAF results.
• Identify key lessons from implementation of the ongoing CP which can inform the design of
the next CP.
24. To fulfil the objectives and respond to all evaluation questions, this evaluation looked at all areas
of the CP, assessing higher level results. In depth assessment of Health and Nutrition, Education
and WASH components of the CP was conducted, and insight into performance and
contributions of CP components was gained from previous sectoral evaluations and key
informant interviews (KIIs) with national level stakeholders and donors. The evaluation also
assessed the cross-cutting areas such as Early Childhood Development (ECD), Technology for
Development (T4D) and support to adolescents and climate resilience. The UNICEF CO has an
increasing focus on adolescents, so it was important to take this opportunity to understand how
the programme addresses adolescents needs.

25. Time period: During the inception phase, the scope was reconfirmed as January 2019- June
2022.
26. Evaluation Use: The evaluation served the dual and mutually reinforcing objectives of
accountability and learning. For accountability, the evaluation assessed and reported on the
performance and results achieved (intended or unintended, positive, or negative) of UNICEF's
assistance to Cambodian institutions. The evaluation also provided stakeholders with an
independent platform to register their suggestions, ultimately becoming recommendations for
incorporation into programme design or implementation. For learning, the evaluation
determined why and how specific results occurred the way they did, drawing lessons and good
practices with pointers for learning from them. It provided evidence-based findings to inform
operational and strategic decision-making. Lessons learnt from this evaluation are intended to
help refine and improve the implementation of the activities under the current cycle and for
future CPs.
27. Evaluation questions: The questions that guided this evaluation were aligned with the 2019
OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) evaluation criteria of relevance, effectiveness,
and sustainability.66 The evaluation questions are listed in Evaluation Matrix, Annex 4.
28. Cross cutting areas: The evaluation prioritizes human rights, equity, disability and gender
equality as key criteria was mainstreamed across all evaluation questions (EQ) and subsequent
analysis.
METHODOLOGY
29. The evaluation methodology was guided by the Norms and Standards of the United Nations
Evaluation Group (UNEG)67 and the 2018 UNICEF Evaluation Policy,68 and employed a theory-
based approach, enabling assessment of cause-effect interactions between individual
components and the programme’s desired outcomes. The evaluation was founded on principles
of participation, empowerment, and appreciative inquiry, which led the design and tools and
analysis exercises and used a mixed-methods approach drawing on three general sources of
information across different levels of stakeholders. These were: i) Pre-existing documentation
(e.g., policies, donor reports, evaluations, annual workplans, external research, among others –
see Bibliography in Annex 5); ii) Pre-existing quantitative or qualitative information (e.g.,
National level indicators on child wellbeing; CP outcome, output and activity indicators, internal
datasets, among others); iii) Primary qualitative information (information collected by the
Evaluation team (ET) during the data collection process - e.g., KII, focus group discussions (FGD),
site observations).
30. Document review was a continuous process from the start of the inception phase and served
to create informational and secondary data foundations, leading to preliminary hypotheses that
were checked during the primary data collection. The primary data collection spanned July –
September 2022, coinciding with annual leave for many UNICEF, governmental staff and
development partners, which called for a longer, hybrid data collection approach. This included
in-person field mission to sampled communities and remote KIIs from UNICEF, central
government, civil society, and development partners. Online interviews were done through
virtual platforms, such as Teams and Zoom.

Data Collection
31. The primary qualitative and quantitative collected by the ET related to four dimensions: i)
Qualitative information from a wide range of stakeholders at the central level (national
Government institutions, UNICEF, UN agencies, development partners, civil society and other
central level stakeholders) regarding the overall CP performance (strategic positioning,
convergence, programming at scale, relevance, comparative advantage, leverage, etc.); ii)
Interviews with provincial, district and local level stakeholders (provincial, district, and
commune authorities engaged in sectors of Health and nutrition, Education, WASH, but
also child protection), service providers and other partners working at the local level; iii)
FGD with communities and final beneficiaries; and iv) site observations of schools and health
centres; and iv) sectoral working sessions with UNICEF section teams. Over the whole
evaluation, the ET spoke with a total of 218 people (43.6 percent of them were female) (Figure
4). This included 14 KII during the inception phase (86 percent women), 161 KII during field
phase (36.6 percent women), and seven FGD gathering a total of 57 persons (63 percent
women). Field data collection covered 13 districts across six provinces to collect views of
authorities, service providers and communities (see Table in Annex 6). For both the KII and the
FGD, semi-structured interview and focus group guides were used to ensure consistent
formatting of the interviews.69 Evaluation notes were compiled into a standardized template for
each of the FGD and KIIs - labelled by stakeholder and activity. The ET also conducted 5
observations in schools and health facilities.

Data Analysis
32. The ET undertook a comprehensive data analysis exercise with a combination of synchronous
and asynchronous exercises, including using interactive record management to help organize
the main findings and evidence. The analysis of collected data included descriptive and
comparative quantitative analysis, thematic narrative analysis, qualitative iterative data analysis,
and contribution analysis. All methods were triangulated both internally and across methods as
feasible.
69 Annex 7 Interview guides
15
33. In line with the participatory approach, the ET held a debriefing session with the CO teams while
in the country, and then follow up meetings to check facts and further validate the findings,
conclusions and recommendations. Key stakeholders had the opportunity to comment on the
draft report, with the final report being submitted in conjunction with an online validation
workshop that will also serve to co-create recommendations in November 2022.
Data Reliability and other Limitations
34. The evaluation experienced delays and rescheduling, due partly to the long finalization process
for the inception report. The hybrid approach and extended collection period was mitigated by
ensuring that the team debriefed internally and was well prepared for the second round of data
collection. Only the national consultant undertook the field component at provincial level,
though the ET members remained in close contact and used different opportunities to discuss
field data collection, reflect on some emerging themes between central and subnational level
stakeholders.
35. The lack of an overarching programme Theory of Change (ToC) limited somewhat the analysis
of overarching CP transformative results. Individual programme components were used as a
framework for ToC and contribution analysis, particularly regarding the three components in
focus (WASH, Health and Nutrition and Education). Without an overarching ToC, the CP results
framework in use and implicit theory were articulated through naturalistic analysis of interview
notes. This approach helped to assess the UNICEF contributions based on the a priori
frameworks used by individual stakeholders.
Ethical considerations
36. Adhering to the United Nations Evaluation Ethics Principles: The ET abided by the 2016
UNEG norms and standards, the 2007 UNEG Ethical Guidelines and Code of Conduct and the
principles of ‘do no harm’. The ET ensured that the gender lens of the evaluation was integrated
by ensuring adequate representation of gender considerations in the evaluation processes and
assessment of results. The humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence
were safeguarded in the development of findings and recommendations. The Ethical Clearance
from the Ethics Review Board (ERB) was obtained ahead of the field data collection phase (See
Annex 14).
KEY FINDINGS
37. This section presents the evaluation findings against the key evaluation questions, and their
related judgment indicators in response to evaluation objectives. The synthesis findings were
derived from detailed analysis of the overall strategic framework of UNICEF’s work in Cambodia
as presented in the CP and analysis of UNICEF’s sector interventions. The responses to
evaluation questions present triangulated findings from comprehensive document review,
information received from various stakeholders and site observations.
5.1 UNICEF’s strategic positioning and adaptability to respond to changes in national needs, and
priorities or to shifts caused by COVID-19 and other major socio-economic and political changes
(EQ1)
5.1.1 Strategic positioning
Finding 1. UNICEF’s country strategies and areas of intervention are aligned with and contribute to
Cambodia’s national development and sector priorities, and Cambodia’s Agenda 2030.
38. The overall direction of the CP design and implementation were informed by and contributed
to national priorities as defined in the ten-year National Strategic Development Plan 2019-2023,
16
the Rectangular Strategy, the National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025, other
national sectoral strategies and country priorities, and the United Nations Development
Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2019-2023, and UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021.70 The
programme targeted national, subnational and to a certain extent, community levels, with a
geographical focus on north-eastern and north-western Cambodia, where the needs were
considered higher based on key socio-economic indicators.71 This national strategic and
legislative framework created a strong foundation for UNICEF’s work and its corresponding
activities helped achieve vital milestones towards developing a systematic response to address
the needs of the most vulnerable people.
39. There was ample evidence of UNICEF’s strong strategic positioning as a partner of the Royal
Government of Cambodia and donors, being one of the longest standing UN Agencies actively
engaging in supporting the Government and the most vulnerable groups. Evidence points to
UNICEF’s efforts to maintain regular and intensive consultations with government authorities72
and relevant public institutions at national level, though to a lesser extent with subnational
authorities. National level government stakeholders consider close consultation and open and
flexible approaches of UNICEF as a driver of ownership of results. UNICEF’s value proposition
lays with its systems approach, that includes institutional capacity strengthening and provision
of financial resources; modelling of preventive and responsive services; promoting positive
social norms; and investment in a robust legal and policy framework. Most stakeholders
interviewed also consider UNICEF as a partner of choice when it comes to technical assistance
support to the Government’s priorities in education, health and nutrition, child protection and
social protection, and WASH. For instance, UNICEF is viewed as a long-term partner for
improving and optimizing health and nutrition services for children and women across
Cambodia, and the main partner for supporting the Ministry of Health (MoH) to address wasting
in the country. UNICEF’s work on Public Financial Management (PFM) and social policies is
increasingly being recognised as effective, and contributes to better planning, aligned with the
Government’s recognised need to invest in programme budgeting for children. The evaluation
found that nutrition and health were not initially visible and promoted at the onset of the CP
implementation but were boosted and leveraged UNICEF’s strong support to the immunisation
efforts, particularly the COVID-19 immunisation and Communications for Development (C4D)
efforts.
40. UNICEF focused on strengthening human and financial resources and capacities to plan, budget
and deliver policies and services for children at the national level and to a lesser extent the
subnational levels. The sector support strategies included service delivery, capacity
development, institution building, evidence generation, policy engagement, behaviour change,
leveraging resources and partnerships, and advocacy. It is not clear how these were informed
by systematic evidence on government partners’ needs and capacity gaps, beyond a
consultative process. UNICEF’s global network and experience has helped provide a cutting-
edge vantage position in terms of the ability to source the best technical experts on different
themes and issues. Interviewed stakeholders cited that most outsourced international technical
expertise was valuable, despite the travel limitations due to COVID-19, which changed the type
of support due to experts not being able to travel to Cambodia. Evaluation findings point to the
challenge of sustained dependence from continuing UNICEF hands-on support to government
institutions in the design and implementation of policies, and the direct delivery of support.

Finding 2. UNICEF’s support to the Decentralisation and Deconcentration (D&D) process and engagement
with civil society were of varying depth. These related to UNICEF’s promoted upstream work
that at times came at the expense of mid- and down- stream engagement. More efforts to
develop programmes with more full engagement with the communities, to solicit their inputs
is warranted.
41. UNICEF’s support to the national Government’s efforts to implement the D&D reform, and to
gradually delegate power (involving administration of finance) to subnational government levels
in sector areas was implemented, but with varying level of elaboration by sector. This is due to
UNICEF’s upstream macro-level focus to respond to structural issues and systemic bottlenecks,
which was considered as a prerequisite for operationalisation of policies at subnational level
and depended on the pace of D&D implementation in different sectors. The most elaborated
contribution to the D&D process was found across the Social Policy (SP) sector, where UNICEF
engaged with the Ministry of Interior to help cascade upstream policies down to the subnational
level. UNICEF’s subnational engagement strategies in SP were efficient to systematically address
(and bridge) the gap between policy guidance and policy implementation (operationalization),
but less so in other sectors.
42. UNICEF’s field presence and ability to demonstrate small-scale implementation models in WASH
and social services, education, health and nutrition results for children were valued and brought
evidence of feasible and functional approaches that could be scaled up by the government. The
field presence acted as a platform for supporting cross-sectoral collaboration at community
level and creating opportunities for collecting data and strengthening data systems at the
subnational level, though wider coverage. A more consistent approach to systems
strengthening at subnational level was cited as necessary by UNICEF’s key national and donor
partners. The evaluation found that the ZOs cannot always manage to engage in every aspect
of implementation (participation in health, nutrition, WASH, education technical WGs at
subnational level, or their prioritisation), which should be an aspect to consider in the new CP
cycle.
43. UNICEF’s convener role and capacity has been helpful to advocate and promote child rights and
to gather partners around important issues. For instance, UNICEF is the lead development
partner for subnational multisectoral nutrition coordination in three provinces (and member in
all others) and plays a leading role in the development and implementation of the multisectoral
National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition (NSFSN) 2019-2023. UNICEF also financially
and technically supports the Council for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) to lead
implementation of the NSFN. Evaluation also found numerous examples of efforts to reinforce
the provincial/district levels data systems and commune/district and provincial plannings;
putting in place up-to-date equity analysis to reach the most deprived through adapted
assessments; better profiling and monitoring access to essential services for vulnerable
populations for evidence-based cross-sectoral approaches and solutions at both national and
subnational level. Despite evidenced UNICEF’s good work in this area, some development
partners mentioned UNICEF’s perceived hesitancy to use its position to advocate more strongly
for child rights (e.g., right to education, faster reopening of schools following COVID-19, disability
and inclusion) or advocacy for the centrality of Protection in the humanitarian response. The
reason might be related to visibility of UNICEF’s work or little publicity of such actions. Desk
review and stakeholder interviews with UNICEF and the government, found that much of
UNICEF’s advocacy efforts for school reopening, improving inclusion of social assistance took
place in bilateral meetings with the government, or in TWG meetings, joint UN letters initiated
by UNICEF, OpEds, etc..
44. UNICEF’s engagement with civil society and communities was found to be limited. While
documents pointed to some consultations with civil society, interviewed civil society
18
stakeholders cited their engagement as implementing partners to be less in matters of
consultations on priorities, gaps or as advisors or advocacy partners. The subnational level
presence has helped to establish and nurture productive partnerships with state and non-state
actors in some sectors, but complaints regarding flexibility of partnership approaches,
misunderstanding by Provincial Officers or CSOs were noted in a few instances.
45. No structured feedback mechanisms are in place that could serve as tools to strengthen
community involvement or to promote participatory decision-making and inform programme
design. The evaluation found varied but not systematic approaches to Accountability to Affected
Populations. Good examples were found in the SP sector, where post-distribution calls are
conducted together with the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation
(MoSVY) to get feedback from cash transfer beneficiaries, and with some partners and/or
collaborators implementing the Social Accountability Framework (ISAF) in Cambodia.73 Another
example is the COVID-19 Rapid Coverage Assessment (RCA) implemented by the health team to
support MoH to engage vulnerable HHs and communities in the northeast & northwest and
identify behavioural and structural barriers to access, demand and uptake of vaccination. To
date, 2120 HHs have been engaged with key findings shared with EPI managers and PHDs to
inform booster campaigns.
46. Information collected by the evaluation indicated that feedback from communities also sought
by UNICEF programme staff during field visits, including from beneficiaries in health facilities,
school, etc. Findings were discussed routinely within UNICEF teams at Zonal Office and Phnom
Penh level and used as evidence to guide UNICEF programmes, informing annual work plans of
all sections.
5.1.2 UNICEF’s ability to meet the needs and include the most vulnerable and marginalised groups
(EQ 1, EQ 9, EQ 12)
Finding 3. UNICEF's Country Programme Document shows efforts to promote and document the
programme delivery through a gender and equity lens. While gender considerations are not
seen as a priority in Government, UNICEF’s advocacy in this area has been continuous.
47. Regarding gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE), the programmatic gender
review helped UNICEF better understand the potential and gaps for integrating gender into
programming and was one of the foundations around which the CP was built and implemented.
Examining the CP metrics also reveals efforts to promote and document the programme's
delivery through a gender lens. The evaluation found that all information, education and
communication (IEC) materials are gender-responsive and depict both girls and boys in active
roles, while also taking gender-specific barriers to education or other services into account.
UNICEF’s work to raise menstrual hygiene awareness was also considered by relevant
stakeholders as important, resulting in some schools implementing specific measures, including
stocking menstrual hygiene kits. Although these are only preliminary steps, they provide
positive experience that be later expanded across the country. Interviews with key informants
revealed that gender considerations were not seen as a priority in the Government, so the fact
that UNICEF addressed issues like female leadership and the training of gender focal points in
the MoEYS was considered important. Other significant contributions included the Gender Audit
within the education sector, the Gender Mainstreaming Action Plan (2020-2024), and a Gender
Master Training for a key pool of specialists within the MoEYS. These contributions were
considered by stakeholders as important to promote a gender-equitable working environment
and advancement of women leaders across the education sector. The evaluation found that
73 The ISAF aims to improve local service delivery through enhanced accountability. See more in World Bank Group

19
gender-based violence (GBV) was tackled within child protection, education and mental health
and psychosocial support activities.
48. With regards to wider coverage and equity issues, the evaluation found some adaptation issues
regarding work with children with disabilities relating to inclusive education, health, nutrition
and social policy. While UNICEF has maintained focus on these groups, particularly in education,
such support may have not been sufficiently communicated or promoted. UNICEF invested
continuous efforts to support inclusive education by training teachers, including special
education teachers (to teach children with sight and hearing impairment). UNICEF and MoEYS
chose a blended learning strategy which was then incorporated into the National Institute of
Education (NIE) teacher preparation syllabus. The national programme for disability
identification was launched with UNICEF's assistance, involving rolling out identification tools
and data collection mechanisms, and helped to collect data in all 25 provinces, leading to an
estimated 250,000 people with disabilities identified for final verification and receipt of Disability
ID cards. The design of interventions pertaining WASH in Schools and WASH in Health Centres
include gender, disability and climate resilience inclusive designs and approaches to ensure that
WASH facilities are accessible and more friendly. Gender, Age and Disability disaggregation
and analysis are also systematically included in WASH baseline survey. UNICEF also
mainstreamed disability and climate change resilience into its programming, such as climate
change focused life skills education, disability identification and social protection, COVID-19
vaccination support for ID-poor and people with disabilities, climate resilient WASH risk-
informed programming at national and sub-national levels and rural WASH management
information system linked to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process at national and sub-
national level.
49. UNICEF worked hard to ensure equal access to resources created for online/distance learning
during the COVID-19 epidemic, by adapting the contents for blind and Multi-Lingual Education
(MLE) students or providing materials in paper and digitally. These efforts were positively
evaluated by KII, suggesting that UNICEF also improved access to education for students with
disability or those from minority groups (most of whom are based in vulnerable regions) by
supporting MLE in those areas.
50. UNICEF’s focus on children and young people as agents of change has been very fragmented
and unsystematic. UNICEF engages in the Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP)
platform and in multiple youth-related activities, including - but not limited to - Adolescent and
Youth Reference Group (AYRG), engaging youth in budget planning and implementation at
provincial levels; the nutrition youth group, Generation Future (following up on Voices of Youth
initiative); and some, albeit limited, work on U-report. The document review and stakeholder
interviews revealed that it is unclear what the common goal of these interventions was, or how
these different interventions could work together or converge. The lack of a unified strategy for
all these types of engagements results in initiatives running in parallel, leading to fragmentation
and spreading resources, in turn delivering very short-term output level results and very limited
transformative potential. The level of development of each of these initiatives is different as
well. For instance, ADAP does not have a clear strategy but has its TOC, which is helpful to
understand the underlying intervention logic. Interviews with UNICEF stakeholders noted
efforts by senior management to bring different initiatives together, but this has yet to bear fruit
towards creating coherent platforms and opportunities for the youth to demand accountability
and drive progress for children.
51. UNICEF has been addressing the issues of school drop-out prevention and access to education
through the support to the strengthening of scholarships and other social protection systems
to address the economic barriers of children's school retention and completion. In response to
COVID-19, UNICEF provided learning materials to many students and intensive support for
20
continuous and remedial learning, back-to-school campaigns to promote students' school
enrolment and attendance after the school reopening, etc. (See Section 5.4.3). However,
criticism was raised by some development partners that UNICEF’s COVID-19 response could
have invested more strongly in tackling issues of dropout (particularly amongst boys), working
children and mental health issues, and more intensive communication on such issues by
UNICEF. The evaluation found that UNICEF had worked on the issue of drop out, but that work
was less intensive and visibl compared to support to continuous learning and learning recovery.
52. All stakeholders spoke positively about UNICEF’s vaccination contributions (See Section 5.4.1),
its risk communication, communication engagement and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)
in schools and health facilities, as well as the emergency WASH response to Cambodian
returning migrants (non-food items distribution). A criticism was raised in relation to the joint
UN response to returning migrants,74 which only began in 2022 even though 63.5 percent of the
surveyed population had returned to Cambodia in March and April 2021. This raised protection
concerns and criticism among development partners and UNICEF staff about: 1) Overall UN
capacity to deliver a principled humanitarian action, and 2) raised specific concerns about
UNICEF’s understanding of the centrality of Protection and its leadership role in the Protection
Working group of the Humanitarian Response Forum.75 The evaluation recognises that the
timing of the response was out of UNICEF control, and is something for the UN Cambodia team
to reflect on.
Finding 4. Geographic targeting was generally appropriate, though at times it happened in silos which
brought some overlaps and lack of synergies.
53. UNICEF’s targeting and coverage is informed by a range of studies, evaluations, and reviews.
UNICEF implements several sector-specific activities across the country and intensively in a total
of 25 provinces across the north-east and northwest regions where Zone Offices are located
(see Figure 2 in Section 1). Analysis of multiple deprivations in Cambodia (see figure in Annex 2)
shows that the most vulnerable provinces are Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri, Stung Treng, Kampong
Thom, Preah Vihear and Koh Kong. In Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri and Stung Treng, UNICEF
implements different sectoral components with uneven levels of intensity; in Kampong Thom
UNICEF activities are reduced to three out of the 12 Education components and two out of the
nine Child Protection components, whilst in Koh Kong, only one out of the 12 Education
components are implemented.
54. Activity mapping conducted by the ET based on document review and stakeholder interviews
shows several provinces, districts and communities where more than one sector intervention is
taking place. Except for Health and Nutrition (i.e., community outreach of services that provide
both health and nutrition services at the same time, place and targeted populations in remote
communities in NE provinces, IECD, IYCF, ADAP) and some WASH components, activities are
dispersed and implemented in silo from one another. The districts or areas where more than
one sectoral activity does happen is more due to geographical ‘coincidence’, and not because of
efforts to converge. IECD is progressing to overcome such issues through progressively building
coherent approaches, based on findings of the IECD evaluation and learnings from how ECD
has worked during this CP, which lead to an IECD-TOC workplan, and coherent approach in
2022. As a rule, the profiled activities at subnational level tend to be highly specialized, focusing
on niche populations and reported as separate sector-specific activities targeting different

21
stakeholder groups76 for different purposes,77 though at times the same beneficiaries may be
included in different thematic activities. As a result, individual beneficiary numbers reported are
at activity level and do not necessarily help capture multiple benefits of more than one sector-
specific intervention that could be implemented in any community/district/province. This
pattern reflects the challenges of linking specific types of programme intervention strategy to
overall CP contributions, calling for more interaction between sections on planning and
implementation of activities addressed to achieve common goals at subnational levels.
Comparative analysis of UNICEF’s coverage and available data on key indicators shows that the
generic geographic targeting of the north-eastern provinces is appropriate.
5.1.3 Adaptability and continued relevance
Finding 5. UNICEF was able to adapt to the evolving local context and needs throughout the CP
implementation. These efforts helped boost efficiency and effectiveness and turn challenges
into opportunities.
55. The evaluation found evidence of UNICEF’s flexible and adaptive approaches, and their utility
considering emerging needs and shifted national and donor priorities, such as the
reprioritization of Government priorities for the COVID-19 response. UNICEF refocused the CP
towards the pandemic response and recovery, aligning with the UN Cambodia Framework for
Socio-Economic Response to COVID-19 and emerging sector priorities, by investing in emerging
needs in education, health and nutrition, WASH, C4D, social protection and child protection.
UNICEF’s flexible strategies, strong strategic positioning and rolling workplans were found to be
the drivers of adaptability and agile response to emerging needs and priorities. The CO also
worked to minimize the effects of underachievement and/or the suspension of activities.
56. UNICEF’s COVID-19 response was considered as relevant and timely considering the needs and
challenges children were facing. For instance, in response to COVID-19, UNICEF shifted its focus
towards investing significantly in immunization (See Section 5.4.1). School closures led to
extensive learning loss; around 30 percent of children were unable to access some forms of
distance learning programmes,78 affecting 3.2 million students.79 In response, UNICEF refocused
its education work to help children continue their learning and supporting their safe return to
school in 2021/2022. The flexible and continuously responsive WASH support to Government
partners on infection prevention and control (IPC), hand hygiene supplies, risk communication
and community engagement, and the technical working group to mobilise the national COVID-
19 response and planning, were valued as very relevant and timely support efforts. UNICEF’s
climate and environment work has increasingly been anchored in WASH, allowing UNICEF to
support national development needs during the pandemic period, such as those articulated in
Cambodia’s climate change Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), to priority actions in
Education and WASH.
57. In responding to evidenced emerging challenges related to domestic violence and online
security during the COVID-19 period, UNICEF’s child protection programme invested time and
effort in strengthening information sharing and coordination amongst Government
76 For example: Cambodia national, provincial or district Institutions, Municipality Stakeholders, Teachers, Nurses, Social
Workers, Women, Children, Youth, NGOs or other groups targeted by thematic interventions.

22
counterparts, CSOs, other UN agencies and donors, to ensure continuity of child protection
services. This refocused attention resulted in integration of child protection in the ‘Back to
School Agenda’. For instance, stakeholders valued UNICEF’s stepped-up efforts to provide
650,000 children and adults with mental health and psychosocial support through hotlines,
counselling, and supportive messages. UNICEF also pushed for adoption of the new case
management guidelines for the safety of children in residential care and quarantine facilities
during COVID-19. These efforts were considered as extremely relevant by interviewed
stakeholders.
58. Finally, UNICEF played a catalytic role in developing and delivering the national response to
poverty reduction and inclusion, by building capacities of institutions to plan, budget and deliver
social services for vulnerable children and to design the first emergency government cash
transfer scheme, reaching over 700,000 poor households. This role was considered as very
relevant to address the needs of the most vulnerable and addressing policy and institutional
capacity gaps in the social protection sector.
59. The participatory Programme Review conducted in 2021 helped take stock of changing contexts
and shifting priorities, and UNICEF's position and interventions considering COVID-19. The
process resulted in concrete recommendations for each thematic area, helping to reaffirm
working methods and introduce other areas considered as relevant in the operational context.
This strategic exercise also provided an opportunity to ensure alignment with the new UNICEF
Strategic Plan (2022-2025), the Gender Action Plan (2022-2025) and new global strategies such
as the UNICEF Nutrition Strategy (2020-2030) and the Child Protection Strategy (2021-2030). The
Review presented a momentum for convergence for Integrated Early Childhood Development
(IECD), addressing climate change (CC), Adolescent Development and Participation (ADAP),
Communications for Development (C4D) and Technology for Development (T4D). It is important
to note that the Health and Nutrition program positioning and interventions were used as entry
points for stronger intersection with SBCC and T4D capacities in the office to better address
demand side barriers that H&N and other programs face. Several evaluations and reviews were
done on thematic components to inform adjustments in the programme - for instance, a review
of the Child Protection programme in 2021 resulted in a revised results framework of that
programme component for 2021-2023, to better reflect the new context and the strategic
adjustments.80 The IECD evaluation also helped to strengthen internal coherence of ECD
through an overarching TOC framework, workplan and coherent approach to ECD.
5.2 Extent to which UNICEF identified emerging needs and adopted relevant strategies to respond
to these, including the development and use of the Private Sector Engagement and Technology for
Development (EQ2)
5.2.1 Identification and response to emerging needs
Finding 6. The CPD design was informed by evidence collected through analytical studies initiated by
UNICEF or conducted jointly with the central Government. This helped maintain focus on
addressing gaps in government policies and social services and unmet needs of children and
their families across different domains. UNICEF selected indicators relating to some critical
bottlenecks linked to certain key outcomes for children, which created difficulties for UNICEF
to measure their results, as much of indictor areas were beyond UNICEF’s control or
influence.
80 UNICEF (2021). Reflection on UNICEF Cambodia Child Protection Programme to be “Fit for Purpose”
23
60. The choice of activities, target groups and areas of intervention included in the CPD were guided
by national priorities and unmet needs of children, as identified by UNICEF’s and other actors’
analytical work. Important evidence generation activities included the update of the 2018
Situation Analysis81 (SitAn), which used and collated research, studies and evaluations
conducted between 2014 and 2017 to confirm inequities, deprivations and gaps in the fulfilment
of children’s rights, especially the most disadvantaged, marginalized and excluded. UNICEF
conducted a Gender Programmatic review (GPR) in September-October 2018. The aim of the
GPR was to support UNICEF Offices to bring their country programmes in line with UNICEF’s
Gender Action Plan (GAP) 2018-2021 and the Strategic Plan (SP) 2018-2021, and accelerate
results for all children by strengthening high-quality, evidence-based gender programming.82
The review was used to reemphasise the CP’s focus on strengthening targeting and integration
of specific gender interventions across all programme areas. Other important studies that
informed the development and implementation of the CP include the evaluation of the
community preschools, the global evaluation of the nutrition programmes, the global evaluation
of the UNICEF’s drinking water supply programming in rural areas and small towns, the joint
formative evaluation of the child friendly school policy implementation, and the formative
evaluation of the UNICEF Cambodia Child Protection programme conducted in 2018. Some of
UNICEF’s interventions (for example, menstrual hygiene in schools) were informed by evidence
on obstacles to girls’ participation in education, bringing new themes to the agenda of the
Government and the schools. This was applauded as a good initiative, even though the initiative
remained limited to targeted pilot schools and not scaled up, despite evidence showing the
need and value of such investments (see more in Section 5.3).
61. Analysis of sector interventions across the CP shows that UNICEF identified a range of national
critical bottlenecks and multiple deprivations of children and addressed them by specific
interventions. For instance, generated evidence on low utilization of services for children,
insufficient public budget allocation and execution for social services and protection, and
capacity levels within line ministries, informed the development and implementation of PF4C
and social policy programme. However, some CPD design bottlenecks were linked to the choice
of some key indicators for children’s outcomes, which are rarely caused by a single factor but
resulting from an interplay between poverty, gender, disease, caring practices, educational level,
disability, etc.) many of which are outside UNICEF’s influence. This made it difficult for UNICEF
to measure adequately its contributions. The evaluation found that in some cases, indicator
measurements are difficult to obtain due to information gaps (e.g. a lack of a nationwide
mortality and nutritional or other surveys, or a lack of commune level data which is not available
in DHS, or SMART surveys83). UNICEF’s CP did not include any activity or budget to conduct such
surveys on its own, which would have contributed to inform interventions in health, nutrition
and IECD.
5.2.2 The role of Communication for Development, Private Sector Engagement and Technology for
Development in implementation of UNICEF’s CP
Finding 7. Targeted technical expertise, capacity building, and C4D-SBCC, all enabled the
implementation of strategies and plans. T4D and Private Sector Engagement have been less
explored, although some promising results are already achieved in the WASH sector.
62. The evaluation found a growing and effective role of C4D-Social and Behaviour Change
Communication (SBCC) in achieving the goals of the CP. The evaluation found that the C4D-SBCC

priorities, and ongoing planning of the CDHS for 2021-2022, no other nutrition surveys were conducted
24
had been mainstreamed across all sections and its growth was boosted with the development
of an evidence-based multi-sectoral Social and Behaviour Change costed Strategy.84 This
strategy reflects the global UNICEF strategic shift from C4D to SBCC, building on the common
ground between SBC, IECD and ADAP. A positive and leading role of C4D-SBCC was found in the
UNCT and the SERF COVID-19 response, and risk communication and community engagement
(RCCE) at the national and subnational level,85 corroborated by interviewed stakeholders who
referred to it as “remarkable” and “outstanding”.
63. Digital innovations for immunization have been assessed as UNICEF’s particular expertise that
show potential for further development. Notably useful were the technical support in designing
and implementing an immunization information system (including an E-registration system),
and the update of guidelines for micro-planning using satellite identification of settlements for
better population estimation and building on existing GIS and geospatial mapping. The inclusion
of real time monitoring tools and technical support to improve vaccine stock management and
other key areas in the supply chain were also identified as areas with maximum relevance in
the contemporary context.86
64. Regarding private sector engagement, the CO was working with Ready to Use Food (RTUF)
produced by a local company, and salt producers for iodine, to conform to standards. However,
this was deprioritized during the pandemic. UNICEF participates in the “Scaling Up Nutrition
(SUN) Business Network” and developed a five-year strategy (2021-2025)87 with the purpose of
strengthening the private sector’s contributions towards healthy diets and practices for
improved nutrition for all Cambodians. This was considered an opportunity to define the CO
strategy related to the private sector and the business for results approach, grouped together
with T4D.88 UNICEF also engaged with ICT industry in the emerging area of Child Online
Protection agenda together with Ministry of Post and Telecommunication (MoPTC). Although
the CO’s participation in the overall SUN platform has been strong, the CO’s participation in the
SUN Business network has been limited, with opportunities for more engagement.
65. UNICEF supports the Royal Government of Cambodia, the private sector and social enterprises
to provide clean drinking water to communities that rely on rivers, wells and ponds (risking
contamination from microbiological and naturally occurring pollutants such as arsenic),
developing a range of water supply technologies, adapted for local contexts including piped
water systems and bottled water enterprises. For WASH, the business engagement activities
and the scope of the UNICEF operation are very relevant (at national and subnational levels) but
need strengthening, especially at subnational/commune levels, where water system (piped
water) operators need support to reduce the financial gap to expand people’s access to water
at an affordable price. During the CP, UNICEF and UNDP in cooperation with Water and Waste
service private businesses successfully submitted a proposal to the UN Joint SDG Fund, P a for
the CLEAN joint programme on innovative financing for private sector climate resilient and low
carbon water and waste services in Cambodia).

5.3 Strengths, comparative advantages, and modalities to be kept and changes to make in the design
of the next country programme to align with the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan (EQ3, EQ4)
5.3.1 Comparative advantages
Finding 8. UNICEF's main comparative advantage pertains to integrated upstream policy support and
modelling of services in different sector, contributing to generating evidence and policy
dialogue, supporting innovative tools and strategies. Such approaches help mobilise
resources and interest by stakeholders by sharing effective methods and approaches to be
integrated in policies and practices. From that perspective, such integrated upstream-
downstream approach is appropriate considering Cambodia’s development ambition and
capacity needs.
66. Comparative advantage: UNICEF in Cambodia should retain the roles of contributing technical
expertise, as convener, and its role in advocacy. The comparative advantage valued by partners
is combined upstream policy support to different sectors with modelling of services, which helps
inform such policies. UNICEF brings international technical expertise, political credibility, and
financial resources to the Government, and implements its convener role between different
players. For instance, in the education sector, UNICEF’s strategies integrate several key reform
areas such as teacher training, school inspection, curriculum revision, capacity development
and PFM, strengthening UNICEF’s prominent role in the sector and position to capitalise delivery
of results, especially in early childhood education (ECE) and primary education. During and in
the aftermath of COVID-19, UNICEF, as co-chair of the Education Working Group, facilitated
development partner support to the COVID strategy development, led advocacy on school re-
opening and worked with partners on a joint needs assessment (evidence generation). UNICEF
also invested in creating safe and protective learning environments, ‘distance education, and
technical support for safe school re-opening. These are considered by stakeholders as adding
value to the education sector work.
67. In Nutrition, UNICEF has been key in mobilising external resources and leveraging budget
support from the powerful Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Government officials
highlight UNICEF’s mediation within their own Government as key to allocating official resources
for the next year, even before they have their own budgets finalized. This was important and
clear added value of UNICEF’s advocacy role. The UNICEF contribution to supporting the GAP
Roadmap (under the leadership of the Government) was seen as improving partner
coordination for nutrition and bringing substantial resources to the country (with new multi-
year funding recently approved).
68. Investing in PFM, social protection and child protection policies is seen as an important policy
investment to make them more realistic, while also providing a larger framework for UNICEF to
address vulnerabilities and social exclusion, by providing a more systemic framework for
reaching the most vulnerable groups (through policies, cash transfer and protection services).
69. Comparative Advantage: UNICEF’s WASH strategies to respond to the priority water and
sanitation needs were valued, with its multi-sectoral approach (also engaging the private sector),
to strengthen systems for sanitation and open defecation free (ODF) acceleration, climate risk
informed programming, and rural water supply sustainability management modelling, with a
gender-disability, equity, pro-poor and isolated communities programming focus. In healthcare
facilities, UNICEF works with the Government to model and scale up inclusive sanitation and
hygiene improvements, such as appropriate toilets, separated for patients and staff, private for
women, equipped for menstrual hygiene management, and accessible for people with limited
mobility. UNICEF’s efforts to advocate for and model menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in
the minimum ‘WASH in Schools’ package (Government guidelines) was considered as an
26
important first step. These efforts demonstrate how national guidance on WASH can be
implemented, with a focus on raising minimum standards in health facilities and schools.
70. Comparative advantage: Adaptability (transforming challenges into opportunities) and
innovation. As noted in Finding 3 above, UNICEF’s flexibility and agile adaptation to changing
needs and realities (e.g., response to COVID-19) is valued and should be kept. Innovation,
particularly through T4D and C4D interventions was seen by partners as an area that UNICEF
can tap into.
71. Comparative advantage: C4D-SBCC in general, and particularly during COVID, including
excellent communication, response, and flexibility within the UN framework, was considered as
UNICEF’s comparative advantage, which can be capitalised upon and expanded in the next CP.
5.3.2 Changes to make in the design of the next country programme
Finding 9. UNICEF requires a more focused approach on priority areas. Current approaches that require
review include its broad and demand-driven approach to working with the government; a
rather generalist approach across sectors; and inconsistent strategies to engage at
subnational level. This poses a challenge to dilute impact by doing a lot of things, especially
considering shrinking resource mobilisation opportunities, and increasing needs in the
country.
72. UNICEF’s demand driven approach to working with government and the desire to respond to
multiple government priorities and other identified needs has boosted relevance but also
resulted in a broad scope of activities, with insufficient prioritization/focus and consolidation of
approach and geographic targeting. The current financial and human resources portfolio still
allows for such a broad scope, but multiplication of activities and thematic areas of intervention,
with insufficient cross sectoral linkages, leads to fragmentation and reduces the impact of the
overall portfolio. This will represent a challenge in the future without a more focused approach
on priority areas.
73. UNICEF’s focus on adolescents has been rather fragmented and prone to overlaps and
duplication. The evaluation mapped multiple interventions implemented by different sections
(child protection, communications, education, etc.) as presented in Figure 1 in Section 2,
indicating gaps in joint approaches. Some duplication of activities (such as overlapping field
missions; activities gathering same people for different topics organised at same time) were also
cited by interviewed stakeholders from UNICEF and local partners. Stakeholder interviews
(within UNICEF and with external partners) revealed confusion with activities pointing to a lack
of interlinkages and insufficient clarity on the sectoral subnational systems strengthening
approach. There are consistency limitations when it comes to efforts to build more capacity at
the subnational level by profiting more from the ZO/provincial level presence; and tracking new
technical working groups at provincial level, and the participation in the D&D process. The CO
has not systematically prioritized nurturing consultative approaches and/or ownership of the
programme at the subnational level or promoted bottom-up planning and coordination efforts
(e.g., supporting provincial mechanisms and Action Working Groups, capacity building, etc.). A
positive example was found to be the engagement with Ministry of Interior (MoI) on promoting
sub-national planning and budgeting, which was considered by UNICEF and government as
helpful to provide scaled support at subnational level. Another positive example relates to the
national and sub-national WASH sector systems strengthening activities and the update and
alignment of the national reporting to global level on WASH SDG goals connected to the Joint
Monitoring Programme (JMP) reporting, among continued COVID restrictions. Example is also
the technical support to MRD and 25 PDRDs to develop their WASH 2022 programme budgets
which was followed by indications of an increase in the state budget for water supply work.
27
5.3 Adequacy and effectiveness of undertaken steps to deliver in convergent approaches (EQ5, EQ6)
Internal convergence
Finding 10. UNICEF’s convergence efforts are still inconsistent, bilateral (section-to-section) and ad-hoc.
Effective convergence efforts included C4D, WASH and Public Finance for Children (PF4C). The
2021 programme review presented a boost for convergence efforts for ECD, climate change
(CC), ADAP, C4D and T4D), though the follow up actions are only slowly gaining traction.
74. As already discussed, the assistance components outlined in the CP were designed to have
stand-alone results, though the review of some interventions shows cross-sector contribution
in the achievement of certain key child indicators. The lack of a common Theory of Change
presents an obstacle to integration or system thinking and convergent approaches. UNICEF’s
sectoral interventions are very broad, covering a range of activities and interactions at central
level and in certain targeted regions (provinces, districts, and communities). As mentioned in
para 56 the programme is quite siloed without a standardised approach to ensure coherence
between sectors.
75. Despite some overlaps or duplication of activities noted in Finding 9 above, evaluation also
found cross-sector synergies and interactions. Positive examples include: 1) integration of policy
and financing for children’s programme components, which aimed at contributing to the
reduction in multidimensional poverty through advocacy for results-based financing for
children across sectors; 2) synergies between Education and Child Protection (CP) (promotion
of safe and protective learning environments from pre-schools to junior secondary schools, as
well as teacher training in CP and positive discipline); 3) synergies between Education and WASH
(upgrading physical school environments through the provision of clean water89 and latrines, as
well as support to MHM in schools); 4) synergies between Child Protection, Social Inclusion and
Governance interventions (in particular cash transfers and increased access to child protection
and other social services); 5) intersections between Child Protection and Health, 6) WASH and
C4D-SBCC contributions to the mainstreaming of Climate resilience; 7) intersections between
Health and Nutrition; 8) intersections between WASH and Nutrition; 9) intersections between
thematic components and IECD; 10) COVID-19 response; etc. (see Annex 8 for a detailed
overview of synergies). Except for C4D-SBCC and the new emerging Climate Programming
(under the WASH lead) which were developed more recently; other cross-component
interactions happened within the evolution of the programme and with full awareness of the
need for systematizing the planning or as interventions to seize openings in terms of
Government priorities, needs or interests, rather than because of systematic higher-level
planning. Examples include the CO’s development of an IECD TOC at the start of COVID-19 to
mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, with a subsequent IECD plan for the office.
This led to IECD funding to several sections working together (e.g from USAID, Australia
Natcom).
76. A hindrance to convergence was found to be a lack of UNICEF’s definition or joint understanding
of what convergence means in terms of their work, leaving it open to interpretation. Some
UNICEF stakeholders considered it an artificial construct and not sufficiently thought through in
terms of specific common goals. Others considered it unnecessary for everything to be linked,
noting that some areas (from a technical perspective) do not necessarily need to converge. The
2021 CP Review was used as an opportunity to re-emphasise UNICEF’s convergence ambition,
particularly through a focus on IECD for the first decade of life, and Adolescent Development
and Participation (ADAP) for the second decade. To operationalise this strategic direction,
89 Note: children are usually requested to bring their own 0,5 l. of safe water per day (provided at home). At schools, the
current approach is the provision of clean water, not of safe drinking water.
28
UNICEF empowered the Kratie ZO to drive and coordinate IECD programmes in the north-east,
in close liaison with all sections. A Joint workplan/framework for IECD was designed to steer joint
planning, implementation, monitoring, and resource mobilization for IECD. At the same time,
the leadership over the ADAP programme implementation was committed to the Siem Reap ZO,
with similar operational linkages with the CO in Phnom Penh. The IECD and ADAP interventions
were also discussed and steered through IECD and ADAP Task Forces (with TORs and M&E
frameworks). UNICEF interlocutors noted that these efforts have helped to coordinate joint
efforts, though they are not sufficient to substantially boost convergence, at least in short to
medium term, because both IECD and ADAP are vertically set, being implemented in one region
each. The ET’s document review, and corroborated by stakeholder interviews, reveals that zonal
offices implement their respective programmes in isolation from one another and with limited
human resources, with interventions focused almost entirely on their respective region. This
hinders the outreach, efficiency, and potential for substantial convergence. The evaluation also
found that ZO are still not fully empowered and capacitated to lead and implement ADAP and
IECD respectively. IECD is attached to Nutrition while ADAP is attached to the Child Protection
section, with these tasks added to already huge portfolios of section staff (since before 2021
review). The lack of exclusively dedicated staff at the CO, and lack of substantial empowerment
of ZO leads, present a challenge regarding moving the programmes forward.
77. The most recent Generation Future pilot implemented by the Communications department was
considered by some UNICEF stakeholders as a new opening for cross-cutting collaboration.
However, this is just one of UNICEF’s multiple youth-related initiatives included under the ADAP
(life skills programme, youth engagement on climate, child protection and environment issues,
youth employability, etc). The document review findings, corroborated by stakeholder
interviews, show that each of these gather and support diverse youth groups, but without
genuine interaction between them, leading to a multiplication of efforts and resources, and
general fragmentation of offers, diminishing transformational potential.
External convergence
Finding 11. UNICEF’s partnership approaches prioritize cooperation with government over, and
sometimes at the expense of, collaboration with other development partners. Joint activities
with other UN agencies were noted, yet more strategic convergence of efforts is warranted.
78. UNICEF’s partnership approaches are comprehensive and multi-pronged, encompassing
engagement with a wide range of national, subnational, and international actors. UNICEF’s
participation in Government and UN-led working and sub-working groups, task forces and other
technical bodies also contribute to enhanced information sharing and convergence (as
confirmed by multiple informants (See Annex 9 with an overview of UNICEF’s engagement in
such groups). For instance, the Nutrition sector was mentioned as a positive example of external
convergence acceleration and joint-programming, through the recently funded Global Action
Plan on Wasting (GAP) project in Cambodia (UNICEF-led, with FAO, WFP, and WHO) in
partnership with the Government of Cambodia and other development partners), that will
strengthen joint efforts to prevent and treat wasting. Some joint projects with UN agencies have
been realized (e.g., the CLEAN Joint Programme proposal on innovative financing for private
sector climate resilient, low carbon water and waste services in Cambodia, with UNDP and the
United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office (UNRC)) that has facilitated inter-agency
collaboration. Convergence with financial institutions (like the ADB and the WB) has been very
much focused on technical issues, bilateral exchanges, and coordination.
29
79. However, the evaluation finds that UNICEF, in some sectors (disability inclusion more generally,
and protection, adolescents), could have publicised more its commitment and efforts to other
development and/or humanitarian partners.
5.4 Achievement of Sector level results in Health and Nutrition, WASH, and Education (EQ 7, EQ 8,
EQ 9)
5.4.1 Health and Nutrition (EQ 7, EQ 8, EQ 9)
Outcome: By 2023 pregnant women, mothers, new-borns, and children under the age of 5 years have
increased equitable access to and the use of quality health and nutrition services, especially in the
north-eastern provinces and among marginalized groups, including during emergencies.
80. The health and nutrition component of the Country Programme aimed to increase equitable
access and use of quality, affordable and sustainable health, and nutrition services, and focused
on supporting the Royal Government of Cambodia to reduce maternal, neonatal and child
mortality, strengthen the capacity of the health workforce and increase the coverage of health
services.
81. Throughout 2020 and 2021, although support to the government’s COVID-19 response was
prioritized, UNICEF’s health and nutrition work, and COVID-19 immunisation and infection
prevention and control, positioned UNICEF as a key health and nutrition sector partner in
Cambodia.
Output 1: By 2023, the national and sub-national health system and service providers have
improved capacity to deliver quality Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH)
interventions
Finding 12. UNICEF’S support in strengthening the implementation of high-impact MNCH and nutrition
services and interventions at national and sub-national level is an important contribution to
the national health system, supporting the scale-up of maternal health services as a
continuum of care. Similarly, UNICEF’s assistance to the national immunization programme
is unanimously considered an important contribution to universal primary health care.
82. The health and nutrition programme focused on the implementation of high-impact MNCH and
nutrition upstream capacity strengthening at national level and support to services at sub-
national level, particularly in the five north-eastern provinces of Kratie, Mondolkiri, Preah Vihear,
Ratanakiri and Stung Treng.
83. The ET found that the UNICEF programme was instrumental in providing technical, financial and
advocacy support to planning, policy and strategy development, direct support in capacity
building and strengthening of service provision and strengthening health sector partner
coordination. Significant results have been achieved in improving both the capacity and
coverage of health and nutrition services, specifically in NE areas, despite limited nutrition
budget, especially prior to COVID-19.
84. The focus of UNICEF’s more sector-intensive work was to improve key MNCH indicators in hard-
to-reach areas across the five north-eastern provinces, with invested efforts to scale-up
maternal health services as a continuum of care: from antenatal care, skilled birth attendance,
and post-partum and post-natal care with integrated early essential new-born care approaches.
85. During COVID-19, despite the country facing large-scale community transmission and
lockdowns, most outputs and targets were achieved. With UNICEF’s direct technical support, the
MoH was able to maintain essential health services and effectively implement IPC against
COVID-19. UNICEF’s direct support to continued integrated health and nutrition community
outreach services led to minimized disruption in the availability of health and nutrition services
in NE provinces.
30
86. With UNICEF financial and technical support, hard-to-reach villages in north-eastern provinces
received at least two rounds of integrated outreach services that included childhood
immunization; antenatal check-up, post-natal care for mothers and newborns; micronutrients
supplementation and deworming; and growth monitoring for under-five children. Stakeholders
noted UNICEF’s contribution to the continuity of essential services to mitigate the impact of the
pandemic. However, despite this, quality and comprehensiveness were impacted by COVID-19
and related restrictions, leading to the decline in coverage of maternal, newborn and child
health services. Barriers to health service utilization included fear of infection transmission,
movement restrictions, and an overstretched health system. The proportion of pregnant
women completing four antenatal care visits and receiving post-natal care as recommended
dropped between 2020 and 2021, after a significant improvement from 2019-2020, despite
UNICEF’s efforts. Supporting the government to accelerate the quality and coverage of routine
and essential health and nutrition services is considered a priority by multiple stakeholders, to
ensure sustainability of results achieved before the pandemic.
87. Capacity building: UNICEF supported maternal, newborn and child health programme staff,
engage with 1032 government health personnel- through on the job coaching, supportive
supervision, and refresher training. Hospital midwives were also trained to coach health centre
midwives on intensive neonatal care and early essential newborn care. Midwives deployed to
remote health facilities received quarterly on-site coaching by provincial health authorities, with
technical and financial support from UNICEF. The revitalization of midwifery and intensive new-
born care coaching is expected to have positive results in the maternal and new-born care cases,
especially in remote areas, as evidenced by this evaluation. Under the GAVI HSS, UNICEF
provided substantial capacity building support to routine immunisation through cold
chain/supply chain strengthening at all levels, community outreach and demand generation.
88. As per UNICEF reports, UNICEF also supported the capacity building of 459 Village Health
Support Group members to implement IPC measures and promote routine MNCH services,
benefiting 190,305 people. UNICEF also used new donor funding and partnerships (e.g
DFAT/Australia; USAID) on COVID-19 health response and vaccination, to leverage Education,
Social Protection, Child Protection and Communications programmes to facilitate a multi-
sectoral approach that contributed to more equitable vaccination among specific vulnerable
groups while expanding its cross-sectoral capacities in T4D and C4D to broaden programming
for children. The integration of T4D and C4D interventions were appreciated by interviewed
stakeholders, who noted innovative approaches that were employed to maximise the potential
of UNICEF’s interventions.
89. Immunization: Programme reports indicate that with UNICEF support, almost 90 percent of
hard-to-reach villages in NE provinces received integrated outreach services, including routine
childhood immunization. UNICEF’s assistance to maintaining the immunization programme
across the country, including COVID-19 immunisation, was unanimously considered an
important contribution to the national health system. The consistent support provided to
government on vaccine logistic procurement and immunization systems support, including the
specific support to north-eastern provinces (indicators 1 and 2) greatly surpassed the targets.90
90. The focus of the UNICEF immunization efforts has been on strengthening the cold chain system
through improved equipment and management, RCCE, increasing community awareness of and
demand for immunization, and increasing immunization coverage in high-risk communities.
Some of the key activities undertaken include technical support to develop web-based
immunization supply chain management, and promoting its use; implementing a
comprehensive cold chain maintenance plan, and implementing a communications strategy,
90 Based on UNICEF monitoring data
31
rolling out standard operation procedure guidelines for the immunization supply chain in
provincial health facilities, and several other important activities.91 UNICEF has worked to
strengthen the national cold chain system through improved equipment and management,
increased community awareness of (and demand for) immunization, and increased coverage in
high-risk communities. Stakeholders recognize UNICEF’s position and approach towards
prioritizing routine health services and routine immunization through government funding
allocation, stronger intersectoral collaboration and increased community engagement. Output
targets were achieved despite constraints in implementation due to the pandemic. Based on
the 2022 mid-year assessment, all 4 indicators under Output 1 were fully achieved or on track,
with 3 them exceeded. Key indicators under Output 1 are shown in Table 1.

91. Despite continued UNICEF’s support, the emerging needs, and priorities due to COVID-19
affected the extent to which government could spend on routine health services. This led to a
drop in the proportion of children under 12 months of age receiving the 3rd dose of DPT. Recent
data from the 2021-22 DHS survey suggests that DTP-1 coverage has dropped to 92% nationally
from 94% in 2014 (increasing the “zero-dose” children92 up to 8% from 6% in 2014), with the
greatest zero dose burden in Ratanak Kiri, where 54% of children age 12-23 months are missing
out, followed by 30% in Kampot. The drop-out rate for DPT vaccine between first and third
doses remained low at national level (2.6%) but in the NE provinces, dropout rate average was
of 10.52%)93. Interviewed stakeholders felt that this drop was beyond UNICEF’s control, noting
the need for sustained government’s focus on maintaining high coverage of routine health
services, even in times of crises. Overall, both DPT1 rates (94%) and DPT3 rates (92%) were high
in 2021 for children under 5 years and the drop-out rate between first and third doses remained
low (2.6%).
92. Output 1: COVID-19 related indicator: UNICEF supported the MoH to minimize COVID-19

with capacity building to handle the workload. There is ample evidence of UNICEF’s key and
effective role in supporting the Government on sector coordination, planning, monitoring, RCCE
in close collaboration with Communications and C4D, and vaccine supply chain management
and cold chain strengthening to respond to COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to the COVID-19
pandemic called for the reprioritization of some components and additional indicators were
added to the Results Framework over the course of 2020 and 2021. Under this output, one new
indicator was added on the number of health facilities supported by UNICEF in 2021 using
COVID-19 funds. Table 2 shows that by mid-2021, 126 health centres were supported. In total,
USD14.4 million was allocated by UNICEF for COVID-19 vaccine shipments during 2021-22.

Output 2: By 2023, the national and sub-national health system and service providers
have improved capacity to deliver quality nutrition-specific interventions
Finding 13. There have been significant efforts and successes in nutrition despite limited funding,
reflected through succeeding to make good progress on all but one indicator under this
Output. UNICEF’s work to strengthen nutrition programming, assisting in systems
strengthening for maternal and child nutrition provided through facility- and community-
based delivery mechanisms is considered a significant contribution. Efforts in addressing
wasting (acute malnutrition), remain an important intervention that needs to be scaled-up
according to international minimum standards in areas of high and very high severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) prevalence. Funding constraints and the COVID-19 response influenced
these results.
93. Maximising its strategic partner role in light of limited funding (see more on funding in Figure 2
in Annex 10), UNICEF has focused on upstream support to nutrition during the reference period,
providing long-term support to the MoH/National Nutrition Programme (NNP) to improve and
optimize nutrition services for children and pregnant women across Cambodia. This approach
was effective in light of funding constraints, as upstream intervention brought important
results. For example, UNICEF’s strong advocacy and technical support resulted in national
roadmaps (i.e., the development of FTRIN 2022-2030, Global Action Plan/GAP to prevent and
treat wasting (2021-2023)) and resource mobilization plans and commitments (i.e., financial
allocation for SAM treatment under the MoH and World Bank supported Cambodia Nutrition
Programme). UNICEF also played a critical role in the Government maintaining the national
budget for RUTF despite fiscal constraints and in supporting Government to strengthen national
goals, plans and resource mobilisation for wasting prevention and treatment and Food Systems
Strengthening (FSS).
94. UNICEF also effectively applied its convener role to support the government in convening
partners to formulate Nutrition 4 Growth (N4G) commitments, aiming to increase investments
in nutrition and accelerate actions across sectors. Advocacy, coordination, and technical support
from UNICEF led to new commitments for nutrition at a time when the socio-economic impacts
33
of COVID-19 were increasing risks of malnutrition, particularly for the poorest and most
vulnerable populations, as found by this evaluation.
95. The assessment of this output of nutritional results is, however, constrained by limited
availability of disaggregated data (by sex, age, location, and disability). While the CP
appropriately prioritised nutrition in northeast provinces, which have the highest child
malnutrition rates, more disaggregated data would enable better identification and targeting of
the most vulnerable. While changes in programme indicators over the past years suggests an
improvement in performance of SAM treatment (e.g., reduction in drop out although defaulter
rates are still high), the coverage of SAM treatment in NE provinces and across the country
remains small, given limited resources available for community screening and referral. Recent
funding opportunities will prioritise addressing these issues from 2023.
96. Capacity Building: To maximize coverage and efficiency gains, UNICEF focused on capacity
building of health facilities and staff, and community outreach, for both health and nutrition (for
example, delivery of key nutrition services through the health sector), which Government and
development partners cited as an effective approach with sustainability potential. Under Output
2, UNICEF planned to strengthen the capacity of the health system94 to identify and treat earlier
groups that are most at risk from prevalent forms of malnutrition, through the screening and
management of SAM. UNICEF also supported the capacity building of health care workers on
early identification and treatment of wasting. Despite the COVID situation, decentralized
trainings were delivered to health workers focusing on the early identification of SAM cases
during outreach services and referral of malnourished children to health facilities for treatment.
97. Despite limited resources, UNICEF Cambodia has made important contributions to mobilize
additional resources to improve SAM identification and treatment (midterm) through the GAP
framework. It also assisted in systems strengthening for maternal and child nutrition provided
through facility- and community-based delivery mechanisms, aiming at maintaining the
continuity of essential nutrition services. Leveraging COVID-19 funding, UNICEF was able to
continue supporting integrated community outreach for nutrition counselling and community-
based screening.
98. The COVID-19 pandemic decreased uptake in services and movement, limited time availability
of health workers and limited resources for scale up on the side of the government. However,
available data from internal UNICEF 2022 mid-year assessment shows 5 out of 6 indicators
under Output 2 were fully achieved or on track and only one constrained (Table 3). Key
successes include already exceeding the target for caregivers of young children receiving IYCF
counselling support through facility-based services and community-based platforms supported
by UNICEF (#2). Health screening reached 61 preschools in IECD enhanced monitoring districts,
benefiting 1,922 children aged 3-6 years (#6). In the first half of 2022, 56 percent of the final
target figure had been achieved.
99. Government and other stakeholders noted the relevance and utility of all UNICEF interventions
for improvement of services, which have contributed to an increase of SAM programme cure
rate (68%).

100. Wasting: UNICEF remains the main partner supporting MoH to prevent and treat wasting
in the country. UNICEF’s continuous technical support and advocacy have led to mobilized
funding to scale up modelled interventions in 4 new provinces with previously no SAM
treatment services by MoH. Acute malnutrition treatment is mainstreamed into routine MoH
Program and Primary Health Care package, available information (including 2021 UNDAF
results) shows that targets for wasting coverage and scale up are behind, mainly because of
fiscal limitations including for community screening-referral.
101. The evaluation found that UNICEF’s technical support and advocacy leveraged financing
from the Cambodia Nutrition Project (CNP) by MoH, World Bank and other donors (Global
Financing Facility, DFAT, KOICA, Germany/KfW), in bringing more resources into wasting
including RUTF commodities, where previously the CNP only focus on prevention of stunting
alone. With UNICEF’s support, Cambodia became one of the frontrunner countries globally to
develop the GAP Wasting roadmap, which enabled UNICEF to an additional USD 3.4 million
(from the donor CIFF) to support efforts to eliminate wasting. Leveraged resources are expected
to enable the government to scale up successful models further, interventions which are viewed
by most KI as needed.
102. Evidence Generation and Advocacy: UNICEF played a leading role in data and analysis
generation (i.e., SE survey results on food security and nutrition, gap analyses, etc) and their
dissemination, and on advocacy and resource mobilization to support wasting prevention and
treatment (GAP roadmap, N4G Commitment). This work resulted in attracting key donor’
funding for nutrition as detailed above.
103. UNICEF conducted in-depth analysis to identify the drivers of malnutrition and indicate the
disparities and levels of vulnerability using the available data (the 2014 CDHS report). This
35
helped define the current country program strategies and programming and provided data and
evidence for the investment case of the CNP. UNICEF also contributed to the COVID-19 Socio-
Economic Impact Assessment, which included an analysis of the COVID-19 impact on Food
Security and Nutrition. This was considered useful by interviewed stakeholders for advocacy for
social cash transfer program to the most affected population. UNICEF also played a major role
in institutionalizing SAM and GMP data though advocacy and technical support and showing the
gaps and challenges in current SAM treatment reporting and demanding to integrate key
nutrition indicators into the Health Management Information System (HMIS).
104. Both document review and stakeholders indicate that UNICEF played a positive role in
advocating for Government budget allocations for, nutrition to ensure continuous availability of
treatment.95 96 UNICEF supported budget analysis and a gap/needs analysis as part of the GAP
national roadmap, considered by key Government stakeholders as an important leverage to
better understand budget needs and commitments for scaling-up wasting treatment, including
advocacy actions towards a gradual increase of the national MoH for RUTF. This involved
technical support and advocacy alongside the PF4C.97 Some of the activities were delayed due
to pandemic restrictions: trainings and workshops were cancelled or postponed due to limits
on gatherings, although these picked up again during 2022.
105. Output 2 - COVID-19 related indicators: UNICEF supported the MoH to issue guidance on
how to implement safe nutrition outreach service during COVID-19. The use of this guideline
helped to ensure continuity of health and nutrition services through community-based outreach
services, including outreach nutrition screening. According to UNICEF data, the outreach
interventions managed to screen 100,000 children under five in 2020 and 61,000 in 2021
through village level activity, screening integrated with SBCC actions to promote nutrition,
counselling, and information on hygiene practices related to infant and young child feeding for
pregnant women and mothers with children under the of age two years. The outreach screening
sessions have been conducted mainly in hard-to-reach areas where families have the challenge
to visit health facilities for regular health and nutrition services.
106. Two new indicators were added to respond to the COVID-19 situation, as shown in Table 4
below. Using social media and other communication channels, and working via school after
their reopening, both targets have been met.

97 The Policy and Public Financing for Children programme (PPF4C) focuses on reducing multi-dimensional child poverty
in Cambodia, particularly for children living in urban and rural poor areas, children from ethnic minorities, and children
with disabilities
36
107. Communication: UNICEF supported IYCF was integrated into COVID-19 risk
communication, and it was estimated that as a result, information on breastfeeding and
nutrition practices reached 2.8 million people. UNICEF also leveraged Education, Social
Protection, and communication platforms to reach school-aged children and their caregivers by
integrating nutrition into the MoEYS’ Home Learning Package, which benefitted 763,865 primary
school children. Nutrition content was also integrated into MOSVY’s cash transfers programme
reaching 110,000 cash transfer beneficiaries.
108. In the absence of survey data on behaviour change (promoted through IYCF, outreach,
SBCC, etc.) (#1), it was not possible to assess the effectiveness of the communication approach,
but key stakeholders indicated this activity had positive influence on better infant feeding
practices, and better utilization of core and subsidized MNCH.
109. Multi-sectoral approach: The ET highlights the critical role that the health and nutrition
programme played in strengthening the multi-sectoral and SBCC approaches using COVID-19
resources as leverage and entry points. Strengthening cross-sectoral capacities and roles in the
areas of T4D and C4D, went beyond benefiting only the COVID-19 health response, it
strengthened UNICEF’s broader, routine programming for children across multiple sectors,
mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in the longer term, through use of digital innovation and
more effective strategies to identify, reach the unreached and bring them closer to services.
110. UNICEF also used the opportunity to ensure stronger cross sectoral approaches in health, ,
integrating youth engagement on climate change from the food and nutrition angle into the
CO’s climate change action plan and new ADAP strategy. The Mid-term review found that
UNICEF reviewed its priorities in health and nutrition and focused efforts towards strengthening
integrated, multi-sectoral approaches, such as IECD programme to include strengthened
routine childhood immunisation, promote nurturing care behaviours, quality nutrition
counselling and more effective management of SAM. Uncertainty of funding and the socio-
economic impact of COVID-19 were the driving factors for UNICEF to rethink the use of
resources towards more integrated approaches to better mitigate COVID-19’s impact on
children and their families. UNICEF is using best practices and lessons from COVID-19 to
support the Government in strengthening equitable primary health care (e.g digital innovation
for a new electronic immunisation record for both COVID-19 and routine childhood
vaccinations).
5.4.2. Achievement of outcome level results
111. Based on desk research and stakeholders’ inputs, this evaluation found that UNICEF’s
technical and financial contributions promoted equitable access to quality health and nutrition
services to pregnant women, mothers, new-borns and children under the age of 5 years,
towards the achievement of target indicators in the area of health and nutrition. This was
achieved through targeted interventions in policy development, capacity building and service
delivery, and sector and resource mobilization.
112. Program implementation data suggest that outcome indicators in targeted vulnerable NE
areas are improving (e.g., ANC, PNC, live births with skilled attendant). However, it is hard to
assess outcomes in some areas where there is limited disaggregated data (e.g., immunization
and SAM management). However, across several indicators, coverage of key health services in
some NE provinces is increasing from year to year whilst others remain underperforming, given
the large structural inequities they face. UNICEF’s role as a key partner in MNCH and nutrition
is instrumental in the achievement of these results. The improved/recovered (identified by
UNICEF as “cured”) and defaulter rates (see table below) is also indicative of improved quality of
services, though challenges remain to meet international standards that correspond to the
management of SAM (including unknown survival rates by age, sex and province). NE provinces
37
are the only provinces that have widely available SAM treatment services in health facilities
(compared to other provinces), indicative of UNICEF investment in wasting in most vulnerable
parts of the country including the northeast. UNICEF’s technical support and advocacy have led
to mobilized funding to scale up interventions in 4 new provinces with no SAM treatment
services by MoH. The ET notes that this remains an important intervention that needs to be
scaled-up in areas of high and very high SAM prevalence.
113. Data from the 2022 mid-year assessment shows that four of the regular programme
indicators were fully achieved by June 2022 (#1, #2, #4, #6); two are partially achieved (#3, #5),
one is missing (no value) (#7); and all the COVID-19 related indicators were surpassed. Although
the available data sources do not allow disaggregation, there is ample evidence to suggest that
geographical targeting of UNICEF’s health and nutrition programme in the NE provinces
represents a critical part of the CPD’s equity approach.

114. Throughout CPD implementation, UNICEF supported system strengthening through
facilitating the development of strategies and roadmaps, mobilizing resources, and providing
direct services. Stakeholders have noted UNICEFs role in improving the capacities of service
providers and expanding integrated service delivery in hard- to- reach operational districts in
the north-eastern provinces. Document review and stakeholder interviews provide evidence of
UNICEF’s contributions to increasing availability of essential MNCH and nutrition services for
hard to reach and marginalized populations, contributing to the recorded improvements in the
coverage of antenatal care, skilled attendance during delivery, postpartum care, and reduction
of drop-out rates of vaccines. Outreach services were complemented with facility-based service
38
delivery and monitoring system strengthening. UNICEF also initiated and supported expanded
community-based integrated services for children98.
115. Between 2021 and 2022, there was a striking increase in ante-natal care (ANC) 4+ visits (#1),
skilled birth attendance (#2), and post-natal care (PNC) within two days (#4). This is very positive,
and MoH reports indicate that UNICEF’s support in providing integrated health and nutrition
outreach services substantially brough services closer to communities helping address the
access and coverage barriers, though outstanding issues remain. The number of births
delivered in a health facility (#3) in the north-eastern provinces also shows some improvement
in 2022, but it is still below the 2019 baseline (which stakeholders linked to pandemic related
factors that many women chose to deliver in private settings).
116. Improved cure and defaulter rate is indicative of improved quality of services. The increase
of the SAM cure rate from 59 percent in 2020 to 68 percent in 2021 (#6), and a reduction in
defaulters from 40 percent to 32 percent in the same years, are positive achievements. The fact
that NE provinces are the only provinces that have full wide SAM treatment services in health
facilities (compared to other provinces) strongly speaks to UNICEF’s investment in wasting in
most vulnerable parts of the country.
117. Improved SAM cure and defaulter rate is also indicative of improved quality of services. The
increase of the SAM cure rate from 59 percent in 2020 to 68 percent in 2021 (#6), and a reduction
in defaulters from 40 percent to 32 percent in the same years, are positive achievements. The
fact that NE provinces are the only provinces that have full, widely available SAM treatment
services in health facilities (compared to other provinces) strongly speaks to UNICEFs
investment in wasting in most vulnerable parts of the country.
118. CDHS immunization coverage data between 2014 and 2021/2022 shows overall
improvement in northeast provinces when considering full vaccinated children against basic
antigens. Many NE provinces are not far off to the national average, and higher than other
provinces in the country where there was less intensive integrated health and nutrition
community outreach by MOH, as in NE with support of UNICEF. Table 7 below shows CDHS
immunization coverage indicators between 2014 and 2021/2022 for all provinces including the
NE ones where UNICEF has provided a lot of sub-national and community level.

98 Activities were conducted to help families, communities and schoolteachers identify and follow children with illness
and/or impairment that could benefit from early, immediate and/or ongoing medical attention. UNICEF supported
implementation of compressive nutrition program which is integrated in to the health system. The major programs
supported were Management of Sever Acute Malnutrition (SAM), promotion of Maternal Infant and Young Child Nutrition
and salt iodization.

119. COVID-19 related indicators: Since the start of the pandemic, UNICEF’s focus has been the
response to COVID-19 and its central role in the SERF’s Health First pillar. With more emergency
funding available, additional support was provided to essential routine programming and
community integrated health and nutrition services, sub-national capacity building in targeted
provinces, etc. It is important to highlight that prior to the pandemic, the health programme had
limited funding (even to support the CPD plans). Table 7 shows the added COVID-19 indicators
all of which have been achieved/surpassed.

120. All four indicators have been surpassed, and UNICEF’s contribution to the successful
National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP)99 is widely recognized by the Government,
99 MOH. 2021. National Deployment and Vaccination Plan For COVID-19 Vaccines – National Immunization Program.
Phnom Penh. The plan was updated several times
40
UN agencies and development partners. UNICEF played a key role in vaccine supply chain
management and cold chain strengthening in support of the Government, based on a detailed
cold chain capacity assessment and modelling exercise to enable use of mRNA vaccines. This
enabled the Government to diversify the vaccine portfolio and to have a low reported wastage
rate (#2), as other partners have noted.100,101
121. Numerous informants confirmed (supported by documented evidence), that the NDVP was
consistent with international norms and safeguards regarding the inclusion of marginalized and
vulnerable groups. Key stakeholders confirmed that UNICEF’s long-standing country presence,
immunization expertise and field proximity helped the MoH to strategize how to best reach
disadvantaged and more remote populations for vaccination, expanding vaccine delivery
options from exclusively hospitals (as in the first phase) to selected health centres and mobile
clinics in remote areas, thus greatly increasing the number of delivery points.102
5.4.3 WASH
Outcome: By 2023, girls and boys, particularly the most vulnerable, have increased equitable access
to, and sustainable use of safe water, and adoption of safe sanitation and hygiene practices, including
during humanitarian situations.
122. The WASH component of the CP aimed to increase equitable access and sustained use of
water, and the adoption of safe sanitation and hygiene practices, to achieve compelling results
in children’s survival, health, and education. Three outputs were designed to deliver this
outcome, and the Evaluation Team’s findings, based on data from multiple sources, and their
transformative potential, are given below.
Output 1: By 2023, national and sub-national authorities have strengthened capacity to
plan, coordinate, and monitor inclusive, quality, child-focused WASH services to
communities and institutions (schools and health care facilities), including in emergencies.
Finding 14. The WASH programme has made consistent efforts to build more capacity on the sub-
national level (focusing on rural WASH), showing a coherent balance of investment and
prioritization between national level policy guidance and policy implementation support
(national and sub-national levels). The WASH support contributed to identifying key
challenges for the operationalization of the WASH policies within the framework of D&D
process roll out.
123. Output 1 addresses the enabling environment, and all indicators, as shown in Table 8, are
on track and expected to be achieved by the end of 2022. One indicator (#4) is already fully
achieved.103

124. Capacity Building UNICEF WASH programme has made consistent efforts to increase
capacities at national and sub-national levels, through investment and support to delivering
policy guidance and implementation support in key areas, including the formulation of state
rural WASH budget. This has helped make more efficient use of available resources, and
addressed challenges faced by ongoing rollout of the D&D reforms related to functions,
resources, and responsibilities for the lower administrative levels.
125. Key Government partners in this area are Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and
Innovation (MISTI) and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). Government stakeholders
indicated that they very much appreciated the broad support UNICEF is giving in this sector
including catalytic contribution to the achievement of results through the convening of key
partnerships with government, CSO, and private sector stakeholders.
126. A key part of the D&D reforms is to move decision making, functions related to service
delivery and budget responsibilities to local levels, thus empowering local authorities to plan
and implement necessary improvement for service reach, supporting the development of their
operational and management capacity. To this end, UNICEF has helped over 132 communes
(#1) build a WASH component into their local planning. Mapping of rural water supply in five
provinces was undertaken to help prioritize available resources. UNICEF gave technical support
to the MRD and 25 provincial departments to develop their 2022 budgets, and to ensure that
WASH was included to allow them to undertake their basic responsibilities in the sector.
127. Improving data management and information has been key to support the sector with an
improved regulatory framework and guidelines for ensuring sustainability of the water supply
management arrangements. An assessment on the sustainability of rural water supply including
source point solutions and community-based piped systems has been undertaken, along with
technical support to ensure the mainstreaming of climate risk assessments into the on-going
revision of the MRD and MISTI’s water safety plan guidelines for water supply (both rural and
urban). Indicator #2 shows progress reports are being generated.
128. Five provincial WASH technical working groups (TWGs) in six target provinces meet regularly,
and UNICEF tracks and supports new TWGs as they are established. WASH emergency
preparedness and response plans (#4) have been prepared for six provinces, and Development
Action Plans developed in three provinces, with support from UNICEF and partners. UNICEF’s
proactive engagement and convener role was considered as constructive by interviewed
stakeholders.
Output 2: By 2023, state and non-state actors have strengthened capacity to implement
programmes to increase equitable access to basic, safe, climate resilient water supply for
people at home, in schools, and health care facilities in targeted UNICEF districts.
42
Finding 15. UNICEF provided effective support to the Government partners to repurpose WASH
coordination, planning, and information management arrangements for emergency response
– including COVID-19
129. For Output 2, two of the four indicators (#1 and #3 in Table 9) were already achieved by mid-
2022. The other two are likely to be reached by the end of 2022. One new climate resilience
indicator was added to this Output for the 2022 and 2023 Results Matrix, but it has not yet been
measured.104

indicators, including ranking Cambodia between 2015 and 2020/2021 as:
● the most successful country in the world in reducing the percentage of schools with no
hygiene service;
● the most successful country in the world in reducing household open defecation;
● the second most successful in the world in increasing basic household sanitation;
● the ninth in the world in increasing basic household hygiene.
132. There were also significant challenges:
● financing gaps and insufficient state investment for rural WASH services;
● poor access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately affecting rural communities,
with 25 percent of the rural population still practicing open defecation, and only 65 percent
having access to a basic water supply;
● access to safely managed water and sanitation shows even more disparities between
urban and rural areas, and inequities between the richest and the poorest.
133. Feedback from multiple sources indicates that UNICEF’s WASH programme is closely aligned
with the Government’s priorities and national targets, but these do not always reflect adherence
to international minimum standards, such as WASH activities and facilities in schools
(insufficient ratio of facilities for boys/girls, disability adaptation, etc.). Government commitment
and financing for rural WASH programming remains insufficient to make any substantial
progress.
134. The plan to increase access to sanitation activities through the private sector (#1) has
resulted in the WASH programme working with 19 local businesses in Kratie rovince on the
designs of climate resilient and safely managed sanitation facilities, adapted from the MRD

guidelines and manuals. The programme has field-tested these facilities in flood risk areas with
the local authorities. While this is above the set target, it remains very localized. Other private
sector initiatives have included working with bottled water producers about improving quality
and aiming for a standard mark.
135. Indicators #2, #3 and #4 are all on track despite funding constraints for the WASH
programme. In several provinces, activities such as delivering pro-poor latrine ‘smart subsidies’
to vulnerable groups, in conjunction with the MRD, have been delayed due to COVID-19
restrictions; as have the MRD’s guidelines for transferring key functions to the sub-national level.
A market assessment of the sanitation sector in the north-eastern provinces is currently
underway.
136. Secondary data and primary-level feedback to the evaluation, particularly from Government
stakeholders, highlighted some other important contributions and approaches by the WASH
programme that are not captured under these indicators. Action to address sanitation and
hygiene bottlenecks included systems strengthening work to accelerate and scale up open
defecation free (ODF) sanitation results and inclusion of hand hygiene in Cambodia’s ODF
criteria and are detailed elsewhere in this report.
137. The COVID-19 pandemic impacts on existing programmes with new priorities. KII confirmed
that UNICEF had delivered a strong emergency response in the WASH sector, working with the
Government and sector partners to ensure a coordinated approach on work plans, the
monitoring frameworks, etc. As Table 10 shows, both new indicators for sanitation activities
under the COVID-19 updates have been achieved.

138. In response to COVID-19 programming, UNICEF procured 780,000 bars of locally produced
soap and 31,500 recycled plastic buckets from local traders. UNICEF and the MRD convened
virtual WASH sector stakeholder coordination meetings and updated the WASH management
information systems to identify gaps and strengthen the coverage of hand hygiene promotion.
WASH in schools was an outstanding activity, providing toilet, handwashing facilities and other
material for hygiene sanitation, which were part of the Government’s minimum standards to
allow schools to reopen. Another recent evaluation105 confirmed that the increased focus on
sanitation during the pandemic was still in evidence in schools and being actively practiced by
the children.
139. Hygiene promotion was another important activity during the pandemic: hand hygiene
messages via mobile loudspeaker and local radio in six provinces and via social media (more
than 1,132,000 views) – although maintaining or increasing this awareness will be an ongoing
challenge. Hand hygiene supplies were distributed to people registered as IDPoor and factory
workers, to health care facilities in seven provinces, and to 158 quarantine/treatment sites and
red zone areas in 12 provinces and in the capital. UNICEF played a key role in the first
collaboration between a mobile telecommunications operator and the MRD to widely distribute
handwashing voice messages.

Output 3. By 2023, state and non-state actors have strengthened capacity to implement
programmes to increase equitable access to basic, safe, climate resilient water supply for
people at home, in schools, and health care facilities in targeted UNICEF districts.
Finding 16. UNICEF contributed to an overall increase in the capacity of state and non-state actors to
develop and implement measures aimed at increasing access to basic, safe, climate resilient
water supply for people in schools and health care facilities in targeted UNICEF districts.
However, more transformative system results are muted by challenges relating to water
accessibility and resilience.
140. Cambodia classifies its water supply in two ways: by the type of supply system, piped water
supply106 and the rural supply in areas without a pipeline connection, currently using open wells
and ponds, deep wells, water harvesting, etc., under the MRD. UNICEF focuses primarily on the
rural supply side and the improvements to be made there, but the policy work often overlaps
between the two ministries. For example, the programme has supported the Guiding Principles
for Pro-Poor Water Connections Subsidies, and MISTI’s field testing the implementation of piped
water connection to poor households through development and trialling of tools on operator
and beneficiary selection and agreements – all tools with the potential for scale-up through a
pro-poor piped subsidy modelling and programme that would facilitate additional underserved
rural areas to be covered. There remains the need to strengthen the enabling environment for
climate resilient water supply programming and operational capacity, including climate risk
assessment at both national and sub-national levels, for water supply work be viable and
sustainable.
141. Under Output 3 (equitable water access), three of the indicators are already fully achieved
(#1, #2 and #3 as shown in Table 11), and the fourth one is on track to be achieved by the end
of 2022.

142. A current national priority under D&D is to provide piped water supply to communities as a
key step to improve not only their access to clean water, but also, critically, to safe water
(quality). Working with the provincial staff of the MISTI, the WASH programme has helped
strengthen the capacity and systems for climate resilient water supply service delivery through
technical and financial support to operationalize the official decision, starting with 250 IDPoor
households in three provinces, thereby developing the implementation and management
capacity of MISTI in this area. In turn, this has brought new funding to accelerate the connection
of poor households to piped water supply systems.
106 Piped water supply is overseen by the MISTI – with most of service provision concentrated in large cities,
45
143. A range of other activities have been supported, covering advocacy and ‘piped water
campaigns’, development of an online portal for rural WASH MIS data (with training conducted
to department focal points in all provinces), development of a climate risk-informed training
package, and technical support for a government delegation to the 2022 Sanitation and Water
for All Sectors Ministerial Meeting.
144. Over time, these initiatives should help increase the number of people who will ultimately
benefit from new connections to piped (clean) water, but indicator #1 under this Output – which
has been achieved – is a positive step forward. Convergence with the ECD programming,
especially in the north-eastern provinces, means the programme will be more focused on water
supply starting from 2023, ensuring that underserved children in these provinces equitably use
water, including during humanitarian situations, allowing them to live in a healthier and cleaner
environment.
145. Indicator #2 has also been surpassed with 14 communes including water safety plans within
their commune level plans. Water safety planning (with training provided to MRD’s Rural Water
Supply teams), and development of climate risk assessment tools adapted for the country
context. At the sub-national level climate risk informed water safety analysis and planning was
facilitated in 22 target communes, with the capacity of 289 local government officers built
through their engagement with planning processes of climate risk assessments, with quality
assurance provided by UNICEF. The programme also provided technical support to mapping
the current water supply situation, groundwater quality, climate hazards and vulnerable
population (IDPoor and children <5y) for data-led water supply planning and decision making in
five provinces. The data from this mapping allowed MRD to identify priority communes for water
safety planning, which will assist planning and targeting for future rural water supply
interventions.
146. Target numbers for #3 and #4 have also been met under this programme. The programme
has ensured a handover agreement as these facilities have been completed, between the
various partners, outlining future maintenance roles and responsibilities, which should ensure
their use into the future. However, despite UNICEF’s contribution to increase WASH services in
schools and health care facilities, the national progress is only partially measured and available
data is particularly concerning. Figure 1 in Annex 11 gives additional information in the three
WASH areas, clearly showing the challenges to be addressed, particularly in the rural areas.
147. Primary-level feedback to the evaluation, particularly from Government stakeholders,
highlighted several other important contributions and approaches by the WASH programme
that are not captured under the indicators. In summary, these covered:
● consistent perception of truly sharing the work as partners and preparing it together with
them; enhanced national and sub-national sector coordination
● strengthening activities and updated the national reporting to global level on WASH SDG
goals
● WASH key results and activities have been carefully designed, revised, and refined to
enhance appropriateness to each WASH output, and the overall WASH outcome
● promotion of COVID-19 infection prevention and control through community and mass
media activities, complementing messages in the national ‘3 do’s and 3 don’ts’ campaign
● increase partnerships with private sector and strengthen working relationship with MISTI
and MPWT.
● improvement of data (nationwide) with gender, disability, equity approaches; and use of
innovative approaches (e.g: Rural WASH Management Information System – linked to NAPs;
WASH SDG systems strengthening for alignment of national tools (CSES and census) to global
definitions – connected to JMP reporting and baseline WASH surveys).
● supported MRD to develop its first Emergency Response Contingency Plan on rural WASH,
including strengthening capacity on emergency preparedness and response
46
5.4.3. Achievement of Outcome level Results
148. Despite important funding gaps for the WASH component, the section optimized
effectiveness by carefully adapting, reviewing, and refining strategies and activities under each
output to try to achieve the overall WASH outcome. Water supply interventions have
contributed to achieve the CP outcome through work with social policy and dialogue with MEF
and MRD to advocate for increased public funding for water supply, and to mainstream climate
resilient water supply into its programming, including in institutions.
149. Based on the available data, two of the Outcome level indicators (shown in Table 12 below)
are expected to be achieved by 2023, three are constrained and one is missing (no value).

150. Water quality and quantity are defining dimensions of safe water supply. With only a small
percentage of rural drinking water classified as ‘safely managed’ (around 18 percent; and
compared with 57 per cent of urban drinking water), there is an urgent need to ensure that rural
populations have access to clean, climate-resilient water supply in homes, schools, and
healthcare facilities, particularly in more vulnerable areas. Cambodia’s stated goal108 is to reach
90 percent of the rural population having access to improved drinking water by 2023, and 33
percent access to safely managed drinking water109. Although the WASH programme target
communities started with a baseline of 54 percent (#1), progress has been slow, and it is unlikely
the target will be reached by the end of the period.
151. The under-performance of rural water programming compared to rural sanitation in
Cambodia remains a major challenge, with the top-down, centralized funding and service
delivery model of rural water supply making it vulnerable to bottlenecks in investments and
implementation when compared to the bottom-up model of rural sanitation, where households

108 Cambodia falls behind its national SDGs, and the secondary targets of the Strategic Framework for the 2nd NFSN 2019-
2023 in Cambodia
109 WHO/UNICEF defines a safely managed drinking water as an improved water source that is accessible on premises,
available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination. Improved water sources include: piped
water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water.
47
largely finance their own needs, and small entrepreneurs deliver service improvements. Cuts in
donor funding have further impacted on these activities. There is also the need to transition
from clean to safe water approach, and there are currently insufficient needs assessments to
give a better idea of interventions that should take place to move in this direction, and to identify
how far Cambodia is from the SDGs target.
152. Improving the general sanitation situation in rural Cambodia remains a major challenge: for
example, 14 percent of rural households had no access to soap and 15 percent no handwashing
facilities. Scarcity of water compounds this problem. Data on access to basic hygiene shows
several challenges: with a 2020 baseline of 70.85 percent, and the annual increase plateaued at
1.5 percent since 2010, the country is not on track to reach the national in rural areas by 2025,
nor the global SDG target date of 2030.
153. Improving basic hygiene practices is also challenging. Data from the JMP report shows that
Cambodia achieved the ninth largest increase in basic hygiene in the world between 2015 and
2020, with a jump of seven percent.110 Household hygiene practices were strengthened in 2021
through the messages disseminated during the COVID-19 response. The WASH programme
indicators (#2 and #3) refer to this area of work in selected places, and while they may show
improvements over the baseline, both are unlikely to meet their targets within the programme
period.
154. Although the first open defecation free (ODF) province in the country was declared in 2021
(benefiting a population of over 525,000 people), Cambodia is off track to meet its basic
sanitation national or global targets with the annual rate of improvement plateaued in rural
areas at three percent, and the reduction in rural open defecation at 3.6 percent (since 2000).
The outcome indicator #2 is ‘partially achieved’ at 64 percent compared to a target of 66 percent.
UNICEF also supports the ODF modelling replication and scale-up in six provinces, also resulting
in one district (Ou Chum, population over 11,800 people) which was also declared the first ODF
district in the northeast of Cambodia.
155. Ending ODF in rural areas implies that the people have access to alternatives. Action to
address these bottlenecks included systems strengthening work to accelerate and scale up ODF
sanitation results and an enabling environment for hand hygiene. Again, some national
progress has been made, including one province being declared ODF-free, and the UNICEF
programme is on track (#5) to reach the target in its target communities, but this masks the
wider problems faced in the country. UNICEF supported pro-poor market and finance-based
approaches to sanitation, through subsidies and payment by facilitating instalment modalities
for families facing cashflow constraints, opening opportunities to poor households to purchase
a partially subsidized toilet; and remote monitoring methods were used for sanitation
programme assurance in more than half of the target provinces, to ensure proper programming
and use of funds.
156. It was reported that in 2019 only 73 percent of schools had a basic water supply, and 32
percent had basic sanitation facilities – with the rural schools likely to be below these figures. 111
While the programme targets are likely to be met for water (#6), there is no data for those
schools that were targeted for water and sanitation services and menstrual hygiene facilities
(#4). Also see Figure 2 in the Annex 11. Without such facilities, there are critical bottlenecks and
obstacles for girls’ participation in education, and UNICEF works with the Government to model
and scale up inclusive sanitation and hygiene improvements, such as toilets that are usable,
separated for patients and staff, private for women, equipped for menstrual hygiene

management, and accessible for people with limited mobility, and that demonstrate how
national guidance on WASH can be implemented.
157. Some advances (either new facilities or repairs) were made at some schools while they were
closed during the pandemic, but there remains much to be done. UNICEF promotes trials of
solutions that can be safely managed on site, and are climate resilient, such as improved water
sources, and flood-resilient latrines and latrines that use minimal water. This informs decisions
on which climate-resilient WASH solutions to model and bring to scale.
5.4.4 Education
Outcome: By 2023, girls and boys have expanded access to inclusive, egalitarian, relevant, and high-
quality early childhood and basic education.
158. The education component of the CP aimed to ensure that every child can learn and
emphasized fair and inclusive access to education for children with disabilities, children from
racial and ethnic minorities, and children living in rural and urban impoverished regions.
Output 1: Support to the enhancement of the MoEYS’ capacity to plan and monitor results-
based plans and budgets
Finding 127. UNICEF has contributed to enhanced MoEYS’ capacity to navigate transformation of the
quality, inclusiveness and relevance of education policies and services, including by building
on the capacity of its human resources to plan, implement and monitor Education Strategic
Plan targets. However, operationalization of ambitious educational reform plans at
subnational level is slow and warrants consolidated focus on priority areas.
159. Long-term cooperation between UNICEF and MoEYS and consistent donor financing,
especially from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the
Capacity Development Partnership Fund (CDPF)112, enabled continuing and broad support for
the Ministry's many reform initiatives. Being needs-based and demand-driven, the CDPF
portfolio offered the chance to cover a variety of interventions.
160. The evaluation recognizes an internally consistent and integrated approach to national level
policy making and the building of the MoEYS’ capacities, and for other state institutions.
Interviewed stakeholders highlighted UNICEF’s contributions at scale through supporting the
policies and programmes, which have created a strong framework, though they confirmed that
capacity strengthening is complex in a country like Cambodia (because of the size of its
educational system, the recent decentralisation of the education sector and persistent needs).
However, a broad needs-based portfolio presented challenges due to the wide range of
activities and multiple implementing partners, and engagement was reported to be ‘at times
insubstantial’ and uneven, as it focused at central rather than subnational level.
161. The ET found that a more coordinated approach connecting different education
interventions across the three output areas would have contributed more substantially and
comprehensively to reform (e.g., integrating and reporting in particular activities under Output
1 and 2).
162. Due to the pandemic, approximately 93 per cent of the 2020 work plan activities faced
delays. By the end of 2021, most UNICEF's output level indicators had been met, as presented
in Table 13. Table 1 in Annex 12 also shows that the evaluation identified some outputs that
112 The CDPF multi-donor partnership was programmed to support the implementation of MoEYS’ Capacity Development
Master Plan, comprising contributions from SIDA, EU, USAID, GPE and UNICEF, and included 3 technical service providers
(IIEP, ITC-ILO and VSO), with UNICEF serving as CDPF Secretariat and fund manager. With an initially planned
programmable budget of nearly $5.5 million for the CDPF in 2020, the support was planned through 135 activities with
convening actions and advocacy by CDPF partners.
49
were successfully provided to the MoEYS. These outputs are grouped under support to
enhanced governance; competencies and skills; handbooks and manuals; and support to
service provision. Some key examples: under governance, UNICEF played a critical role in
helping MoEYS complete its Functional review (which resulted in revised job descriptions and
clarity of roles); the review strategic policy documents (such as the ESP), the design and
implementation of the scholarship policies as well as to strengthen its finance and budgeting
process with support of CDPF and in cooperation between the education and social policy
sections. Interviewed stakeholders praised the quality and effectiveness of such interventions,
as helpful to strengthen institutional and policy capacity of MoEYS.
TABLE 12 EDUCATION RESULTS (OUTPUT 1)
Source: UNICEF RAM data
163. Capacity Building: Under competencies, the ability of sub-national education officials to
plan and budget based on results has risen. The use of tools designed to evaluate Annual
Operational Plans (AOPs) shows that they are more effective, goal-oriented, and gender-
sensitive. Support to the MoEYS to conduct a gender audit helped identify practical
opportunities to promote organizational learning and action on how to achieve gender-
equitable management and leadership, which resulted in the development of the MoEYS'
gender mainstreaming action plan (2020-2024).
164. Through the strengthening of preschool and regional teacher training centres (TTCs),
important investments have been made to upskill and support teacher educators. The
transition from 12+2 to 12+4 teacher education is still in its infancy, hence more work needs to
be done to improve the TTC teaching resources (human and material).
165. To create rules and procedures for Continuous Professional Development and the Teacher
Career Pathway, UNICEF actively assisted the MoEYS to develop the necessary policies and
guidelines and supported the design of a school-based mentoring programme that should
contribute to improved competencies of early grade teachers, with plans also to establish a
longer-term school-based mentoring system.
50
166. It was also noted that UNICEF supported the MoEYS’s monitoring and evidence generation
through making improvements in the tracking methods and indicators of the Education
Management Information System (EMIS), which systematically produces key education data and
indicators that are used for overall sector monitoring at both the central and sub-national levels.
The EMIS was supported by a range of development partners (UNICEF, the ADB, GIZ, EU, WFP
and more recently, the CDPF III); , however some development partners still consider EMIS to
be not yet fully functional in terms of using data for policy and planning.
Output 2: Supporting capacity strengthening of school leaders and teachers to deliver
gender-responsive, equitable, inclusive, and relevant quality education
Finding 18. UNICEF’s support to the technical and system strengthening in areas such as inclusive
education, multi-lingual education and supporting the upscaling of positive discipline
training for teachers to address the issues of corporal punishment and other violence in
school has brought a number of positive short term results, that help create strong
foundation for further and deeper investment in enhancement of quality and accessibility of
education, though its full institutionalisation or scale has not yet materialised despite long
term support. Further efforts in all areas are required.
167. The achievements under this Output have been mixed, as can be seen from an overview of
indicators in Table 14 below. Output level results are presented in full in Table 2, in Annex 12.
51
TABLE 13 EDUCATION RESULTS (OUTPUT 2)
Source: UNICEF RAM data
168. UNICEF's technical and policy level support for teacher and school leader capacity building
for ECE and primary education has been extensive and multifaceted, addressing a wide range
of sector priorities and capacity gaps. The improvement of classroom management,
instructional methods, and infrastructure within the Community Preschools (CPS) had resulted
in 1,250 CPS succeeding to meet MoEYS minimum quality criteria. These included significant
and broad investments in improving educational access and quality, particularly among the
most disadvantaged populations. As a result of such efforts, UNICEF data shows that UNICEF
contributed to enabling national system to enrol approximately 327,000 children aged 3 to 5
years of age in ECE programmes (165,000 girls) out of which an estimated 68,000 (35,000 girls)
are enrolled in ECE programmes within the community-based preschools supported by UNICEF
and other education partners113.
169. Interviewed stakeholders considered that UNICEF had contributed to raising awareness of
problems minority children face in the educational system, and had helped move this up the

based%20financing%20(Cambodia).pdf
52
MOEYS agenda, although further efforts (going beyond the regions UNICEF has covered to date)
to create more transformative results beyond individual level are still required.
170. The ET found that UNICEF life cycle approach and the life skills education interventions both
support the development of 21st century skills, including self-directed learning. Stakeholders
view that UNICEF’s advocacy and support to fight against physical punishment and gender-
based violence in schools, including through cross-sectoral initiatives like the positive discipline
course, have been essential and contributing to a larger effort to defend children's rights. Some
stakeholders noted that while UNICEF's contribution in this area is significant, the current
scattered initiatives do not provide much national value or transformative potential considering
patriarchal norms and traditions.
171. MoEYS and UNICEF collaborated to ensure COVID-19 related learning loss was minimised
despite 30 percent of children not consistently having access to online learning options, despite
all efforts. Offline and paper-based resources were identified as an alternative solution,
especially for the most vulnerable children, to continue learning during school closures. UNICEF
and CDPF partners coordinated to support the development and distribution of a paper-based
Home-Learning Package (HLP) to 760,000 Grade 1 and 2 students and their teachers in all 25
provinces.
172. UNICEF’s advocacy efforts for safe school reopening both through the ESWG and wider
campaigns have also been extensive and considered by all interviewed stakeholders as crucial
in combination with provision of educational resources mentioned above to overcome the
challenges posed by school closures.
173. UNICEF also had some engagement in inclusive education, albeit fragmented. UNICEF’s
support to adapting teaching/learning material and include some inclusive services were
considered as contributing to transformative potential, but not sufficient due to their small
scale. These interventions were therefore considered by interviewed national and international
stakeholders as only "scratching the surface" of the more comprehensive reforms required to
significantly improve inclusive education for all children.
174. Informants reported that UNICEF's efforts to improve the accessibility of education to
minorities through support to multi-lingual education materials (including sign language),
teacher training and the scholarship programme added value to its system support efforts.
175. The scholarship programme has also helped empower minority groups, while also
attracting new financial support to expand the programme's reach. UNICEF data shows that
about 5,000 children across in four north-eastern provinces benefited from the package in
minority languages. The resources continued to be helpful for remedial learning once pupils
returned to school, despite being designed initially for home study during the school shutdown.
Informant feedback indicated this support was essential to prevent learning loss during the
pandemic closures.
53
Output 3: Supporting the enhancement of capacity of communities to demand
accountability and relevant quality education services
Finding 19. Contributions to the enhancement of capacity of communities to demand accountability
and relevant quality education services have thus far been minimal, mainly due to COVID-19
which led to reorientation of the support. The “back to school” campaign lead by UNICEF was
considered as very effective and as a good illustration of UNICEF’s value added.
176. UNICEF’s rather ambitious agenda of Communication for Education (C4E) was
mainstreamed, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed or postponed many activities. The
partnership between NGOs in the education sector has improved: the support to the NEP’s
strategic reorientation and institutional capacity development (through a sub-grant and on-the-
job strategic support to NEP’s executive leadership and staff) led to some improvements in the
collaboration between NGOs in the education sector, though numerous interviewees indicated
this could be further enhanced. The evaluation found that the C4E campaign and related wider
communication efforts of UNICEF were very effective, promoting good practices and raising
awareness on children’s rights and needs.
177. UNICEF adapted to the pandemic challenges by working proactively on community
engagement and risk communication activities and assets, including COVID-19 prevention and
mitigation messages for students, teachers, and communities. Using social media channels,
more than 50 education-related IEC assets, including films, posters, booklets, and articles were
created. Up to 1.7 million views per post were registered in 2020 alone.
178. Prior to schools reopening, UNICEF and MoEYS launched the nationwide Back to School
campaign, which stressed the importance of good hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures,
as well as children’s wellbeing in the areas of education, health, nutrition, and protection, with
many stakeholders remarking on its effectiveness.
179. The new CO SBC strategy (June 2022) also defines some additional education priorities,
providing openings for further investment across these areas.
Achievement of outcome level results
Finding 20. Despite UNICEF's efforts, overall progress toward achieving the CP’s expected outcome under
Goal Area 2 has been slow. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and extended school
closures were significant limiting factors. Other factors included institutional and, in some
cases, financial constraints on scaling up working methods and approaches. Nevertheless,
evidence suggests that UNICEF's significant contribution to the education sector, reform, and
emergency response is widely recognized.
180. Despite extensive efforts from UNICEF, the overall progress towards achieving the CP
anticipated outcome under Goal Area 2 has been limited. The COVID-19 pandemic and
subsequent extended school closures were major restricting factors that impacted across
Cambodia's education sector. Institutional and, in some cases, financial restrictions on scaling
up working methods and approaches were other elements that affected the achievement of
results.
181. Evidence indicates that UNICEF's major contribution to the education sector, reform, and
emergency response is widely acknowledged. A broad improvement in capability and
leadership across structures has been facilitated through technical help provided to the MoEYS.
Along with the establishment of the groundwork for high standards of education, there were
also notable advancements in the coordination of planning and resource distribution, along
with foundations set for improved education quality (through teacher training, curriculum
frameworks, classroom-based assessment guidelines, etc.)
54
182. Direct outreach to schools and final beneficiaries (through life skills education, school-based
positive discipline, minority education, and return to schools following COVID-19), has also
resulted in examples of improved practices, although the lack of such interventions on a large
scale constrains wider transformative change. The positive trend in enrolment in ECE that had
continued since 2012 stalled in 2021: the age-specific enrolment rate in ECE among 5-year-olds
fell from 62.9 percent in 2020 to 61.1 percent in 2022 (Table 15).
TABLE 14 EDUCATION SECTOR RESULTS (OUTCOME LEVEL)
Source: UNICEF RAM data
183. Numerous factors due to multiple causes, including COVID-19, have impacted the education
sector in Cambodia. The deteriorating socio-economic situation and difficulties to sustain
learning during school closures, increased domestic violence during lockdowns and child labour
and drop out, particularly among boys, etc. as described earlier have all contributed. These
elements have had a profoundly detrimental impact on educational results and instruction.
Financial limitations for implementation of the reforms on the side of the government were
reported to be another obstacle to getting the desired results.
Finding 21. UNICEF's sustained system-wide capacity building in multiple areas has helped lay the
groundwork for future reforms, although respondents indicated that UNICEF could have
promoted more equitable methods through its strategic positioning and advocacy role. A
more systematic (and systemic) approach would have allowed for a more 'blanket' coverage
in capacity strengthening and policy transfer to sub-national levels. Feedback indicated that
UNICEF appears more concerned with the Government's priorities than with the unmet needs
of some of the most marginalized and vulnerable people (e.g., children with disability), an
important perception for the CO to reflect upon.
184. UNICEF's sustained system-wide capacity building in strategy and policy development
(including ESP, CDMP, ECD-NAP), planning, finance, human resources, inclusive education,
gender, has helped develop strong foundations for further reforms. UNICEF also continuously
advocates for the government to develop and implement equity-focused policies and strategies,
while providing direct support to government programmes specifically targeting disadvantaged
populations (e.g., multi-lingual education for ethnic minority children, inclusive education for
children with disabilities, scholarships for children from poor households etc.). However, some
development partners felt that UNICEF could have promoted the equity agenda even more
strongly (e.g., inclusion of children with disability) using its strategic positioning and advocacy
55
role. Such interlocutors also considered UNICEF to be more focused on the Government’s
priorities and less so on the unmet needs of the most marginalized and vulnerable (returnees,
children with disabilities, out of school children, etc.). Reasons for this may link to COVID-19
related barriers to broader information sharing on UNICEF’s work, especially in light of the
protracted limitations for in-person exchange and information sharing, but it remains an
important stakeholder perception for the CO to reflect upon.
185. UNICEF used its convener role well to maintain dialogue between the Government and
development partners, which helped to leverage new budget support for programmes targeting
children; as well as supporting budget negotiations and closely monitoring budget allocations.
This is expected to increase the fiscal space, in addition to more consolidation resulting from
coordinated policies in support of the Government’s education agenda.
186. UNICEF’s results and factors affecting performance in Social Protection, Child protection and
cross cutting are found in Sections 5.6 and 5,8 (See also Subject of the evaluation section).
5.5 Active involvement with duty-bearers (EQ 10)
Finding 22. UNICEF has actively engaged with duty bearers at central level, leading to strong ownership
of results. Engagement with duty bearers at subnational level varied between thematic areas
but is generally considered as positive where it happened. The strong ownership is yet to
deliver results in terms of scale up and institutionalisation of tested mechanisms and
modalities of work in some areas.
187. UNICEF’s long-standing role as one of the longest serving UN actors in Cambodia and close
coordination and involvement with duty bearers, particularly at central level has already been
frequently cited in other sections (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, 4.3). Close cooperation and inclusion of national
level stakeholders in the design of the CPD and its 2021 review, and inclusive monitoring
processes have contributed to the overall perception of UNICEF as transparent, credible and
approachable partner. This has increased UNICEF strategic positioning and ownership over the
selection of intervention areas and delivered results by national level duty bearers. Government
stakeholders cited that their full involvement in the review and planning of the Annual work
plans is a distinctive value of UNICEF when compared to other partners (UN and non-UN).
188. Regular exchanges also allow UNICEF to improve data/evidence-based programming and
situation gap and comparative analysis, which serve as the basis for targeting and adaptation.
The COVID-19 additional funding for health also offered the opportunity to leverage and jointly
prioritize interventions with the MoH and concerned state departments, and the expansion of
UNICEF planned support to routines services across all sectors. These measures helped raise
ownership of respective duty bearers at central level. However, fragmented, and uneven
engagement with subnational level duty bearers diminishes somewhat the ownership of results
at that level.
5.6 The extent to which the Country Programme used: a) programming at scale, b) winning support
for the cause of children from decision makers, c) developing and leveraging resources and
partnerships for children and d) using the power of evidence to drive change to achieve results (EQ
11)
189. Overall, the evaluation found that UNICEF has used appropriately a) programming at scale,
b) winning support for the cause of children from decision makers, c) developing and leveraging
resources and partnerships for children and d) using the power of evidence to drive change.
Detailed assessment of each of these strategies is presented below.
Programming at scale
56
Finding 23. UNICEF’s shift towards upstream work with integration of modelling has been sound and
brought important national contributions across all sectors. A better definition of UNICEF’s
role in supporting the government to boost sub-national level capacity (commune and
district levels) to operationalise and implement scaled up programmes would have increased
the overall effectiveness of the CP.
190. Programming at scale is included as one of the change strategies in UNICEF’s Strategic Plan
2018-2021, promoting “cross-sectoral and multi-sectoral programming that responds
holistically to children’s needs and to the environments in which they grow up”114. UNICEF’s
upstream work was aligned with this principle even before the current CPD and continued to
grow in response to Cambodia’s development and graduation from LDC status by 2027
ambition.
191. Across all programme components, programmes focusing on structural reforms and
national coverage have been implemented, with positive results overall. For instance,
programmes at scale were implemented with MoEYS assisting the development,
implementation and national scale up of early grade learning program, IECE, distribution of HLP,
Life skills programme, minority education (over 50 districts), school block grants, national
scholarship program, supporting community preschool nationwide to meet minimum
standards (including teacher training and learning materials). The assistance to nation-wide
teacher training was considered as an area with strong transformational potential, opening
opportunity for general improvement of quality of education and as means for tackling learning
loss.
192. Social Policy: In the area of Social Policy, notable programming at scale was evidenced in
the promotion of programme-based budgeting and advocacy for budgeting for children and
prioritization of social protection at all levels. Application of UNICEF’s convener role helped
facilitate the inter-ministerial dialogue for stronger sub-national budgeting, M&E and social
service delivery. UNICEF’s support at scale, resulted in increased budget allocations for social
affairs as a share of the total budget increased, including the COVID-19 related Cash Transfer
Programme in 2021.
193. Digitalization of the Family Package was rolled-out and the National Social Assistance Fund
sub-decree was drafted. The national identification process of people with disabilities (PWD)
was completed and important synergies continued to be created in support of the PDM and
D&D reforms at SNA level.
194. Capacity building of 1646 communes and sangkats to plan and deliver social services using
the Menu of Social Services and promote budget accountability is also considered a great
achievement by all relevant interviewed stakeholders. With UNICEF support, the coverage of the
COVID-19 Cash Transfer Programme for the Poor and Vulnerable households in Cambodia
reached 681,090 households with additional 108,000 households reached through the
Lockdown Cash Transfer Programme. Document review and KII from all stakeholder groups
found this package of interventions to have the potential to be one the most relevant strategies
put in place to push forward the work on filling in the capacity and coordination gaps on multiple
issue related to social policies.
195. Child Protection: scaled programmes were evidenced towards enhancing child protection
in Cambodia, with the launch of the first Child Protection Information Management System to
track child protection service delivery and inform policy setting and action. The legal framework
114 UNICEF (2018); UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, p. 26;
https://www.unicef.org/media/48126/file/UNICEF_Strategic_Plan_2018-2021-ENG.pdf, accessed on 28 September 2022
57
also advanced with the drafting of the Child Protection Law and Standard Operating Procedures
for child protection services, and kinship and foster care.
196. Capacity building of the social service workforce is another key achievement, as is the
development of the training modules, curriculum, training strategy and adoption of job
description of social workers for child protection nation-wide. UNICEF supported the
development and launch of the National Action Plan to prevent and respond to online child
sexual exploitation 2021-2025, and integration of online child protection and positive parenting
materials.
197. The roll out of Primero digital case management system continued to support all children
living in alternative care, reunified with their families from residential care as well as those at
risk or that experienced significant harm115. The roll out of Primero enabled the assessment of
all children living in residential care nationwide, as a first step towards individual development
planning and family-based care placement. Guidelines on diversion of children in conflict with
the law and on child friendly justice procedures were developed jointly by Ministry of Justice,
Ministry of Interior and MoSVY.
198. WASH: Within the WASH sector, the sanitation systems strengthening and institutional
building components of the CP were evidenced as major success in programming at scale. Key
results included UNICEF’s valuable inputs to support the development of key national ODF
guidelines and strategies and eradication of ODF in one province (Svay Rieng province). Other
outstanding achievements included: the support to the MRD in the development of the costed
National Action Plan on Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2019-2023 l, and the
strengthening of capacities of the same ministry and its provincial branches (MRD and PDRD) in
mainstreaming climate risk into the establishment of commune water safety plans.
199. In the Health and Nutrition areas, UNICEF supported the government to develop new
policies, processes, tools, etc. and to roll them out to generate evidence-based analysis and
approaches prior to scaling them up (e.g.: Electronic Immunization Registry (EIR (/digital health),
SAM management and Growth Monitoring and Promotion (GMP) for children).
200. Limited human and financial capacities of subnational level governments to operationalise
and implement new policies, functions and service delivery programmes are cited as most
relevant challenges affecting programming at scale. Programming at scale assumes that the
support to the government would result in nation-wide transformative national programmes
which would be operationalised by government institutions. In most cases, UNICEF invested at
central level, with assumption that strengthening of the capacities of service providers and
implementers would be government led, which is not always the case. Given decreasing
resource mobilisation efforts, it could not be expected from UNICEF to follow and support the
entire policy cycle, and evaluation found that UNICEF supported to the extent possible given its
resource limitations.
Winning support for the cause of children from decision makers
Finding 24. UNICEF’s convening power, coordination, and leveraging potential is substantial –
particularly with Government partnerships and with development partners. This positioning
serves as a core foundation in all actions. UNICEF’s engagement with children and youth as
agents of change has been on the rise, though yet to reach its full potential. Obstacles for
this are found to relate to still underdeveloped internal synergetic factors of various youth
related activities that lead to duplication of efforts.
115 UNICEF (2021). Country Programme Full Approved Report 2021
58
201. UNICEF’s Change Strategy 3: Winning support for the cause of children as set out in the
2018-2021 Strategic Plan,116 relates to engaging and leading in strong advocacy, campaigning,
fundraising and communications for children, building alliances and movements for change. It
also includes a focus on children and young people as agents of change, creating platforms and
opportunities for them to demand accountability and drive progress for themselves.
202. The evaluation found ample evidence of utility of UNICEF’s convener and coordination role
to promote the needs and results for children as exemplified in other sections of this report.
UNICEF’s active participation, and in many cases, leadership of various working groups and task
forces has been utilised for advocacy and awareness raising on issues pertaining to child rights,
as interviewees confirmed.
203. UNICEF’s C4D-SBCC strategies were utilised on issues of child and youth rights and
empowerment, IECD, climate change, education, health (particularly considering COVID-19).
These were helpful to advocate and win support from decision makers. However, more
synergies between different youth activities would have been helpful to raise the profile and
results of UNICEF’s support to these groups.
Developing and Leveraging Resources and Partnerships for Children
Finding 25. UNICEF's efforts to develop and leverage resources and partnerships for children have mostly
been successful. A strong boost was evidenced during and in the aftermath of the pandemic,
whereby UNICEF seized the opportunity to strongly leverage its positioning and resources to
reach children and maximise results.
204. Partnerships and the ability to mobilise resources to reach children present the core
foundation of UNICEF’s work, including by influencing domestic planning, financing, and the
delivery of children’s services.117 Over the reference period, and especially during the COVID-19
crisis, UNICEF’s change strategy has successfully focused on developing and leveraging
resources and partnerships. UNICEF leveraged its existing partnerships and programmes with
ministries and partners in the sectors of Education, Social Protection, Child Protection and
Communications to ensure timely information sharing and action.
205. Strategic partnerships and collaboration enabled UNICEF to mobilize critical resources for
the COVID-19 response and vaccination, and to expand cross-sectoral capacities and
approaches to reach the most vulnerable, including through digital innovation strategies and
community engagement. UNICEF leveraged funding for COVID-19 vaccination support to multi-
sectoral efforts to strengthen SBCC, social protection data systems (disability management
information system) and community outreach with other health and nutrition services.
206. Substantial funding strengthened CO’s T4D and C4D/SBC expertise. COVID-19 vaccination
was also a significant entry point to strengthen broader UNICEF multi-sector programming for
the most vulnerable. UNICEF maintained and strengthened partnerships with government and
development partners for SUN and Cambodia Nutrition Project. Working with several Ministries
including MoH, MoI and MOSVY, at both national and sub-national levels enabled UNICEF’s
support to directly benefit specific vulnerable populations, including the elderly, pregnant
women, people with disabilities, and people living on the street, and provide timely COVID-19
information and vaccination.

207. UNICEF leveraged resources and maximised partnerships with the MoH to gear up the
NDVP, including risk communication and community engagement, with a notable focus on
specific vulnerable. This was an innovative multi-sectoral approach, benefiting from additional
funding, that led to LTAs with private sector suppliers and dedicated T4D and C4D-SBCC
resources. The document review showed that a new Private Sector Engagement strategy 2021-
2022 was developed by the CO, presenting thematic areas as a key priority for private sector
engagement
208. UNICEF takes an active role in UNCT, leading, co-leading, or engaging in various results
groups and programmes, which is considered by UNCT stakeholders as positive partnership
engagement. UNICEF engages with civil society, but as discussed in previous sections, this
engagement is often limited to their implementation tasks, without much consultation or wider
advocacy potential.
Using the power of evidence to drive change
Finding 26. UNICEF’s evaluations, research, and data about children in Cambodia have helped shape
and strengthen national policies and measures but also donors’ and UN agencies
interventions.
209. UNICEF engages with the Government in several evidence generation interventions,
including situational analyses, research studies, evaluations, and reviews, which are used to
inform both national policies and UNICEF’s. For instance, studies such as the learning loss study,
the joint rapid assessment of the education sector, or the UNICEF led the COVID-19 Socio-
Economic Impact Assessment118 (those most cited by informants), as being useful to better
understand the changing needs of the most vulnerable in Cambodia.
210. UNICEF’s monitoring efforts, such as the support to the GS-NSPC and MOSVY to get accurate
information from beneficiaries of the cash transfer programme or the WASH section’s support
to the standardisation of monitoring processes and availability of data (through the support to
the Management Information System (MIS)) and equity gaps analysis, were also cited as useful.
However, informants noted persistent gaps and weaknesses in the government’s sectoral MIS,
and its insufficient exploitation for SNAs annual equity planning and budgeting.
5.7 Timeliness of UNICEF’s delivery of results (EQ 12)
Finding 13. Timeliness of delivery of support to the duty bearers and right holders was hampered to
different extent by COVID-19 constraints, and in some cases by Cambodia’s challenging
topography. Other more structural factors also affected timeliness of support. Driver of
timeliness of support was adaptability of the programme to changing context.
211. The systematic planning approach at UNICEF, within which annual work plans, annual (and
mid-term) reviews and evaluations represent the main pillars is effective at supporting timely
results. In particular, the reviews and plans for each sector help to bring partners together to
reflect on achievements and adjust and reprogramme some activities as required. however,
documentary review findings, reinforced by stakeholder feedback, affirm that the timeliness of
CP implementation was affected by COVID-19, although CP implementation is still on track to
achieve it targets, with most output indicators considered on track or already achieved.

212. To address constraints brought by COVID-19, UNICEF invested sustained efforts to continue
its upstream capacity strengthening and direct support activities through online platforms. The
shift to an online modality affected the quality of engagement, though most of activities
continued. Once the restrictions were eased, the CO resumed direct engagement.
213. The immediate COVID-19 response (vaccination and education) and UNICEF’s WASH response
within the flood response were both found to be timely and efficient.
5.8 Contributions of the selected programmatic areas to intended national results, including SDG
focused results, as well as whole of UN outcomes specified in the UNDAF and more recently in the
context of COVID-19 in the SERP (EQ13)
Finding 28. System level reforms supported by UNICEF across education, social protection and child
protection, health and WASH contribute to SDG acceleration, despite persisting challenges
that Cambodia encounters. UNICEF’s contributions to the UNDAF goals are positive overall,
and in particular its contributions to the COVID-19 response within the framework of SERF.
UNICEF’s contributions to SDGs and Agenda 2030
214. UNICEF’s work in Cambodia reflects its global commitments to Agenda 2030 and is
structured across five overarching areas of well-being for every child which are grounded in the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.119 The evaluation mapped a number of SDGs (SDG
1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and their respective targets to which UNICEF contributes. Most of these
contributions are direct ones, though some leveraging potential is also found also in targets that
do not show explicit linkages to date, or are only emerging, such as SDG 1, target 1.5 (see Figure
2 in Annex 3). The ET’s document review and stakeholder interviews indicate that UNICEF’s
upstream interventions in capacity strengthening at national level and support services at sub-
national level, in social protection, PFM, education, health, nutrition and child protection are
contributing significantly to the achievement of the relevant SDGs. UNICEF’s capacity
strengthening work includes the provision of technical, financial and advocacy support to
planning, policy and strategy development, direct support in capacity building and
strengthening of direct service provision and partner coordination are perceived as good drivers
of such contribution by interviewed stakeholders.
215. SDG1: Visible contributions to SDG 1 (End Poverty) were made through extensive two-
pronged support to the reforms of social protection, engaging with national Government on
reforming social services provision while at the same time investing in social assistance. The
emergency cash assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Family Package, integrating four
core social assistance programmes addressing needs of pregnant women, children 0-2y,
persons with disability, and the elderly, as well as wider work investment in better connection
between policies and budgets, have all been positive. UNICEF has expanded its reach to the
most vulnerable, with transformational potential on the well-being of women, children, and
other vulnerable groups. Increased access to social assistance and social services helps
contribute to mitigating socio-economic risks and vulnerability to poverty.
216. SDG2: UNICEF contributions to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) targets are operationalized through its
nutrition work. UNICEF’s Investments in the prevention and treatment of wasting in targeted
northeast provinces has been substantial and has enabled all Government health facilities to
provide treatment services compared to many provinces in the country without SAM supplies
and management capacity. However, overall, still only 10 percent of severely wasted children
nationwide have access to treatment and more support from Government, partners and
UNICEF is needed to further improve quality and scale. The improvement in the SAM cure rate
119 https://data.unicef.org/sdgs/country/khm/
61
is an important achievement. Advocacy, coordination, and technical support from UNICEF also
led to important recent national plans and commitments for nutrition at a time during the
pandemic where the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 was aggravating risks for increasing
malnutrition, especially on the poorest and most vulnerable populations.
217. SDG 3: UNICEF contributions to SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) were evidenced by the
mobilisation of substantial resources for health during the pandemic, not only for COVID-19
response and vaccination, but also for maintaining essential health care services including
routine immunisation. UNICEF’s direct technical support enabled MoH to maintain essential
health services and effectively implement IPC against COVID-19. UNICEF’s direct support to
continued integrated health and nutrition community outreach services led to minimized
disruption in the availability of health and nutrition services in NE provinces. Maternal care
indicators show a striking increase in coverage in 2021 and 2022, with disparities by measures
of inequality substantially decreased. This is largely due to UNICEF investment in integrated
community outreach of Health and Nutrition services. Furthermore, according to different key
stakeholders, this also reflected the effective community-based poverty identification system,
the ID-Poor expansion and the conditional cash transfer (CCT) contribution (supported by
UNICEF). Despite the reinforcement of health services, other key indicators suffered a serious
decline in coverage (related to growing inequities and significant subnational disparities),
reinforcing the need to monitor progress also at subnational levels.
218. SDG 4: Throughout decades of hands-on support to the education system, UNICEF has
contributed significantly to progress towards achievement of SDG 4 (Quality Education) through
technical support to system reforms in response to Cambodia’s 2030 Education Roadmap.120
Output and outcome level results coming out of investment in education policies, capacity
strengthening of teachers and school leadership, school WASH infrastructure, and inclusive
education (multilingual education), as well as supporting the COVID-19 response in education,
etc. have brought contributions to SDG 4. A weakness is the variable support to inclusive
education and the active promotion of disability rights.
219. SDG 5: Finally, contributions to SDG 5 (Gender Equality) were notable, resulting from the
integration of GEWE into strategic interventions across all sectors. The review of available
programme documents and evaluations shows overall positive assessments of UNICEF’s GEWE
efforts, as also confirmed by stakeholder interviews. For instance, girls and boys, pregnant and
lactating women, and women from the most vulnerable groups all benefited from direct
support across each sector, while technical support promoted the needs and vulnerabilities of
girls and boys, women and men.
220. The evaluation confirmed the findings of the SIDA-funded project on strengthening local
governance for social service delivery,121 which found that “the programme overall contributed
towards the SDG 5.4 of recognising and valuing unpaid care and domestic work through the provision
of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies”. However, available data on the
attainment of Agenda 2030, as measured through indicators for Cambodia, show weak progress
across all five dimensions of child rights as shown in Figure 5.

Source: https://data.unicef.org/sdgs/country/khm/
221. A detailed review of available indicator data relating to five dimensions of child rights
confirms slow progress towards targets122. Some reasons for this (as cited by stakeholders)
pertain to the slow pace of incremental reforms that UNICEF supports, and a worsening socio-
economic outlook due to COVID-19. Most stakeholders indicated an expectation that the
situation will further deteriorate due to the current global geo-political crises.
UNICEF’s contributions to UNDAF
Finding 29. UNICEF remains an essential UNDAF partner, with multi-sectoral capacities, and
programmatic focus areas that are fully integrated into national sector policies and
successfully linked to UNDAF outcomes.
222. UNICEF and UNDAF outcomes are closely related, including to expanding social opportunity
(Outcome 1); promoting sustainable living (Outcome 3); and strengthening participation and
accountability (Outcome 4); and its four key accelerators in the areas of social protection,
nutrition, youth and data (see Figure 3 in Annex 3 showing the UNICEF CP 2019-2023 linkages
with UN priorities in Cambodia).
223. Notable contributions to UNDAF Outcome 1 and its Intermediate Outcomes 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3
included UNICEF’s and the UN Country Team’s (UNCT) efforts to adapt to emerging needs
stemming from COVID-19 and the 2020 floods. For instance, UNICEF and HRF partners
supported the development of a Floods Response Plan for the most affected provinces, to reach
237,000 people over six months addressing priority needs. UNICEF led the WASH response
(WASH supplies and first aid kits) benefiting approximately 65,000 people. The Education
response reached up to 187,000 children with primary and secondary level textbooks.123
224. Outcomes related to improving public health care (routine immunization) and nutrition
(wasting prevention and treatment), based on last UNDAF reporting from 2021, shows that
targets for wasting coverage and scale up are behind. This mentioned earlier, this is mainly due
to lack of resource mobilization by the government, limited community-based approaches for
screening/identification and limited resources for support by partners. Even though coverage
of wasting program across the country is inadequate, in the areas where UNICEF is supporting,
there has been increase in quality of treatment (Figure 3 in Annex 10) and increased number of
children with wasting reached (Figure 4 in Annex 10).

FIGURE 6: NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS TREATED FOR SAM 225. Figure 6 shows that in areas
(2011-2021) with UNICEF support, treatment of SAM
(particularly outpatient in health
facilities) has increased over the past
years, but still remains under the
target values and international
standards. In the current CPD, there
have been increases in both 2019 and
2020. The drop in 2021is due to the
pandemic and resource mobilisation
factors. In 2022, there have been
several positive developments,
including mobilization of funding to
support scale up in 4 new provinces
where there is currently no/very little
SAM treatment services by MOH. Also, allocation of Cambodia Nutrition Project funding for the
first time to support wasting programming including RUTF supplies (starting 2023).
226. UNICEF is also an active member of the UNCT, chairing or co-chairing a number of Results
Groups, as presented in the Annex 9. Interviewed UNCT stakeholders confirmed UNICEF’s
proactive and generally consultative role in UNCT Results and theme groups and Task forces.
UNICEF’s contributions to SERF
Finding 30. UNICEF responded strongly in scale and scope of programming and in response to the
COVID-19 challenge, gaining recognition for its capabilities, demonstrated adaptability and leadership.
227. The “UN Cambodia framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID” (SERF)
(August 2020), aimed to support the Government in several areas including scale-up and
expansion of social protection; education and other essential services and the enhancement of
food security and nutrition. The five pillars of SERF are detailed in the Figure 3 in Annex 3.
228. The UNCT efforts also complemented the National COVID-19 Health Master Plan, stepping
towards an integrated financing framework. UNICEF leadership and support to the Government
on the COVID-19 programmatic response (vaccination programme rollout, education support
and RCCE and C4D-SBC), is widely recognized by evaluation informants and in relevant reports,
as outstanding. UNICEF contributed to combined efforts to ensure that essential and basic
health services continued to be available for all, and in the prevention of GBV mechanisms and
child protection services.
229. Using the Health and Nutrition program positioning as entry points and leveraging on this,
UNICEF’s C4D, Communications, and Health and Nutrition programme team worked on a
nationwide Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) response and the co-
creation of the evidence-based Advocacy Communication and Social Mobilization (ACSM)/C4D
plan, which supported seamless coordination of prevention and vaccination approaches.
UNICEF reports that 62 percent of the population of 16 million were reached by these
communications.
230. In response to rising socio-economic and child malnutrition challenges in the north-eastern
provinces, UNICEF prioritised implementation of a comprehensive Nutrition programme,124
supporting capacity building and use of HMIS data tools, and the implementation and use of
124 Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition, Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Micronutrients strategic actions
64
Interpersonal Communication (IPC) and counselling tools. The WASH and the Health
programme (with financial and technical support on RCCE, IPC, etc) focused its COVID-19
response on reducing the transmission of the virus, providing critical hygiene and prevention
supplies alongside risk communication, IPC efforts, guidance, advocacy, and remote technical
support. Contributions of these activities to UNDAF’s Pillar 1 were assessed by stakeholders as
outstanding.
231. In relation to Pillar 2 – Protecting People, prior to the UN SERF design, UNCT formulated a
comprehensive social protection policy options paper that facilitated the direction for the
Government’s immediate response to the pandemic, influencing key policies for resilient
recovery. The social protection responses before COVID-19, were not sufficient to fully protect
and build the resilience of the most affected and disadvantaged groups during the pandemic.125
UNICEF’s support to the Government’s cash transfer programme for Pregnant Women and
Children under Two covering over 240,000 pregnant women and young children was an
investment in system building for the delivery of the routine social assistance programme, with
the system used to rapidly build the national emergency COVID-19 Cash Transfer Programme
for the Poor and Vulnerable Households. As co-chair of the Education Working Group, UNICEF
facilitated development partner support for COVID-19 response, including creating safe and
protective learning environments, “Back-to-school” campaigns, distance education, and
technical support for safe school re-opening. This Pillar also shows a critical UNICEF contribution
to the implementation of the different technical components and a focus on areas where
UNICEF has a comparative added value within the UNCT. Pillars (3, 4 and 5) show less
engagement of UNICEF, explained by the leading role of other UN agencies in areas where they
have primary capacities.
5.9 Major external and internal factors influencing the achievement of Country Programme results,
with a special focus on Health and Nutrition, Education and WASH (EQ 14)
Finding 31. CP focus and performance have benefited from UNICEF’s office structure; evidence
generation, combination of upstream and downstream focus and adaptability as well as the
Royal Government of Cambodia’s commitment and positioning. Nevertheless, progress was
hindered by internal siloed approaches, and, to greater extent, external factors (D&D
challenges, the Government’s limited resources and the COVID-19 pandemic).
Internal enabling factors
232. The evaluation found that the attainment of CP strategic results was facilitated by UNICEF’s
well-resourced office structure, regional presence, and healthy budget. In Cambodia, UNICEF
has the largest presence of all the UN agencies, with 104 staff members and 16 staff engaged
in ZO.126 Interviewed stakeholders cited UNICEF’s resource mobilisation efforts and appropriate
and sound budget utilisation; the team’s expertise, familiarity with the local context; and
flexibility and availability, as important enabling factors for the delivery of results.
233. Other factors included:
● timely evidence generation (SitAn, Analytical studies, assessment of impact of COVID-19 on
vulnerability, reviews and evaluations) enabling informed strategic and operational
decisions;
● UNICEF’s strategic positioning as a go-to-partner for reforms (in particular at national level);

126 According to UNICEF Cambodia’s 2021 HR chart
65
● the integration of upstream policy work with capacity strengthening, hence contributing to
sustainability;
● direct engagement with final beneficiaries. The evaluation found that this was systematically
mainstreamed in the WASH sector, or in the SP sector, where post distribution calls were
conducted together with the MoSVY to get feedback from cash transfer beneficiaries);
● UNICEF’s convener role and partnership with other UN agencies, donors and other
partners.
Internal hindrances
234. Constraints to UNICEF’s work relate to the silo approaches at both the design and
implementation levels, often identifying pre-determined outputs rather than focusing on the
achievement of broader outcomes that require an integrated causal framework analysis and
ToC in support of a coordinated programme design.
235. The CP sectoral formulations remain quite theoretical, too high level and relative to the
central/national level (policy guidance) with overly ambitious indicators, presenting challenges
to understanding UNICEF’s contributions and higher-level monitoring and reporting on results.
The evaluation found that external subnational stakeholders are largely unaware of
interventions beyond their own. Budget limitations in some sectors (Nutrition and WASH) also
represented hindrances to implementation of planned results. UNICEF’s demand driven
approach to working with the government has resulted in some fragmentation, limited
resources (i.e., nutrition) and spreading resources too thinly. An analysis of UNICEF’s sectoral
interventions (as illustrated by assessment of UNICEF’s support to education, WASH and Health
and Nutrition presented in Section 5.4, and corroborated by stakeholder feedback) indicates
that UNICEF engages in multiple sector-specific interventions and thematic areas within each
sector. The range of activities (resulting from UNICEF’s demand driven approach) demands a lot
of attention and resources, diluting the potential impact, and leading to little time for interaction
and reflection.
External drivers
236. The single main external driver of attainment of results is the government’s commitment to
reform and their ambitious reform agenda. Being a strategic partner of the government, UNICEF
has direct access and influence on reform path, which helped both relevance and effectiveness
of support.
237. COVID-19 was considered by most stakeholders as both a driver and a hindrance to
UNICEF’s work. UNICEF’s adaptable approaches, global mandate and expertise put UNICEF at
the forefront of the national pandemic response efforts.
External hindering factors
238. The main hindering factors, in particular affecting sustainability or for scaling up, include
pervasive and systemic bottlenecks for the delivery of services and inequity barriers, specifically
in the Northeast regions of the country (including, but not limited to, limited infrastructure,
capacity and fiscal limitations, lack of trained professionals, socio-cultural factors affecting
minority groups, etc.). Stakeholders at all levels reported that Cambodia has developed a
comprehensive policy and institutional framework portfolio, but that these policies are only
implemented slowly, if at all, hindered by the very slow D&D process and systemic gaps. The
D&D process, in turn, is constrained by several internal and external challenges, most notably
institutional capacity related. Due to slow implementation of policies, access to the benefits of
the services and policies by the affected populations is often limited or uneven.
66
239. The evaluation found that the stated strong ownership and declared commitment of the
duty bearers does not always translate into, or guarantee, scaling up or sustainability of
delivered results. The document review and stakeholder interviews confirmed that ownership
is high and, in many cases, results in scaled up mechanisms (e.g., cash transfers; teacher
training; large scale programming through sanitation systems strengthening; SAM treatment as
a government national program, and numerous others). However, some interventions do not
manage to be fully institutionalised (including MHM in schools, bridging the water supply gap in
rural, etc.). Some of the quoted reasons include donor dependence, capacity and fiscal
limitations, especially at decentralised levels. and recurring crises.
240. A linked challenge remains the limitations in subnational level government’s absorption
capacity (limited human, material and institutional resources, staff turnover, low awareness of
relevance of proposed models and potential benefits, etc.) and fiscal limitations, particularly at
subnational level. Key stakeholders cited these as important factors limiting UNICEF’s and other
development partners’ results.
241. The document review and stakeholder feedback confirmed a low level of harmonization and
coherence between different laws and policies, and weak inter-sectoral coordination within the
Government, (both horizontally, between ministries; and vertically, between different tiers of
government), which affects the transformative potential of UNICEF’s work, despite best efforts.
242. UNICEF invested in building awareness and PF4C capacity across the Government, but the
budget preparation and allocation processes and priorities, and roles and responsibilities for
budgeting between central and subnational levels, remains challenging in a number of
structural and fiscal domains. This is a critical factor for sustainability and scale up.
243. The availability of reliable data at administrative and social levels varies between sectors or
themes, affecting the extent to which adequate government targeting or evidence-based policy
decisions can be made across sectors. The evaluation found that UNICEF’s work is affected by
insufficiently disaggregated data at national and subnational levels on essential services,
including vulnerability profiling and trend comparisons on disparities, gaps, etc. These were
highlighted by stakeholders as major hindrances to better equity and results programming.
244. A further worsening of the socio-economic conditions in Cambodia in the aftermath of the
pandemic, caused by both internal and global factors, were also noted as likely to hinder the
transformative potential of delivered results.
5.10 The sustainability of the gains relating to 1) programming at scale in vaccination; 2) social
protection, including cash transfers, acceleration of the strengthening of the social workforce and
3) increased investments in areas such as GVB, MHPSS achieved in the COVID-19 response (EQ 15,
16)
245. There is an overall perception among stakeholders that it is still too early to know if the
changes generated through different investments in the COVID-19 response will be sustainable,
as many of these changes are still underway. UNICEF is already supporting MOH in the
integration of COVID-19 vaccination into routine immunisation programming, which could be
delivered with other essential primary health care services for the most vulnerable, following
the UNICEF supported integrated community outreach model in the northeast. UNICEF
stakeholders confirmed that forecasting and tracking tools include both routine and COVID-19
vaccination and the cold chain. These elements and supporting systems are included in Gavi’s
Health System Strengthening Support 3 (HSS) five-year funding to the Government, which is
strongly designed to reach zero dose children, due to substantial advocacy and technical
support by UNICEF, WHO and CHAI. The new Primary Health Care booster framework of the
MoH also integrates COVID-19 vaccination into routine immunization programmes and PHC
policies and strengthens community outreach to reach zero dose children, which is a foundation
67
of sustainability for UNICEF’s results. The HSS support is intended to address health system
bottlenecks.127
246. The Health Sector is also documenting and building upon lessons from the past two years
while global guidance and evidence continues to emerge on COVID-19 vaccination and its future,
and in other areas such as digital immunization –an area that the MOH had not explored before
the pandemic but wants to include now as a key programme priority. Feedback indicated that
many of the components and investments are agreed at national decision making and technical
levels but their roll-out and implementation may be challenged by policy environment and
commitment from Government, fiscal and human resource limitations at all levels, as well as
capacities to ensure equitable access to essential services for vulnerable populations.
247. UNICEF’s contribution to bridging the digital divide in support of the education sector during
the pandemic school closures boosted the Government’s efforts to achieve the envisioned
digitalization in education by 2030. Consulted government stakeholders reaffirmed their
commitment to continue the efforts to bridge the gaps in internet access, reducing the rural-
urban disparity.
248. The unprecedented expansion of Cambodia’s social protection system during the pandemic
response has provided the opportunity to develop new capacities among the national duty
bearers, providing a unique opportunity to temporarily expand social assistance during a crisis.
Such efforts have helped to shift minds towards scale-up, as emphasized by relevant
stakeholders. Feedback also suggested using lessons learned in the pandemic response to tailor
approaches across multiple sectors, such as in nutrition-sensitive interventions, to reduce child
labour, for disaster risk management, humanitarian response, etc.
249. Efforts to extend WASH services and infrastructure, targeted provision of soap and
handwashing facilities and campaigns, particularly for the low-income households in rural
areas, have resulted (as per some of the participants in the evaluation), in sustaining
handwashing with soap behaviour (handwashing at critical times) post COVID-19, although this
evaluation could not corroborate these from other sources. The socio-economic impact study
suggests that 93 percent of participants declared to wash hands with soap frequently (Feb21)).
A hand hygiene addition to the ODF criteria represents a tangible and sustained gain on the
COVID-19 focused WASH investment.
250. Some key informants indicated that UNICEF’s operational focus on GBV and MHPSS
activities reaching out the most vulnerable and marginalized has opened a window of
opportunity for policy influencing and advocacy for equitable coverage, and may help intensify
efforts in other domains too, such as civil registration-returned migrants, refugees, etc.
CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
251. The findings from this evaluation indicate the importance of strengthening key policy and
institutional mechanisms128 across all sectors. This can be done through strong evidence
generation activities to inform targeting of assistance, using the limited organizational
resources, and acknowledging the troubled external geo-political, socio-economic and donor
environment. Programme development often implicitly assumes a stable operational and
financial framework and institutional environment within which to implement activities.

128 Such as educational institutions and teacher training colleges, social assistance, child protection; fiscal and budget
planning and targeting; IT systems (e.g. EMIS, Primero digital case management system, integrated HN community
outreach programme, integration of essential ECD services, etc.
68
252. Relevance: The CP design is aligned with national priorities, the UNDAF and the relevant
SDGs. The CP integrated gender considerations and responds to most needs of rights holders,
though coverage of the most vulnerable groups would have enhanced UNICEF’s added value in
Cambodia. UNICEF CO has created, cultivated, and maintained good relationships with the Royal
Government of Cambodia, enabling UNICEF to influence national discourse and policy
development, though to a lesser extent its operationalisation and implementation. UNICEF’s
credibility provides good potential for convening multiple actors and responding to emerging
needs and priorities, though consultations with civil society and affected populations were not
applied systematically. UNICEF’s response within the UN Cambodia SERF to the pandemic is a
good example of the CO’s continued relevance and agility to adapt to emerging needs, boosting
its relevance to both the governmental priorities and unmet needs of children.
253. UNICEF’s scope of support to the country is expansive and includes upstream support to
policies and institutional strengthening; downstream for strengthening quality of services, and
generation of evidence and advocacy on child rights. Conceptually, these areas of engagement
are relevant, though there are many emerging needs and demands which could have been
better prioritized to ensure that resources are not too thinly spread. UNICEF CO modelling
efforts and direct interaction with affected groups, where it happened, was relevant to the
needs and local realities.
254. Convergence is still emerging. The design of the different sectors’ Theories of Change do
not reflect key thematic and cross-sector linkages, which hinders convergence. A multitude of
sectoral upstream and downstream interventions with funding constraints and silo approaches
in implementation of activities are further reflected in vertical communication issues between
the CO and ZOs. The CO efforts to enhance convergence have been commended, though have
been insufficient to bring any shift in terms of convergence or to break silos thus far. As such, it
is hard to assess the effectiveness and impact of conceptualised converging programmes (IECD
and ADAP, for instance) right now. However, there are promising developments as the Kratie
Zonal office leads on IECD programming in the north, where recent focus has been on
strengthening Government systems and capacities at national and sub-national level to
operationalise the National Action Plan for Early Childhood Care and Development (NAP-ECCD
2022-2026), which has recently resulted in development of a first provincial ECD plan (in Kratie).
255. Comparative advantage: The two most significant strengths and value propositions of
UNICEF in Cambodia include its reputation as the go-to agency for system strengthening, policy
support, modelling, and filling gaps (e.g., through technical expertise, financial support, capacity
strengthening, ICT, etc.) in education, child protection and social policy, WASH, and increasingly
health and nutrition, with an equity approach. This provides an opportunity for tackling reform
efforts more systematically at central and subnational levels. This advantage comes with a
threat of multiplying efforts in response to demands and creating/maintaining donor
dependence, which needs to be closely monitored and mitigated in the future. UNICEF also
holds substantial coordination, convening, and leveraging potential – both with the Government
and with development partners.
256. Effectiveness and sustainability: UNICEF’s output level results from system strengthening
efforts across all CP sectors (and the COVID-19 response) have been positive, though the
challenge remains to ensure that investments across these thematic areas transform into
sustainable outcome level results. The system strengthening support delivered results in both
policy and delivery, which improved as a result of capacity strengthening efforts. There has been
significant progress in improvement of policy and regulatory frameworks thanks to UNICEF’s
support, but there are still gaps in terms of conducive policy and the fiscal environment at all
levels; operationalisation of policy and legislative provisions and the scale up of the tested
models. UNICEF’s blanket support across sectors in targeted regions (and nationwide in some
69
sectors like education, health, and social protection) has reached and provided beneficial
support to children. However, this outreach faced challenges in reaching the most vulnerable
populations, notably children and their families facing multiple deprivations in some regions,129
due to COVID-19 and limited national and UNICEF resources.
257. Results at the outcome level display a mixed performance, particularly in terms of scalability
and sustainability. The modelling of WASH, child protection, social services was successful in
targeted communities but their scale up potential was not fully explored. This limits the
transformative potential of such models. Two exceptions were the modelling of conditional cash
transfers, which resulted in an important national cash transfer programme and a model for
other similar cash transfer cross-sectoral measures and the operationalization at the national
level; and the strengthening of capacities of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) and its
provincial departments in mainstreaming climate risk into the establishment of commune water
safety plans (which bring local authorities into the water safety plan development process).
258. UNICEF’s support contributed to institutional reforms, and capacity has improved though to
varying degrees at different governance levels and across different institutions. The system level
investment in social protection and public finance management has the potential to bring long
term positive outcomes in ensuring safety nets for the most vulnerable groups. UNICEF’s
contributions to child protection services are progressively benefitting children.
259. Engagement in education, through support to teaching colleges, teaching and learning
materials and online learning tools and methods, brought important advances in terms of the
quality of teaching and learning, though these are still emerging and very incremental. Support
to multilingual education and inclusive education, though variable, has had positive outcomes
on livelihoods and empowerment, particularly of girls and boys from minority groups that
participated in the programmes. However, learning loss and exclusion of the most deprived
(notably, children with disabilities, working children and children at risk) is exacerbated by a
worsening socio-economic situation, and warrants a stronger focus and consolidation.
260. In spite of important funding gaps over the implementation of the WASH component, the
WASH section championed equity-based analysis and pro-poor programming at scale with a
systematic integration of the human rights-based approach, through sanitation systems
strengthening and institution building, directly contributing towards the SDG targets for rural
sanitation.
261. In Health and Nutrition, UNICEF strengthened national and local capacities in key
programme areas and positioned itself strongly through advocacy and technical support in the
COVID-19 response. This provided an entry point to, mobilise substantial resources for the
section and CO broadly, expanding key high impact basic health and nutrition services (such as
routine immunization) and cross-sectoral approaches (e.g T4D, SBC) during the pandemic.
Persistent bottlenecks in accessibility, utilization of basic health and nutrition services and
institutional capacity limitations, compounded by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, still
remain with slightly better indicators noted in some of the provinces prioritised by UNICEF. This
points to an overall positive trend in areas where more focused support is provided and
integrated.
262. Availability of data to inform targeting of the most vulnerable groups represents a challenge.
While initial coverage of the CP was guided by SitAns and other related assessments available
at the time of design, only limited comprehensive analysis to identify and reconfirm target
groups has been conducted since. There is insufficient up-to-date timely and accurate
129 For example, children from the poorest households-lowest wealth index quintiles, working children, out-of-school
children, children living in rural hard to reach areas, children with disability, children at risk of forced labor or forced
marriages, returning or migrant workers’ families, etc.
70
subnational data to make inequities in coverage more visible, which is key to identifying and
reaching the most marginalized with an appropriate response. A major contribution from
UNICEF was its support to MOSVY’s national Disability Management Information System
revealed real-time and disaggregated data on PwDs registered in the country have been fully
vaccinated. This presents an opportunity for scale up and use in advocacy, sector coordination
and local level planning to understand and address access barriers.
263. Gender issues received strong attention and were mainstreamed throughout
implementation. A dedicated T4D team brough in by CO was a positive step to building inhouse
capacity for addressing many of these issues. Consultation with, and accountability to, local
communities and rights holders varied, with some good examples, such as post-distribution
calls conducted together with the MoSVY to get feedback from cash transfer beneficiaries.
264. UNICEF implemented several relevant and effective interventions in response to
COVID-19 under SERF. The utility of UNICEF’s mandate and efficient resource mobilisation
approaches in response to the pandemic led the immediate rapid and effective response,
providing needed vaccination, child protection and social assistance (cash transfers, mental
health, etc.), education and wash services education and WASH support services at scale to the
Government and children. Such support to the most affected population has to some extent
mitigated the negative learning loss and health impact of COVID-19 across Cambodia.
265. Factors affecting sustainability of results. The transformative potential and sustainability
of UNICEF’s results are muted to some extent by subnational government’s absorption capacity
limitations, UNICEF’s fragmented approaches and recurring crises. By providing significant
amounts of technical assistance to national institutions, UNICEF has delivered on its promises,
though longer term sustainable transformative potential and impact of UNICEF contributions is
muted because even as programme interventions deliver outputs, the benefits of the
programme interventions often do not materialize with the affected populations. These suggest
the need for more in-depth accompaniment regarding institutional bottlenecks and procedures
to bridge the gap between policy guidance and policy implementation, identifying areas where
UNICEF could add value through a systems strengthening approach across areas mentioned
above. UNICEF is seen as having the potential leverage and reputation to focus more
persistently on commonly identified bottlenecks, such as central and subnational level planning,
budgeting, and monitoring processes and service functions. Focused attention on subnational
level engagement, capacity strengthening and support to operationalisation of adopted policies
and for the scale up of models was a declared commitment but could not always be fulfilled.
Lessons Learned
266. Lesson 1. In countries where UNICEF’s sector reform interventions (e.g., social protection,
education, or others) include strong evidence generation and engagement in PFM, there is a
greater transformational potential for improving accountability and transparency of targeting
and coverage, and access to services for the most vulnerable. Experience from Cambodia shows
that in countries where UNICEF invests efforts in understanding and promoting enabling fiscal
space for children and social protection systems, resulting interventions are stronger, with more
apt targeting and coverage mechanisms across sectors.
267. Lesson 2. Government sector institutions require long-term funding to support continuous
and comprehensive technical and financial support over time, often over multiple programme
cycles. Experience from Cambodia shows that achieving tangible and transformative results
require support from development partners over a prolonged period, as exemplified by
UNICEF’s long support to the education, health and WASH. UNICEF has consistently worked with
the Government over multiple CP cycles on identifying the needs and gaps, developing
proposals and bringing diverse knowledge and know-how, shaping country-specific institutional
71
arrangements and legal frameworks and strengthening the capacities at national and local
levels. This helped establish UNICEF as an immediate point of reference and source of expertise
in given sectors, which can be helpful when governments plan adjustments and reforms.
268. Lesson 3. Given the critical importance of essential services for children, including primary
health care and education, long term dedicated resources are needed to ensure a strong focus
on quality, equity and inclusiveness. Even in more developed countries with well-established
health systems, COVID-19 has exposed fragility and gaps of health institutions and budgets and
has forced the governments to rethink health-sector mechanisms to address the emerging
needs and pandemic response. Experience from Cambodia shows that UNICEF’s direct support
with community outreach services led to minimized disruption in the availability of health and
nutrition services in targeted provinces, contributing to increasing coverage of essential services
and reduction of vaccine drop-outs in targeted populations, despite movement restrictions.
Ensuring strong engagement of community members and continuous support by UNICEF allows
for early identification and timely actions.
269. Lesson 4. Convergence requires organisational dedication, time, resources, and clear and
sound intervention logic. Experience from UNICEF’s efforts in Cambodia to strengthen internal
convergencies and coherence between programme components shows that besides declarative
commitment, dedicated resources, time, and strong overarching programme intervention logic
are needed to transform declarative commitments into working methods.
270. Lesson 5. The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge but can also an opportunity. UNICEF’s
approach to leveraging COVID-19 pandemic and related funding shows how UNICEF COs can
seize opportunity for accelerating and advancing the health system strengthening efforts,
particularly in most vulnerable areas, and for the nutrition program. UNICEF’s ability to leverage
COVID-19 strategic partnerships and resources to strengthen the organisation’s cross-sectoral
capacities is a positive effort towards strengthening UNICEF’s broader, routine programming for
children across multiple sectors.

A comprehensive capacity strengthening strategy with longer-term strategic visioning and partners
direction for at least a 5-year horizon should be developed under the consolidated set of
areas of focus of UNICEF as defined in the CP. This will ensure that capacity strengthening
efforts follow a clear intervention logic and are appropriately targeted to fulfil transformative
potential.
Operational steps include:

partners at national and subnational levels to collect data on capacity gaps, needs and
priorities, identifying in which governance level UNICEF can have more impact in bridging
the gaps to maximise both: sectoral and area-wide approaches and its advocacy role.
Functional and/or fiscal analyses could be considered as some useful tools for such
assessment as exemplified by UNICEF’s PFM work.

Given that budget and fiscal planning issues are obstacles for implementation of adopted partners

expanding its interventions to support the government’s fiscal planning in all targeted
sectors, building upon the ongoing PF4C efforts, and developing a specific strategy for
PF4C (adapting the systematic cross-sectoral integration of the CO SBCC strategy and

Title of Consultancy/Works: UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme Evaluation
Requesting Section: Evaluation
LTA Reference ESAR Evaluation: Provision of consultancy services in conducting Country Programme Evaluations.
Specific LTA line item: Country Programme Evaluation
1. Background
1.1 Introduction
UNICEF Cambodia Country Office (CO) is commissioning the Country Programme Evaluation of the UNICEF Cambodia Country
Programme 2019-2023 (referred to as CPE throughout the document). This CPE terms of reference (ToR) has been developed in
line with the 2018 UNICEF Evaluation Policy, which emphasizes the importance of CPE in guiding the development and
implementation of UNICEF Country Programmes, as well as closely aligned with the newly developed guidance on CPEs.
The Cambodia Country Office is facing important contextual changes: The impact of the ongoing Covid-19 Pandemic on the GDP,
national budgets and overall fiscal space, as well as major socio-economic impacts on Cambodian households in the short term
as well as in the years to come. The projected impacts of climate change also present structural challenges that are likely to
increase going forward. A utilization focused and strategic CPE can help the office better strategize and plan its future CPD.
The timing of the evaluation is aligned with the drafting of the CPD for the next Country Programme. The evaluation will be
carried out between the start of Q1Y4 (namely 2022) and the end of Q2-Y4, while at the same time having three full years of
implementation of the current country programme. The timing of the evaluation has also been adjusted to follow the common
UN processes, including the UNDAF evaluation which is expected to take place in the second semester of 2022, and the
development process of the UNSDCF expected to start in 2022. The CCA is expected to finalize in November 2022, while the UN
Prioritization workshops are expected to take place in March 2023. This will allow UNICEF to use this evaluation for its
prioritization work for the next country programme, expected to take place early 2023.
These Terms of Reference (ToR) set out the purpose, objectives, methodological options and operational modalities for an
institutional contract to undertake this evaluation. The evaluation is expected to start in January 2022 and to be completed
by June 2022 for approximately 18 working weeks. It will be supervised by an Evaluation Management Team led by the
Regional Advisor, Evaluation (UNICEF EAPRO132) and the Evaluation Specialist (UNICEF Cambodia).
1.2 Context
Cambodia has a population of around 15.55 million (7.57 million male and 7.98 million female), with a median age of 27.133
Approximately 39.4 percent live in urban areas and 25 percent of Cambodia’s 3.55 million households are female headed.
Children under age 5 years amount to 9.3 percent of the total population (approximately 1.44 million), while 4.56 million (29.4
percent) are under age 15 years. Youth aged 15-24 account for 17.2 percent.134 Ethnically, 98 percent of Cambodians are Khmer,
though there are 8 officially acknowledged ethnic minorities and 17 recognized indigenous groups. The indigenous groups are
generally located in Cambodia’s North-eastern provinces where socio-economic disadvantage is concentrated.135 Around 8.3
percent of the estimated 4.2 million (predominantly) internal migrants are children. Cambodia is in the midst of transitioning
from a Least Developed Country to a lower-middle-income economy and society.
Cambodia is highly dependent on the natural environment and thus particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The
frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are increasing, including severe drought. In 2020, the country was particularly
hard hit. Around 45,000 hectares of rice paddy were damaged and 16 of Cambodia’s 25 provinces faced freshwater shortages.
The country’s worst flooding in a decade occurred just months later.
Since the time of preparation of the Country Programme there have been significant changes in the programming environment
and the situation of children in Cambodia. These shifts have been largely brought about by the advent of the global COVID-19
pandemic, which altered the trajectory of Cambodia’s development pathway. While in 2020, Cambodia confirmed community
transmission and the total number of reported cases of Covid-19 was 381 with zero deaths, 2021 saw a huge surge in cases and
deaths with 114,810 cases and 2,506 deaths by 11 October. The onset and ramifications of COVID-19 have led to a sharp
slowdown in both domestic and international economic activity, increasing poverty and inequality. Prolonged schools closure
affected 3.2 million students with negative repercussions including learning loss, increased school dropout, vulnerability to child
labour and early marriage. Based on the UN simulation, human development index (HDI) in 2020 dropped by an estimated 3.93%
or the equivalent of four years of progress, largely due to extended school closures.

During the first half of the programme, food insecurity and malnutrition remained an area of significant public health concern.
Cambodia is off-track to achieve the nutrition SDG targets and a high proportion of children suffering from severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) remains, with low coverage of treatment services. At the same time, based on historical data, there are high
rates of underweight for girls aged 15-19 (estimated at 28 percent) and an increasing trend in adolescent pregnancy, making for
a dangerous combination. There have been significant improvements in access to health and education underpinned by
legislative and policy changes, yet Cambodia is 'off course' to meet every maternal, infant and young child nutrition SDG target.
According to national data, although the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is estimated to have declined by more than two thirds
between 2008 and 2019 (from 461 to 141 per 100,000 live births,136 respectively) it remains far from the SDG target of 70 per
100,000 live births. Income poverty and multidimensional poverty remain features of life for children in Cambodia. As of 2015,
roughly 8 percent of children in the country lived below the nationally defined poverty line. At the same time, 48.7 percent of
children experienced multidimensional poverty and were deprived in at least three dimensions of child wellbeing.
The extension of early childhood education (ECE) services to previously under-served rural and remote areas has resulted in
increased enrolment.137 Yet only 11 percent of preschools nationwide have access to basic sanitation services, around 58 percent
to basic drinking water and 38 percent to hygiene services.138 In 2019/2020, an estimated 79.7 percent of the population had
access to an improved water source. In Cambodia, urban basic sanitation coverage increased from 46 percent to 96 percent
between 2000 and 2017, and the gap between the richest and poorest was reduced by more than 60 percentage points over the
same period.139 However, 8 in 10 of the poorest rural Cambodians still practice open defecation. The number of children enrolled
in primary education increased from 82 percent in 1997 to over 97 percent in school year 2017/18. Existing evidence indicates
children in Cambodia are facing significant learning challenges with a great majority of them failing to reach learning standards
appropriate for their age and grade. The Programme for International Student Assessment for Development (PISA-D) conducted
in 2018 shows only 8% of 15-year-olds in Cambodia reach a minimum proficiency level in reading and 10% reach the minimum
level in mathematics.
The Southeast Asia Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics (SEA-PLM) in 2019 also indicates only 11% and 19% of grade 5
students attain minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics respectively. The prolonged school closure due to COVID-19 is
likely to have made learners fall further behind, as captured in the COVID-19 socio economic impact study, where 45% of parents
stated that children were learning less than usual. In addition, COVID-19 has also led to increased number of children starting to
work, potentially increasing the changes of school drop-out. The prevalence of violence, particularly physical violence against
children, remains high. Based on the 2013 survey on violence against children, one in two experienced at least one form of
violence before the age of 18140. Many children are trafficked, forced to work, separated from their families, or unnecessarily
placed in residential care institutions. The education needs assessment conducted in 2020 found that students were found to
be experiencing increased mental health and psychosocial distress during COVID-19 with more than half reporting to have
experienced at least one type of mental health psychosocial stressor during the pandemic period including sadness, loneliness
and fear. In addition to increased mental health and psychosocial distress, a notable portion of students (17 percent girls and 23
percent boys) self-reported facing additional violence, abuse or exploitation.
Other assessments of the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 provide additional evidence of increased mental strain in the form
of anxiety and depression. For example, in the UNICEF-led youth module of the Socio-Economic Assessment in Cambodia, 49
percent of respondents indicated that they experienced anxiety about what is going to happen and another 47 percent
experienced anxiety about “things” in general. Regarding depression, participants responded often or always to statements such
as “nothing is much fun anymore”, “I am tired a lot” and “I have trouble speaking”. Children and adolescents remain at high risk
of dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy, child marriage and violence. In addition, COVID pandemic has further underscored
the importance of WASH interventions in prevention and control of disease transmission. While there was a sharp decline in
open defecation: a drop of 53 percent between 2000 and 2020. Cambodian children of today also have far greater access to
internet and social media - although the digital divide means that only half of school children were able to benefit from remote
learning during the pandemic-related school closures.
1.3 Object of the Evaluation: The UNICEF Cambodia 2019-2023 Country Programme
The RGC-UNICEF Country Programme (2019-2023) was designed to contribute to national efforts to enable “all girls and boys,
especially those most disadvantaged, [to] progressively fulfil their basic rights to survival, care, protection and participation to
reach their full potential.” The programme is clearly aligned with the Government’s draft Rectangular Strategy 4 and National
Strategic Development Plan (2014–2018) midterm review priorities and other sector policies as well as with the UNICEF Strategic
Plan, 2018–2021. The Country Programme is also aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework
(UNDAF) 2019-2023.

The country programme works on three levels: (a) upstream: national; (b) midstream: subnational (provincial and district); and
(c) downstream: community (parents, caregivers, service providers, children and adolescents). The geographical focus is mainly
on north-eastern Cambodia, where socioeconomic indicators are worse than national averages, particularly for ECD, and
presence in north-western areas, particularly for child protection and education. However, depending on specific needs of the
population and programme, other areas of the country are supported. The Country Programme also places importance on
expanding its gender-responsive interventions, on in-depth knowledge and evidence generation, and enhancing work with
adolescents.
The Country Programme Document (CPD) addresses critical overarching issues through prioritizing work in five interconnected
outcome areas: health and nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene; education; child protection; and policy and public financing
for children. There is a sixth programme area on programme effectiveness. The outcomes for each programme component are:
Health & Nutrition: By 2023 pregnant women, mothers, newborns and children under the age of 5 years have increased
equitable access to and the use of quality health and nutrition services, especially in the north-eastern provinces and among
marginalized groups, including during emergencies.
Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH): By 2023, underserved children equitably use safe water and practise safe sanitation and
hygiene, including during humanitarian situations.
Education: By 2023, girls and boys, particularly the rural and urban poor, have increased access to inclusive, equitable, relevant
and quality early childhood and basic education that promotes lifelong learning, including in emergencies.
Child Protection: By 2023, girls and boys including adolescents, living with families and outside of family care are increasingly
free from violence and exploitation and from the threat of violence and exploitation in their homes, schools and communities
and in institutions, including during humanitarian situations.
Social Policy and Public Finance for Children: By 2023, children and adolescents, including the most disadvantaged, benefit
from effective social services and a child-sensitive social protection system.
Programme Effectiveness: The country programme is efficiently designed, coordinated, managed and supported to meet
quality results-based management standards and achieve results for children.
There are 3 outputs associated with each of the first outcome areas, and one output associated with programme effectiveness.
A full description of the Country Programme, implementation strategies, sectoral approaches, results matrix and planned
resources for each programme component can be found in the CPD accessible online here:
https://sites.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/2018-PL22-Rev1-Cambodia_CPD-ODS-EN.pdf. The theory of change of each
programmatic area is included in Annex 1 of this ToR.
In addition to the CPD and Programme Strategy Notes, UNICEF Cambodia develops an Annual Management Plan (AMP), which
highlights the areas of priority for each year and is based on changing context. These priorities are based on key programmatic
and operational concerns that require a whole-office approach to achieve the desired result.
The UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme is jointly implemented by UNICEF and the Royal Government of Cambodia. The
government, line ministries and implementing partners are the key duty bearers. As the Country Programme includes upstream
and downstream work; rights holders include all children in Cambodia and their families as well as pregnant women. Taking
stock of progress and learning are a natural part of the CP cycle. Country programme annual results are monitored through the
Results Assessment Module (RAM) embedded in UNICEF’s ERP141 system. UNICEF Cambodia undertakes mid-year and end-year
reviews with the government and partners, which allow for ongoing identification of challenges, bottlenecks, and progress
towards results for children. Furthermore, UNICEF Cambodia undertakes a quarterly review of its AMP to assess progress
towards the identified priorities, including any course correction needed at specified review points.
A light programmatic review took place from June to September 2021, which will further inform the CPE. The review undertook
an assessment of progress and constraints in achieving results (including but not limited to the impact of COVID-19 on
programmatic results), as well as an assessment of strategies, implementation modalities risks and assumptions. This
programmatic review also included a zonal office review and a reflection on UNICEF’s adolescent programming.
The Costed Evaluation Plan (CEP) identifies seven evaluations to be undertaken during the current programme cycle, and a
further two (2) evaluations have been planned (in addition to those in the CEP) which are also feeding into the Cambodia CO’s
decision-making processes. To date following have been completed: an evaluation of the integrated early childhood development
(IECD) approach implemented in the period 2016–2018, a review of the Mine Risk Education programme and a Country Led
Evaluation of the Action Plan to Prevent and Respond to Violence Against Children. A country led process evaluation of the Cash
Transfer Programme for Pregnant Women and Children Under Two (U-2) is close to completion (as of October 2021). Additional
evaluations expected to finish by February 2022 are: an evaluation of mainstreaming of climate resilience in WASH programming,
and a two pronged evaluation on the SIDA funded project on Strengthening Local Governance for Delivering Social Services and
Social Protection for Vulnerable Children and Women in Cambodia (henceforth referred to as the Strengthening Local
Governance Project) and the Joint SDG funded programme to Support the National Social Protection Policy Framework in
Cambodia.. It is expected that these evaluations strongly inform this Country Programme Evaluation. In addition, during the
remainder of this country programme, an Outcome Evaluation of the Child Protection Programme, and an Impact evaluation of
the education capacity development partnership fund – Phase III are expected to take place in the second semester of 2022 and

first semester of 2023 respectively. These will not inform this CPE, however, will provide evidence to the Country Office and will
feed into the new CPD planning.
2. Purpose and objectives of the consultancy/Contract
The main purpose of the evaluation is to inform the next Country Programme. It will be summative in its ability to assess past
and ongoing programme implementation, with a formative focus to inform future programming and in particular, the design of
the next CPD.
The main objectives of the CPE are to:
Assess the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of the Country Programme, with a strong cross-cutting focus on equity,
human rights, disability and gender equality and with a focus on specific programme areas which have not been subject to
evaluation
To identify key challenges that constrain or catalysts that accelerate and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of CP
implementation and performance
To assess the ability of the country programme to respond and adapt to changing contexts (including but not limited to COVID-
19), new emerging issues, and national priorities
Support an accountability objective by providing an independent assessment of progress towards expected results of the country
programme, and the programme’s contribution to national development results and UNICEF’s contribution to UNDAF
results.
Identify key lessons from implementation of the ongoing country programme which can inform the design of the next country
programme,
3. Work Assignments/TOR
Evaluation Scope
Focus of the evaluation
The country programme evaluation will not look at the entirety of the country programme results framework and will not
evaluate every sector independently. The evaluation will look at the country programme as a whole, assess higher level results
and will have a special focus on a few areas that are relevant to all programme sections (presented below), and in particular
aspects of the country programme that are assumed to be necessary to reach results in a sustainable, efficient and equitable
manner. After three years of programme implementation, the CPE will not fully be able to capture final outcomes achieved,
however, will be able to make a solid assessment on progress towards country programme outcomes.
Three programme areas will be prioritized for a deep-down and detailed evaluative assessment. These are: Health and Nutrition,
Education and WASH. The WASH component should exclude what is covered under the ongoing Climate Resilient WASH
evaluation. The final report of this evaluation is expected in January 2022, providing a chance to reflect on the scope of WASH
components based on what was covered in the evaluation. These programme areas will be the object of analysis on key aspects
of the evaluation:
o Assessment of relevance, effectiveness and sustainability with a focus on equity, gender equality and human rights;
o Identification of catalysts and barriers to effectiveness of implementation and performance;
o support to systems strengthening (e.g. support in development of costed action plans/strategic plans, evidence
generation, development and use of MIS systems and data, etc.) and
o UNICEF contribution towards increasing fiscal space for child related priorities.
The CPE will look at the Country Programme in its entirety with respect to the following assessment areas:
o Use of the following strategies to achieve results: a) programming at scale, b) winning support for the cause of children
from decision makers, c) developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children and d) using the power of
evidence to drive change
o Adequacy of the CO’s capacity to deliver in a convergent approach, and in those areas where the work is more
advanced, whether the convergence approach has led to acceleration in achievement of results
o Ability of the country programme to respond and adapt to changing contexts (including but not limited to COVID-19),
new emerging issues, and national priorities. This further includes exploring the quality of the response and the use of
new strategies (e.g. Private Sector Engagement and T4D)
o Contribution to national development results and UNDAF outcomes
It is expected that through these focus areas, the CPE will be able to provide a solid set of forward looking recommendations
that will allow the Country Programme to capitalize on gains, further exploit its comparative advantages and align its
programmatic strengths to the changing needs of children in Cambodia as well as to the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2021-2025.
Geographic scope: Nationwide for systems strengthening and advocacy, while for service delivery related focus areas the
geographic scope would be:
Health & Nutrition: North East zone;
WASH: NE and provinces with high ODF potential and high levels of inequity in sanitation coverage, including Svay Rieng, Takeo,
and Kampong Speu.;
Education: North East, North West and others
Timeframe: Evaluation time scope to focus on current country programme only 2019-2023 (effectively, 2019-2021 in a summative
way, 2022 onward in a formative manner).

Evaluation questions and criteria
The CPE prioritises the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria of: relevance/appropriateness, effectiveness, and sustainability. In addition
to OECD/DAC evaluation criteria, the evaluation will prioritize human rights, equity and gender equality as key criteria.
• Relevance: it is critically important for UNICEF to be able to assess the extent to which it’s programme objectives, and design
are appropriate to the Cambodian context and are able to respond and adapt to the needs of beneficiaries and other
stakeholders in this changing context;
83
• Effectiveness: the extent to which the Country Programme achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives including
support for / working with others including government;
• Sustainability: this reflects the importance of assessing the extent UNICEF’s work has succeeded in creating potential
adoption by the government and local institutions in future, and enhancing the likelihood that results will continue in future,
and
• Analysis of the extent to which human rights, child rights, disability inclusion and gender equality and equity have been
addressed within the programme will be mainstreamed within the criteria and within the evaluation questions.
The evaluation will not focus on impact, efficiency or coherence in an effort to prioritize the key questions that the office feels
are most strategic for learning. Impact will be best assessed once CDHS data becomes available in the second half of 2022.
Coherence is touched upon when exploring convergence, which has been included as an aspect under effectiveness. Impact,
coherence and efficiency have been included in most of the other evaluations undertaken by the country office in this country
programme cycle, allowing for lessons learned that can also inform the programme as a whole.
The following table provides an overview of the evaluation objectives, the questions that will guide the evaluation and the criteria
covered under each.

Agencies are encouraged to propose changes to the questions and sub-questions and even to add sub-questions in their
proposals. The proposal should also include a preliminary evaluation matrix linking evaluation criteria and questions with
appropriate indicators, the proposed methods of data collection and analysis as well as and data sources for answering each
evaluation question (and exploring the sub-questions). The proposal should also hint at what will be used as rating metrics for
each question. These evaluation metrics will be further elaborated during the inception phase, but the proposal should show
the firm’s ability to develop appropriate metrics for assessing each question objectively.
Evaluation methodology and approach
Based on the objectives of the evaluation, this section indicates a possible approach, methods, and processes for the
evaluation.142 Methodological rigor will be given significant consideration in the assessment of proposals. Hence bidders
are invited to interrogate the approach and methodology proffered in the ToR and improve on it or propose an approach
they deem more appropriate. In their proposal, bidder should clearly refer to triangulation, sampling plan, ethical
consideration and methodological limitations and mitigation measures. Bidders are encouraged to also demonstrate
methodological expertise in evaluating initiatives related to the focus areas (i.e. system strengthening, convergent service
delivery, demand creation and social norms and humanitarian and development nexus) as well as evaluating Country
Programmes or assessment of development assistance agencies.
The design of the evaluation is expected to be non-experimental, and theory based in assessing the relevance, effectiveness and
sustainability of the UNICEF strategy, and approaches adopted in the current programme cycle against their intended aims.
During the process the evaluation team would assess Theories of Change within the Programme Strategy Notes for the
programme components and assess and validate these in the evaluation and help stimulate reflection and inform thinking for
the next Country Programme. The evaluation is expected to be utilization focused and has ensured participation of key users
from its onset. As the focus areas refer to implementing strategies, the theory-based approach would set out a strong focus on
pathways of change and whether focus areas are enabling and accelerating the achievement of results as set out by the Theories
of Change. The Evaluation Team could consider a Process Tracing approach for the focus areas and in particular for effectiveness

review and in consultation with UNICEF Cambodia.
85
questions. The evaluation team is free to propose the most suitable methodologies to address the remaining evaluation
questions that are not related directly to the theories of change of the focus programme areas.
With a strong focus on utilisation, the approach of the evaluation will concentrate on engaging with the principal users of the
evaluation process and report – UNICEF country and regional offices, key stakeholders in national government ministries and
departments, representatives at national and sub-national level, and other UN organisations working in Cambodia throughout
the process. This includes involvement of the stakeholders in the evaluation design (inception phase), in the validation of data
collected and emerging results as well in the formulation and validation of recommendations. This will increase the relevance of
the questions asked, the appropriateness of the data collected as well as the level of actionability and usefulness of the
recommendations. Where feasible and relevant, the evaluators are encouraged to include adolescents and youth in the
validation of evaluation findings and recommendations, including but not limited to the Adolescent and Youth Reference Group
(AYRG).
Mixed methods will be incorporated as far as possible. Discussions within Phnom Penh and field consultations will be largely
qualitative and might need to take place remotely. Quantitative data will be largely drawn from existing data sources, and to a
lesser extent, from primary data collection. The evaluation team will need to draw on available quantitative data from recent
evaluations, reviews, research studies, progress reports, situation reports, national datasets and surveys and other sources. All
data collected will need to undergo rigorous triangulation during data analysis and reporting, and it must be ensured that key
findings that lead to conclusions come from triangulated data. Bidders will be encouraged to propose any feasible stakeholder
consultation approaches that could generate useful quantitative data on key issues and help form qualitative areas of enquiry.
The methodology will be further refined in the inception phase.
Participatory approaches will be adopted within the evaluation process, with engagement and consultation of key stakeholders
in government (national and local levels) and partner agencies throughout the process.
In the proposal, the Evaluation Team will assess options and set out detailed methods suited to meeting the requirements of the
purpose, scope and objectives of this evaluation.
The Evaluation Team will be expected to conform to guidance and standards set by UN and UNICEF. The team will be guided by
UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018), the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation
(2016), UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020), UN SWAP Evaluation Performance Indicator (2018), UNEG Guidance on
Integrating Human Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluation (2014), and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards
(2017)
Likewise, conventional ethical guidelines are to be followed during the evaluation. Specific reference is made to the UNEG Norms
and Standards and Ethical Guidelines, as well as the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and
Data Collection and Analysis and UNICEF’s Evaluation Reporting Standards.143 Note that the standards cover the possibility
of needing an ethical review of the inception report and evaluation tools, especially when vulnerable populations are included
into the data collection. Ethical review from an IRB should be considered in the technical and financial proposal and in
the timeline and are the responsibility of the consultant. Good practices not covered therein are also to be followed. Any
sensitive issues or concerns should be raised with the Evaluation Manager as soon as they are identified.
Data collection methods
At minimum, the evaluation will draw on the following methods:
• Comprehensive desk review of available documentation – country strategy and associated reports (e.g. Situation
Analysis Report, Gender Programmatic Review, Country Programme Document, Programme Strategy Notes, Annual
Management Plan), progress reports, UNICEF’s Enterprise Resource Planning system144 reports, mid-year, end-year
reviews and annual reports, evaluations, third party monitoring, research and studies reports and the Programmatic
Review report. Key government documents also need to be reviewed, such as the Cambodia National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023, and key sectoral and thematic action plans. Midterm review of the NSDP in
underway, and based on government timelines, it will be finalized by early 2022. Given the Covid-19 context, it is
expected that the inception phase might take place without field visits from the evaluation team. However, as the
country and region open up, it is strongly advised to favour an on-site visit if possible. It is strongly encouraged to have
strong national evaluation staff in Cambodia who can be ready to support consultation processes or support to the
inception phase on the ground.
• Initial consultation through Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) at the inception phase to shape the inception process mostly
with UNICEF Cambodia Country Office (current and former staff) and Regional office.
• Country visit during data collection stage. The emphasis for in-country data collection will be on key stakeholder
consultations using:
o Individual key informant interviews with staff representatives of UNICEF, government officials and other
implementing partners, UN agencies and other humanitarian partners, including:
▪ Government officials from key ministries and departments (see Annex 2 for line ministries with
whom programme sections have signed workplans);
▪ UNICEF Cambodia senior staff and programme leads
▪ Other UN agencies with whom UNICEF Cambodia has joint programmes and the RC’s office
▪ Donor representatives and as appropriate, other organisations operating in Cambodia
143 See: https://www.unicef.org/media/54796/file
144 UNICEF’s ERP backbone and major software is SAP.
86
▪ Key UNICEF EAP regional staff in Bangkok
o Focus group discussions at national level and with representatives of line Ministries
o Field visits to a selection of field sites for observation and consultation at the sub-national level. This will
depend on the Covid-19 situation at the time of data collection, expected to take place around
February/March 2022. Existing data coming from studies, surveys and third-party monitoring should be used
as much as possible to draw information from rights holders. Rights holders and beneficiaries would be
included in data collection as seen fit to answer they key evaluation questions.
o It is important to note that data collection might need to be done remotely in case of travel/ movement
restrictions due to COVID-19. Innovative and appropriate remote data collection methods need to be
proposed and considered from the onset.
• A survey could also be considered to complement the evidence collected through the above-mentioned data
collection tools, and access stakeholders such as former staff.
Data collection and analysis should be human rights based and gender sensitive. Any data collected should be disaggregated by
age, gender, state/region, disability, etc., where possible. Data triangulation will be of crucial importance. Data analysis should
also include aspects of gender, equity and human rights into consideration.
A sampling strategy should be included in the Technical Proposal, setting out how geographic areas and populations, and
different stakeholder groups will be sampled. This applies to both quantitative and qualitative data collection.
Assessing and validating findings
• Initial findings validation workshop: Initial findings will be presented to stakeholders in a workshop to assess
the validity/ accuracy of the findings and their relevance to the country context and UNICEF programming and
strategy at the end of the in-country visit/ data collection phase, with feedback documented including where
any divergent views, sensitivities, or lack of consensus on these findings arise. These will be based as far as
possible on triangulation of evidence collected.
• Recommendations workshop: Once data analysis is finalized, a final workshop with the reference group and
management team will be conducted. Findings and conclusions will be presented. Conclusions should present
reasonable judgements based on findings and substantiated by evidence and provide insights pertinent to the
object and purpose of the evaluation and will be presented in the workshop. Stakeholders will then be asked at
the workshop to help the evaluation team formulate and prioritise recommendations so that relevance,
usefulness and actionability of these can be maximised. It is suggested that preliminary and well-thought
recommendations are brought as inputs, although enough space should be given for co-creation of the
recommendations in the workshop.
Limitations
Some limitations can already be foreseen and should be taken into consideration in the proposal and in the design of the
methodology and approach to be followed. The main limitation is related to Covid-19. Even though data collection is not expected
to take place until Q1 2022, it is unknown what the level of restrictions or mobility might look like at that point. Alternative remote
evaluative methods, scenarios and possibilities to ensure that the evaluation retains its high quality in the face of continued
restrictions, as well as its participatory approach need to be considered and included in the proposal.
Tied to this are budget considerations as resources are being prioritized for the covid-19 response. Bidders are expected to offer
the best possible services while being cost-conscious and looking for alternatives and innovations that can keep costs down while
meeting the evaluation objectives.
Bidders are encouraged to identify the limitations of the proposed methods and any risks related to evaluation conduct as well
as mitigating measures for these limitations and risks in the proposal.

note in preparation for data collection (summary note in both English and Khmer). The IR will be initially shared with
the management team and after revision, will be shared with the reference group for clearance.
87
The Inception Report will be key in confirming a mutual understanding of what is to be evaluated, including additional insights
into executing the evaluation. At this stage, evaluators will refine and confirm evaluation questions, confirm the scope of the
evaluation, further improve on the methodology proposed in the ToR and their own evaluation proposal to improve its rigor, as
well as develop and validate evaluation instruments. The report will include, among other elements: i) evaluation purpose and
scope, confirmation of objectives of the evaluation; ii) evaluation criteria and questions; iii) evaluation methodology (i.e., sampling
criteria), along with a description of data collection methods and data sources (incl. a rationale for their selection), advanced
draft data collection instruments, for example questionnaires, with a data collection toolkit as an annex, an evaluation matrix
that identifies descriptive and normative questions and criteria for evaluating evidence, data analysis methods and a data
analysis plan, a discussion on how to enhance the reliability and validity of evaluation conclusions, the field visit approach, a
description of the quality review process, a discussion on the limitations of the methodology and ethical considerations; iv)
proposed structure of the final report; v) evaluation work plan and timeline, including a revised work and travel plan and
deliverables timeline; vi) detailed evaluation budget; vii) annexes (i.e., organizing matrix for evaluation questions, data collection
toolkit, data analysis framework); and vi) a summary of the evaluation process (evaluation briefing note) for external
communication purposes;
2) A summary of initial evaluation findings from primary data collection of maximum 20 pages excluding annexes
(in English), and a PowerPoint presentation to facilitate the initial findings consultation workshop (in English and
Khmer). The report should include findings from the desk review and data collection (primary and secondary), with an
initial attempt to triangulation of findings. The report should also present a matrix of quality of data collected for
responding to each evaluation question and point to gaps that challenged the data collection phase. The report should
include as annexes the notes and summaries made during the desk review, transcripts of qualitative data (KIIs and
FGDs) as well as the anonymised datasets obtained from the online survey;
3) A draft and final report that fully conforms to the Global Evaluation Report Oversight System145 of not more than 50
plus executive summary and annexes (in English and Khmer) that will be revised until approved (incl. a complete first
draft to be reviewed by the Evaluation Management Team and UNICEF; a second draft to be reviewed by the Reference
Group, and a penultimate draft to be cleared by the Evaluation Management Team).
4) A Power Point presentation of the final report (in both English and Khmer) to be used to share final evaluation
findings and conclusions with the Reference Group in a validation workshop and updated to include final
recommendations for use in subsequent dissemination events; and
5) A four-page Evaluation Brief (in both English and Khmer) that is distinct from the executive summary in the evaluation
report and it is intended for a broader, non-technical and non-UNICEF audience, and should resemble an e-book or
infographic as much as possible. The summary of findings and recommendations will also be shared with national and
sub national level officials and will need to be produced using disability accessible and inclusive formats.
Reports will be prepared according to the UNICEF Style Guide, UNICEF Brand Toolkit and UNICEF Publication Toolkit (to be shared
with the winning bidder) and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG Evaluation Reports Standards as per GEROS guidelines (referenced before).
All deliverables must be in professional level standard English and they must be language-edited/proof-read by a native speaker.
The final report as well as the four-page Evaluation Brief need to be accessible and inclusive of people with disabilities. This
means specifically that:
• All images such as quotation boxes, tables and infographics in the design must be accompanied by Alt Text to
enable a screen reader to detect and provide an audio description;
• Final publication must be delivered as an accessible PDF . The designer is expected to check the levels (ad
adjust accordingly) of accessibility in the document. They can do this using the “accessibility checker” in their
design software and via the “Read Aloud” function on Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Other interim products are:
• Minutes of key meetings with the Evaluation Management Team and the Reference Group;
• Presentation materials for the meetings with the Evaluation Management Team and the Reference Group (if needed,
in addition to the ones mentioned above). These may include PowerPoint summaries of work progress and conclusions
to that point.
Bidders are invited to reflect on each outline and effect the necessary modification to enhance their coverage and clarity. Having
said so, products are expected to conform to the stipulated number of pages where that applies.
6. Location and Duration
Location: Home based with field missions to Cambodia: Phnom Penh and areas selected for data collection
Duration: January-June 2022
An estimated budget has been allocated for this evaluation. As reflected in Table three, the evaluation has a timeline of six
months from January 2022 to June 2022. Adequate effort should be allocated to the evaluation to ensure timely submission of
all deliverables, approximately 18 weeks on the part of the Evaluation Team (6 additional weeks for quality assurance have been
noted below but may not require working full time from the evaluation team). The proposal should consider alternatives for
meeting the deadlines in the current Covid-19 scenario, including alternative ways of data collection and participatory validation.
145 UNICEF has instituted the Global Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS), a system where final evaluation reports are
quality assessed by an external company against UNICEF/UNEG Norms and Standards for evaluation reports. The Evaluation
Team is expected to reflect on and conform to these standards as they write their report. The team may choose to share a self-
assessment based on the GEROS with the Evaluation Manager.

The Team Members will play a key role in data collection, analysis and presentation, and preparation of the debriefings and will
make significant contributions to the writing of the main evaluation report.
The Evaluation Team is expected to be gender and geographically balanced. Back-office support assisting the team with logistics
and other administrative matters is also expected to be provided by the evaluation firm. It is vital that the same individuals
that develop the methodology for the proposal will be involved in conducting the evaluation. In the review of the
proposal, while adequate consideration will be given to the technical methodology, significant weighting will be given
to the quality, experience (CV’s and written samples of previous evaluations) and relevance of individuals who will be
involved in the evaluation.
8. Administrative Issues
The consultant is expected to submit their financial proposals inclusive of cross country and in-country travel and DSA cost.
Consultant will be responsible for travel arrangements cross-country and in country (if required). No additional cost outside of
the scope of this TOR will be covered by UNICEF.
Travel cost shall be calculated based on economy class travel, regardless of the length of travel and costs for accommodation,
meals and incidentals shall not exceed applicable daily subsistence allowance (DSA) rates, as promulgated by the International
Civil Service Commission (ICSC).
90
The consultants will have to possess own laptop and other technical equipment to complete the assignment. No office space at
UNICEF Cambodia will be provided.
The documents produced during the period of this consultancy will be treated strictly confidential and the rights of distribution
and/or publication shall solely reside with UNICEF.
Some of the documents (see where indicated in the deliverables above) should be developed in both English and Khmer. The
translation costs are to be covered by the consultants and clearly budgeted in the financial proposal as well. Translation services
for the two validation workshops need to be organized and covered by the evaluation team.
9. Project Management/Contract Supervisor and other stakeholders
Evaluation management
The evaluation will be conducted by an external Evaluation Team (ET) hired by a consultancy firm to be recruited by UNICEF
Cambodia. The Evaluation Team will operate under the supervision of an Evaluation Specialist at UNICEF Cambodia, together
with the EAPRO Regional Advisor. Together they will act as Evaluation Managers and therefore be responsible for the day-to-day
oversight and management of the evaluation and for the management of the evaluation budget. The Evaluation supervisors will
assure the quality and independence of the evaluation and together with the ET guarantee its alignment with UNEG Norms and
Standards and Ethical Guidelines and other relevant procedures, provide quality assurance checking that the evaluation findings
and conclusions are relevant; and recommendations are implementable, and contribute to the dissemination of the evaluation
findings and follow-up on the management response. the supervisory team will work in collaboration with a management team
consisting of the Representative, Deputy Representative and selected members of the PME team. The role of the evaluation
management team is to provide feedback and oversight to every deliverable, including to its first draft version.
A Reference Group will be established, including UNICEF staff from different sections of the Country Office, government officials
from the Ministry of Planning. The Reference Group will have an advisory role with a focus on the the following tasks: contribute
to the preparation and design of the evaluation, including providing feedback and comments on the Inception Report and on
the technical quality of the work of the consultants; provide comments and substantive feedback to ensure the quality – from a
technical point of view – of the draft and final evaluation reports; assist in identifying internal and external stakeholders to be
consulted during the evaluation process; participate in review meetings organized by the Evaluation Management Team and
with the Evaluation Team as required; play a key role in learning and knowledge sharing from the evaluation results, contributing
to disseminating the findings of the evaluation and participate in the drafting and validation of recommendations.
Quality assurance
Quality assurance plays a vital role in the evaluation and involves a wide range of people. Quality assurance must start from the
evaluation firm bidding for this work, and evaluation team itself, and clear quality assurance considerations and system must be
presented in the proposal and ensured throughout the evaluation. As a minimum, the UNICEF evaluation manager, together
with the evaluation management team will be the second layer of quality assurance. The reference group together with the
Regional Office will add a third layer of technical and strategic feedback. Each deliverable will undergo a thorough process of
quality assurance. Quality assurance will focus on the technical soundness of the deliverables, as well as on ensuring the
deliverables meet the reporting standards set out by GEROS and other UNICEF and UNEG guidelines as mentioned above. The
evaluation manager will make such guidelines available, as well as examples of highly satisfactory evaluation reports to guide
the evaluation team.
Quality assurance turnaround times: The inception report and final report will go through various rounds of quality assurance,
starting with a first review by the evaluation management team (1 week). After this review the evaluation firm will have one week
turnaround time after which the report must be returned together with the comments matrix. This will then be shared with the
reference group, who have two weeks to review the report and revert with comments. Power point presentations to the
management team and reference group (in English and Khmer) will also be given to provide interactive ways to get feedback.

Annex 2. Extended Context Analysis
Cambodia is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliamentary government located on the Indochinese mainland of
Southeast Asia. The dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in 2017 effectively transformed the
country into a one-party system with diminishing civic and democratic space over the past decade.147 Cambodia has a population
of 15.5 million people, 51.3 percent of which are female.148 This represents a 16.1 percent increase since the last census in 2008.
Cambodia has a young population with the median age being 27 years and over half of the population being under 35 years of
age. As stated in the UN Common Country Analysis (CCA), the youthful population (over 38% below 19 years old) represents both
a catalyst for driving economic activity and innovation as well as added pressure for education, skills development, health care
and social services.149
The urban population represents 39.4 percent of the overall population. Rising wages in the light manufacturing and other
service sectors has led to rapid urbanization and internal migration.150 The country is divided into four regions (Central Plain
region, Tonle Sap region, Plateau and Mountains region and Costal and Sea region) and 25 provinces, which are the country’s
first-level administrative divisions.151 Figure 1 shows the distribution of the population by provinces as per the 2019 Census.

1.1.1.1.1 Socio-Economic Context
Cambodia has made significant strides in its economy reaching lower middle- income country (LMIC) status in 2015 and aspiring
to transition to an upper middle-income country by 2030. The current approach to economic development in Cambodia is
organized under the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023, designed to operationalize Phase Four of Cambodia’s
Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency. The NSDP prioritizes, above all, human resource development
through improving the quality of education and healthcare, provision of vocational training to increase human capital and
strengthening gender equality and social protections.
Cambodia sustained a steady annual growth of 7.7 percent from 1998 to 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly
slowed the economy with growth falling by an estimated 10.1 percentage points compared to the pre-pandemic coverage growth
rate.152 The dramatic decline highlights high dependence on a limited range of products, markets and factor inputs especially in
the service, construction and real estate sectors.153 The employment rate has also been negatively affected by the COVID-19
pandemic and the resulting stringent measures to stop the spread of the pandemic. According to World Bank, about 45 percent
of households continue to experience income losses.154 The Figure below provides an overview of multiple deprivations in
Cambodia.
FIGURE 8. MULTIPLE DEPRIVATIONS INDEX
Cambodia’s progress towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), endorsed in 2015 and localized to the
Cambodian SDGs (CSDG), is mixed.155 While there has been substantial progress in SDG 1, 6, 12 and 13, performance on SDGs
related to education (SDG4), gender equality (SDG5), life below water (SDG14) and partnerships (SDG17) have stagnated.
Progress, previously supported by consistent economic growth, has been threatened by the devastating impacts of the COVID-
19 pandemic. 156 Other challenges are the countries high exposure to the impacts of climate change157 with Cambodia in the top
third of countries in the world where children are most vulnerable to climate change,158 and continuing gaps in public
management reform and systems strengthening.159
Education: The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport’s (MoEYS) developed and adopted the National Education 2030 Roadmap
for SDG4 which provides the overarching strategy and priorities for achieving long-term education targets under SDG4. The
adoption of the Roadmap is, in part, the result of findings from a midterm review (MTR) of the 2014-2018 Education Strategic

Plan (ESP) conducted in 2016 whereby the MoEYS revised its education policies to be consistent with SDG4.160 Primary enrolment
is nearly universal with 91.9 percent net enrolment rates for 2021 dropping to 32.2 percent for upper secondary net enrolment.161
The gender gap in education remains in primary and secondary education where completion rates are much lower for boys
compared to girls, though there is almost no gap in early childhood education.162 Despite high enrolment, the quality of education
is poor with nearly a quarter of students in Grade 3 unable to write a single word in a dictation test.163 Furthermore, considerable
disparities exist in terms of access to quality education. Children with disabilities, indigenous children, those living in rural areas,
those from poorer areas and those from poorer families face additional barriers to accessing quality education. The average
student-teacher ratio is 47:1 but this reaches closer to 100:1 in the poorest areas.164
Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH): Cambodia has made considerable progress in reaching national WASH targets.
However, progress has been insufficient to reach the CSDG 6 goals. Between 2015 and 2020, Cambodia achieved the second
largest increase in the world in access to at least basic sanitation at the household level and largest decrease in rates of open
defecation (16 percentage points for both indicators).165 However, despite these improvements, Cambodia is not on track to meet
national and global targets with a continuation of the annual rate of increase in basic sanitation in rural areas at 3%, and in the
reduction in rural open defecation at 3.6% (since 2000).166 Continuing obstacles to reaching sanitation targets include gaps in
public financing for rural sanitation, centralized open defecation verification processes and relatively weak sanitation markets in
underserved areas.167
Cambodia achieved the ninth largest increase in basic hygiene in the world between 2015 and 2020, with an increase of 7%
points.168 However, with a 2020 baseline of 70.85%, and continuation of the annual increase of 1.5% (recorded since 2010), the
country is not on track to reach the national target of universal basic hygiene in rural areas by 2025, nor the global SDG target
date of 2030.169 Absence of soap amongst 14% of rural households, and handwashing facilities amongst 15% of rural households,
particularly among the poor, remain major bottlenecks.170 Updated data from the 2021 JMP indicates that of the three elements
of WASH, access to drinking water in rural areas posed the largest challenge, with an average annual rate of change of 0.9% since
2000 – slower than that of rural sanitation and hygiene (discussed above).171 At this rate, the national and global targets will not
be met until after mid-century.172
The underperformance of rural water compared to rural sanitation in Cambodia remains a major challenge, with the top-down,
centralized funding and service delivery model of rural water supply making it more subject to investment and implementation
bottlenecks than the more bottom-up model of rural sanitation, where households largely finance their own needs, and small
entrepreneurs deliver service improvements.
WASH services in Cambodia are vulnerable to seasonal variations which are amplified by changes in climate. Rural populations
experience a 22 percentage point wet to dry season decrease in those using improved water sources, and the poorest rural
households experience a 20 percentage point drop in those using improved water sources, compared to a 11 percentage point
drop amongst the richest rural households.173 In sanitation, it is estimated that over 25% of the population is affected by
challenging environments, living in areas affected by floods, high ground water, and other barriers to effective sanitation and
fecal sludge management. Of that population, the majority (62.5%) live in seasonally affected flood prone areas.174
WASH services in school have been interrupted by the impact of climate change,175 affecting children’s school attendance and
possibly academic performance through the damages of the physical infrastructures and the contamination of water sources
during floods, and the reduced quantity of safe drinking water and water for flushing and cleaning purposes during droughts176.
Health and Nutrition: Health in Cambodia has shown significant improvement in the quality, availability, and utilization of
health services. The RGC has invested substantial resources in increasing equitable access to healthcare through pro-poor
demand side financing initiatives. Under the current draft Health Strategic Plan 4 2022-2030, Cambodia maintains a commitment
to SDG3 to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. In March 2016, the government committed to achieving

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) 177 through the Social Health Protection Framework.178 As of 2021, total effective social health
protection coverage equates to about one-third of the total population. Cambodia’s largest social health protection scheme, the
Health Equity Fund (HEF), was established to provide free access to health care for the poorest. Free benefits under the HEF have
been extended to some informal workers and selected populations (about 93,500 enrollees).179 In addition, according to the
Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSAVY), the roll-out of the on-demand ID Poor system in 2020, has
increased eligibility by approximately 195,321 new beneficiaries (poor households) from May 2020 to March 2021.180,181 Although
the HEF allows poor households with Equity or IDPoor cards to access healthcare services free of charge, about 40 percent of
the total population (especially people clustering around the poverty line) – are not covered.182
Cambodia achieved the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for both maternal and child mortality183. The maternal mortality
rate has halved in the last decade, from 303 to decreased to 160 per 100,000 between 2007 and 2017, the last year of
measurement.184 Over the same period, infant and under-five mortality rates both decreased by over 70 percent.185 These
improvements are driven largely by increased antenatal and postnatal care, increased immunization coverage and skilled birth
attendance.186 However, the agenda of access to basic reproductive, maternal and under-five health services has not been met
for all in the country.187 Remaining challenges include high neonatal mortality, a double disease burden of communicable and
non-communicable diseases (NCDs)188, and high rates of adolescent pregnancy.
Inadequate and inappropriate Infant and Young Children Feeding (IYCF) practices leave many Cambodian children at high risk of
malnutrition during the early stages of life with Cambodia falling behind in achieving exclusive breastfeeding targets (with 65.2
percent of infants aged 0 to 5 months exclusively breastfed) and the target of reducing anemia among women of reproductive
age (with 47.1 percent of women aged 15 to 49 years now affected).189
Data on the nutritional status of children in Cambodia is out of date (2014) but the recently completed Demographic and Health
Survey (2021-22) will provide updated figures for the prevalence of stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiencies. Previous
data indicated high levels of stunting, medium levels of wasting, and high rates of several micronutrient deficiencies including
anaemia, and iodine deficiency disorder (IDD)190.
Some of the key factors associated with these poor outcomes in Cambodia are: a poor diet quality, and insufficient access to
improved sanitation and water sources,191 which in the rural areas and for the poor and near-poor are very much related to the
dependence on agriculture for their livelihoods (for nearly 70 percent of the population living in rural areas), limited educational
177 The vision of universal health coverage (UHC) is for all people to have access to quality health services, when and where they
need them, without suffering financial hardship
178 Cambodia’s high-level strategy and policy documents include the National Strategic Development Plan 2019–2023 call to
advance UHC by increasing population coverage of social health protection to 65% by 2023. Health Economics Review

179 The scheme reimburses public health facilities user-fees normally paid by the patient. Since 2017, approximately 2.6 million
household members have been covered under the HEF, representing about 16.1% of the total population. Kolesar, Robert

completion beyond primary school and limited access to health services, poor hygiene and sanitation and sub-optimal feeding
and childcare practices.192 At the same time, Cambodia is going through a nutrition transition, with an increased trend of
overweight and obesity and diet-related diseases.193 The second multisectoral National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition
(NSFSN 2019 - 2023) makes explicit the focus on addressing child malnutrition in all its forms from multisectoral dimensions.
According to the Ministry of Health, funding and delivery capacity for nutrition programmes, especially to manage acute
malnutrition (wasting), is limited, reaching only 10 percent of children with total severe acute malnutrition in the country.194 This
adds to the burden of morbidity and mortality in the under-five population and the failure to achieve the SDG target for
wasting.195 In March 2020, five UN agencies (FAO, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP and WHO) released the Framework for Action for the UN
Global Action Plan (GAP) on Child Wasting to accelerate progress in preventing and managing child wasting. The GAP Framework
aims to support countries in prioritizing and coordinating the delivery of preventive and treatment actions across four key
systems: food, health, social protection, and WASH. Cambodia is identified as one of the 23 frontrunner countries globally and
one of the five in the region to implement the GAP.196
Health service utilization rates in Cambodia are considered low compared with other Asian countries.197 Cambodian households
bear approximately 60 percent of health care costs out of pocket, posing a substantial barrier to poorer households.198 There is
still a long way to go to achieve universal access to essential health services in the country: between 2015 and 2019, the
Cambodian UHC only increased from 57.7 to 61.2.199 Equitable and access to quality health and education services remains a
challenge with specific vulnerable groups facing health care access challenges: elderly people, people living with a disability,
households living in poverty, single female-headed households and indigenous groups.200 There are also persisting inequalities
in health outcomes by socioeconomic status, geographic regions and between urban and rural populations.201
Children, and Youth Protection: There is an increasingly robust legal framework and expanded child protection services
available in Cambodia.202 Major legal achievements include approval of Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual
Exploitation and its Explanatory Note, the Law on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the
Law on Domestic Violence, the In-Country Adoption Law, the Juvenile Justice Law, and the Action Plan for the Implementation of
the National Policy on Child Protection System 2019-2029. 203
The government has made significant strides in alternative care system also adopting for instance the Sub-Decree on the
Management of Residential care Centers in 2015 to regulate the residential care sector. In 2015, the Ministry of Social Affairs,
Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation (MoSVY) together with UNICEF and USAID supports conducted a national mapping of all
residential care facilities across the country. The mapping identified that there were many residential care institutions (RCIs)
outside of the ministry’s regulatory framework (inspection reports) which raised serious concerns.204 Several successful steps
were taken, including the Action Plan for Improving Child Care and a reintegration programme for children in Residential care
which led to a decrease in the number of children living in RCIs.205
The government has also publicly committed to ending all forms of violence against children, becoming the 26th Pathfinding
Country in 2019.206 With the support of UNICEF, the government developed the ‘Action Plan to Respond to Violence against
Children 2017-2021’, a holistic plan to be implemented at national and sub-national levels which includes specific operational

plans and budgets dedicated to activities addressing violence against children.207 Positively, the 2017 Violence Against Children
Survey (VACS) shows a decrease in exposure to physical violence compared to 2013 data.208 However, violence against children
remains a substantial problem with over half of respondents in 2013 (approximately 60 percent) reporting experiencing
emotional, physical or sexual violence during childhood.209
In 2016, Cambodia passed the Juvenile Justice Law which was followed by the Juvenile Justice Law Strategic and Operation Plan
(JJLSOP) 2018-2020, to provide adequate and holistic support to children in conflict with the law. The new law presents a positive
shift in the approach requiring that the child protection and judicial systems focus on diversion, rehabilitation, and reintegration
rather punishment of children in conflict with the law. This is a new approach and concept for the law in Cambodia that requires
acceptance and high-level support.210
1.1.1.1.2 Poverty
A significant proportion of Cambodians live on the verge of poverty, reducing their resilience to socio-economic and natural
shocks. The government has advanced substantial pro-poor legislation under its ‘Rectangular Strategy for Growth’ most notably
the implementation of the ‘Social Protection Policy Framework 2016-2025’ and mitigated rising poverty levels through scale up
of assistance to poor and vulnerable households in June 2020.211 The Government also introduced a child grant through Sub-
Decree 245, providing US190 benefit to poor households identified through the IDPoor scheme.212
The Cambodian poverty line was redefined using the most recent Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey for 2019/20, based on cost-
of-basic need, and a common basket approach.213 Under the new poverty line, approximately 18 percent of the population is
identified as poor with poverty concentrated in rural areas (22.8 percent).214 Multidimensional poverty has also declined, though
less rapidly, driven largely by poor quality public service provision.215 Poverty rates have a marked gender inequality and tend to
be higher in rural areas as well as for those with other intersecting vulnerabilities such as indigenous and ethnic minority
women.216 There are also important geographical variations in poverty prevalence, with more people living in poverty and
multidimensional poverty in rural areas in north-eastern provinces.217
1.1.1.1.3 Disaster Risk
Cambodia is one of the more disaster‐prone countries in Southeast Asia, affected by floods and droughts on a seasonal basis. A
succession of droughts and floods resulted in significant loss of life and considerable economic loss (only in 2020, “more than 2
million people were exposed to flooding and some 800,000 people had been directly affected. Of these, an estimated 388,000
people with pre-existing vulnerabilities (households classified as Poor) prior to the disaster needed humanitarian assistance”218.
Mean annual temperature has increased by 0.8ºC since 1960 with a rate of around 0.18ºC per decade. In almost every season,
the frequency of hot days and hot nights has also increased significantly over the same period. Cambodia experiences almost all
types of hydrometeorological hazards, including floods, drought, heavy storms / typhoons, and most geographical regions of the
country are exposed to one or more of these hazards. Increases in mean annual temperature in Cambodia are predicted to be
between 1.4 and 4.3ºC by 2100, with mean annual rainfall also predicted to increase, most significantly, during the wet season.
As with the other countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion, flooding and droughts are also expected to increase in terms of
frequency, severity, and duration.219
1.1.1.1.4 Gender and Disability
Cambodia is a party to all core international human rights treaties including the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and in 2019220 has committed to achieve the three transformative results: Zero unmet

need for family planning, Zero preventable maternal deaths, and Zero Gender-Based Violence (GBV).221 While there is substantial
gender equity legislation in place to protect against domestic violence and sexual harassment, implementation is hampered by
inconsistent enforcement and cultural norms that continue to deny women’s rights.222 Harmful gender norms, such as that men
are entitled to sex regardless of consent, directly contribute to GBV, a substantial problem in Cambodia where 20 percent of
women have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner.223 The true burden of GBV may be even higher
given limited reporting. A recent Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Gender Outlook report highlighted that only 43
percent of Cambodian victims of intimate partner violence sought help to stop the abuse.224
In the 2021 Gender Gap report, Cambodia ranked 103 out of 156 countries and 12th in the region out of 20 countries, dropping
14 places since its 2020 ranking.225 While the country ranks relatively well in terms of economic participation (48th) and health and
survival (45th), inequalities in secondary and tertiary education lower gender parity in educational attainment (128th) while a lack
of female political representation brings the country down in terms of political empowerment (126th) as only twenty percent of
seats in parliament are held by women.226 Gender inequalities tend to be higher in rural areas as well as for those with other
intersecting vulnerabilities such as indigenous and ethnic minority women.227
In 2012, Cambodia ratified the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), but the national
disability rights law is still in a draft version and, according to Human Rights Watch, it fails to adopt a human rights-based
approach. The CCA estimates people with disabilities numbering around 310,000. There is no quality data about children with
disabilities, what makes them ‘invisible’ in mainstream development programming.228
1.1.1.1.5 COVID-19
COVID-19 was first reported in Cambodia on January 27, 2020. Cambodia avoided the COVID-19 community spread throughout
most of 2020, which helped the country and UNICEF to prepare for the virus’ inevitable arrival. By August 4, 2020, the Ministry of
Health (MoH) had confirmed 241 cases, (the majority from foreign arrivals), and zero deaths. The first case of community
transmission was reported only in late November 2020, and it was very localized. A total of 135,085 confirmed cases of COVID-
19 and 3,052 deaths have been reported from Cambodia since 27 January 2020 till 20 March 2022, of which 131,038 have
recovered.229

FIGURE 9 EPIDEMIC CURVE OF CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASES BY DATE OF REPORT (JANUARY 2020 – MARCH 2022)230
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting measures to curb transmission including lockdowns and school and business closures
has had a devastating impact on Cambodia’s economic and social development. In 2020, economic growth contracted for the
first time in nearly a decade, with real gross domestic product (GDP) estimated to have contracted by 3.1 percent in 2020.231 The
country’s gain in poverty reduction was also reversed in 2020 due to COVID-19232. The pandemic also impacted the near-term
potential for new government investment as tax revenues fell.233 Public health expenditure dropped from 6.43 percent of the
total national budget in 2020 to an estimated 4.8 percent in 2021 (excluding COVID-19 extraordinary allocations), as the total
2021 national budget was scaled down due to concerns over the expanding fiscal deficit. The loss of income and livelihoods due
to COVID-19 has also amplified the risk and vulnerability of the current healthcare system.234
National Master Plan for COVID-19: In March 2020, the RCG launched their March 2020-February 2021 plan for responding to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Plan had four strategic objectives: to reduce and delay transmission, to minimize serious disease
and reduce associated deaths, to ensure ongoing essential health services particularly during epidemic peak periods; and to
minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. The plan included strengthening the health system,
providing support for workers and enterprises, and allocating cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households. Under that
framework, the government introduced several fiscal and social protection measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic
including cash transfers to 700,000 families registered in the national IDPoor database in 2020 with payments set to continue in
2022.235 Despite these measures, households were hit hard by the pandemic. A survey program carried out by UNICEF and the
World Food Programme (WFP)236 highlights the pandemic’s negative impact on income, food security, and multidimensional
impacts on children237
School closures in Cambodia were longer238 than most countries in Asia and the Pacific. Schools in Cambodia were closed for 250
days during 2020 and 2021, the equivalent of almost two-thirds of the two school years239, with expected lasting impacts on
human capital formation.240 The pandemic also exacerbated existing disparities in access to education, with students from poorer
households and households in rural areas facing much higher barriers to digital distance learning.241 A recent assessment done
by MoEYS on the impact of COVID-19242 confirms the growing body of global evidence that school closures put children at
increased risk of violence. The study also corroborates the strong body of evidence that children with disabilities are at higher

risk of experiencing violence and abuse compared to those without disabilities,243 with children self-identifying as having a
disability more likely to report being at increased risk of experiencing additional violence, abuse, or exploitation (23 percent) than
those who did not self-identify as having a disability (15 percent).244
In April 2022, the MoEYS revealed alarming new findings about learning loss experienced by Cambodian students during the
pandemic. Many children have fallen behind in their learning, in both mathematics and Khmer. While learning loss has occurred
across the board, children in rural areas, those in public schools and those from poorer households continue to show significantly
lower learning achievements compared to their urban, private, and wealthier counterparts. The combination of lost school days
with insufficient engagement in learning during an extended period of remote teaching and learning leaves little question that
the education system — and students — were subjected to a tremendous pandemic-related shock, with potentially far-reaching
implications for outcomes like student achievement that were already quite low at the onset of the pandemic period. 245
The successful rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign has led to a staggered reopening of the government in quarter four
of 2021 with projected real GDP growth of 1.9 percent.246 However, vaccine mandates raised rights concerns247 that added to the
March 2021 COVID-19 Law248, whose punishment provisions are described in the CCA as ‘excessive and disproportionate,
including imprisonment of between six months and 20 years, with fines of up to US$2,500’. The CCA also expresses concern that
individual freedoms will continue to be eroded, and that the recent years’ measures against those expressing dissenting views
will gain momentum as authorities seek to suppress the sharing of information on violations arising in the context of COVID-19.
While there are substantial opportunities for economic growth in Cambodia in the coming years, notably through new free trade
agreements with the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea, economic growth remains vulnerable to reductions
in access to the EU and US markets.249 Households currently supported under unconditional cash transfer programs will continue
needing support through longer-term programs as the emergency program ends.

Annex 3 Full Country Programme Overview
UNICEF’s cooperation with the government is articulated in the RGC–UNICEF Country Programme (CP) 2019–2023. The CP is
designed to align with the government’s Rectangular Strategy Phase IV (RS-IV), the National Strategic Development Plan 2019–
2023 the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2019-2023, other sector policies and the UNICEF Strategic
Plan 2018-2021. The overview of linkages between UNICEF CP and UNDAF are presented in Figure 6 below.
FIGURE 10. HOW UNICEF CP 2019-2023 SECTORAL OUTCOMES CONTRIBUTE WITH UNDAF PRIORITY AREAS
Source: Adaptation from UNICEF Cambodia CPD 2019-23 programme presentation
The UNICEF CP was designed to contribute to Cambodia’s national efforts to enable “all girls and boys, especially those most
vulnerable and marginalized, progressively enjoy their rights to survival, care, protection and participation, and develop to reach
their full potential”. The CP focuses on five key programmatic areas/pillars: 1) Health and Nutrition, 2) WASH, 3) Education, 4)
Child Protection, and 5) Policy and Public Financing for Children, with a sixth programme area focusing on programme
effectiveness.
Several cross-cutting issues are stated in the CP document, intended to help connect the programme components together:
early childhood development (ECD), adolescents, gender equality, humanitarian action, climate change, disability,
communication for development, urban poverty, and migration.
The CP is adopting a holistic approach that considers education, child protection, social protection, WASH health, hygiene and
nutrition and their interaction with ECD, and incorporates cross-sectoral support for communication for development (C4D),
Technology for Development (T4D), emergency preparedness and response, disaster risk reduction and climate change
adaptation, public advocacy, external communication, and partnerships, monitoring and evaluation, supply, and logistics.
UNICEF contributes to a number of SDGs as presented in Figure 7 below.

1.1.1.1.6 Programme outcomes and outputs
The CP document (CPD)250 does not present an overarching intervention logic for the Country Programme. Instead, the UNICEF
team developed intervention logics for individual programme areas (see Annex 2). The CPD presents the results and resources
framework which shows the structure for implementation of UNICEF’s mandate in Cambodia within the given period (See Annex
2).
UNICEF planning documents show an evolution of the CP outputs and Indicators over time.
● Some of the output statements were improved in 2021 (more detailed formulation).
● The Health and Nutrition component merged Output 3 with Outputs 1 and 2
● Five new outputs were created under Programme Effectiveness.
● Additionally, several COVID-19 related indicators were included alongside the following sectors: Health and Nutrition, WASH,
Education, Child Protection and Programme Effectiveness
1.1.1.1.7 Health and Nutrition component
Outcome: By 2023 pregnant women, mothers, new-borns, and children under the age of 5 years have increased equitable access
to and the use of quality health and nutrition services, especially in the north-eastern provinces and among marginalized groups,
including during emergencies.
Target groups: Pregnant women, mothers, new-borns, children under 5 years and adolescents, especially in the more
marginalized north-eastern provinces of Cambodia.
Budget: USD 16,001,000
Key donors: US Agency for International Development (USAID), EU, SDG Fund, Canadian, German, Australian, Danish and Hong
Kong National UNICEF Committees.
The health and nutrition component of the CP aims to increase equitable access to quality health and nutrition services in
particularly in North-eastern provinces among marginalized groups. The Health and Nutrition component focuses on equitable
access to sustainable, inclusive, adequate, and affordable health and nutrition services from birth to adolescence. The work
under this component includes three main outputs:
● Accountability systems and frameworks to support the implementation of high-impact maternal, new-born and child health
(MNCH) and nutrition interventions,
● Capacity to deliver equitable gender-responsive quality and accessible essential MNCH and nutrition services, and
● Capacity to promote safe health and nutrition behaviours and practices.

103
For high-impact interventions, UNICEF implements a comprehensive approach, combining health and nutrition interventions
with C4D and T4D activities including:
● For individual and community buy-in and demand for MNCH and nutrition services such as: immunization (campaigns and
routine); maternal and neonatal health services; treatment for pneumonia and diarrhoea; counselling on IYCF and care;
stimulation; timely and correct health care seeking behaviours; hygiene and sanitation; healthy maternal diets and to key
service delivery), with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programming in certain provinces/districts address the root
causes of malnutrition in Cambodia.
● Other UNICEF nutrition related activities include promoting locally sourced nutrition products, setting up systems to track
consumption of iodized salt, collecting age and sex-disaggregated data on acute malnutrition, developing e-mapping tools to
monitor and improve performance in health centres, and training health staff to offer nutrition counselling and
complementary feeding.
The Nutrition component supports nutrition interventions prioritized in the MoH-UNICEF rolling work plans, aligning, after the
2021 review its activities with the new global UNICEF Nutrition Strategy 2020-2030 as well as the National Strategy for Food
Security and Nutrition (NSFSN 2019-2023). Both strategies make explicit focus on addressing the triple burden of child
malnutrition in all its forms from multisectoral dimensions and through comprehensive nutrition program implementation at
scale: undernutrition (both stunting and wasting); deficiencies in vitamins and other micronutrients; and overweight, obesity and
diet-related noncommunicable diseases. The strategies use a comprehensive life cycle approach to nutrition programming to
protect and promote diets, services and practices that support optimal nutrition for all children, adolescents, and women.

The CP WASH component focuses on improving WASH financing and coordination to achieve compelling results in children’s
survival, health, and education. Due to increasing climate change pressures, Cambodia faces the prospects of deteriorating
agriculture, food security, ecosystems, water resources and water quality, with Cambodian children highly exposed to water
scarcity, riverine flooding, and vector-borne disease to ensure that WASH systems are adapted to support increased climate
resilience becomes a priority for the country.
The WASH component vision of universal access by 2025 and the barriers to WASH progress will be addressed by strengthening
national budgeting, regulatory, data and coordination systems; providing catalytic support for continued efforts to reach an
open-defecation free Cambodia by 2025; and modelling data-led, context-based, climate-resilient, pro-poor, accessible, child-
sensitive and gender inclusive WASH.
WASH includes three outputs related to strengthening capacity to:
● Plan, coordinate and monitor inclusive, quality, child-focused water, sanitation, and hygiene services,
● Implement programmes to increase equitable access to basic sanitation and hygiene and
● implement programmes to increase equitable access to safe and climate-resilient water supply. 251

and quality early childhood and basic education that promotes lifelong learning, including in emergencies.
Target groups: Children and adolescents.
Budget: USD 22,800,000.
Key donors: USAID, Japan, and Child Protection thematic
The Child Protection component focuses on building a child friendly institutional and legal framework to protect children in
Cambodia, strengthening child protection services in the health, education, justice, and early childhood sectors, and fostering a
culture of non-violence by transforming the social attitudes and beliefs that perpetuate violence itself.
Efforts in this regard are focused on the establishment of the child protection system as such by working with governments and
other partners to strengthen child protection systems to respond to child protection violations with quality and to scale up
evidence-based prevention interventions. Within these efforts, UNICEF works to establish intersectoral collaboration and child
protection as a basic service on a par with other basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation, and with
corresponding laws, policies, budgets, institutions, workforce capability and accountability for outcomes for children.
CP includes three outputs related to enhance/increase capacity to: strengthen capacity to:
● Formulate and implement child protection institutional and legal frameworks,
● Provide prevention and response child protection services,
● Implement at scale Positive Discipline, Positive Parenting and Protect child protection programmes.

Outcome: By 2023, children and adolescents, including the most disadvantaged, benefit from effective social services and a
child-sensitive social protection system.
Focus: reducing multi-dimensional child poverty in Cambodia.
Target groups: Particularly children living in urban and rural poor areas, children from ethnic minorities, and children with
disabilities.
Budget: USD 7,418,000.
Key donors: Social Policy Thematic
The Policy and Public Financing for Children component uses a multi-sectoral approach, where social protection activities focus
on building the delivery systems and programme design to reduce child poverty and vulnerability while establishing strong
linkages with other programmes, such as health and nutrition, WASH, education, and child protection. UNICEF continues to
support the government with the implementation of the National Social Protection Policy Framework 2016–2025 to ensure that
children and women in Cambodia receive the social protection they need.
The Policy and public financing for children component of the CP includes three outputs related to strengthen capacity to:
● Design gender-sensitive and equity-focused social protection programmes,
● Programme-based budget formulation, execution, monitoring, and reporting and
● Formulate policies and plans to address multidimensional child poverty, with sound monitoring and evaluation systems.

In 2020, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF refocused the CP towards pandemic response and recovery,
aligning with the UN Cambodia Framework for Socio-Economic Response to COVID-19 (SERF). The UN framework for recovery
has five pillars, starting with health as a foremost top priority (Protecting Health Services and Systems During the Crisis), and
complementing the National COVID-19 Health Master Plan252. The other four pillars reflect essential social and economic
dimensions, and the priorities of Cambodia’s Economic Recovery Strategy (Figure 9).

The UNICEF CO contributed to the UN Country Team (UNCT) response and continued leading the Education, Protection, and
WASH sectors of the Humanitarian Response Forum (HRF) on emergencies, regularly monitoring the emergency situation’s
effects on children through the Humanitarian Performance Monitoring, and quarterly sitreps.
UNICEF did not develop a specific UNICEF CO COVID-19 plan, instead reporting activities through each of the existing
programmatic areas. UNICEF data show that a total of approximately. US$3.8 million (54 percent of the total COVID-19 appeal)
was received and roughly US$3.7 million was re-programmed from existing resources.254 In light of restrictions, UNICEF shifted
the way they supported national partners and changed how national partners delivered services – from in-person support to
distance and remote delivery. This made digital development integral to how UNICEF works in the field, accelerating its
transformation into a digital organization. The following is an overview of programmatic measures undertaken by the office.
When it comes to social protection, UNICEF provided technical support to the government in system building for COVID-19 cash
transfer programme – a national programme that has supported 2.8 million poor and vulnerable Cambodians and additional
108,000 households during lockdown in urban areas. This measure was an investment in system building for the delivery of
routine social assistance programme, including through policy design, digital system tools building, capacity development and
communication.
UNICEF continued and expanded partnership with RGC (and with WHO) to help strengthen the Government’s health system and
cold chain capacities, including supporting preparedness, training, and the procurement of equipment for the adequate handling
of COVID-19 vaccination (inc. the mRNA vaccines) through the COVAX Facility.255 UNICEF immunization efforts (COVID-19 and EPI)
notably expanded during 2021. Given global supply constraints, the RGC pursued diverse procurement channels (not only relying
on COVAX), but also securing bilateral donations and procurement of vaccines. The CO supported the entire country’s vaccine
management and cold chain systems.
UNICEF Cambodia also Communication for Development (C4D) worked on a nation-wide COVID-19 Risk Communication and
Community Engagement (RCCE) response and the co-creation of the evidence-based Advocacy Communication and Social
Mobilization (ACSM)/C4D planning to support seamless coordination of COVID-19 prevention and vaccination roll out into the
country, whilst Technology for Development (T4D) has had, as first priority, to support digital approaches to strengthen
Government health systems and capacities for the roll-out and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination, including related to
monitoring and data analysis of community feedback, social listening, also providing technical support to digital health
interventions that will also strengthen routine immunization, reaching the most disadvantage groups (including the first disability
breakdown data collection that will be key for equity targeting and coverage).

255 The COVAX Facility is a partnership, co-led by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi-The Vaccine
Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). As the largest single vaccine
buyer in the world, UNICEF is the leading procurement and supply agency for COVAX.

UNICEF also responded to arising socioeconomic and child malnutrition challenges in Northeastern provinces by prioritizing
implementation of a comprehensive Nutrition program256, support capacity building and use of Health Management Information
Systems (HMIS) data tools for the new nutrition indicators related to severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and the implementation
and use of Interpersonal Communication (IPC) and counselling tools.
The UNICEF Cambodia WASH programme focused its COVID-19 response on reducing the transmission of the virus, providing
critical hygiene and prevention supplies alongside risk communications, infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts, guidance,
advocacy, and remote technical support.
UNICEF, as co-chair of the Education Working Group, facilitated development partner support for COVID-19 response, including
creating safe and protective learning environments, “Back-to-school” campaigns, distance education, and technical support for
safe school re-opening.
1.1.1.1.13 Programme effectiveness
Outcome: The country programme is efficiently designed, coordinated, managed, and supported to meet quality results-based
management standards and achieve results for children.
Target groups: This component facilitates the UNICEF country presence, enhancing the effectiveness of programmes at the
subnational and national levels and promoting engagement with local government and non-State actors.
Budget: 6,887,000 USD
The Programme Effectiveness component of the CP focuses on whether the CP is efficiently designed, coordinated, managed,
and supported. Originally, this component included three inter-related outputs to provide UNICEF staff and partners the
guidance, tools, and resources to:
● Effectively plan, monitor, and evaluate programmes.
● Effectively communicate, advocate, and develop partnerships regarding child rights issues with stakeholders.
● Apply strategies to address cross- cutting issues related to child rights.
In 2021, five more outputs were added to this component, giving special relevance to Emergency Preparedness and Response.
UNICEF co-led the national WASH, Education and Child Protection working groups. The CO developed in 2021 an emergency
preparedness plan to respond to floods, drought, storms, and COVID-19. The newly added outputs are:
● Emergency Preparedness and Response,
● Effective Results based Reporting,
● Quality evaluations are conducted and utilized to inform programmes
● Evidence generation and knowledge management is strengthened
● Cross-sectoral inter-linkage in programmes is strengthened
1.1.1.1.14 Programme delivery
The CP works on three levels: (a) upstream: national; (b) midstream: subnational (provincial and district); and (c) downstream:
community (parents, caregivers, service providers, children, and adolescents). The UNICEF Cambodia’s main office is based in
the city of Phnom Penh. This is backed by two zone offices in Kratie and Siem Reap provinces, with the main office covering
South-Eastern & Western provinces (see Figure 4 below).

In December 2019, the Cambodian decentralization and deconcentration (D&D) reform process that started in 2001 was
accelerated by the launch of Sub-decree 193 on “Decentralization of Health Management Functions and Service Delivery to the
Capital and Province Administration”. This had a profound impact on the way in which health and other public services are
financed, managed, and delivered, involving a shift in responsibility for implementation and management of service delivery to
25 provincial and district-level authorities and municipal administration.257
While many structures and systems for implementation have been established, many have yet to be fully or successfully
implemented.258 For governmental partnerships, a Rolling Work Plan (RWP) is usually signed between UNICEF and the respective
Ministry, with a Results and Resources Framework rolling work plan (RWP). For service delivery with NGO partners, UNICEF
usually entered into Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCAs), which fully scope the work, and are usually developed in
consultation with the different Ministries leading to the RGC sectoral responses. Small-Scale Funding Agreements (SSFA) are also
used to provide cash transfers to a Civil Society Organization (CSO) for activities within the CP (regular and humanitarian
response). In the COVID-19 response, other complementary and (in some cases) less-formal partnerships were developed with
different networks-local solution providers, innovators, cultural and religious organizations, the private sector, local media, and
academia to provide a space to nurture and test new and innovative technologies and build local capacities.
1.1.1.1.15 Budget and overview of expenditure
A total of 121 million USD has been planned for implementation of the CP within the reference period.259 Most funding (55 million
USD) was planned to be allocated to education (45.6 percent) followed by child protection (18.7 percent), health and nutrition
(13.2 percent) and WASH (10.7 percent). Significantly less funding was planned to be available for policy and public finance for
children (6 percent) and programme effectiveness (5.7 percent) (Table 1).

258 Cambodia’s public health system consists of a network of national and provincial-municipal level hospitals, Operational
District (OD) referral hospitals, health centers, and health posts. Hospitals are sub-categorized into four levels: national
hospitals and complimentary package of activities (CPA) hospitals levels 1–3. Health centers provide a minimum package of
activities (MPA) and operate health posts which extend services to hard-to-reach areas. The MPA focuses on preventative and
basic curative services; each health center serves approximately 10,000–20,000 people. Health Operational Districts (ODs),
responsible for health center oversight, are typically comprised of 10–15 health centers covering about 100,000–200,000
people and a district referral hospital. Advancing universal health coverage in the COVID-19 era: an assessment of public health

TABLE 15 SUMMARY BUDGET OF THE COUNTRY PROGRAMME PLANNED ALLOCATION
Annual financial figures from January 2019 to December 2021 show the differences between Planned and Allocated Budgets (See
Table 2 below). Comparison across the internal CP 2021 budget closure information shows that (as per the updated cumulative
figure of funds received vs requirements) five programmatic areas were underfunded: Education, Health and Nutrition, WASH,
Policy and Public Finance for Children. The ORR ceiling was lifted, and total increased to 120 million USD, so that the total CPD
Budget increased by USD 23.7 million. The most updated figures (July 2022) on Percentage and Amount of UNICEF Section
Funding show that in 2019 and 2020, half of the funds supported the Education component, while in 2021 and 2022 budgets
show a different trend in allocations, which is very much related to COVID-19 related funds. The distribution and prioritization
across the different programmatic areas are reflected in Figure 5:

1.1.1.1.16 CP review 2021
Halfway through the CP, from June to September 2021, UNICEF Cambodia undertook a programme review. The review aimed to:
a) better align the CP with the new UNICEF Strategic Plan (2022-2025), the Gender Action Plan (2022-2025) and other new global
strategies, providing a clear vision and strategic framework for the decade to 2030 to meet a different set of global priorities (like
the UNICEF: Education Strategy 2019-2030; the Nutrition Strategy 2020-2030 and the Child Protection Strategy 2021-2030), b)
help to rethink about the integration on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and the way of work at UNICEF to better
adapt to deliver more effectively and efficiently to populations in need in the RGC for the remaining period (2022-2023), c) assess
strategies, implementation modalities, risks and assumptions, d) carry out a reflection on UNICEF’s adolescent programming and
a zonal office review. Emerging sectoral priorities-recommendations260 as reflected in the “Report of the Programme Review
of the Royal Government of Cambodia – UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation” (2019-2023), September 2021) are included
in Annex 3. The ET will use these recommendations to help evaluate whether the CP is aligned with national priorities (coherence).
1.1.1.1.17 Emerging Sectoral Priorities
Emerging sectoral priorities-recommendations261 (as reflected in the “Report of the Programme Review of the Royal
Government of Cambodia – UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation” (2019-2023), September 2021) were:

Annex 7 Interview Guides
UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme Evaluation (2019-2023)
SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE
The purpose of this questionnaire produced by the Evaluation team is to:
● Obtain evidence from the self-assessment of the Country Office (CO) team as input for analysis of evidence collected during
the desk and the field phase;
● help identify areas where additional evidence is needed, or validation/triangulation is necessary, thereby contributing to a
better planned/structured mission planning; and
● help identify key issues and factors affecting performance, thereby contributing to better defined and targeted questions for
interviews in the country.
It is important that you provide in your response as much depth and information (including quantitative data) as you can,
including practical examples and best practices. Upon reviewing your response, the Evaluation team will get back to you with
clarificatory questions or requests any further information, as needed.

the summative perspective of CP Evaluation implementation in the period between 2019-2021, and formative perspective for
the period of 2022-onward. The evaluation offers the opportunity to critically assess UNICEF contribution to Cambodia’s national
efforts to enable all girls and boys, especially those most vulnerable and marginalized, progressively enjoy their rights to survival,
care, protection, and participation, and develop to reach their full potential. The evaluation will look at the whole Country
Programme and will focus on assessing UNICEF specific contributions, with deeper focus on three key programmatic
areas/pillars: 1) Health and Nutrition, 2) Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), excluding Climate Resilient WASH, and 3)
Education. The findings of the evaluation will inform the next Country Programme, by assessing past and ongoing programme
implementation, with a formative focus to inform programming of a remainder of CP implementation and the design of the next
Country Programme.
We are asking you to participate in the evaluation because you can contribute a relevant and valuable perspective on the
functioning of this programme. If you decide to participate, you will be interviewed by members of the evaluation team for a
duration of approximately 1 hour.
Participation is voluntary: Your participation in the interview is voluntary. You can withdraw from the interview after it has
begun, for any reason, with no penalty. Participating or not in the interview will not affect the benefits to the organizations or
communities from the UNICEF CP Evaluation.
Risks and benefits: This review is designed to help improve the programme by learning from the perspectives of everyone
involved. You may not benefit personally from being in this research review. There may be uncommon or previously unknown
risks. You should report any problems to [_________________________].
Confidentiality: The reports from this and the other meetings will collect and summarize the views and opinions of participants
without connecting them to specific individuals and without using names at any time. The ET will retain the names of the
interviewees in the event we will need to reach out to you for further questions. However, any report of this research will be
presented in a way that makes it as difficult as possible for anyone to determine the identity of individuals participating in the
evaluation. Your responses will be kept anonymous in the final results.
If you have any questions, now or at any time in the future, you may call _________________

6 Focus Group Guides - CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS (CSOs), PARENTS (Schools) and SERVICE PROVIDERS
7 (This guide shall serve as basis for all FGDs)
The FGD guide is designed with intention to provide a general framework for discussion and certain level of guidance, but
allowing for more open discussion on main issues pertaining specific UNICEF activity the group members are acquainted with.
The FGD will have a focus on achievements, challenges, and aspirations, so most discussion will focus around those elements. A
single discussion guide has been developed which is to be tailored to each stakeholder group. All notes will be recorded by a
note taker and will be analysed in combination at the end of the field phase to determine emergent themes and patterns across
the responses.
The facilitator is instructed to phrase/re-phrase the questions as they see fit to make them appropriate for their audiences.
Questions can also be omitted if they are not relevant to the group or if they do not seem to be generating good data and
insights. The facilitator should only cover a segment if the respondent has sufficient experience or insights to address the
segment. Depending on the stakeholder and its knowledge/degree of engagement with the UNICEF interventions, the facilitator
should foresee about 1.5 hours on average for each FGD. In light of the need to ensure adequate protection from COVID-19,
FGDs should have between 5-7 persons maximum in the group.
At the onset of each FGD, the facilitator will introduce themselves and clarify the purpose of the evaluation, as well as the
confidentiality of the group discussion (i.e. when quoting statements, attribution will be made to categories of stakeholders, not
individuals or organizations, etc.)
A private place should be provided for the discussion and no officials (UNICEF/partner staff and participants acting in capacity of
local leaders) should be in attendance or proximity during the discussions.
Introduction to the FGD
We are an evaluation team commissioned to carry out an evaluation of the UNICEF Cambodia Country Programme 2019-2023,
assessing UNICEF’s performance in Cambodia across the period between 2019-mid 2022 (CP Evaluation implementation), with

Annex 8. UNICEF’s Convergence
UNICEF’s Cambodia country assistance components outlined in the CP were designed to have stand-
alone results, though the review of some interventions shows cross-sector contribution in the
achievement of certain key child indicators. The lack of a common theory of change presents an
obstacle to integration or system thinking and convergent approaches. UNICEF’s sectoral interventions
are very wide and include a range of activities and interactions at central level and in certain targeted
regions (provinces, districts and communities). Even in cases where different UNICEF’s sector
interventions are implemented in the same district or area, they do not necessarily converge and as
per evaluation findings the happen in silos. Analysis of available data also shows that the majority of
sector interventions are only implemented in a reduced number of provinces and districts. Analysis
shows that, in localities where more than one sectoral activity does happen, this is more due to
geographical “coincidence”, and not a result of efforts to converge. However, there are also purposeful
convergence designs, like expanded multi-sectoral collaboration for nutrition, routine programming
for IECD, school nutrition, adolescents, and nutrition-sensitive social protection.
In 2021, Integrated Early Childhood Development (IECD) was a key area for programme convergence.
The IECD task force made progress in promoting a nurturing, caring andefficient delivery of IECD servi
ces to the most vulnerable children, with a special focus on the Northeast Provinces.
The evaluation has evidenced cross-sector synergies or interactions, as exemplified in paragraphs
below. One of the successes has been UNICEF’s ability to leverage COVID-19 strategic partnerships and
resources (such as from DFAT), to strengthen the organisation’s cross-sectoral capacities and role in
the areas of T4D and C4D, which go beyond benefiting only the COVID-19 health response, but are
used to strengthen UNICEF’s broader, routine programming for children across multiple sectors.
However, and with the exception of C4D-SBCC and the new emerging Climate Programming (under the
WASH lead), cross-component interactions happened rather as bilateral (section to section) activity or
as interventions to seize openings in terms of government priorities, needs or interests rather than as
a result of systematic higher level planning.
Document review and stakeholder interviews showed that COVID-19 provided an opportunity for
increased convergence, through strong UNICEF-led COVID-19 risk communication and community
engagement efforts. The social listening and monitoring platforms that were developed within these
efforts presented an opportunity to promote wider issues affecting children, as strongly corroborated
by external stakeholders (government at national and subnational level, development partners, CSOs
and communities). Besides, T4D-Health interaction relating to digital health/immunisation, training of
health workers and SBCC, as well as SBCC-Health and Nutrition (in support to demand generation for
health services as well as nurturing care, including key MIYCN practices) were found to be promising
convergence points. T4D and C4D-SBCC (both very much funded with Health COVID-19 related
additional funds) are considered by UNICEF stakeholders as innovative multi-sectoral approaches,
which have the potential to boost convergences further in the upcoming period.
There is evidence of UNICEF’s efforts to establish a convergence framework through integrating policy
and financing for children programme components, which aimed at contributing to the reduction in
multidimensional poverty through advocacy for results-based financing for children across sectors.
Document review and stakeholder feedback confirmed that UNICEF’s engagement on issues of
financing for children has promoted convergence and presented an integrated theme spanning social,
child protection, and education. Evaluation also found examples of synergies between Education and
Child protection; and Education and WASH. For instance, promotion of safe and protective learning
environments from pre-schools to junior secondary schools as well as teacher training in CP and
positive discipline (including adopting classroom and school management practices tied to positive
forms of discipline to help protect children and help them to learn), as well as working at school level
and with the life skills curriculum targeting younger adolescents (10-14 years of age). Interaction
173
between education and WASH helped upgrade physical school environments through the provision of

Synergies between Child Protection, Social Inclusion and Governance interventions were evidenced at
national and provincial level. The focus of such efforts was on advocating for adequate budgetary
allocations to the Child Protection sector and advocacy to bring violence against children and
unnecessary family separation on the public agenda. Such efforts helped generate dialogue and
making the issue increasingly visible and politically important, as also confirmed by interviewed
stakeholders.
Intersections between the Child protection and Health were noted when it comes to rollout the Clinical
Handbook for Health Practitioners on the Identification and Treatment of Children Subjected to
Violence. Besides, efforts were invested to collect routine data on the health system response to
violence against children; and Education programme to scale-up the Positive Discipline programme
and to rollout the Child Protection policy in schools.
In the area of Social Policy, the joint efforts were invested in support to the development of the national
conditional cash transfer (CCT) programme for low-income families (pregnant women and young
children 0-2,263 known as “first 1,000 days”). It consists of three stages, entailing the possibility that
eligible women can receive payments over the first 1,000 days after certain conditions are met (upon
completion of each of the 15 maternal and child health (MCH) and wellness visits (at least four prenatal
check-ups; childbirth at a health care facility, two post-natal care visits, monthly growth monitoring and
promotion for children under two years, etc.). This CCT has contributed to a striking increased visits to
health facilities for these key MCH programmes (more detailed under section 5.4 of this report),
opening up the potential for further expansion to other interventions that need a more integrated and
comprehensive approach to programming.
Some stakeholders noted that more investment in cash transfer modalities and social protection
schemes could have also complemented SBCC and WASH and Nutrition sensitive joint programming
to better address the immediate underlying causes of under nutrition and the extremely weak SAM
indicators (also very much linked to barriers for health seeking care and access to services). Such efforts
rolled out in 2022 under the Framework for Action for the UN Global Action Plan on Child Wasting
(GAP), more developed under External Convergence). Cash transfers also increased access to child
protection and other social services.
Furthermore, technical partnerships were deepened on WASH, health and nutrition in the framework
of the joint actions in Health and WASH in health facilities, and Nutrition and WASH-sensitive activities,
as schools were increasingly mapping and improving their WASH facilities. As mentioned by UNICEF
team, the existence of a national led coordination sub-working group on WASH and Nutrition facilitates
the convergence and integration of activities as part of the country nutrition-sensitive WASH services
planning. WASH contributed to the joint IECD workplan with focus on supporting modelling and scaling
up of WASH improvements package in preschools and supporting modelling and scaling up of WASH
improvements in health centres. In IECD, good progress was made in the nurturing care parenting,
provincial ECCD plan.
262 Note: children are usually requested to bring their own 0,5 l. of safe water per day (provided at home). At schools, the
current approach is the provision of clean water, not of safe drinking water.

The CP review conducted in 2021 was used as an opportunity to reemphasise UNICEF’s convergence
ambition. In particular, the need for convergence of efforts through a life cycle approach was
emphasised in UNICEF’s realigned approaches as an avenue to maximize impact, i.e., through focus on
Integrated Early Childhood Development for the first decade of life and ADAP for the second decade.
To operationalise this strategic direction, UNICEF empowered the Kratie zonal office to drive and
coordinate IECD programs in the North East, in close liaison with all sections. Within this framework, a
Joint workplan/framework for IECD was designed to steer joint planning, implementation, monitoring,
and resource mobilization for IECD. At the same time, the leadership over the ADAP programme
implementation was committed to the Siem Reap Zonal office, with similar operational linkages with
the CO in Phnom Phen. IECD and ADAP interventions were also discussed and steered through IECD
and ADAP Task Forces (with TORs and M&E frameworks). UNICEF interlocutors noted that these efforts
have helped to coordinate joint efforts, though they are not sufficient to substantially boost
convergence, at least in short to medium term. The most recent Generation Future pilot implemented
by the Communications department was considered by some UNICEF stakeholders as a new opening
for cross-cutting collaboration. However, this is just one of UNICEF’s multiple youth related initiatives,
including the Generation Future, ADAP, life skills programme, youth engagement on climate, child
protection and environment issues, youth employability, etc. Document review findings, corroborated
by stakeholder interviews, show that each of these gather and support diverse youth groups, but
without genuine interaction between them. This leads to multiplication of efforts and resources, and
general fragmentation of offers, diminishing transformational potential.
Evaluation mapped a number of challenges hinder convergence, notably:
● Lack of UNICEF’s definition or joint CO understanding and agreement of what convergence
means in UNICEF. Stakeholder interviews with UNICEF teams reveal that unclear
understanding or definition of what convergence means in terms of UNICEF’s work, which
leaves it open to interpretation. Some UNICEF stakeholders considered it as an artificial
construction and not sufficiently thought through in terms of specific common goals
towards a given population.
● Convergence is considered not to be a response for everything by UNICEF interlocutors.
Interviewed UNICEF CO and RO stakeholders noted that some areas (from a technical
perspective) do not necessarily need to converge, which presents an important entry for a
debate on what areas present convergence potential to help prioritise which ones should
be/not be invested in. Such debate still has not been initiated.
● Both IECD or ADAP are vertically set. Document review and as corroborated by stakeholder
interviews reveals that Zonal offices implement their respective programmes in isolation
from each other and with limited human resources, with interventions focused almost
entirely on their respective region. This hinders the outreach, efficiency and potential for
substantial convergence. Besides, evaluation found that Zonal Offices are still not fully
empowered and capacitated to lead and implement ADAP and IECD respectively, as tasks
added to already huge portfolios of persons who are assigned to follow these portfolios
(since before 2021 review). The lack of exclusively dedicated staff at CO and suboptimal
level of empowerment of Zonal office leads present a challenge going ahead.

274. Wasting in children is the life-threatening result of poor nutrient intake and/or disease. As per
global evidence,264 children suffering from wasting have weakened immunity, are susceptible to long-
term developmental delays and face an increased risk of death, particularly when wasting is severe.
These children require urgent treatment and care to survive. The prevalence of wasting nationally
