Executive Summary
Project description
The MTV Shuga programme is an award-winning TV programme in Africa and Asia, that uses
edutainment as a model to showcase challenges of young people in different contexts with the aim to
provide behaviour change content to adolescents and young people. Aligned with the Third National
Strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS in Botswana, the programme was initially introduced by National
AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA) through the national Botswana television in 2011 and
later reintroduced on radio with the support of UNICEF in 2018 with the goal of reaching adolescents
and young people with behaviour change content focusing on safe sexual behaviour (delayed sex
debut, prevention of transactional and intergenerational sexual relationships) and uptake of HIV
services. As such, it was implemented through a collaboration mainly between UNICEF and the
National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA), in partnership with MTV Staying Alive
Foundation (MTV SAF), with a budget of budget was US$1,724,696.00. The programme under
evaluation was a catalytic initiative linked to the UNICEF’s Country Programme Outcome 2 which seeks
to ensure that by 2026, adolescents and young people (10–24 years), particularly the most vulnerable,
will be more empowered and engaged to access quality and gender-responsive HIV, health, nutrition,
education, and child protection services. The programme also addressed sustainable development
goal 3 (SDG 3), on ending HIV and AIDS epidemic by 2030. The programme was therefore adapted and
implemented as a behaviour change communication strategy to help adolescents and young people
adopt safe sexual behaviour by targeting key drivers of new infections and non-adherence to ARV
treatment. The following were the key programme objectives:
i. To improve self-efficacy to know HIV status and access sexual and reproductive health services.
ii. To improve attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex.
iii. To improve attitude and self-efficacy to demand or practice safe sex.
iv. To improve knowledge and attitude towards sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and gender-
based violence (GBV).
The MTV-Shuga peer education programme, was piloted in two districts in 2019 and scaled up to four
districts in 2020 (Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe and Gumare) districts). With
the advent of COVID-19, virtual peer education (through social media platforms) programme was
introduced in Botswana in 2020 to ensure continuous access to information and services among AYP
during this period. Various adaptations to the MTV programme, to secure a comprehensive reach –
especially to deepen impact of the radio programme and improve access in remote rural and peri-
urban areas were therefore made. The programme
included: Radio: The Drama series were an adaptation
of MTV Shuga Down South with episodes of about 7-
10 minutes, followed by in studio discussions by young
people for some of the episodes. Interpersonal
communication: Peer education component (led by
trained Peer Educators (PEs)) targeted in school and
out of school adolescents and young people (AYP) in
Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe
and Gumare) districts. The model used the MTV Shuga
Peer Facilitation Guide which contained 7 sessions
which were increased to 9 sessions (to incorporate parent to child engagement) that each group of
participants have to complete to be classified as being fully exposed to the MTV Shuga Peer education
Programme. Interactive voice response (IVR): Episodes of the MTV Shuga drama series were uploaded
to the interactive voice response (IVR) platform known as 124, for audience to listen to at their own
v
time in case they missed the radio show. Also, a ‘choose-your-adventure’ game was introduced to the
platform for improved interaction with audience. The game allowed young people to choose
characters they like and personify the character`s decision making process and listen to how their story
ends. Social Media: With the advent of COVID-19, the programme adopted virtual peer education
approaches to ensure and sustain service demand generation and uptake by adolescents and young
people.
Evaluation purpose, scope, objectives and intended audience
The evaluation purpose was “to evaluate how well the MTV Shuga programme achieved its outcomes”.
The evaluation intended to measure the outcomes of the MTV Shuga programme in all the four
targeted districts. It also determined how effective the programme was in achieving its set targets. The
evaluation results are intended to inform replication of the programme by the Government of
Botswana in several districts of the country. The primary user of the evidence generated from the
evaluation will be the Government of Botswana through NAHPA as the evaluation will inform the
current scale up of the programme to other districts. UNICEF will use the evidence to continue
advocacy efforts towards ensuring adolescent and young people programmes for safe sexual
behaviours are developed and implemented. Development partners and other non-governmental
organisations stand to benefit from the results of the evaluation as well on the use of peer approaches
to behaviour change and in alignment with other programmes targeting Adolescents and Young People
(AYP).
Methodology
Evaluation approach: The evaluation used mixed methods approaches premised on qualitative and
quantitative data. Quantitative data was used to determine MTV Shuga’s performance on envisaged
outcomes while qualitative data was used to answer questions on relevance, efficiency, sustainability
as well to validate and explore further outcomes of the programme. The evaluation was designed on
the premise of a contribution analysis approach where the evaluation did not seek attribution but
rather how the MTV Shuga sessions and other support are contributing to observed outcomes. The
evaluation utilised the contribution analysis methodology to help track emerging programme
impacts/outcomes and determine the programme’s contribution. Across all evaluation criteria the
evaluation explored the extent to which the project design mainstreamed human rights, gender
equality, disability, and equity. The United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) guidance on evaluation,
human rights centred, and gender responsive evaluation were adopted in the tools and data collection
approaches. The UNICEF Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS) was the main guidance
on evaluation quality standards. Evaluation principles of independence, credibility, integrity, and
inclusiveness were integral to the evaluation approach.
Data sources, collection, and analysis: The evaluation team conducted an extensive literature review
to inform the design of the evaluation, methods, and data collection tools as well as the findings. The
quantitative evaluation component relied on secondary data from the programme’s monitoring system
(baseline survey, pre- and post-exposure surveys, and monitoring reports). The qualitative evaluation
component comprised Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), Case Studies
(using the Most Significant Change (MSC) approach). Key informants were drawn from programme
stakeholders such UNICEF, Makgabaneng, NAHPA, BIHL, MTV-SAF, Peer Coordinators, DAC, Chief
Education Officer, DHMTs, and teachers for Guidance and Counselling (G&C). FGD discussants were
primarily adolescents and young people (AYP) that went through the MTV Shuga sessions in- and out
of school, in separate groups of males and females. Case studies were held with selected participants
of the MTV Shuga programme. Only two districts: Selibe Phikwe and Okavango were selected for the
qualitative data collection. Primary quantitative data from pre- and post-exposure surveys was
analysed in accordance with the indicator definitions provided by UNICEF. Differences between the
vi
baseline and post-exposure survey was compared to ascertain the differences. Qualitative data
collected was systematically analysed, triangulated, and synthesised by the evaluation team. The
collected qualitative data complemented and clarified the quantitative findings by helping to identify
common themes.
Validation and dissemination: The evaluation reference group reviewed the draft evaluation report to
correct any factual errors. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated to all stakeholders by
implementing partners.
Limitations of the evaluation: The following were the limitations of the evaluation exercise: 1) Only
the in-person peer educator programme and the IVR platform had pre- and post-exposure data. This
meant assessment of the performance of the programme was limited to these two channels. 2) Visit
to only two of four districts had the potential to skew the perceptions on programme performance.
The evaluation ensured the selection of four wards that represent fully the context of the programme
including selecting some successful localities, provided the evaluation with sufficient variation to fully
explore the programme’s performance. 3) The study relied on secondary data (pre- and post-exposure
survey data) due to unavailability of funding for primary quantitative data collection. Primary
qualitative data on programme was outcomes was collected instead. 4) There was potential to collect
and use clinical data (especially utilisation of HIV services). While this could have provided trends in
utilisation of services, the low performance of lower-level results meant such a contribution story
would be very weak. Resultantly this data was not used for the analysis of outcomes. The programme
had no focus on linkage to health services a requirement for enhancing utilisation of such services
further weakening the contribution story. Instead, the evaluation relied on qualitative obtained
through FGDs and case studies on the outcomes of MTV Shuga.
Findings
Relevance
1. The MTV Shuga programme was strongly aligned to the Government of Botswana’s HIV response
and prevention framework – the third Strategic Framework. Use of multiple channels of
communication (Interactive Voice Response platforms (IVR), radio, social media (Facebook and
WhatsApp) interpersonal communication (through peer educators) allowed for various categories
of AYP with differing resourcing to access behaviour change messages.
2. Content delivered through these platforms was relatable for AYP and applicable in varying context
although in some instances such as in Okavango some adaptations were necessary to address
specific cultural context. Content for IVR and interpersonal sessions were modelled from extensive
research on drivers of new HIV infection among AYP and understanding the motivations for risky
sexual behaviours among the group undertaken in the pilot first phase of the programme.
However, content for social media platforms was not standardised and driven by district level
online peer educators. While such an approach can affect the quality and depth of behaviour
change communication, the use of young people within districts to drive the online engagements
made the content relatable for AYP in those contexts.
3. Young people, through peer educators, led delivery of the programme in particular interpersonal
communication and social media platforms enhancing the effectiveness of communication.
4. While the programme targeted in school and out of school AYP, the design was more effective in
retaining in school than out of school AYP in the programme. For out of school AYP, the lack of
integration with livelihoods or economic empowerment initiatives removed motivation for their
continued participation in the context of other competing needs. Also, when refreshments were
provided for meetings, attendance by out of school AYP tended to increase. However, there was
no budget for this in the programme. In Selibe Phikwe and Okavango peer educators made
arrangements with local NGOs HPP and BOCHAIP respectively for venues for holding sessions with
vii
out of school AYP. while this was commendable it was only for one locality in each district with
space for holding sessions for out of school a challenge throughout the programme period across
all districts. On targeting again, the programme could have been effective by adopting
differentiated approaches, especially after delivery of the nine sessions, to support behaviour
change for those most at risk AYP. This could have been supported by more effective risk profiling
of participants.
5. IVR platform also struggled to keep listeners logged in for majority of sessions as the number of
listeners for the last session decreased by 90% from the first session (approximately 32,000 to
2,000). However, majority of participants had received two sessions on the platform.
6. Peer educators were well trained and perceived to be effective by Guidance and Counselling (G&C)
teachers and AYP (in-school and out of school) in delivering sessions. Because of their effectiveness
peer educators were being allocated more time for sessions in schools including requests for them
to address other issues not necessarily part of their focus e.g., bullying and drug abuse. However,
in Boteti and Okavango districts, Peer Educators had challenges in reaching out to some hard-to-
reach areas for the out of school AYP and their engagements with their caregivers/parents due to
transport constraints.
7. Programme learned and adapted during implementation. One adaptation was the integration of
parent to child communication to improve the enabling environment for AYP behaviour change
which led to expansion of the sessions from seven to nine. Attendance of parents to these sessions
was low due to a poor community mobilisation strategy that failed establish meaningful
relationships with community leaders.
Gender and equity
8. The programme design document recognised the importance of gender but fell short of providing
specific strategies to make the programme gender responsive beyond the session content. Despite
this, during implementation, several initiatives were put in place to enhance gender
responsiveness including recruitment of equal numbers of male and female peer educators, data
collection included sex disaggregated data, and implementation of gender specific interventions
such as targeting teen mothers or “boys’ and girls’ talks”. Majority of these initiatives were district
specific and adhoc. Gender responsiveness of the programme could have been improved by the
collection of session experiential data to address gender specific concerns in session delivery, and
collection of additional demographic data for session participants such marital status, childbearing
etc to support differentiated support.
9. Disability was not considered in the design and implementation of the programme. Peer educators
had no capacity handle children with disabilities and therefore generally avoided them. In schools
where there was some existing capacity or initiatives to support children with disabilities such as
at Lebogang Junior Secondary School (JSS) some support was provided to PEs to handle such
children.
10. Equity was considered in the selection of districts which ensured urban, rural and hard to reach
areas were selected for the programme. While this was commendable resource allocation did not
consider the additional costs incurred for reaching out to AYP in remote areas which compromised
quality of delivery of the programme in such areas e.g., Shakawe in Okavango.
Effectiveness
11. The MTV Shuga programme improved the capacity of AYP to delay sex and practice safe sex (4.9%,
p-value=0.000) as well as gender equitable attitudes in relationships (13.1%, p-value=0.000). It had
a negligible effect on improving AYP’s attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex
(0.6%, p-value=0.7975). The main challenge for this was males whose views of intergenerational
viii
and transactional sex did not change. For female AYP, an increase of 3.1% had improved attitudes
on intergenerational sex compared to 1.8% for males. However, AYP’s perceptions of transactional
sex did not improve with a high proportion of over 80% of MTV Shuga participants still maintaining
that it was reasonable for a partner to expect sex in exchange for money or gifts. Therefore, while
negative attitudes towards risky sexual behaviour changed slightly, the programme had a greater
effect in building capacities of AYP to practice safe sexual behaviours within those relationships
(ability to negotiate safe sex, that both males and females should carry condoms etc.).
12. MTV Shuga in Botswana had a greater effect on females than males. This is important in the
context of equity as new HIV infections were high among female AYP. Nonetheless the effect
changes were marginal primarily as a result of limited engagement of session participants post
completing the standard 9 sessions as discussed earlier. The initiative by PEs in Boteti to reinforce
behaviour change through creating platforms for engaging those AYPs that demonstrated
emerging behaviour change is an emerging practice that could be explored for other districts.
13. While there was a 4% change in the proportion of AYP “intending to go for an HIV test in the next
three months” after the post session survey, the overall proportion of 29% of participants was still
very low showing a lingering reluctance among AYPs.
14. The MTV Shuga programme failed to achieve the targets of any of the outcomes. However, output
indicators were achieved for some outputs e.g., Programme Output 2: Effective and efficient
project management. The best performing indicator was “Percentage of adolescent boys who hold
gender equitable attitudes” which was 0.8% short of the target. This was followed by the indicator,
“Percentage of AYPs who demonstrate intention to demand safe sex under pressure” which was
10% off the target. The programme was able to reach 8,250 AYP instead of the target of 10,000
primarily due to challenges with mobilising out of school AYP.
15. There were cases of young people that had changed their behaviour e.g., stopping transactional
sex, intergenerational sex, drug, substance, and alcohol abuse. Mary’s story (Case study 1)
demonstrates the effect the MTV Shuga sessions can have on behavioural outcomes of adolescents
and young people. The session delivery approach and its content can have a profound effect on
changing risky sexual behaviour as observed in Mary’s story. However, cases of such behaviour
change, as noted by PEs were still few. This could be a result of limited follow of the MTV Shuga
cohorts by PEs or the limited engagement of the same cohort post 9 sessions of MTV Shuga.
16. Several factors contributing to the programme’s effectiveness including:
a. PEs’ ability to deliver the programme sessions effectively.
b. Varying levels of support provided to PEs by District AIDS Coordinators (DACs) helped
improve PEs’ work through linkages to other important stakeholders and provision of
office space etc.
c. PEs’ relationships with schools ensured access to adolescents.
d. Availability of multiple virtual or online communication channels allowed the
programme to adapt quickly to COVID-19 restrictions. Virtual PEs were able to reach
21,297 AYP with behaviour change messages, 92,983 AYP were reached through
various IVR platforms, and 8,250 were reached through physical interaction with PEs.
17. Challenges undermining effectiveness included:
a. A PE to AYP ratio of 1:295 may have been too high for PE’s effective interaction with
AYP.
b. Nine (9) sessions were inadequate to facilitate behaviour change and needed to be
supported with additional risk-based support to AYP.
ix
c. Out of school AYP were difficult to motivate to stay on the programme and therefore
the MTV Shuga programme was not successful with this group.
d. Module content was adaptable across districts but could have addressed some
context specific issues and other areas to support behaviour change.
Efficiency
18. While the PEs created strong relationships with DACs linkages and coordination with other critical
stakeholders were weak. For education, PEs had close working relationships with schools but less
so with the district education office. this posed challenges when school access was denied as
occurred in Ghanzi and in Shakawe, Okavango. Limited linkages with the youth ministry were a
lost opportunity to create synergies with livelihoods or economic empowerment interventions of
the ministry. While Makgabaneng tried to foster these relationships through engagement of all
stakeholders at the onset of the programme in each district this was not followed through by PEs
as there was a lack of a standard stakeholder engagement strategy they could follow.
19. Makgabaneng was responsible for programme implementation in the districts for the peer
education programme and UNICEF for the IVR platforms through Viamo Inc and the radio
programme. Quarterly meetings between UNICEF and Makgabaneng were held to support review
and planning. These were informed by PE reports, quarterly monitoring and supportive visits
undertaken by Makgabaneng and joint monitoring visits conducted with UNICEF and NAHPA.
Refresher trainings were also used as points of reflection. However, coordination of the
programme could have more systematically involved NAHPA through the structured quarterly
meetings to ensure they kept abreast of the programme implementation. This would have added
to the involvement of NAHPA in training of PEs.
20. Peer educator training was conducted through a Training of Trainers approach, with quality
assurance being provided by MTV SAF. PEs generally appreciated the scope and content of the
training they received but viewed the duration as too short.
21. Adaptation of the programme to incorporate virtual communication platforms increased reach
even in the face of restrictions on physical interaction to contain the COVID-19 pandemic but
required additional support to be effective. This included (1) provision of audio and visual content
to support communication on Facebook and WhatsApp for the virtual PEs, (2) integration with
social mobilisation using community leaders and influential people to increase access by AYP, and
(3) unavailability of pre and post exposure questionnaires for participants made the work of virtual
PEs unmeasurable.
22. While virtual platforms with their high reach are more likely to be cost efficient (e.g., 93,000 were
reached with virtual platforms compared to 8,000 from the in-person peer education over the
same period). Results from the IVR show similar or better performance on selected indicators
when compared to in-person peer education. Season 1 of the IVR had impact on attitudes towards
transactional sex, condom use and capacity to negotiate safe sex. Season 2 had an impact across
all indicators include on HIV testing which lagged among participants in the physical peer
education programme. Given that the numbers reached by the IVR platform are over ten times
that of the physical peer education programme, the former is likely to result in shifts in attitudes
and capacities among larger population of AYP. It is therefore likely to be more cost effective.
However, all the channels are required. While the virtual communication channels may appear to
be more cost effective, they may not be best to deliver equity as some AYP where unaware or did
not have resources to access these platforms. A differentiated approach is necessary accompanied
by risk profiling to address specific needs of AYP to achieve behaviour change. This is difficult to
achieve with mass communication and would need to be supported by social mobilisation through
the physical peer education programme.
23. The programme’s data collection framework was aligned to its results framework with data being
used to inform programme changes. Areas for improvement were performance feedback to PEs
and local stakeholders, and collection of qualitative data on behaviour change.

Sustainability
24. NAHPA has demonstrated readiness (willingness and capacity) to integrate the MTV Shuga
programme scope into its roll out plans, without external support. The MTV Shuga programme
(primarily the peer educator programme) was incorporated in the current round Global Funding
cycle for Botswana under the HIV prevention pillar and within the behaviour change
communication thematic area. The funding will enable scale up of the programme in all high-risk
districts. Furthermore, NAPHA has included the MTV Shuga programme under its HIV response
social contracting modality. Makgabaneng provides technical leadership working with CSOs in four
additional districts implementing the full package of the MTV Shuga peer educator programme.
The programme budget is BWP16 million.
25. Integration of the PEs sessions with G&C sessions served as a good entry point for comprehensive
sexuality education. There was limited integration with health facilities. While PEs are well
recognised as an important stakeholder, the MTV Shuga programme was not always included in
the district evidence-based HIV annual plan e.g., in Okavango in was included while in Selibe
Phikwe it was excluded.
26. DACs, G&C teachers, and PEs have demonstrated readiness to continue supporting the programme
but require more orientation or sensitisation on additional programme components.
27. The adoption of MTV Shuga as part of the national HIV response is testament to the success of
advocacy efforts by UNICEF for national ownership and effectiveness of the technical support from
MTV SAF.
Conclusion
MTV Shuga programme has provided a model design that is feasible, acceptable, and implementable
without external funding through PEs, schools, and communities. It can be easily scaled as it is
applicable in multiple contexts of Botswana. The multiple communication channels provide the
programme the unique ability to reach a broad range of AYP with behaviour change messaging. The
evaluation demonstrated that the programme in its current state can build capacities of AYP, especially
females, to negotiate and practice safe sex and support more gender equal attitudes within sexual
relationships. However, what remained in the programme is to ensure with this capacity AYP can
overcome the barriers that undermine positive behaviour. This is where the programme needed to
invest more through differentiated approaches that addressed the unique needs of the most at risk
AYP. The current model has also failed to sustain engagement with out of school AYP and requires re-
designing to integrate economic livelihoods and linkages with health facilities whilst strengthening
differentiated PE approaches and parent-AYP engagement.
Lessons learned
Below are the lessons have been learned from the implementation of the MTV Shuga programme in
Botswana:
Lesson 1: Out of school AYP require incentives or additional motivation to participate in MTV Shuga
sessions. The programme faced challenges in mobilising AYP as they found the opportunity cost high
or just lacked interest to meet and talk about “HIV and teenage pregnancies”. When refreshments
were introduced during meeting sessions participation in the programme increased. The motivation
must be a basket of interventions to support the diverse needs of AYP.
Lesson 2: A programme targeting AYP must remain adaptable and agile to remain relevant. The MTV
Shuga programme in Botswana was implemented through a changing context at national and micro
level. The advent of COVID-19 led to introduction virtual peer education programme which has
continued post COVID-19. When visual TV episodes were not working due to vandalism of electrical
xi
facilities in schools the programme had to quickly change to using radio sessions. The programme kept
on adapting through its life cycle in this way it remained relevant to the needs of AYP.
Lesson 3: Using multiple channels of communication increased the breadth of reach for the
programme and its ability to influence change among targeted AYP. However, they should not
operate in isolation but complement each other. Over the course of the programme the various
channels reached over 200,000 AYP of varying backgrounds and circumstances in Botswana. Use of
multiple communication channels increases the chance of being successful in achieving outcomes.
Exposure from social media had the potential to be reinforced through the in-person peer education
programme. Referrals can occur from the virtual platform to the in-person interaction enhancing the
effectiveness of both platforms.
Lesson 4: It is not only important to ensure introduction of the programme at district level at the
commencement of the programme is key but to complement this with a regular monitorable plan
for engagement. This will make implementation easy and make stakeholders to be part of the project.
The programme was formally introduced at the districts in June 2020 whereas the PEs started in
December 2019. Second even with the introductory meetings relationships between PEs and
stakeholders were not fully established which affected implementation of the programme.
Lesson 5: For in-school sessions use of G&C sessions were found to be ideal as they proved less
disruptive of the school academic calendar. In schools, the use of guidance and counselling lessons
were explored. This was to enable the lessons to be utilised for the sessions. With the curricular
affected by COVID- 19, more time was allocated to classes therefore the use of G&C classes was ideal
less disruptive to the catch-up programme employed by schools. The worked collaboratively with the
school to map a plan for sessions using the school planner. to slot the sessions in the G&C classes.
Recommendations
Below is a summary of the proposed recommendations to enhance implementation of a future
programme:
Recommendation 1: A future programme should revise the programme module to include ART
adherence, Post Exposure Prophylaxis. It should also allow for provisions for adaptation after rapid
situation assessments to ensure unique context specific drivers are considered including content and
reach for certain AYP population groups with tailored messages e.g., the Basarwa in Okavango.
Responsibility: NAHPA
Recommendation 2: Enhance the parent and AYP engagement module by developing guidelines and
support for social mobilisation to support community buy in of the programme as a pillar for effective
parent involvement. This needs to be complemented by community-based Caregiver - AYP dialogues
to facilitate common understanding and break silence for discussions at household/family levels.
Responsibility: Makgabaneng
Recommendation 3: There is need for the programme to advance beyond the 9 sessions. The
components are already there e.g., motivational talks, meetings with AYP beginning to demonstrate
behaviour change, differentiated targeting e.g., teen mothers etc. This needs to be harnessed and
provided in a structured handbook and guidance for PCs and PEs to effectively use these instruments
to achieve behaviour change. Responsibility: Makgabaneng.
Recommendation 4: There is need for the programme to have a stakeholder engagement strategy and
guidelines that PEs follow to ensure all necessary stakeholders are engaged effectively. This should be
xii
supported with mechanisms for monitoring and supporting engagement. Responsibility:
Makgabaneng.
Recommendation 5: There is need consider the additional cost burden for onboarding remote areas
onto the programme to ensure effectiveness in delivery. Responsibility: NAHPA.
Recommendation 6: The programme needs to develop a standard PE:AYP ratio that ensures efficiency
and effectiveness in the delivery of support by PEs. This is especially so in the context of any additional
load with differentiated support. Responsibility: NAHPA.
Recommendation 7: A future programme needs to put in place a local sustainability plan that involves
building capacity of the education office and schools and DACs in the MTV Shuga programme content
and delivery. This should be supported with mechanisms to influence incorporation of the MTV Shuga
concept in the annual Evidence plans and the education office district plans as well. Responsibility:
Makgabaneng.
Recommendation 8: A multi-pronged approach to incentivise participation needs to be employed by
the programme, to include:
a) facilitating linkages with opportunities for economic and livelihood opportunities through
engagement with Ministry of Youth, and private sector
b) support provision of certificates after completing the standard MTV Shuga sessions
c) Consider provision of refreshments where feasible with adequate fiduciary risk management.
d) facilitate the identification of venues to hold the sessions preferably with the visual than on
radio to increase the appeal.
Responsibility: Makgabaneng.
Recommendation 9: the programme need to support the current monitoring system with mechanisms
to support outcome monitoring:
a) consider introducing annual outcome surveys that target the cross-section of recipients of the
MTV Shuga support (virtual and in person participants)
b) introduce qualitative data aimed at understanding the change the attitudinal and behavioural
outcomes occurring and how the programme is contributing to them.
Responsibility: NAHPA.
Recommendation 10: There is need for structured feedback loops at district community and levels
and from implementing CSO to PCs on performance. This will keep stakeholders engaged and
motivated for the programme. Responsibility: Makgabaneng.
Recommendation 11: The programme needs to put in place the following to support improvement of
session delivery and support of participants to facilitate behaviour change:
a) collect participants experiential data with the aim of improving session delivery.
b) collect risk profiling data for participants.
c) include collection of disability inclusion data to support disability inclusion in the programme.
Responsibility: Makgabaneng.

1 Introduction
This report presents findings for the Evaluation of MTV Shuga in Botswana covering the period 1
January 2020 to 31 December 2022. The evaluation was undertaken by Muthengo Development
Solutions on behalf of UNICEF and National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA).
This report provides details of the scope of the evaluation, its methodological approach used to draw
evidence for the evaluation’s conclusions and recommendations. The findings of the evaluation
process are presented according to the evaluation criteria of Relevance, Gender and equity,
Effectiveness, Efficiency and Sustainability. Conclusions and recommendations for improving a similar
programme in the future are also provided. The evaluation report is also a culmination of several
validation processes held with stakeholders of the programme to validate and verify the findings as
well as building acceptance of the recommendations.
2 Background
2.1 Context
National HIV estimates, and projections indicate that Botswana has the fourth highest level of HIV
prevalence in the world. In 2022, according to Botswana HIV/ AIDS Impact Survey (BAIS V) prevalence
of HIV of 2022 among adults in Botswana was 20.8%, which corresponds to approximately 329,000
adults living with HIV. While females in the general population carry the heavier HIV burden (26.2%
among females and 15% among males), young women and adolescent girls are more affected. The HIV
prevalence for adolescent girls of 15-19 years age was about double that of the boys (1.6% compared
to 2.7%). The disparately is higher in the 20-24 age group with HIV prevalence of young women, at
6.7% being more than double that of young males at 2.7%. According to the Botswana HIV/ AIDS
Impact Survey (BAIS V) prevalence of HIV of 2018, an estimated 8,510 new HIV infections occurred in
2018 being 33% among young people aged 15-24 years. This accounted for 3 in every 10 new infections
that occurred during that year.
Sexual abuse and violence against children have been reported to be major issues among adolescents
(Botswana Youth Risk Behavioural and Biological Surveillance Survey II, 2016). In this regard, almost
19% of sexually experienced students were forced to have sexual intercourse during 12 months prior
to the survey. One-third of sexually experienced students had sexual intercourse for the first time
before age 13 years, with 22% of them reporting being forced to have sexual intercourse. The report
indicates that 13.4% of girls reported having been pregnant. Furthermore, according to the Violence
Against Children’s Study, 6 to 9% of young people ages 18 to 24 years have experienced sexual violence
and 14% experienced emotional violence. Among adolescents 13 to 17 years of age, 4 to 10% have
experienced sexual violence and 12% have experienced emotional violence.
Comprehensive knowledge of HIV among adolescents and young people aged between 15 and 24
years is generally low, estimated at 47.9% (Botswana AIDS Impact Survey, 2013). Progress in reducing
new HIV infections among adolescents and young people is further constrained by intergenerational
& transactional sex, peer pressure, stigma & discrimination, and gender-based violence. Barriers
include entrenched harmful gender norms, gaps between policies and their implementation and
inadequate resource allocation for prevention programmes. These factors call for strategic, relevant,
and appropriate interventions for adolescents and young people to reverse and mitigate the impact of
HIV and AIDS.
Against this background and in alignment with the Third National Strategic Framework (NSF) for HIV
and AIDS in Botswana (2019-2023), UNICEF and the National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency
(NAHPA) worked together from 2018 in Partnership with MTV Staying Alive Foundation to adapt the
MTV Shuga Programme as a behaviour change communication strategy to help adolescents and young
1
people adopt safe sexual behaviour by targeting key drivers of new infections and non-adherence to
ARV treatment. The programme directly responded to the need to address barriers to reduction of HIV
prevalence among adolescents and young people and especially girls and young women as recognised
in the NSF for HIV and AIDS (2019-2023).
2.2 Description of the project
The MTV Shuga programme is an award-winning TV programme in Africa and Asia, that uses
edutainment as a model to showcase challenges of young people in different contexts with the aim to
provide behaviour change content to adolescents and young people. Aligned with the Third National
Strategic Framework for HIV and AIDS in Botswana, the programme was initially introduced by National
AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA) through the national Botswana television in 2011 and
later reintroduced on radio with the support of UNICEF in 2018 with the goal of reaching adolescents
and young people with behaviour change content focusing on safe sexual behaviour (delayed sex
debut, prevention of transactional and intergenerational sexual relationships) and uptake of HIV
services. As such, it was implemented through a collaboration mainly between UNICEF and the NAHPA,
in partnership with MTV Staying Alive Foundation.
The programme budget was US$1,724,696.00.
The MTV Shuga programme was a catalytic initiative linked to UNICEF’s Country Programme Outcome
2 which seeks to ensure that by 2026, adolescents and young people (10–24 years), particularly the
most vulnerable, will be more empowered and engaged to access quality and gender-responsive HIV,
health, nutrition, education, and child protection services. The programme also addressed sustainable
development goal 3 (SDG 3), on ending HIV and AIDS epidemic by 2030.
The programme was adapted and implemented as a behaviour change communication strategy to help
adolescents and young people adopt safe sexual behaviour by targeting key drivers of new infections
and non-adherence to ARV treatment. Objectives of the programme were to improve:
i. self-efficacy to know HIV status and access sexual and reproductive health services;
ii. attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex;
iii. attitude and self-efficacy to demand or practice safe sex; and
iv. knowledge and attitude towards sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and gender-based
violence (GBV).
The programme’s theory of change posits that:
if MTV Shuga messaging and support is delivered through multiple channels: radio, peer educators,
and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) targeting both in- and out-of-school adolescents and youth, more
adolescents and young people will receive knowledge and skills to avoid transactional sex, undertake
HIV testing, avoid or report sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and gender-based violence (GBV) and
use condoms which will then lead to: 1) improved self-efficacy to know HIV status; 2) improved
attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex; 3) improved attitude and self-efficacy to
demand or practice safe sex; and 4) improved knowledge and attitudes towards SEA/GBV. These will
ultimately lead adolescents and young people practicing safe sexual behaviour.

Programme components
The MTV-Shuga peer education programme, was piloted in two districts in 2019 and scaled up to four
districts in 2020 (Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe and Gumare) districts). With
the advent of COVID-19, virtual peer education (through social media platforms) programme was
introduced in Botswana in 2020 to ensure continuous access to information and services among AYP
during this period. As such, below are the various adaptations to the MTV programme, to secure a
comprehensive reach – especially to deepen impact of the radio programme and improve access in
remote rural and peri-urban areas:
i. Radio: The Drama series were an adaptation of MTV Shuga Down South with episodes of
about 7-10 minutes, followed by in studio discussions by young people for some of the
episodes so that the messages portrayed can be buttressed and to spark issues of discussion
by audience. The programme aired on Radio Botswana 2 (RB2) FM and Yarona FM which are
the 2 leading youth radio station and have a wider geographic coverage, especially RB2 fm.
ii. Interpersonal communication: Peer education component specifically aimed to promote and
support the adoption of positive behaviours, mitigate the impact of and prevent HIV, sexual
exploitation, and abuse (SEA) and gender-based violence (GBV) among adolescents and young
people (AYP) from within and around Selibe-Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango (Shakawe
and Gumare) districts. The model used the MTV Shuga Peer Facilitation Guide which contained
7 sessions which were increased to 9 sessions that each group of participants have to complete
to be classified as being fully exposed to the MTV Shuga Peer education Programme. Pre-
assessments were run by the facilitators from the beginning and post assessment done at the
end of the 9 sessions for each group. This component was done by an implementing partner,
Makgabaneng, with the support of both UNICEF and National AIDS and Health Promotion
Agency (NAHPA) as technical and funding partners. Twenty-four (20 Peer educators and 4 Peer
coordinators) volunteers were locally recruited, trained, and worked in close collaboration

with district authorities to implement the MTV-Shuga peer education programme for in and
out of school youth in the four districts.
The programme intended to train four
peer coordinators (one per district)
and twenty peer educators for face-
to-face interaction and support across
the four districts, whilst mentoring
and coaching them to strengthen their
agency, leadership, and
communication skills, for meaningful
engagement and participation in
decision making processes. The peer
educators were also designed to
utilise the revised peer education
manual (now with additional sessions
on peer face to face interaction and engagement with parents and teachers). The other components
which were covered during the trainings or refreshers were on social media literacy, sexual
exploitation, abuse, and COVID-19.
In-school sessions: In Ghanzi, Itekeng JSS, Ghanzi SSS and Ghanzi Brigade were the targeted schools. In
Okavango, the targeted schools were the following: Okavango JSS, Shakawe JSS, Shakawe SSS,
Ngambao JSS, Popagano JSS, Okavango Brigade and Ngethu Brigade. In Boteti the schools of scope
were Ditsweletse Junior Secondary school Motsumi Junior Secondary School and Orapa Junior
Secondary School and Letlhakane Senior Secondary school. The target schools in Selibe Phikwe district
were: Boikhutso Junior Secondary School, Lebogang Junior Secondary School, Makhubu Junior
Secondary School, Meepong Junior Secondary School, Mojamorago Junior Secondary School,
Phatsimo Junior Secondary School and Selibe- Phikwe Senior Secondary school.
Out of school sessions: The out of school sessions comprised of youth within the districts. These
included football clubs, traditional dance groups, drama groups, choirs just to mention a few. The
groups met at their agreed convenient time and location with the peer educator. The groups in the
four districts were young stars (Selibe- Phikwe), Banyana Banyana football club (Letlhakane)and in
Okavango and Ghanzi, a mix of local youth formed part of the sessions. In Gumare, the youth convened
at 6 BOCAIP, in Seronga they convened at Okavango Community Trust and in Ghanzi they convened at
Rollen Academy.
Peer educators also conducted district level advocacy campaigns on issues affecting AYP. They also
implemented community outreach activities such as motivational talks, one on one session with girls,
house to house campaigns, addressing of primary school students, born fire, Youth Dialogues, GBV
cycling campaigns, Arts workshops, and cultural festivals.
iii. Interactive voice response (IVR): Episodes of the MTV Shuga drama series were uploaded to
the interactive voice response (IVR) platform known as 124, for audience to listen to at their
own time in case they missed the radio show. Also, a ‘choose-your-adventure’ game was
introduced to the platform for improved interaction with audience. The game allowed young
people to choose characters they like and personify the character`s decision making process
and listen to how their story ends. This approach magnified the significance of decision making
by young people, elevating them to be more conscious in their decision making about key
themes of the drama series.
4
iv. Social Media: With the advent of COVID-19, the programme adopted virtual peer education
approaches to ensure and sustain service demand generation and uptake by adolescents and
young people. The 2020 lockdowns that came due to COVID-19 stopped the implementation
of the face-to-face sessions in the four districts. The use of social media platforms such as
WhatsApp and Facebook became key in implementation and for the continuation of the
programme. As such, online meetings were held with peer educators using WhatsApp to
engage and monitor progress on the online tasks given. These included holding bi-weekly
meetings with Peer Coordinators, COVID-19 sensitisation campaigns through Facebook and
WhatsApp, Peer Education sessions using WhatsApp and sharing Youth Motivational videos
on Facebook and WhatsApp platforms. Virtual peer education using Facebook also helped in
disseminating and engaging young people about the programme.
In 2020, the implementation coverages were as follows: 1) In Selibe-Phikwe, the project solely focused
on the town, six junior schools and one senior
secondary school; 2) In Boteti, implementation Peer education summary reach
was focussed on Letlhakane and Orapa areas; 3) Year Face to Face Peer Virtual
In Okavango, Gumare, Shakawe, Sepopa and Education Peer
Seronga and 4) In Ghanzi the focus of Education
implementation was only on the town. However, 2020 5272 -
by the end of 2022, the programme had been
2021 4363 21 297
expanded to more remote and underserved
areas/villages, as well as new schools and
2022 8250 56 682
tertiary education institutions, within the
districts. Makgabaneng programme reports Total 17, 885 77, 979
show that in 2021, 21 297 AYP
were reached through virtual
peer education whilst 4363 AYP (52.3% females) were reached through face-to-face peer education
across the four districts. Majority (56.4%) of the participants reached through face to face were aged
15-19 years, followed by those aged 10-14 years with 39.6%. By end of 2021 and August 2022, 7000
and 8250 (82.5% of the target) adolescents and young people (AYP) had been reached, respectively
through the face-to face peer education component whilst over 10000 AYP had been reached through
the social media platforms across the four districts. By the end of 2022, 56 682 had been reached
through virtual peer education. The peer education component was rolled out to more districts such
as Chobe, Goodhope/Lobatse, Kweneng, Gaborone and Francistown with support from UNICEF,
NAHPA and Makgabaneng, through a social contracting partnership arrangement from NAHPA.

2.3 Evaluation purpose
The evaluation purpose was stated in the Terms of Reference (ToR) as, “to evaluate how well the MTV
Shuga programme achieved its outcomes”. The evaluation measured the outcomes of the MTV Shuga
programme in all the four targeted districts. It also determined how effective the programme was in
achieving its set targets. The evaluation results are intended to inform replication of the programme
by the Government of Botswana in several districts of the country.
2.4 Evaluation objectives and scope
Objectives: The main objective of the evaluation was to undertake an outcome evaluation of the
MTV Shuga programme. In particular, the evaluation intended to measure whether the programme
resulted in:
a) Improved behaviour changes to adopt safe sexual behaviour;
b) Improved self-efficacy to practice safe sexual behaviour;
c) Improved attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex;
d) Improved gender equitable attitudes;
e) Increased demand for health services; and
f) Improved uptake of HIV Testing.
It determined the relevance and effectiveness of delivery models and communication channels
utilised.
Scope: The evaluation covered the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. While the evaluation
of outcomes covered all four districts, fieldwork was only undertaken in two districts. In accordance
with the ToR, the evaluation scope was guided by the evaluation questions developed for five criteria:
Relevance, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Gender and Equity, and Sustainability. Measurement of outcomes
relied on secondary data from the programme’s monitoring system (baseline, pre- and post-exposure
assessments). No primary quantitative data was collected due to budgetary constraints. The evaluation
also considered the effect of gender and geographical location on the intended outcomes of the
programme.
2.5 Evaluation framework
An evaluation framework was developed to guide the evaluation presented in Annex 2.
2.6 Evaluation audience and users
The primary user of the evidence generated from the evaluation will be the Government of Botswana
through NAHPA as the evaluation will inform the current scale up of the programme to other districts.
NAHPA will ensure that lessons learned are documented and built into the current programme for
better implementation. UNICEF will use the evidence to continue advocacy efforts towards ensuring
adolescent and young people programmes for safe sexual behaviours are developed and implemented.
This evaluation will also provide adolescent and young people programmeming sector invaluable
evidence on how to implement a social and behavioural change for adolescent and young people in
Botswana that is both relevant and sustainable. Development partners and other non-governmental
organisations stand to benefit from the results of the evaluation as well on the use of peer approaches
8
to behaviour change and in alignment with other programmes targeting AYP such as DREAMS and Sky
Girls.

3 Methodology
This section presents the evaluation methodology. It includes two broad sections on: 1) evaluation
approach which provides key guidance for the evaluation and its overall framing and design; and 2)
evaluation methodology which provides the specific details for data collection and analysis.
3.1 Evaluation approach
The evaluation used mixed methods approaches premised on qualitative and quantitative data.
Quantitative data was used to determine MTV Shuga’s performance on envisaged outcomes while
qualitative data was used to answer questions on relevance, efficiency, sustainability as well to validate
and explore further outcomes of the programme.
The evaluation was designed on the premise of a
This was the most relevant approach

3.1.1 Evaluation guidance and principles
In general, the evaluation was guided by the following UNICEF and UNEG evaluation and research
guidelines:
• United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards for Evaluation in the UN
System 20161 (including impartiality, independence, quality, transparency, consultative
process).
• Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations;
• UNICEF Ethical Guidelines and standards for research and evaluation and Ethical Research
Involving Children;
• UNEG guidance on integrating human rights and gender equality and UN System-Wide
Action Plan (UN-SWAP) on gender equality;
• UNICEF Guidance on Gender Integration in Evaluation;
• UNICEF adapted evaluation report standards and GEROS;
• UNICEF Guidance Note on Adolescent participation in UNICEF monitoring and evaluation;
and
• Disability-Inclusive Evaluations in UNICEF: Guideline for Achieving UNDIS Standards
Principles of independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest, and accountability guided
the evaluation.
Independence, impartiality, and conflict of interest: As independent evaluators, the evaluation team
had no interest in the outcome of the evaluation and was not involved in the programme’s
implementation. The evaluation team’s conclusions were not influenced by future gain or past
involvement with the programme and its implementers.
Credibility: the evaluation ensured data collection followed the agreed scope of work at inception. The
structure and content of the report was strongly influenced by UNEG Norms and Standards for
Evaluation and UNICEF adapted evaluation report standards and GEROS.
Accountability: All evaluation outputs were validated with stakeholders of the programme providing
them an opportunity to agree, disagree or seek clarifications on the findings and recommendations.
Whenever there were disagreements in the findings, the evaluators sought additional evidence to
retract the finding or strengthening their argument.
3.2 Evaluation methodology
The evaluation methodology was divided into quantitative and qualitative methodology. Overarching
was literature review.
3.2.1 Secondary literature review
A variety of secondary literature of the programme was made available to the evaluation team during
the inception phase. This included programme documents on MTV Shuga from UNICEF and
Makgabaneng, quarterly and annual programme reports from Makgabaneng, and various activity
reports. This literature was used to inform the design of the evaluation, methods and data collection
tools as well as the findings. The list of documents reviewed is presented in Annex 5. The information
collected from secondary literature was verified with primary data from field visits, interviews, and
workshops.
3.2.2 Quantitative evaluation
The quantitative evaluation relied on secondary data from the programme’s monitoring system (mainly
pre- and post-exposure surveys, and monitoring reports). The quantitative evaluation focused on
ascertaining achievement of the programme’s outcomes. The main data source was the pre- and post-
11
exposure survey data. While there was potential to use clinical data on SRH service utilisation, for
example, the contribution story for outcomes was weak and lower-level results were not fully achieved
(See Section 3.4, Limitations of the evaluation).
Data analysis
Secondary data from pre- and post-exposure surveys was analysed in accordance with the indicator
definitions provided by UNICEF. Differences between the baseline and post-exposure survey was
compared to ascertain the differences. The following Indicator Analyses Definitions and Rationale
were used in coming up with the analysis logic.
There were seven (7) indicators that were analysed. Outcome 1 had 4 indicators, Outcome 2 had 2
indicators and Outcome 3 had 1 indicator. For each indicator, an adolescent was assigned “1” if he or
she gave a response that matched the ones defined in the third column (Analysis Definition and
Rationale) and a “0” if other response was given.

the gender equitable norm as compared
to others, but feel free to include others if
needed.
A cluster of indicators with correct responses (“1”) were used to assess whether one will have achieved
that outcome or not. The following reason or logic was used:
1. For Outcome 1, an adolescent was considered having “self-efficacy to delay sex and practice
safe sexual behavior” if one had scored “1” s for the first 2 indicators and a “1” for the last two.
For the last two indicators, it is either one has the intention to get tested or was tested and
not all. The total score was 3. The proportion of those who scored 3 was therefore calculated
and compared for the pre- and post-exposure data sets and this enabled us to come up the
proportion of those with “Improved self-efficacy to delay sex and practice safe sexual
behavior”.
2. For Indicator 2, one was considered having “positive attitudes towards intergenerational and
transactional sex” when he/she scored “1” s for all the two indicators. The total score was 2.
The proportion of those who scored 2 was therefore calculated and compared for the pre- and
post-exposure data sets and this enabled us to come up the proportion of those with
“Improved attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex”.
3. For Indicator 3, a score of a “1” for the indicators sufficed for one to be considered “Improved
gender equitable attitudes”. The total score was 1. The proportion of those who scored 1 was
therefore calculated and compared for the pre- and post-exposure data sets and this enabled
us to come up the proportion of those with “Improved gender equitable attitudes”.
An adolescent was also considered to have achieved all the three indicators if he/she scored 7.
In all the three cases, calculation of the p-value using the protest1 in STATA was used to find out
whether there was a statistically significant difference between the pre- and post-exposure
percentages. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the difference was statistically significant and
worth considering as an effect of the programme whereas that greater than 0.05 would suggest that
there was no major difference between the two compared pre- and post-exposure proportions.
3.2.3 Qualitative evaluation
The qualitative evaluation comprised Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Focus Group Discussions
(FGDs), Case Studies (using the Most Significant Change (MSC) approach).
Key informant interviews: Key informants were drawn from institutional stakeholders. These were
purposively selected with those with the most knowledge of the programme being selected. A list of
11prtest performs tests on the equality of proportions using large-sample statistics. The test can be performed
for one sample against a hypothesized population value or for no difference in population proportions
estimated from two samples.
13
key informants met during the evaluation is presented in Annex 3. Key informants from national level
included UNICEF, Makgabaneng, NAHPA, BIHL, MTV-SAF. At the district level the following were
consulted: Peer educators, DAC, Chief Education Officer, DHMT lead, G&C teachers, etc. See Annex 3
for list of people met and Annex 8 for the data collection tools.
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs): FGD discussants were primarily adolescents and young people (AYP)
that went through the MTV Shuga sessions in- and out of school. Separate groups of males and females
were interviewed with each group having a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 8 participants. FGD
participants were divided into two age groups 15-18 and 19-24. The 19-24 were primarily out of school
of youths. Adaptations were made to the tools to ensure the tool could be completed in a reduced
time. The tool was more participatory by including programme posters and problem analysis, other
child friendly methods to gain deeper feedback in a shorter period. The FGDs included separate groups
of male and female which were later joined together to discuss programme impact through project
posters. Picture collage in Box 1 provides a sample of the process. These analyses became the entry
points to discuss the evaluation questions in the AYP tool.

Case study interviews: these in-depth discussions were held with selected participants of the MTV
Shuga programme that demonstrate changes in the outcome domains of the programme. Case study
interviews sought to ascertain how the MTV Shuga contributed to the change in knowledge, attitudes
and behaviour observed in the individual. A balance between male and female was maintained. While
disability was considered, the programme did not include persons with disability.
Sampling and sample sizes
Only two districts were visited for primary data collection. After conducting initial discussions with
NAHPA and Makgabaneng, two districts – Selibe Phikwe and Okavango were selected. The selection
was based on the need to have two districts that can provide a representative context of the project
14
implementation. The two districts provided urban area programmeming (Selibe Phikwe), rural and
remote area (Okavango). Selibe Phikwe provided additional performance context – where there is a
high concentration of actors aiming to reduce HIV incidence among adolescents and youth – providing
the evaluation additional analysis on programme contribution to outcomes in such contexts.
Okavango, in addition to providing remoteness, it was also viewed as a successful district. This provided
the evaluation an opportunity to explore what success meant for MTV Shuga and what made it
successful. Within Okavango, Gumare and Etsha 6 were selected as the locations for the evaluation in
addition to Lebogang and Meepong in Selibe Phikwe. Selection of the locations was undertaken in
collaboration with Makgabaneng to ensure urban, rural, and remote dimensions were included.
Therefore, four wards within the two selected districts were visited.
In each selected area, a school targeted by the programme was randomly selected for FGDs. Past
participants from the selected school were included in the sampling frame with the actual respondents
being randomly selected from participants’ lists. Due to their busy schedule, out of school participants
were difficult to meet as a group. the evaluation team resorted to meeting them individually.
Participants for case studies were purposively selected with the help of peer facilitators. These were
individuals that had participated in all sessions, and demonstrated changes as observed by the
facilitators or as feedback to facilitators.
The peer educator for the selected area was automatically selected for interviews while the Peer
Coordinators from the selected districts were included in the survey.
Sample sizes achieved for the evaluation are presented in Table 3.

Data collection
15
Qualitative data collection was led by the team leader and involved all team members. The
international team members were accompanied by interpreters during data collection at the
community level. Interpreters were trained on the tool and the data the evaluation sought to obtain.
This ensured no data was lost between translations. Data was collected over a period of 10 days
allowing the team at least two days per locality.
Data analysis
The data collected through qualitative methods in each district was systematically analysed,
triangulated, and synthesised by the evaluation team. The collected qualitative data complemented
and clarified the quantitative findings by helping to identify common themes. The Evaluation
Framework, Annex 2, provided an analysis framework for gathering and synthesising data against the
key evaluation questions. The analysis explored gendered differences in responses to specific
questions of the evaluation and understand, where differences exist, the possible reasons for such
differences.
3.2.4 Reporting, validation and participation of rights holders
All findings were validated by stakeholders through two processes. The first was a preliminary findings
presentation that sought to validate initial findings of the evaluation team with UNICEF, Makgabaneng
and NAHPA. This was followed by a presentation to the Evaluation Reference Group.
Participation of duty bearers: UNICEF, NAHPA, Makgabaneng, MTV SAF, BIHL and local governments
all participated in the evaluation as sources of information as well as validating the findings.
Participation included other stakeholders from outside Botswana including from the UNICEF regional
office for Eastern and Southern Africa, and regional office for MTV Shuga. The Evaluation Reference
Group, facilitated by the Evaluation Manager at UNICEF Botswana, and comprising a cross-section of
stakeholders for the programme was the primary platform through which these stakeholders
contributed to reviewing and validating the evaluation findings and recommendations.
Participation of rights holders: participation of rights holders, in this case adolescents and young
people, was achieved through ensuring their full participation in the data collection. In Selebi Phikwe
the evaluation recruited a young person to be involved in the data collection with AYP. We also
employed methods of data collection that facilitated their full participation in the evaluation. However,
they were not involved in the validation processes of the evaluation.
3.3 Ethical Considerations
Necessary safeguarding and ethical research safeguards were put in place. The evaluation underwent
ethical approval with the HRDC. The evaluation adhered to principles of confidentiality and informed
consent for all respondents to the evaluation.
The evaluation will involve interviewing children and therefore drew guidance from UNICEF Ethical
Guidelines and standards for research and evaluation and Ethical Research Involving Children.
Interviewing children was necessary to understand the outcomes of the MTV Shuga and receive
feedback on the quality and adequacy of the programme. While no significant harm is foreseen in the
conduct of the evaluation to child participants, the following guided all conduct of the evaluators:
• All children assented to being interviewed and parental consent sought through the help of
the school (for in-school participants) and peer educators (for out of school participants). If
seeking consent for an interview from parents or caregivers would put the child in harm’s way,
then such children would participate in the evaluation. The evaluation depended on the
experience of peer educators with the cohorts of participants they worked with during the
programme period. All consent or assenting were fully informed about the evaluation
therefore the evaluation ensured:
16
• Respecting the privacy and confidentiality of children and young people participating in
research. This involved close consideration of several aspects: (1) Privacy with regard to how
much information the child wanted to reveal or share, and with whom; (2) How to discuss
research confidentiality with children, including mention of the limits to this (e.g., safety
concerns such as harm, neglect or abuse), in a way that did not introduce new, potentially
worrisome, ideas; (3) Privacy in the processes of information gathering/ data collection and
storage that allows the exchange of information to be confidential to those involved; and (4)
Children’s anonymity and / or recognition in the publication and dissemination of evaluation
findings and associated activities.
• Children who participated will be given feedback on the results of the evaluation through
NAHPA and the implementing partner (Makgabaneng).
The evaluation did not come across any safeguarding issue and therefore the safeguarding protocol
was not employed.
Box 1: Ethical considerations
Risks: The evaluation protocol was noninvasive and involved minimal risk to participants. The
probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the evaluation were not greater
17
Box 1: Ethical considerations
than those encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations.
Voluntary participation: As part of the informed consent procedure, all potential participants were
instructed that they can choose not to participate in the survey if they do not want to. They were
also instructed that if they decide to participate, they do not have to disclose personal information
that they were uncomfortable sharing and that they could withdraw from the survey at any time.
Compensation: Participants were not compensated for participation in the survey.
Adverse events and protocol deviations: There were no adverse events and protocol deviations.
Inclusion Criteria: Outline of criteria for selection of subjects, gender, ethnic group, and
performance sites (provide justification for single gender or group).
• For those aged 10 to 64 years, able and willing to provide verbal (oral) informed consent in
English or Setswana;
• For emancipated minors (aged 10 to 17), able and willing to provide verbal informed
consent in English or Setswana.
Exclusion Criteria: Outline criteria for exclusion of subjects, gender, ethnic group, and
performance sites (provide justification for single gender or group).
• Unable or unwilling to provide consent or assent.
• Persons who are unable to give consent or assent due to cognitive impairment or
intellectual disability will not be eligible to participate.
• Cognitive ability will be assessed by providing information on participation and asking the
participant to summarize their understanding of the purpose of the evaluation and what is
requested from them if they choose to participate.
• Individuals who are unwilling to participate will also be excluded from the evaluation.
Potential risks for children and their mitigation measures are presented in Table 4.

3.4 Limitations of the evaluation
The following were the limitations of the evaluation:
1. Visit to only two of four districts had the potential to skew the perceptions on programme
performance. The evaluation ensured the selection of four wards that represent fully the
context of the programme including selecting some successful localities, provided the
evaluation with sufficient variation to fully explore the programme’s performance.
2. Analysis of the programme’s performance on outcomes was dependent on pre- and post-
exposure surveys as there were budget constraints to undertake a KAP survey of AYP that were
exposed to various elements of MTV Shuga in Botswana. The pre-exposure surveys were
conducted for each group of AYP prior to participating in the MTV Shuga sessions. This was
followed by post exposure surveys undertaken after completion of sessions. Only the in-
person peer educator programme and the IVR platform had pre- and post-exposure data. This
meant assessment of the performance of the programme was limited to these two channels.
3. There was potential to collect and use clinical data (especially utilisation of HIV services). While
this could have provided trends in utilisation of services and shown how the programme was,
through improved knowledge and attitudes, contributing to behavioural outcomes (utilisation
of HIV services), the low performance of lower-level results (especially improvement in
attitudes) (See Section 4.3.1, Effectiveness) meant such a contribution story would be very
weak or near impossible to establish. Additionally, the programme had no focus on linkage to
health services a requirement for enhancing utilisation of such services further weakening the
contribution story (See Finding 6 under Section 4.1). Resultantly clinical data was not used for
the analysis of outcomes. Instead, the evaluation relied on qualitative data obtained through
FGDs and case studies on the outcomes of MTV Shuga.
4. The evaluation was undertaken during school term. Majority of AYP participants, who were in
school, were given the G&C session, of 45 minutes, to participate in the evaluation. The AYP
tool had to be adapted to ensure FGDs with AYP could be completed within this time. Time
constraints were also experienced with out of school AYP who preferred to have meetings in
the evening. This cut short the time for interviews from one and a half hours to an hour at
most.

4 Findings
This section presents findings of the evaluation in accordance with the evaluation criteria of Relevance,
Gender and equity, Effectiveness, Efficiency and Sustainability. In each criterion the evaluation answers
questions posed in the evaluation framework, Annex 2.
4.1 Relevance
4.1.1 To what extent were the beneficiaries satisfied with the behaviour change
intervention?
Finding 1: The MTV Shuga programme used multiple channels of communication (both online and
offline) to address negative attitudes and behaviours that lead to new HIV infections and teenage
pregnancies. However, weak parent- AYP engagement and integration of economic empowerment
(for out of school) undermined design effectiveness.
The programme had a very strong integrated peer education and community-based approach to
increasing knowledge and developing positive attitudes towards HIV prevention, teenage pregnancy,
Gender Based Violence, and other issues affecting adolescents and young people in Botswana.
Integration of advocacy and community
outreach activities to the peer education
programme component, were perceived
by stakeholders to provide a holistic
approach towards increasing knowledge
whilst influencing attitudes towards HIV
prevention. The complementarity of the
radio drama series, the interactive voice
response (IVR) 124 platform and the
choose-your-adventure’ game provided
an opportunity for AYP to interact on
radio, IVR and choose characters they like
and personify the character`s decision
making process, thereby influencing their
attitudes and practices.
Other additions such as the inclusion of
social media platforms (Facebook and
WhatsApp), identification of advocacy
issues and integration of community
outreaches through motivational talks,
one on one session with girls, house to
house campaigns, addressing of primary
school students, youth Dialogues, GBV
cycling campaign, arts workshops, and
cultural festivals provided multiple communication platforms for the programme to address negative
attitudes around drivers of new HIV infections among adolescents. These multiple channels were able
to increase knowledge of risky sexual behaviours as demonstrated by boys in an FGD at Lebogang JSS
(see picture above).
Parent to child engagement was introduced in the third year of the programme as part of addressing
some of the barriers towards positive decision making by AYP on HIV prevention practices.
20
Parent/Caregiver – AYP engagement was recommended and implemented as a response to the lessons
learnt and voice of AYP towards creation of an enabling environment for decision making among AYP.
However, PEs faced challenges in mobilising caregivers to attend these sessions primarily due to a fault
in the design of the engagement approach. It did not include a social mobilisation component to
ensure there was buy in from caregivers on the intentions of the programme. It could have been, for
example, strengthened by household follow ups and mentoring to facilitate meaningful conversations
and household support for AYP decision making, including support for HIV testing, protection from
GBV, and uptake of related HIV and pregnancy prevention services. In addition to the cultural festivals,
the parent-AYP engagement sessions could have been complemented by community dialogues with
traditional and religious leaders, to create a more enabling environment for protection of AYP from
GBV, drug and substance abuse and sexual exploitation.
The programme faced challenges in mobilising and retaining out of school AYP because of there was
no incentive or motivation for them to take time out of their schedules to attend a talk about “HIV and
pregnancies”. This challenge is reflected in all annual reports. However, in instances where
refreshments were provided higher attendance by out of school was experienced. In general, out of
school AYP and PEs were of the opinion that if the meetings were to be integrated with economic
empowerment or livelihood activities the former would find the motivation to join and continue in the
group until all sessions are completed. Another challenge was the limited availability of appropriate
space to conduct sessions for the group.
Finding 2: The scope and design of the programme rightfully addressed the key drivers of new HIV
infections among adolescents in the targeted districts. During implementation the programme also
integrated drug and substance abuse prevention and management a key driver of risky sexual
behaviour.
AYP during FGDs were asked to list the behaviours they see every day in their community that are likely
to lead to HIV infection or teenage pregnancies. The identified drivers are presented in Figure 3.
Intergenerational and transactional sex, peer pressure, lack of confidence and agency, and SGBV were
common drivers for both male and female AYP. Alcohol abuse was mentioned for both girls and boys
however, substance and drug abuse was mentioned primarily by boys. Early sexual debut was
mentioned as another driver for girls.
Figure 3: Key drivers of new HIV infections for male and female AYP
Source: FGDs with in-school male and female AYP
The aim of MTV Shuga was to improve adoption of safe sexual behaviour by targeting drivers of new
HIV infections among adolescents and young people such as transactional sex and gender inequality,
21
also to improve uptake of HIV and health services such as HIV testing. It also aimed to support AYP to
delay sexual debut as well as understand the social complexities of negotiating safe sex. Therefore, in
its design, the programme was addressing a majority of the drivers of new HIV infections among AYP.
The programme design document for MTV Shuga did not address alcohol, drug and substance abuse
as a key driver of new HIV infections. Lessons learnt during engagements with parents, caregivers,
school authorities and police, through peer education, advocacy efforts and community outreach
activities established an increase in substance and drug abuse among both in and out of school AYP.
As such, inclusion of drug and, alcohol and substance abuse in the programme albeit outside the
standard MTV Shuga sessions (such as motivational talks, community outreach etc.) demonstrated the
programme’s adaptability to new realities (discussed more under Effectiveness and Efficiency).
Finding 3: The programme approaches were designed largely along the urban – rural, the in- out of
school and male-female divides. It did not implement differentiated approaches for engaging and
reaching out to the diverse groups of AYP beyond the three classifications.
Though the programme scope was adapted to both rural and urban settings, it largely used the
schooling status in profiling approaches for reaching out and engaging with AYP. The project focussed
more on male and female gender differentials, with a special focus on adolescent girls and young
women, with no deliberate efforts for engaging and reaching out to other genders. Therefore, the
programme lacked differentiated efforts or initiatives for engaging or reaching out to diverse groups of
adolescents and young people, to address the different vulnerabilities and most appropriate
approaches for reaching out and engaging AYP in their diversity. PEs could have been trained and
empowered to engage and work with different groups (both in and out of school) such as adolescents
living with HIV (including ART adherence as part of combination HIV prevention), teen
mothers/fathers, AYP selling sex, those with disabilities, and special tribes such as the Basarwa in
Okavango. As such, household vulnerability assessments could have helped the programme in
identifying the most vulnerable AYP for post peer education support and enrolment in differentiated
parent/caregiver – AYP sessions.
Though the project intended to increase self-efficacy for uptake of HIV testing, and practice sex through
PrEP, condoms and family planning services, the linkages between demand generation/peer
education, advocacy, community outreach and health service systems improvement towards these
outcomes was weak.
Finding 4: Peer educators were perceived to be effective in delivering sessions with AYP in both in
and out of school AYP.
Programme beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with skills and approach of peer educators across all
districts and settings (both rural and urban). No variations were noted on competency between male
and female peer educators. In schools, peer educators gained the confidence of both the G&C teachers
and the learners, to the extent learners were more confident in sharing and discussing sensitive
sexuality matters on HIV, teenage pregnancy, GBV and sexual exploitation with peer educators than
the G&C teachers, in both settings (rural and urban) (See more in Finding 14). However, in Boteti and
Okavango districts, Peer Educators had challenges in reaching out to some hard-to-reach areas for the
out of school AYP and their engagements with their caregivers/parents due to transport constraints.
4.1.2 To what extent were the programme strategies, approaches, and methods relevant
and responsive to the local settings, population, circumstances, and challenges?
Finding 5: Content of MTV Shuga sessions was generally aligned to the daily lives of AYP, with in-
person delivery approaches appropriate for meaningful engagements with AYP.
The content of the MTV Shuga sessions was adaptable to the lives and contexts of the AYP, both rural
and urban. However, due to the diversity of AYP, beyond the rural-urban and schooling differentials,
22
the IVR sessions could have been contextualised to the diverse categories of AYP (including those from
child headed households), so as to address the different vulnerabilities of AYP, in terms of HIV and
pregnancy prevention, GBV and sexual exploitation.
The delivery of in-person sessions by PEs and G&C teachers was perceived by AYP and stakeholders as
more appropriate as they provided for learning and engagement through various edutaining and
practical demonstrations (including through drama and songs). Similarly, the delivery of peer led
sessions for the out of school AYP through football clubs, traditional dance groups, drama groups,
among others at agreed convenient time and locations was very acceptable and appropriate for AYP,
for being more interactive, participatory and edutaining than virtual platforms such as Facebook and
WhatsApp. Establishment of district level Facebook pages and WhatsApp groups was also widely
accepted for contextualising discussions and issues to the respective localities.
Finding 6: While assumptions underpinning the programme theory of change were valid, there was
insufficient attention to manage the risks they posed.
The evaluation identified five key assumptions underpinning the effectiveness of the programme. Each
of these assumptions is detailed below and the programme’s approach to manage them.
Assumption 1 – MTV Shuga can deliver drivers of the health belief model: The
programme is underpinned by the health belief model which posits that, “successful
adoption of healthy behaviour starts with an individual`s perception of their risk
relative to their personal profile and linking it with their perception of the threat/ risk,
barriers and opportunities for adopting new healthy behaviour. The model suggests
that addressing perceived susceptibility, severity and amplifying benefits could go a
long way in building motivation to adopt new behaviour, which if augmented well with linkages to
solutions or services and promoting self-confidence to change, behaviour changes is highly likely to
occur2”. The MTV Shuga programme can realise the model as shown by Mary’s case (see Finding 15).
The programme sessions do well in improving risk awareness and improving capacity to address the
barriers for adopting new behaviours. However, there were weaknesses that undermine the
achievement of the model. First, and shall be detailed under Section 4.3, the nine sessions were
inadequate to support behaviour change. Risk profiling and supporting differentiated approaches post
the general MTV Shuga sessions were missing elements to enhance the effectiveness of the standard
nine sessions. Also, continuum of support was needed including at the critical transition point of Form
3 and senior secondary school as most teenage pregnancies were reported to occur at this point.
Second, the programme had weak referral to services (See Finding 18).
Assumption 2 – The programme will be able to mobilise AYP to attend the complete
set of sessions: This assumption largely held for in-school AYP but less so for those
out of school for reasons already discussed under Finding 1. Therefore, the
programme needed to support further mobilisation of out of school AYP with linkages
to economic empowerment and livelihood opportunities or incentives for attending
sessions such as refreshments or certificates. The IVR platform also faced similar
challenges with session participants dropping by 90% on the last episode compared to those that
participated in the first (See Finding 17).
Assumption 3 – Peer educators will be able to deliver sessions effectively: PEs were
deemed to be effective as demonstrated by their relationship with AYP and G&C
teachers (See Findings 4 and 14).

Assumption 4 – Parents can engage with the sessions: In general, there was poor
attendance by parents to the parent and AYP engagement meetings owing to weak
community mobilisation strategy (See Finding 1).
Assumption 5 – Majority of PEs will be retained in the programme:
AYP are a highly mobile group and hence this assumption was more a
risk. However, the programme did plan for it with recruiting and training of trainers
stationed in the districts to offer training to new PEs. MTV SAF, Makgabaneng and
UNICEF ran refresher trainings for PEs which enabled new PEs to get up to speed with
their work.
Finding 7: Challenges undermining responsiveness of in-person interventions included
infrastructure, PEs’ mobility for out of school AYP sessions and retention of out of school AYP.
In-person interventions also encountered various challenges, that relate to infrastructure, peer
educators’ mobility and retention of out of school AYP in the programme. Due to poor linkages of the
programme with economic livelihoods, the programme had challenges in motivating and retaining out
of school AYP in all the 9 sessions as they were committed to other more economically productive or
promising activities. As compared to in-school programmeming, where schools could provide
conducive spaces for individual one on one sessions for AYP, there were limited spaces for such services
for the out of school AYP. Additionally, peer educators and peer coordinators had challenges of
transport in reaching out to hard to reach and more vulnerable communities, especially in Boteti and
Okavango districts. In some rural areas, peer educators also encountered challenges in accessing
electricity for projecting out of school sessions.
4.2 Gender and equity
4.2.1 How well did the programme integrate gender and equity considerations into its
design and implementation?
Finding 8: Integration of gender was integrated from the recruitment of male and female PEs and
subsumed in the MTV Shuga sessions, which had a special focus on adolescent girls and young
women. Equity was also integrated through selection of urban, rural, and hard to reach areas.
Gender integration was recognised in the programme document of the MTV Shuga programme as
addressed through content of sessions which was inclined towards addressing challenges faced by
adolescent girls and young women as the group affected the most. However, the design document fell
short of providing specific strategies to enhance gender inclusion beyond the content.
In practice, however, several initiatives were put in place by project implementers and PEs in the
districts. First, the programme deliberately recruited male and female PEs in same localities to address
gender specific issues among AYP participants. Nonetheless, the programme still faced challenges in
recruiting an adequate number of male PEs resulting in some locations having majority female PEs.
This was noted to cause some challenges in facilitating boys’ or girls, to open up to the PEs about their
struggles and get referral assistance. Secondly, PEs, on their own initiative, introduced various
measures in their localities to address gender specific issues. At Ethsa 6 Junior Secondary School (JSS)
in Okavango district, PEs had a separate session with boys to address bullying, and at Lebogang JSS
separate boys' session were held to address drug, and alcohol and substance abuse which was
common among them. PEs also reported having some separate dialogues with boys and girls on
specific issues including teenage pregnancies.
Equity was addressed through the selection of urban, rural and remote districts. In each of the districts
except for Selibe Phikwe (predominantly urban) there was a focus on proximity and remoteness in the
24
selection of districts. In Okavango for example, the programme was in Gumare (the urban centre), in
Etsha 6 (rural ward) and in Shakawe.
For remote areas, such as Shakawe in Okavango, where population was dispersed, PEs faced the
additional burden of walking long distances to reach AYP on the programme. To oversee such PEs the
PC had to incur additional costs of lodging as it took a whole day of travel to reach the PEs. These
additional costs to support effectiveness of PEs and PCs in such areas were not considered in the
programme’s cost allocation.
Finding 9: The absence of gender inclusion strategies in programme documents of MTV Shuga
intervention undermined ability of implementers to effectively address needs of varying categories
of adolescents.
As noted above, PEs faced with different challenges or circumstances differentiated their target groups
for specific issues. At Estha 6 a session was held with teenage mothers to help address their specific
needs and drivers of HIV infection. Across all four districts boys' and girls’ talks were held. In Boteti
FGDs were held in 2022 for children who were exhibiting behavioural change to reinforce the change.
Such initiatives were adhoc and unplanned and dependent on the PEs’ own initiative. Because this
gendered approach was not always implemented by PEs it undermined the ability of the programme
to fully address circumstances of adolescent and young people groupings.
4.2.2 Was sufficient information collected during the implementation period on specific
result indicators to measure progress on gender and equity?
Finding 10: Data was being collected to measure project’s impact on gender and equity but was
not sufficient to address the data needs for implementing a gender responsive programme.
The programme’s monitoring system comprising session registers, and pre and post sessions exposure
surveys all collected sex disaggregated data. Furthermore, all indicators were sex disaggregated.
Through these provisions the programme was able to ascertain the impact on males and females.
While this was important to learn on the programmes gendered effect, process level data such as
experiences of males and females with the sessions was missing and important to determine gendered
approaches to session delivery by the PEs or timing and delivery approach for the IVR platform. Apart
from the standard nine sessions in the peer educator MTV Shuga guidelines, PEs did undertake, as
noted earlier, additional dialogues with programme participants. Data from such dialogues was
important to understand the extent to which different districts were putting in place measures to
address gender specific issues.
The session registers while providing sex disaggregated data, they were also inadequate for profiling
of session participants including marital status, teen mothers/ fathers, disability etc to facilitate a
gender differentiated approach to session delivery and content.
4.2.3 To what extent was the programme disability inclusive?
Finding 11: In general, the MTV Shuga programme was not disability inclusive.
Disability inclusion was not considered in the programme design nor during implementation. PEs and
G&C teachers generally reported limited capacity to handle children with disabilities undermining
actions to fully incorporate children with disabilities in the programme sessions. However, where the
school had some provisions to support persons with disability e.g., in Lebogang JSS, children with
disability were participating in the MTV Shuga programme but this was limited to visual and physical
impairments. Data collection forms did not reflect disability.
25
4.3 Effectiveness
4.3.1 To what extent did adolescents and young people adopt safe sexual behaviours as a
result of the programme? Was there an improvement in self-efficacy? To what extent
did attitudes towards the following improve: intergenerational and transaction sex;
gender norms related to prevention of HIV and unwanted pregnancy?
Finding 12: The MTV Shuga programme improved capacity of AYP to practice safe sex and gender
equitable attitudes. Adoption of safe sexual behaviours was less observed.
The project aimed to achieve three outcomes:
To determine the programme’s performance on these three outcomes the evaluation compared pre-
and post-assessment data of MTV Shuga session participants covering indicators of the three
outcomes.
There was a 3.9% (p-value = 0.000) increase in the proportion of AYP who achieved all three outcomes
between pre- and post-exposure (See Figure 4). The greatest change was in Outcome 3 with a 13.1%
(p-value = 0.0000) increase in the proportion of AYP with improved gender equitable attitudes between
pre- and post-exposure assessments. The proportion of AYP with the capacity to delay sex and practice
sexual behaviour increased by 4.9% (p-value = 0.000). However, there was a marginal increase of 0.6%
(p-value = 0.7975) in the proportion of AYP with improved attitudes towards intergenerational and
transactional sex. This was not statistically significant – meaning there was no change between pre-
and post-exposure assessment and that AYP perceptions on intergenerational or transaction sex did
not change between before and after exposure to the MTV sessions. Therefore, while negative
attitudes towards risky sexual behaviour changed slightly, the programme had a greater effect in
building capacities of AYP to practice safe sexual behaviours within those relationships (ability to
negotiate safe sex, that both males and females should carry condoms etc.).
26
Figure 4: Project achievements by outcome (pre- and post-exposure measurements)
When gender is considered, in general more females than males achieved all the three outcomes (See
Figure 5). Females (6.6%) were about 2.4 times more likely to have improved self-efficacy to delay sex
and practice safe sexual behaviour compared to their male counterpart (2.8%). Exposure to the
intervention had no significant change in males’ attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional
sex. For females, participation in the sessions led to a marginal increase of 1.9% of females with
improved attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex. The highest proportion of MTV
Shuga session participants achieved Outcome 3, gender equitable attitudes (12.2% for males and
13.4% for females) with slightly more females achieving this outcome. Thus, it can be concluded the
programme had a greater effect on females than males. This is important in the context of equity as
new HIV infections were high among female AYP. Nonetheless the effect changes were marginal
primarily as a result of limited engagement of session participants post completing the standard 9
sessions as discussed earlier.

Additional analysis was undertaken to understand the performance of indicators contributing to each
of the three outcomes. The results are presented in Table 5. Under Outcome 1, while all indicators
were above 5% change in the proportion of AYP demonstrating positive attitudes towards negotiating
safe sex and reporting sexual abuse, there was still a reluctance to undergo HIV testing and counselling.
Part of the challenge with this indicator could be the majority of the age group included in the MTV
Shuga sessions which were early adolescence group or Form 1 in Junior Secondary School. During the
evaluation when asked about whether they found questions for the pre- and post-exposure survey
easy to respond to, participants from Lebogang JSS in Selibe Phikwe had this to say:
“Sometimes the questions were hard for us to answer. For some of us it is too early to be
talking about HIV testing.” FGD participants, Lebogang JSS, Selibe Phikwe
This finding is consistent with other evaluations of MTV Shuga elsewhere e.g., in South Africa.
Birdthistle et al (2022)3 found older AYP, 19-24 years exposed to the MTV Shuga intervention were
more likely to know their HIV status than younger adolescents (15-19). They were also more interested
in using an HIV self-test kit than younger adolescents.
While there was not much shift in attitudes towards intergenerational relationships and transactional
sex, the largest change of 2.6% was on attitudes related to intergenerational relationships with a higher
proportion of females (3.1%) compared to males (1.8%) saying “it was not okay to date a partner that
is 10 years older”. However, this change was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.9995). AYP’s
perceptions of transactional sex had a very marginal change of 1.1% with males (1.6%) have the higher
proportion of those with a positive change in perception. A high proportion of over 80% of MTV Shuga
participants still maintained that it was reasonable for a partner to expect sex in exchange for money
or gifts.

There were cases of young people that had changed their behaviour e.g., stopping transactional sex,
intergenerational sex, drug, substance, and alcohol abuse. Mary’s story (Case study 1) demonstrates
the effect the MTV Shuga sessions can have on behavioural outcomes of adolescents and young
people. The session delivery approach and its content can have a profound effect on changing risky
sexual behaviour as observed in Mary’s story. However, cases of such behaviour change, as noted by
PEs were still few. This could be a result of limited follow of the MTV Shuga cohorts by PEs or the
limited engagement of the same cohort post 9 sessions of MTV Shuga. As noted earlier, the initiative
by PEs in Boteti to reinforce behaviour change through creating platforms for engaging those AYPs that
demonstrated emerging behaviour change is an emerging practice that could be explored for other
districts.
Case study 1: MTV Shuga can lead to safe sexual behaviours
Mary (not real name) is a 25-year-old young woman, who was born, raised and schooled in Selibe
Phikwe. She was raised very well by her humble family and was viewed by her classmates as a clean
and responsible student. Her problems started when she entered senior secondary school at Selibe
Phikwe Senior Secondary School. She experienced peer pressure from other students who had
started drinking alcohol, smoking and frequently engaging in binge drinking over the weekend with
older men. Oftentimes, over the weekend they would visit bars and night clubs drinking with older
men who were buying them alcohol. She said she used to sleep with multiple men every weekend.
She did not concentrate on her schoolwork. She said drinking and smoking was glamourized by her
peers as something cool. Mary said that she was part of a community of students who were studying
very hard at school but due to peer pressure from bad friends she ended up practising bad behaviour
that predispose her to HIV infection, STIs and teenage pregnancy.
Mary stated that due to her bad behaviour she ended failing Form 5 dismally and had to now face
the realities of life with her parents at home and community. As she was coming from a low-income
family, her initial plans when she got to the secondary school were to pass and proceed to the
university and then get a well-paying job that would help her get her family out of poverty.
Now that she failed her form 5, Mary became an added burden to her family which was already
struggling. She sadly said that her problem started to worsen as she now started drinking with
multiple men and ended getting impregnated by a man who later dumped her. She also indicated
that the child added another burden to her already struggling family because the child needed to
be cared for. Realizing that she had added a huge burden to her family, she then got employed by
Ipelegeng Government Programme. She then got some small money to support her child. “At
Ipelegeng life became better than not working at all”.
It is at Ipelegeng where Mary got to know about MTV Shuga Programme, after Shuga peer educators
visited them during one of their daily works at the site. She enrolled into the programme and
received sessions which she found very intriguing and helped to change her behaviour. During the
time she was participating in the sessions, she started realizing how she had lost direction in life and
her future was in ruins. She realized that if Shuga had reached while in primary school she would
not experience peer pressure at secondary school. She said they learned about HIV prevention, self-
confidence, HIV testing and to avoid drug and alcohol abuse, engaging in multiple sexual relations
as well intergenerational sex.
Mary indicated that since joining the MTV Shuga programme she has since stopped drinking alcohol
and rarely visit bars and has also stopped dating older men. This she said is because of the
competency of peer educators who served as mentors to her and the fact that the sessions are very
stimulating and interesting. She said she is now confident and able to negotiate safer sex, resist peer
pressure, always uses condoms, and regularly goes for HIV testing. “I have now realized that
30
Case study 1: MTV Shuga can lead to safe sexual behaviours
accepting gifts does not mean agreeing to sex and that engaging in relationships with older men
can be exploitative”. Mary advised the government to start implementing MTV Shuga programme
at primary schools as doing so will impact young people’s behaviours as they learn to be resilient
when there are still young. She quoted a Setswana saying, “Lore lo oojwa le sale metsi”.
4.3.2 Achievement of project targets
Finding 13: The programme did not achieve any of its outcome targets.
Annex 4 provides details of the achievement of programme outcomes. It shows that the programme
failed to achieve the targets of any of the outcomes. However, output indicators were achieved for
some outputs e.g., Programme Output 2: Effective and efficient project management. The best
performing indicator was “Percentage of adolescent boys who hold gender equitable attitudes” which
was 0.8% short of the target. This was followed by the indicator, “Percentage of AYPs who demonstrate
intention to demand safe sex under pressure” which was 10% off the target.
The programme was able to reach 8,250 AYP instead of the target of 10,000 primarily due to
challenges with mobilising out of school AYP.
4.3.3 What were the key factors influencing the achievement or non-achievement of results?
Finding 14: PEs’ ability to deliver the programme sessions contributed to programme effectiveness.
However, training duration was viewed as inadequate by some PEs.
PEs were recruited through a competitive and participatory process spearheaded by the DACs in all
four districts. The effectiveness of PEs to undertake the sessions was appreciated by all key
stakeholders: G&C teachers, AYP and DACs. AYP were particularly happy with the approach taken
during the sessions that was participatory and with session delivery appropriate for various age groups
as group in school (Estha 6 JSS) said: “[we like the PEs] as they viewed us as students [they delivered in
a way we understood]”. This capacity is reflected in several ways. AYP noted how through the sessions
they were to increase their knowledge on various topics including improving their self-confidence and
risk awareness (which helps them in decision making). G&C teachers reported that students were more
comfortable speaking to PEs about their personal struggles which are then referred to the G&C by PEs
for further handling. Not only were the student trusting the PEs, the G&C teachers themselves (Estha
6 JSS and Lebogang JSS) were giving PEs more G&C teaching sessions than were required by the
programme and the task of addressing other problematic issues in the schools e.g., bullying at Estha 6
JSS. Key attributes noted by stakeholders for PEs was their enhanced emotional management and
ability to use various methods to engage the AYP.
PEs were also highly motivated and had passion for the work which helped them continue with their
work even under difficult circumstances such as long distances in Okavango or with inadequate
money for transport (Selibe Phikwe).
“Yes, the money for transport is not enough and I walk long distances to schools
[because of it]. I have never stopped going to schools because I like what I do and the
change I make with these children.” Interview with PE, Selibe Phikwe
31
The training undertaken by UNICEF, Makgabaneng and MTV SAF contributed to capacity of PEs. This
training was complemented with the recruitment of volunteer Training of Trainers in each district
and some refresher trainings undertaken by UNICEF and Makgabaneng within districts. While these
trainings were generally well appreciated by PEs for their ability to equip with them with skills and
knowledge necessary for their work, there was general consensus among them that they were more
satisfied with the training in 2019/20 than the 2021 training. The latter training was noted as too
short and focused mainly on emotional management, handling children disclosing abuse etc. It did
not adequately equip new PEs at that point.
Despite the presence of TOT volunteers in each district there were still PEs who were still to be trained
in Okavango for example.
Finding 15: DACs provided varied levels of support for PEs, which helped improve PEs’ work. Their
relationships with schools ensured access to adolescents.
The DACs across all districts provided varying support to PEs improving their effectiveness. Where
support was the strongest, such as in Okavango, PEs were provided office space, were supported with
linkages to other important stakeholders and guidance in implementing their work. Because of the
strong relationship between PEs and the DAC in Okavango, the DAC was able to put in place
mechanisms to continue supporting PEs with allowances over three months in 2022 when there was
a short break in support to ensure they continued to provide services. The DAC also supported the PEs
develop a relationship with a local NGO, BOCHAIP, to secure space for conducting MTV Shuga sessions
for out of school youth. In the districts where the relationship between PEs and DACs was week, such
as Selibe Phikwe, the DACs were still able to provide support for linking the PEs to other stakeholders
such as the DHMT. Due to such linkages PEs participated in health promotion activities especially those
targeting AYP in all the four districts. Such approaches helped broaden the reach of AYP.
Their importance to the DACs was beyond conducting MTV Shuga sessions, to include mobilising AYP
for various HIV behaviour change activities in the districts. The usefulness of PEs in mobilising AYP
strengthened their relationship with DACs.
However, there were instances where the relationship between the DAC and PEs was weak. In one
such district the PEs complained about the support from the DAC while the DAC also did the same
about the working relationship with the PEs. Despite the PEs being used to mobilise for AYP and being
called to provide talks at community health promotion events the weak relationship with the DAC led
to limited support for the PEs in their work that included availing of office space, supporting access to
venues for MTV Shuga sessions for AYP out of school and support with the DHMT. It may seem in this
district the entry meeting alone and having DACs recruit the PEs was inadequate to establish a strong
working relationship and a structured approach to relationship building facilitated by Makgabaneng
would have been appropriate.
In addition to their engagement with DACs, the PEs established strong relationships with schools
which provided them access to students. As discussed under Finding 14, such relationships led to PEs
receiving more time with students providing increased platforms for adolescent engagement.
Finding 16: Weak relationships with other stakeholders undermined availability of necessary
support to enhance the programme interventions.
Across all districts there were weak linkages with other stakeholders outside the DACs. Such
relationships could have enhanced the work of PEs in the districts. For example, challenges with space
for meetings with out of school AYP could have been potentially addressed through linkages with
village development committees (VDCs) and traditional leaders. Such a relationship could have opened
up “community halls” or “Dikgotla” that are owned by VDCs and traditional leaders. PEs also faced
32
challenges in mobilising caregivers for the parent child engagement sessions. Closer engagement with
community leaders from the onset would have helped to gain community buy in and leadership of the
programme.
While the MYC was listed by the project as a key stakeholder they were seldom engaged in its
implementation beyond the project entry meeting. They could have provided potential opportunities
for accessing economic empowerment or other livelihoods activities that would have enhanced
mobilisation and retention of out of school AYP
“On the 2nd of November the coordinator met
in the programme. Across all districts PEs had no
Kabakae Primary [in Ghanzi] school head teacher to
relationship with the chief education officers
requests for slots. The school requested for a letter
which could have been helpful and helping PEs from Ministry of Basic Education before they could
access schools at the end of COVID-19 in districts give a go ahead.” Extract from October to
such as in Shakawe Okavango and throughout December 2022 quarterly report
the programme in Ghanzi.
Finding 17: Availability of multiple virtual or online communication channels allowed the
programme to adapt quickly to COVID-19 restrictions. The restrictions affected continuity and
depth of support for AYP supported through the in-person peer education programme.
The advent of COVID-19 and the restrictions on movement halted all forms of physical interaction with
beneficiaries of the programme. The adoption, from the onset of the programme, of multiple channels
of communication that included, the adaptation of the radio programme through the 124 IVR
programme (titled Wanji game), the MTV Shuga sessions adapted for IVR, the radio programme, and
physical interaction through peer educators provided the programme the ability to reach a wide range
of adolescents. With the advent of COVID-19 the programme was able to continue with virtual
platforms thus limiting disruptions due to lack of physical interaction. The numbers reached by the
programme by December 2021 are presented in Figure 6. The large reach of the IVR platform
continued even during COVID-19. Virtual platforms were able to reach 92,983 AYP as shown in Figure
6.

that, for AYP, finding the phone and mobile data to use to engage with the content was challenging.
Thus, while the virtual peer educators had large followings the engagement of targeted AYP with the
content was less than 10% of the followers. On the IVR platforms participants rarely received full
exposure to all episodes thus limiting the ability of the exposure to influence behaviour change. For
example, 39,306 unique listeners called in for the first episode of Season 1. By Season 12 only 2,042
unique listeners were recorded. The same trend was observed for all three Seasons of MTV Shuga on
the IVR platform.
Finding 18: There were several challenges faced in the implementation of the programme that
undermined achievement of outcomes.
Peer educator to AYP ratio may be too high: the project was able to reach 8,250 participants through
the peer educator programme. This gave a PE to AYP ratio of 1:295. This may have overloaded PEs
limiting their ability to do more with the targeted beneficiaries including providing additional sessions
above the standard nine MTV Shuga sessions. Additionally, this happened in a project environment
where there was no set/defined PE:AYP ratio.
Nine (9) sessions were inadequate to facilitate behaviour change: Exposure within just the nine
sessions was insufficient to achieve the large shifts in behaviour change within the timeframe and is
one of the reasons why improvements in attitudes and behaviour may not have been widespread in
the programme. While there were instances of PE initiatives to address specific issues of groups of AYP
(boys, girls, teen mothers etc), this was not always structured and therefore ad hoc at best. As noted
earlier the absence of risk profiling and provision of specific support to AYP at risk of taking on risky
behaviours was a limitation in the programme. Some PEs such as those in Boteti did put in mechanisms
to reach out to AYP such as the additional sessions with participants demonstrating emerging
behaviour change.
In all four districts, AYP included community outreach as part of a larger health promotion effort of the
DHMT or through HIV behaviour change activities of the DAC and other CSOs in the districts.
Additionally, PEs organised dramas (e.g., in Ghanzi) and motivational talks in all districts. These
different interventions offered a variety of communication channels and opportunities to introduce
additional emerging topics such as drugs, alcohol and substance abuse, and teen pregnancies.
However, because these were not adequately planned for in the programme document including
ensuring sufficient overlap between those exposed to the MTV Shuga sessions and then the additional
support meant there was no consistent messaging to influence attitudes change and ultimately
behaviour as demonstrated by pre- and post-exposure data.
Out of school AYP were difficult to motivate to stay on the programme and therefore the MTV Shuga
programme was not successful with this group: The difficulty in accessing venues for holding the out
of school AYP MTV Shuga sessions, the absence of incentives for participation – refreshments,
economic or livelihood support all combined to limit
retention of AYP in the sessions. Resultantly, of the 8,250 “There has been a better turn out with
AYP reached with the peer educator programme less than regard to out of school participants
10% were out of school. While it can be argued that a larger since the introduction of snacks”
proportion of out of school was covered by virtual sessions, Interview with Estha 6, Okavango
the decrease in numbers exposed to various episodes
militates against effectiveness of exposure (See Finding 20).
Module content was adaptable across districts but could have addressed some context specific
issues and other areas to support behaviour change: As noted earlier the MTV Shuga session content
was adaptable and relatable to the context in which AYP lived. However, it could have address
34
additional specific context issues that drive new HIV infections and teen pregnancies such early child
marriages and bride offerings4 in Okavango. As one stakeholder put it:
“While the content of MTV Shuga is good, there was need for Makgabaneng to do a rapid situation
analysis to understand the context and adapt their content accordingly to ensure it addressed the
main challenges we face here in Okavango.” KII with stakeholder, Gumare Okavango district.
There were some specific modifications that could also have been made to the MTV Shuga module
including the following:
4.4 Efficiency
4.4.1 To what extent were the implementing strategies appropriate for achieving results?
Finding 19: The MTV Shuga programme management and coordination mechanisms were
decentralised and integrated into district levels, with interventions reviewed annually to align it to
lessons and new realities.
The MTV Shuga programme, informed by lessons from Makgabaneng’s previous experiences in Selibe
Phikwe and Boteti districts was designed as a multi-stakeholder intervention overseen at district level
by the DACs. To strengthen this multi-stakeholder approach Makgabaneng included multi-stakeholder
meetings as launchpads of the programme in each district that included key government departments
such as education, youth, and local government to ensure buy in and support for project activities.
However, these engagements were not followed through in implementation as PEs failed to build on
this momentum. Working relationships were established with the DACs and less so with other
stakeholders with others being non-existent e.g., youth, local government, education, health, private
sector, and traditional leadership. For education the relationships were established by PEs at school

35
levels which strengthened implementation at this level but also introduced new challenges when entry
into schools was denied such as in Ghanzi and Shakawe in Okavango (see Findings 18 and 19 above).
The strength of relationships between PEs and other stakeholders also varied across districts
depending on the motivation of the DAC to support the programme.
The collaboration with NAHPA provided opportunities for integrating the programme in the HIV
response and scaling the programme into more districts. At the onset NAHPA was able to support the
four programme districts to develop priority actions for AYP to be included in the overall district
comprehensive plans, thereby facilitating alignment of responses to the overall HIV responses and
priorities for the districts. While the collaboration was commendable, more could have been done to
ensure NAHPA was an integral part of the programme. For example, while NAHPA was included in
trainings of PEs, and some joint monitoring visits it was not always included in the quarterly meetings
between Makgabaneng and UNICEF. Any such meetings when held were adhoc and not part of a
structured process for incorporating NAHPA in planning and reporting. This would have been useful to
ensure NAHPA was fully abreast of the programme implementation.
Refresher trainings of PEs were also used as moments of reflection and learning from PEs on progress
in implementation, challenges being faced and emerging issues. UNICEF and Makgabaneng used this
feedback and results from monitoring visits and reports to inform programme steering. Therefore, the
programme took an adaptive management approach that used these lessons to make annual changes
to programme implementation. These changes included adding the two additional sessions to support
parent to child engagement, changing from use visuals to radio in response to vandalization of
electricity supply to classrooms, support for PE local advocacy initiatives, and supporting PE initiatives
for community outreach that included use of alternative communication approaches such as dramas,
motivational talks etc.
The use of multiple communication channels (as noted under Finding 20): interpersonal
communication, mass media and community mobilization approaches to reach the target audiences
with information and services, enabled the programme to rapidly adjust to the negative effects of
COVID-19 on programme implementation. The introduction of virtual peer education programme that
used WhatsApp and Facebook, and the continued use of IVR and radio platforms allowed the
programme to continue AYP engagement. Having the social media platforms administered locally was
appropriate as it ensured the content and discussions were locally relevant.
Finding 20: Peer educator training was conducted through a Training of Trainers approach, with
quality assurance being provided by MTV SAF. PEs generally appreciated the scope and content of
the training they received but viewed the duration as too short.
MTV SAF provided the training materials and content through a Training of Trainers approach for
Makgabaneng, for the rolling out of the initial training of peer educators and coordinators. The
programme utilised the MTV Shuga Down South Peer Facilitation Manual and tools, which had
adolescent friendly content focused on the key themes of the MTV Shuga Series including HIV
prevention, testing, PrEP, HIV treatment, sexual exploitation, and abuse (SEA) and direct access of
services. PEs and PCs perceived the training to have had comprehensive content, delivered by
experienced, motivated, and competent trainers though the duration was seen to be short. Apart from
addressing content issues, the trainings also managed to clarify the roles and responsibilities as well
as monitoring and supervision mechanisms for peer educators, through the DACs.
The MTV Shuga programme was also efficient in facilitating PE replacement in times of attrition whilst
trainings of new PEs recruits was not limited to residential in-person workshops but included on-the-
job-trainings by Peer Coordinators and specifically recruited Training of Trainers volunteers as well.
36
Such recruitment to replace departed PEs was undertaken by DACs in consultation with Makgabaneng
and PCs. This ensured efficiency in implementation of activities.
Supportive IEC materials such as graphic novels were also produced to reinforce the educational
sessions.
Finding 21: Adaptation of the programme to incorporate virtual programmeming increased reach
but required additional support to be effective.
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and altered the implementation of the MTV Shuga programme
through adoption and implementation of virtual approaches to peer education, trainings, and
stakeholder engagements. These changes were well reflected in programme agreements/programme
documents between UNICEF and Makgabaneng. The programme due to COVID-19 restrictions on
movement and safety precautions, stopped the implementation of the face-to-face sessions and
adopted use of social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook managed and facilitated by
virtual PEs. Four virtual PEs (one for each of the four districts) were trained and dedicated to facilitating
district level social media activities through the use of Facebook, WhatsApp, and SMSs. For example,
in Okavango, on the Facebook page, discussions we held on: HIV testing, prevention and care;
Transactional sex; Sexual exploitation; Condom use and Disclosure, among others. In addition to
training, virtual PEs received internet modems/routers to support virtual engagements.
However, virtual peer education was undermined by unavailability of audio-visual messages
compatible to WhatsApp and Facebook to facilitate engagement of participants. Furthermore, reach
of these platforms to AYP in target areas could have been improved with integrating it with social
mobilisation using community leaders, influential members of the community and PEs (responsible for
the interpersonal communication). AYP frequently reported limited access to phones and data which
could have been addressed with more effective engagement of the wider community. In spite of the
wider reach AYP in remote areas remained disadvantaged as they did not have access to the resources
necessary to access these platforms. For example, AYP spoken to in Okavango were not aware of such
platforms in the district. Lastly, it was difficult to measure the effectiveness of virtual PEs due to
unavailability of pre and post exposure questionnaires for participants.
4.4.2 Which components of the intervention and its communication channels are less
resource intensive but critical for the programme results?
Finding 22: The delivery of peer education sessions through social media platforms was well received
and cost effective. However, network challenges and lack of social media skills affected quality
delivery of the sessions.
Use of virtual approaches do lead to lower costs of implementation given the likely high reach with
much lower investment than physical interaction. While other studies have shown that they can also
lead to attitudinal and behaviour change5, in the context of this evaluation this was not possible to
evaluate6. However, given the context of the programme there were several challenges that could have
undermined effectiveness. Lower skills among PEs in promoting their Facebook and WhatsApp led
them to yield low results as noted in Peer educators’ monthly reports. Poor internet connectivity made
it difficult for the teams to participate in online trainings and other online implementation forums.

African Regional Social and Behaviour Change Communication Programme.

Communication-Programme.pdf
6 There was no pre- and post-exposure data collected for social media participants. However pre- and post-
exposure data was collected for those participating on the IVR platform, but the evaluators could not verify this
data.
37
Similarly, the data packages bought from the monthly airtime, provided social network bundles though
it was perceived to be insufficient. This was also coupled with limited skills among PEs and PCs to
mobilise using social media and to create demand for online platforms postings. In some cases, the
phones were not compatible with the applications.
The IVR platform used two modes the radio programme and the Wanji Game. As noted earlier the
programme was able to reach about 93,000 listeners across the three radio Seasons and the Wanji
Game (See Figure 6). Season 1 of the IVR had impact on attitudes towards transactional sex, condom
use and capacity to negotiate safe sex. Season 2 had an impact across all indicators include on HIV
testing which lagged among participants in the physical peer education programme (see Findings 15).
Given that the numbers reached by the IVR platform are over ten times that of the physical peer
education programme, the former is likely to result in shifts in attitudes and capacities among larger
population of AYP. It is therefore likely to be more cost effective.
However, each mode is important for achieving results in different contexts. Given the challenges
expressed by AYP in school about access to a phone, regular access to the IVR platform can be a
challenge which could have contributed to the drop in listenership with each episode across all three
seasons. AYP in remote areas can be particularly disadvantaged due to their limited or lack of access
to phones and therefore need the physical approach. However, to achieve behaviour change, the
channels are complementary. As noted earlier (see Finding 21) a differentiated approach is necessary
accompanied by risk profiling to address specific needs of AYP to achieve behaviour change. This is
difficult to achieve with mass communication and would need to be supported by social mobilisation
through the physical peer education programme.
4.4.3 To what extent did the programme generate solid evidence from monitoring and
evaluation in order to inform policy/advocacy and improved programmeming?
Finding 23: The programme’s data collection framework was aligned to its results framework with
data being used to inform programme changes. Areas for improvement were performance feedback
to PEs and local stakeholders, and collection of qualitative data on behaviour change.
The MTV Shuga programme had clear monitoring

developed for all indicators.
The radio programme, on the IVR platform, also included questions that collected data on programme
performance indicators ensuring its performance and contribution to programme outcomes could be
measured. The Waji game on the other hand did not have pre- and post-questions to understand its
effects on programme indicators. Also, there was no mechanism for determining effectiveness of the
virtual peer education programme.
Pre- and post-exposure surveys were supported by programme review meetings and joint monitoring
visits for stakeholders to have a first-hand experience of programme implementation. In addition to
38
joint monitoring visits, Makgabaneng conducted quarterly monitoring and supportive visits to all
districts to understand programme implementation and offer technical support to the PEs and PCs.
As noted above, findings and learning generated from the monitoring system were used to make
improvements to the intervention on an annual basis demonstrating the utility of the monitoring
system to the programme. Evidence from the programme was used to influence uptake by NAHPA and
youth led development under the social development pillar of the National Development Strategy (See
Finding 29).
Despite these measures, there were several issues that needed to be addressed in the monitoring
system:
o Feedback loops were not working: There was no feedback from Makgabaneng to PCs and PEs
on their performance based on data from the pre- and post-exposure assessments. This
feedback was important to keep PCs and PEs motivated or determine areas they needed to
improve. Because PCs had no feedback on performance, there was also no feedback on
performance to the G&C teachers and schools in general on the performance of the
programme. This is important to cultivate ownership and motivation for continued support of
the intervention by schools. Even DACs raised concerns about not receiving information on the
performance of the programme although they do get updates on progress in implementation
from the PCs.
o There was over reliance on outcome data and less attention on process data (session
experience information): The programme collected session experience data from the
perspective of PEs. While this was a good practice, it would have benefited more with direct
experiential feedback from AYP themselves to ensure sessions were delivered in a way that
addressed their needs.
o The was no collection of qualitative outcome data: The assessment of performance relied on
quantitative outcome data collected through the monitoring system. To effectively assess its
impact on behaviour change there was need to include in its monitoring system, qualitative
data on stories of change from session participants. Such data would demonstrate the validity
of the theory of change premised on the health belief model.
4.5 Sustainability
4.5.1 How well has the programme been linked to and is synchronised with other
programmes on reproductive health?
39
Finding 24: NAHPA has demonstrated readiness (willingness and capacity) to integrate the MTV
Shuga programme scope into its roll out plans, without external support. Integration of the PEs
sessions with G&C sessions served as a good entry point for comprehensive sexuality education.
There was limited integration with health facilities.
The MTV Shuga programme (primarily the peer educator programme) was incorporated in the current
round Global Funding cycle for Botswana under the HIV prevention pillar and within the behaviour
change communication thematic area. The funding will enable scale up of the programme in all high-
risk districts. Furthermore, NAPHA has included the MTV Shuga programme under its HIV response
social contracting modality. Makgabaneng, the contracted national NGO, provides technical leadership
working with CSOs in four additional districts implementing the full package of the MTV Shuga peer
educator programme. The programme budget is BWP16 million. Thus, the MTV Shuga is well
integrated in the HIV response programme in Botswana. At the time of the evaluation NAPHA had
plans to further scale up the project in more districts using the 2023/24 fiscus funding using the social
contracting modality. NAPHA was also ready to finance continuation of the IVR platform and the radio
programme which had been discontinued. NAPHA was waiting for handover from UNICEF at the time
of the evaluation.
At district levels PEs were invited to various health promotion platforms to reach out to AYPs with
messages on HIV and SRH (see Finding 18). Okavango PEs participated in a condom campaign by
Women Against Rape, and in Ghanzi PEs worked with the Botswana GBV support group to address
GBV. The importance of PEs in mobilising AYP was recognised in the districts as demonstrated by their
enrolment in various district level health promotion initiatives.
While PEs are well recognised as an important stakeholder, the MTV Shuga programme was not always
included in the district evidence-based HIV annual plan. While in Okavango, the MTV Shuga peer
educator programme included in the plan this was not the case in Selibe Phikwe.
Finding 25: DACs, G&C teachers and PEs have demonstrated readiness to continue supporting the
programme but require more orientation or sensitisation on additional programme components.
G&C teachers in all schools expressed readiness to continue working with the PEs even when the
programme stops. The only challenge was allowances for PEs which the schools could not provide.
DACs in Selibe Phikwe and in Okavango have demonstrated that they could fill the gap in funding for
PEs through their participation in HIV prevention activities of the DAC where they are provided
allowances for participation. G&C teachers also needed orientation on the programme to support the
PEs and reinforce their messages to adolescents' post meetings/sessions. There is readiness among
G&C teachers to integrate some of the peer education approaches for the G&C sessions – however
this requires the necessary training.
Several other initiatives are required to support readiness of stakeholders to continue supporting the
programme and possibly taking over at the local level:
• PEs have sufficient capacity but there is need for local CSOs to have capacity for retraining
when attrition of PEs occurs. Through the NAHPA social contracting modality Makgabaneng
was training and supporting local CSOs to implement the MTV Shuga peer education
programme. Further support is needed to ensure that these CSOs can continue regenerating
the same capacity among PEs. This could include mentorship support from Makgabaneng.
• The DACs in all districts require training on the programme and in order to: 1) support
implementation; 2) to reinforce the message by the PEs; and 3) support retraining of PEs when
needed in collaboration with CSOs.
4.5.2 To what extent have advocacy efforts been successfully used to contribute to national
ownership?
40
Finding 26: The adoption of MTV Shuga as part of the national HIV response is testament to the
success of advocacy efforts by UNICEF for national ownership.
UNICEF was deliberate in setting a path for national ownership of the programme from the onset. This
included ensuring NAHPA was an integral part of programme implementation through their
participation in all aspects of the programme and that a national CSO (Makgabaneng) had the capacity
to support its implementation. This approach also included working with NAHPA on a clear road map
for scale up of the programme that includes fiscus funding and as well as through the global fund.
UNICEF also used data and lessons from the MTV Shuga programme to influence development of the
National Development Plan under the social development pillar with a particular focus on youth led
development processes.
41
5 Conclusion, Lessons Learned and Recommendations
5.1 Conclusion
Overall: MTV Shuga programme has provided a model design that is feasible, acceptable, and
implementable without external funding through PEs, schools, and communities. It can be easily scaled
as it is applicable in multiple contexts of Botswana. The multiple communication channels provide the
programme the unique ability to reach a broad range of AYP with behaviour change messaging. The
evaluation demonstrated that the programme in its current state can build capacities of AYP, especially
females, to negotiate and practice safe sex and support more gender equal attitudes within sexual
relationships. However, what remained in the programme is to ensure with this capacity AYP can
overcome the barriers that undermine positive behaviour. This is where the programme needed to
invest more through differentiated approaches that addressed the unique needs of the most at risk
AYP. The current model has also failed to sustain engagement with out of school AYP and requires re-
designing to integrate economic livelihoods and linkages with health facilities whilst strengthening
differentiated PE approaches and parent-AYP engagement.
Relevance: The programme was well aligned with the Third Botswana Strategic Framework for HIV and
AIDS 2019 – 2023. The challenges it addressed were aligned with those experience by AYP in the target
districts. Its content reflected well the lived circumstances of AYP in the four districts. Appropriate
channels were used for reaching AYP comprising the radio, IVR platform, in person and virtual peer to
peer interaction. It put AYP at the centre of driving the initiatives, whilst challenging caregivers/parents
and communities to create a supportive and enabling environment. The programme content and
delivery approaches were also flexible and adaptable to the COVID-19 environment, through adoption
of responsive approaches and was innovative to develop livelihoods skills as part of promoting the
42
employability and business skills of AYP, thereby addressing poverty as one of the underlying
vulnerability causes for risky sexual practices by AYP in Botswana. However, this was not a significant
feature of the programme. The programme was also well integrated with other already existing
relevant programmes for AYP, such as NAHPA’s social contracting modality on peer education
component. Nonetheless, the programme had inadequate tools, and time for meaningful
engagements at family level whilst differentiated approaches for engaging and reaching out to the
diverse groups of AYP, and weak referral linkages with health facilities and economic empowerment
opportunities were notable gaps in the design of the programme.
Gender and equity: Gender was a key consideration of the programme given female AYP were
disproportionately affected, with new HIV infections more than double among females than males.
Significant proportion of the content was inclined towards female AYP. Data collection systems ensured
sex disaggregated data to determine the effect of programme interventions on males and females.
Gender responsiveness of the programme could have been enhanced by collecting sex disaggregated
experiential data of the MTV Shuga sessions. Disability was not considered in the design and
implementation of the programme. However, equity was considered in the selection of districts, but
the programme fell short on financing the additional cost burden faced by PEs and PCs operating in
remote areas.
Effectiveness: While negative attitudes towards risky sexual behaviour changed slightly, the
programme had a greater effect in building capacities of AYP to practice safe sexual behaviours within
intergenerational and transactional relationships (ability to negotiate safe sex, that bot males and
females should carry condoms etc.). The results of both the IVR platform (radio programme) and the
in-person peer education programme show that female AYP exposed to the programme interventions
performed better than their male counterparts which can have a significant long-term influence in
reducing new HIV infections among AYP. Utilisation of HIV services such as HIV Testing and Counselling
was low with no significant change when before and after the intervention are compared. Despite
positive changes in two of the three outcomes, the programme failed to meet its targets. At the same
time, while capacities were built and gender equitable attitudes developing, behaviour change was
not widely observed.
Efficiency: The MTV Shuga programme’s efficiency lied heavily on the radio and peer education
approaches as appropriate and accessible to reach out to both in and out of school AYP. The radio
programme, which was also complimented by the IVR platform and in person peer educator led
sessions provided an opportunity for AYP to be reached through mutually reinforcing approaches.
Implementation of the MTV Shuga programme, through Makgabaneng, which already had a good
working relationship with Government of Botswana at the national and district levels, through various
and decentralised structures (including District Multi-Sectoral AIDS Committees, DACs, DHMTs,
Regional Education Officers, Department of Youth & Culture and Youth Groups) facilitated smooth
programme entry, implementation (including delivery of trainings), monitoring and reporting. The
programme therefore benefited from Makgabaneng’s experiences from similar programme in Selibe-
Phikwe and Boteti districts, hence was already familiar with the respective communities and UNICEF’s
planning and procurement processes. The programme resources (e.g., time and financial) were utilized
as planned, including the re-programmeming that was introduced during COVID-19, through the
introduction of virtual approaches such as Facebook and WhatsApp. The use of PEs and PCs provided
a good entry point for checking feasibility and acceptability of the programme approaches, through
their participation at district level coordination and management structures. However, the programme
had limited engagements with other stakeholders such as the health, private sector, and traditional
leadership as well as limited feedback mechanisms between Makgabaneng, G&C teachers and PEs.
43
Sustainability: Because of the ease of scale up that does not require significant technical input, NAHPA
had already scaled up the project into additional four districts with more districts planned to be added
in the 2023/24 fiscal year. MTV Shuga concept was incorporated in the current funding round of the
Global Fund funding mechanism for Botswana providing additional resources for scale up of the
programme. All this demonstrates that the programme concept has taken root in Botswana. At local
levels gaps in training of G&C teachers and DACs may hamper continuation of the programme in
existing localities. This is more so given majority of the current funding under the social contracting
modality is not multi-year but annual cycles. This heightens the need to putting place sustainability
mechanisms at local level.
5.2 Lessons learned
Several lessons have been gleaned from the implementation of the MTV Shuga programme in
Botswana as follows:
Lesson 1: Out of school AYP require incentives or additional motivation to participate in MTV Shuga
sessions. The programme faced challenges in mobilising AYP as they found the opportunity cost high
or just lacked interest to meet and talk about “HIV and teenage pregnancies”. When refreshments
were introduced during meeting sessions participation in the programme increased. The motivation
must be a basket of interventions to support the diverse needs of AYP.
Lesson 2: A programme targeting AYP must remain adaptable and agile to remain relevant. The MTV
Shuga programme in Botswana was implemented through a changing context at national and micro
level. The advent of COVID-19 led to introduction virtual peer education programme which has
continued post COVID-19. When visual TV episodes were not working due to vandalism of electrical
facilities in schools the programme had to quickly change to using radio sessions. The programme kept
on adapting through its life cycle in this way it remained relevant to the needs of AYP.
Lesson 3: Using multiple channels of communication increased the breadth of reach for the
programme and its ability to influence change among targeted AYP. However, they should not
operate in isolation but complement each other. Over the course of the programme the various
channels reached over 200,000 AYP of varying backgrounds and circumstances in Botswana. Use of
multiple communication channels increases the chance of being successful in achieving outcomes.
Exposure from social media had the potential to be reinforced through the in-person peer education
programme. Referrals can occur from the virtual platform to the in-person interaction enhancing the
effectiveness of both platforms.
Lesson 4: It is not only important to ensure introduction of the programme at district level at the
commencement of the programme is key but to complement this with a regular monitorable plan
for engagement. This will make implementation easy and make stakeholders to be part of the project.
The programme was formally introduced at the districts in June 2020 whereas the PEs started in
December 2019. Second even with the introductory meetings relationships between PEs and
stakeholders were not fully established which affected implementation of the programme.
Lesson 5: For in-school sessions use of G&C sessions were found to be ideal as they proved less
disruptive of the school academic calendar. In schools, the use of guidance and counselling lessons
were explored. This was to enable the lessons to be utilised for the sessions. With the curricular
affected by COVID- 19, more time was allocated to classes therefore the use of G&C classes was ideal
less disruptive to the catch-up programme employed by schools. The worked collaboratively with the
school to map a plan for sessions using the school planner. to slot the sessions in the G&C classes.

5.3 Recommendations
The following recommendations are proposed to enhance implementation of a future programme.
They are organised according to three categories of Programme Content, Programme Delivery, and
Monitoring and Evaluation. The recommendations were developed through stakeholder consultations
and validated through two processes: a meeting with implementers and meetings with broader
stakeholders of the programme. The recommendations were formulated in the context of programme
scale up by NAHPA into other districts and considerations for other organisations intending to use the
concept in contexts similar to Botswana. The recommendations have also been formulated with the
intention to enhance effectiveness of the model by addressing challenges with the programme
content, implementation and monitoring and evaluation.

Title of assignment: Evaluation of MTV Shuga in Botswana
Section: Programme (Adolescent &HIV)
Location: Gaborone, Botswana
Duration: 7 Months
Estimated start date: 1 November 2022
Estimated end date: 31 May 2023
1. Background
National HIV estimates, and projections indicate that Botswana has the fourth highest level of HIV
prevalence in the world. In 2018, the HIV prevalence among adults 15-49 years was 20.3 per cent
with women having a higher prevalence than men (25% and 16% respectively). Overall, a total of
29,000 people aged 10-24 years were living with HIV of whom 64 % (18,847) were females and 36
per cent (10,644) were males. An estimated 8,510 new HIV infections occurred in 2018 being 33 per
cent among young people aged 15-24 years. This accounted for 3 in every 10 new infections that
occurred during that year.
Sexual abuse and violence against children have been reported to be major issues among adolescents
(Botswana Youth Risk Behavioural and Biological Surveillance Survey II, 2016). In this regard, almost 19
% of sexually experienced students were forced to have sexual intercourse during 12 months prior to
the survey. One-third of sexually experienced students had sexual intercourse for the first time before
age 13 years, with 22 % of them reporting being forced to have sexual intercourse. The report indicates
that 13.4 % of girls reported having been pregnant. Furthermore, according to the Violence Against
Children’s Study, 6-9 % of young people ages 8-24 years have experienced sexual violence and 14 %
experienced emotional violence. Among adolescents 13-17 years of age, 4-10 % have experienced
sexual violence and 12 % have experienced emotional violence.
Comprehensive knowledge of HIV among adolescents and young people aged between 15 and 24
years is generally low, estimated at 47.9 per cent (Botswana AIDS Impact Survey, 2013). Progress in
reducing new HIV infections among adolescents and young people is further constrained by
intergenerational & transactional sex, peer pressure, stigma & discrimination, and gender-based
violence. Barriers include entrenched harmful gender norms, gaps between policies and their
implementation and inadequate resource allocation for prevention programmes. These factors call for
strategic, relevant, and appropriate interventions for adolescents and young people in order to reverse
and mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS.
Against this background and in alignment with the Third National Strategic Framework for HIV and
AIDS in Botswana, UNICEF and the National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA) worked
together from 2018 in Partnership with MTV Staying Alive Foundation to adapt the MTV Shuga
Programme as a behaviour change communication strategy to help adolescents and young people
adopt safe sexual behaviour by targeting key drivers of new infections and non-adherence to ARV
treatment.
49
The MTV Shuga Programme
The MTV Shuga programme is an award-winning TV programme in Africa and Asia, that uses
edutainment as a model to showcase challenges of young people in different contexts with the aim to
provide behaviour change content to adolescents and young people. The programme extends to radio,
social media, and several other platforms to have a 360 degree reach of young people. In Botswana,
the programme was introduced by NAHPA on the national TV in 2011 and later reintroduced on radio
with the support of UNICEF in 2018 with the goal of reaching adolescents and young people with
behaviour change content focusing safe sexual behaviour (delayed sex debut, prevention of
transactional and intergenerational sexual relationships) and uptake of HIV services. The radio
programme has so far aired 3 seasons with the support of UNICEF and extended the radio seasons to
the interactive voice response (IVR) platform and face to face peer education in 4 districts with
persistent HIV incidence and HIV prevalence, of Selibe Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango.
Adaptation of the MTV Shuga programme
The adaptations which were
introduced to the MTV Shuga
programme through the NAHPA,
UNICEF collaboration was centred on
leveraging other communication
channels to secure a comprehensive
reach of the programme i.e., utilising:
• Radio: The Drama series are an
adaptation of MTV Shuga Down South
with episodes of about 7-10 minutes,
followed by in studio discussions by
young people for some of the
episodes so that the messages
portrayed can be buttressed and to
spark issues of discussion by audience.
The programme airs on Radio Botswana 2 (RB2) fm and Yarona fm which are the 2 leading
youth radio station and have a wider geographic coverage, especially RB2 fm. UNICEF
supported production of 3 seasons of radio series since 2018.
• Interpersonal communication: Peer education model uses the MTV Shuga Peer Facilitation
Guide which contains 7 sessions that each group of participants have to complete to be
classified as being fully exposed to the MTV Shuga Peer education Programme. Pre-
assessments are run by the facilitators from the beginning and post assessment done at the
end of the 7 sessions for each group. This component is done by an implementing partner,
Makgabaneng, with the support of both UNICEF and NAHPA as technical and funding partners.
• Interactive voice response (IVR): Episodes of the MTV Shuga drama series are uploaded to the
interactive voice response (IVR) platform known as 124 for audience to listen to at their own
time in case they missed the radio show. Also, a ‘choose-your-adventure’ game has been
introduced to the platform for improved interaction with audience, the game allows young
people to choose characters they like and personify the character`s decision making process
and listen to how their story ends. This approach magnifies the significance of decision making
by young people, elevating them to be more conscious in their decision making about key
themes of the drama series.
• Social Media: Using MTV Shuga social media pages/ dedicated page to broaden the reach of
the show, and use polls to monitor impact etc.
50
Programme Stakeholders
UNICEF: The programme is a catalytic programme linked to UNICEF’s Country Programme Outcome 2;
By 2026, adolescents and young people (10–24 years), particularly the most vulnerable, are more
empowered and engaged to access quality and gender-responsive HIV, health, nutrition, education,
and child protection services. The programme also addresses sustainable development goal 3 (SDG 3),
ending HIV and AIDS epidemic by 2030. To this end, UNICEF provided initial funding for the programme
including inception of Peer Education in 4 districts. Furthermore, UNICEF provides technical guidance
on behaviour change strategies for the programme and coordinates all partners to ensure alignment
and impact.
.
National AIDS and Health Promotion Agency (NAHPA)
NAHPA provide national leadership of the programme as custodian for the programme from
Government side and supports engagement with districts and other government stakeholders
involved in the programme. NAHPA is currently leading scale up of the programme in ten (10) other
districts.
MTV Staying Alive Foundation (SAF)
The partner provides radio production services in collaboration with local production houses and
develops adapted Peer education content for implementation. MTV-SAF also provide a platform for
data repository, analysis and dashboard which can be accessed by partners for monitoring.
Makgabaneng
Makgabaneng is the implementing partner that manages the day to day running of the Peer Education
programme, they recruit and contracts Peer Facilitators and manages their performance and
programme delivery. IP also provide documentation and publicity services for the Peer education
programme.
Botswana Insurance Holdings Limited (BIHL)
BIHL recently became a partner to the programme as a funder particularly for the expanding Peer
Education to remote and underserved communities.
UNICEF, in support of the Government of Botswana, is seeking to contract the services of an institution
to conduct the evaluation of the MTV Shuga programme in Botswana. The evaluation will be conducted
through a contract with a third-party service provider which will assess the outcome of the
intervention package on improving adolescent and young people behaviour. A researcher and/or
research organization will be recruited to carry out the evaluation. Lessons learned and products
generated from the programme will be widely disseminated and government supported for any
replication or scale up efforts.
2. Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope
The main purpose of the evaluation is to evaluate how well the MTV Shuga programme achieved its
outcomes. The evaluation will measure behaviour change results due to the MTV Shuga programme
among adolescents and young people exposed to the interventions in 4 districts in Botswana (Selibe
Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango) during the time of implementation from 2020 to 2022. The
evaluation to be carried out in 2 out of the 4 districts.
An outcome evaluation will be conducted to determine how effective the MTV Shuga programme
was in achieving its intended results with more focus on outputs and how well it was implemented.
51
The evaluation will coincide with the end of UNICEF support and the start of replication of the
programme by the government in several districts.
The evaluation will also consider the effect of gender and geographical location on the intended
outcomes of the programme. In particular, the evaluation intends to measure whether the
programme resulted in:
a) Improved behaviour changes to adopt safe sexual behaviour
b) Improved self-efficacy to practice safe sexual behaviour.
c) Improved attitudes towards intergenerational and transactional sex
d) Improved gender equitable attitudes.
e) Increased demand for health services
f) Improved uptake of HIV Testing
g) And to determine the relevance and effectiveness of delivery models and communication
channels utilized.
Evaluators will be expected to utilise as much as possible existing baseline and monitoring data to
analyse the results outlined above.

4. Evaluability and Methodology
Evaluation design: It is expected that the evaluation will utilise a mixed-method design that is gender
sensitive and socially inclusive, incorporating quantitative and qualitative methods. To establish the
evidence, the evaluation team should assess and suggest the most appropriate design in their
proposal for review.
From the evaluation questions, the evaluators will propose an evaluation matrix which will include
for each question, appropriate data collection methods and tools and analyses required.
53
Based on UNICEF’s data quality standards, all data collection and analysis will be disaggregated by
key demographic characteristics (age, sex, location) and if possible, by vulnerability, including
disability.
Data collection tools: Currently the intervention utilises the Pre and Post survey tool to capture
indicator information before and after exposure to the various channels of delivery. For Peer
Education the Peer Facilitator also use Session Tracking form which captures what and how the Peer
Facilitator conducted the session, and it is completed by the Peer Facilitator after each session.
Evaluators are expected to design tools or data capture instruments that will allow for collection of
secondary data and possibly primary data as needed. Tools should collect both quantitative and
qualitative data.
Evaluation scope: The evaluation should include 2 out of the 4 targeted districts and among
adolescents and young people ages XX – XX.
Flexibility of approach: UNICEF is cognizant that methodology and approach may be affected by
prevailing conditions (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) and budgetary constraints and therefore expects the
successful evaluators to be flexible and creative in responding to changing situations.
A clear articulation of how the fieldwork will be undertaken and any contingency measures that will
be in place to deal with COVID-19 should be detailed by the applicants. This should include
alternative data collection methods if needed and safety precautions for participants and staff are
accounted for. Partnership with a local research firm/institution is highly recommended.
The evaluation will be based on the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) criteria for
evaluating development programmes, namely relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and
sustainability with a focus on the impact criteria.7 Quality of the evaluation will assessed against
UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Report Quality Standards (see link below). At least a ‘Satisfactory’ rating
for the draft inception as well as final reports will be expected as per definitions therein. The
evaluation team should refer to these in the development of the inception and final evaluation
reports.

Standards.pdf
5. Primary users and intended use of the Evaluation
The primary user of the evidence generated from the evaluation will be the Government of
Botswana through NAHPA as the evaluation will inform the current scale up of the programme to the
other districts and sure that lessons learned are documented and built into the current programme
for better implementation. UNICEF will use the evidence to continue advocacy efforts towards
ensuring adolescent and young people programmes for safe sexual behaviours are developed and
implemented. This evaluation will also provide adolescent and young people programmeming sector
7 Further details on the UNEG criteria can be obtained from: http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/22.
54
invaluable evidence on how to implement a social and behavioural change for adolescent and young
people in Botswana that is both relevant and sustainable. Development partners and other non-
governmental organisations stand to benefit from the results of the evaluation as well on the use of
peer approaches to behaviour change.
6. Work Plan, Relationships and Reporting
The selected institution will work closely with UNICEF team, the National AIDS and Health Promotion
Agency in the form of a Steering Committee, to conduct the evaluation and the cost analysis for the
intervention package. The focal point to facilitate and coordinate this interaction will be the UNICEF
Botswana Evaluation Focal Point.
The consultancy will be for the duration of 7 months over the period 1 November 2022 to 31 May
2023. The consultancy will follow the schedule in line with the expected deliverables and timelines
will only be negotiated if the delay is due to conditions beyond the control of the incumbent.
A phased approach will be adopted to ensure the successful implementation of the evaluation. It is
foreseen that the assignment would entail the following broad stages:
1) Inception Report and Endorsement: Develop an Inception Report that (i) articulates the
theory of change; (ii) recommends an evaluation design detailing the sampling approach,
data collection tools and instruments; and (iv) proposes a detailed timeline and stakeholder
consultations.
2) Design and Implementation of Evaluation: Data collection, analysis, report writing and
stakeholder engagement by using proposed and approved methodology to investigate the
effectiveness of the MTV Shuga programme as per scope of the TOR.
3) Participate in one or more validation workshops of evaluation design and evaluation findings
and recommendations with the steering committee and other stakeholders
4) Produce a final evaluation report in line with UNICEF GEROS requirements
5) Evaluation advocacy brief: For dissemination of evaluation findings.

an NGO based in Gaborone through peer educators in the two districts.
2.0 Purpose of study
The main purpose of the evaluation is to evaluate how well the MTV Shuga programme
achieved its outcomes. The evaluation will measure behaviour change results due to the MTV
Shuga programme among adolescents and young people exposed to the interventions in 4
districts in Botswana (Selibe Phikwe, Boteti, Ghanzi and Okavango) during the time of
implementation from 2020 to 2022. Though covering the 4 districts, field work for the
evaluation to be carried out in 2 out of the 4 districts.
3.0 Study Procedures
The outcome evaluation of the MTV Shuga programme in Botswana will be conducted through
a gender sensitive and socially inclusive method mix approach to collect both quantitative and
qualitative data. Data will be collected from beneficiaries and other key stakeholders using the
FGDs, In-depth Interviews and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs).

1. Split the group into three. Have one group for male, one group for females and one that is
mixed.
a. In the separate groups ask the following: Tell me what leads to adolescents and young
people getting infected by HIV, STIs or getting pregnant. The boy's group should make
boys get infected, while the girls should do what makes girls get infected or pregnant.
As you do so always ask what causes this and why?
b. When you lookback at the intervention - support from Peer educators including with
the radio programmes - would you say it was addressing the main problems causing
new adolescent HIV infection and for those on ART not to adhere to treatment that you
have discussed? Why do you say so?
2. The mixed group is to come up with a project poster. In the poster they need to detail what they
liked about the programme and what they disliked about it. For each like and dislike write on a
separate sheet about why you like or dislike?
3. On a scale of 1-10 how satisfied were you it supports you received from peer educators? Why
do you say so?
