KEY TERMS OF EVALUATION
Accelerated Education The Accelerated Education Working Group (AEWG) is an inter-agency working group made up of several
Working Group (AEWG) education partners supporting and/or funding Accelerated Learning Programmes (AEPs).1
Accelerated learning A flexible, age-appropriate programme, run in an accelerated timeframe, which aims to provide access to
programmes/pathways education for disadvantaged, over-age, out-of-school children and youth. This may include those who
(AEP) missed out on, or had their education interrupted by, poverty, marginalisation, conflict and crisis. The goal
of AEPs is to provide learners with equivalent, certified competencies for basic education using effective
teaching and learning approaches that match their level of cognitive maturity.2
Accelerated education These principles aim to clarify the essential components of effective AEP. Each principle contains
(AE) principles evidence-informed best practices which can be viewed as a series of key actions or indicators to support
the design, implementation and evaluation of accelerated education work.3
Basic education Typically comprises primary and lower secondary education, and increasingly one or more years of pre-
primary education.4
Centre for Evaluation Uses a participatory approach, clients as well as other relevant parties (e.g., implementing partners or
approach (CEval) target groups) are involved in the different phases of the evaluation process.
Coherence The compatibility of the intervention with other interventions in a country, sector or institution.5
Contribution analysis Contribution analysis explores attribution through assessing the contribution a programme is making to
design observed results.6
Effectiveness The extent to which the intervention achieved, or is expected to achieve, its objectives and its results,
including any differential results across groups. 7
Efficiency The extent to which the intervention delivers, or is likely to deliver, results in an economic and timely way.8
Equity All children have a fair chance to survive, thrive and reach their full potential.9
Formative evaluation Formative evaluations are done during the development of a programme or during the course of a
programme to identify areas for improvement.
Gender equality Is the process of being fair to men and women, boys and girls and is about equality of outcomes and
results. Gender equity may involve the use of temporary special measures to compensate for historical or
systemic bias or discrimination. It refers to differential treatment that is fair and positively addresses a bias
or disadvantage that is due to gender roles, norms or differences between the sexes.10
Human rights-based A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is
approach (HRBA) normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and
protecting human rights.11
Hybrid evaluation design Using multiple evaluation designs.
Impact The extent to which the intervention has generated or is expected to generate significant positive or
negative, intended or unintended, higher-level effects.12
Internally displaced Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places
persons (IDP) of habitual residence, in particular because of or to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of
generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have
not crossed an internationally recognized state border.13
Mixed-methods approach A procedure for collecting, analysing and ‘mixing’ both quantitative and qualitative research and methods
in a single study to understand a research problem.14
Non-formal education Education that is institutionalized, intentional and planned by an education provider. The defining
(NFE) characteristic of non-formal education is that it is an addition, alternative and/or complement to formal
education within the process of the lifelong learning of individuals. It is often provided to guarantee the
right of access to education for all. It caters to people of all ages but does not necessarily apply a
continuous pathway-structure; it may be short in duration and/or low-intensity, and it is typically provided
in the form of short courses, workshops or seminars. Non-formal education mostly leads to qualifications
that are not recognised as formal or equivalent to formal qualifications by the relevant national or sub-
national education authorities or to no qualifications at all. Non-formal education can cover programmes

Executive Summary
This report presents the key findings, conclusions, lessons learnt and recommendations of the
Formative Evaluation of Provincial Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP)22 models and centres
(hereinafter referred to as ‘supported ALPs’), supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund, Pakistan
Country Office (UNICEF PCO) and implemented by relevant education and non-formal education (NFE)
public sector partners in the provinces (i.e., Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)).
ALP centres are a model of NFE that provide flexible, fast tracked education equivalent to the formal
sector. AAN Associates undertook the evaluation from December 2021 to September 2022. The
evaluation complies with the evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR, attached as Appendix 1) and follows
UNICEF prescribed reporting guidelines (i.e., Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS)).
The report comprises five chapters and a series of appendices.
Intervention Context and Object of Evaluation: Pakistan is young country with a population of 220.8
million (2020).23 The problem of out-of-school children (OOSC) is huge as one in every third child (32
per cent) between 5-16 years is not enrolled in the formal education system or is out of school.24 The
key contributory factors are: poverty, inaccessibility of schools and quality of education, and local norms
restricting girls’ education.
The object of this evaluation is to assess the UNICEF-supported ALPs in Balochistan, Sindh, Punjab
and KP for children (aged 5-16 years), who have either not been admitted into or (if admitted)
subsequently dropped out of the formal education system. Since 2016, UNICEF Pakistan has provided
assistance to provincial governments to set up and institutionalize ALP centres to enrol OOSC (over-
age youth in particular) with the possibility of either mainstreaming OOSC to formal education or shifting
them to vocational training/employment. The evaluation scope included all ALP centres supported by
the UNICEF PCO in 31 districts across four provinces of Pakistan.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope: This is a Formative Evaluation with a learning focus.
The expectations of this evaluation are to look backwards and generate evidence of success around
institutionalization of ALPs in four provinces (both pre/during COVID-19), glean lessons learnt and good
practices, and list recommendations for adaptation of supported ALPs. The geographic scope includes
supported ALPs in 31 districts (of four provinces) and the temporal scope includes all UNICEF PCO-
supported ALPs from 2016 to 2021. The thematic scope includes four components i.e., i) learners; ii)
tutors/facilitators; iii) management of supported ALPs; and iv) alignment of supported ALPs with Ministry
of Education (MoE) and policy frameworks. The scope excluded assistance by other partners/donors
and UNICEF PCO-supported ALP centres beyond the targeted 31 districts.
Evaluation Design, Methodology and Limitations: The overarching approach to this evaluation was
drawn from the Center for Evaluation (CEval)25 and remained Participatory.26 The evaluation applied
a Hybrid Design, comprising two sub-designs i.e., Contribution Analysis27 and Normative
Comparison.28 The contribution analysis assessed outcome level achievements disaggregated by
province (to the extent possible) and normative comparison assessed consistency using the
Accelerated Education Working Group’s (AEWG) 10 principles.29 The evaluation used a ‘mixed-
methods’ approach. The quantitative component was based on secondary data (including budgets,
expenditures and assessment of ALP centres) whereas the qualitative data was gathered through key
informant interviews (KIIs) with 14 female and 27 male participants and focus group discussions (FGDs)
with 170 female and 130 male participants. An extensive desk review of 253 documents has also
informed the evaluation. The evaluation faced limitations around availability of usable performance and
financial data, which constrained measurement of impact, effectiveness and efficiency.
Evaluation Findings and Conclusions: Evaluation findings and preliminary conclusions based on
criteria developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – Development
Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) are found below:

Relevance: The findings indicate that supported ALPs are relevant as the numbers of OOSC (in all
provinces) are staggering. Through the technical support provided to provincial ALP centres, the aim
was to formulate/approve NFE/ALP policy frameworks, develop/approve condensed ALP curricula and
teaching and learning materials, and train staff and establish ALP centres. The provincial education and
NFE stakeholders appear to have focused on education-based ALPs with limited
integration/incorporation of technical and vocational education into ALP curricula for adolescent
learners. The supported ALPs have taken an adaptive approach, whereby adjustments were made in
design and delivery due to COVID-19. For instance, all provinces have taken measures to address
COVID-19 risks by introducing home-based learning packages, subject-based educational videos, and
others. The approach to supported ALPs was found to be consistent with provincial policy priorities
(e.g., as listed in Balochistan NFE Policy 2016-2030; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Education Sector Plan
(ESP) 2020/21-2024/25; Punjab Literacy and Non-Formal Basic Education 2019-2020; and Sindh Non-
Formal Education Policy 2017).
Coherence: The results of post-facto normative assessment of supported ALPs (against AEWG
standards introduced in 2017) indicate a high to moderate level of coherence or consistency. The
supported ALPs are fully/mostly compliant in Balochistan, KP and Sindh (found to be compliant with 9
out of a total of 10 principles; found non-compliant vis-à-vis alignment with the national education
system). Punjab is slightly behind others for only being compliant with 7 of the 10 principles and being
non-compliant due to non-approval/non-introduction of the ALP condensed curriculum.
The supported ALPs came up as the singular OOSC intervention by UNICEF provincial offices, hence
the evaluation team is unable to assess how other OOSC interventions complemented the supported
ALPs. The findings indicate variable sector coordination (involving public sector entities, development
partners and civil society organizations (CSOs)) in different provinces. For instance, coordination was
found effective but was carried out informally in KP whereas in Sindh, the coordination platform was
found dormant. The sector coordination needs a clear focus and investments from relevant provincial
actors.
Effectiveness: Data limitations (such as non-annualised targets, lack of provincial governments’
targets and limited number of indicators for which achievement data is recorded) constrained a deeper
effectiveness assessment of supported ALPs. The achieved vs planned outcomes are compared for
three indicators for which secondary data is available (i.e., numbers of centres established, number of
learners enrolled and number of facilitators trained). Achievements vary across the three indicators.
The data points to Punjab and KP being most effective for achieving (for some over-achieving) the
planned outcome targets. Balochistan and Sindh appear to have been less effective due to
underachievement against planned targets. Balochistan managed to achieve three-fourths of the
intended outcome targets whereas Sindh achieved only two-thirds of the targets. With exception of KP
(where interventions started in 2020 and authorities opted to keep ALP centres open), COVID-19
delayed implementation and consequently affected achievements in the provinces.
The supported ALPs did contribute to/produce unintended results such as: perceived delaying of girl
marriages (for parents to allow girls to complete education); learners disseminating COVID-19
precautionary messages; ALPs promoting inclusion by improving access for Afghan refugee children
and children with disabilities; and learners helping families with calculations (after learning
mathematics).
The most significant enablers include: availability and willingness of relevant provincial public
institutions (except in KP) to immediately approve and roll out supported ALPs; use of community-based
approaches and cultivation of community interest and ownership; flexible timing (morning and evening
shifts for ALP learners); use of local facilitators (which reinforced trust in the centres); and placement
of centres in villages/neighbourhoods (which improved accessibility). The disabling factors include:
unavailability of qualified facilitators (especially in hard-to-reach communities in Balochistan and KP);
limited success with mobilising public financing (across all provinces); and COVID-19 driven
disruptions, which reportedly triggered economic migration-driven dropouts.
The NFE/ALP policies lay adequate focus on innovation, however there was limited clarity/guidance
regarding: what is meant by innovation; what are the areas for innovation; and what are associated
incentives. The evaluation found examples of needs-based innovations (i.e., use of supportive
supervision for facilitators (in KP); use of madrassas/government schools as ALP centres (in

Drive (LAD) application developed in Punjab)).30 The documentation of innovation process and

associated results remained weak. Moreover, limited focus is placed on knowledge creation/generation
and learning exchange for replication and scale-up of good practices across provinces.
Efficiency: Data limitations constrained the measurement of efficiency. Province-specific budgets and
expenditures tracking were not available for most provinces. In view of data limitations, the evaluation
team has done a basic yet consolidated efficiency analysis. From the consolidated achievements data,
the supported ALPs look efficient for being able to achieve overall targets (for three outcome indicators:
centres established, learners enrolled, and facilitators trained) within available funds (used 68 per cent
of allocated funds). Given the fact that outcome results (for three indicators) are mostly achieved whilst
using only two-thirds of funds, the budgeting assumptions look unrealistic. The cost/learner appears to
have increased from US$38 (in 2018) to US$94 (in 2020). The has been identified as an evaluation
finding and the evaluation team feels that this should be explored further by UNICEF PCO. Compared
to the national average for NFE (US$49/learner), the supported ALPs look cost-efficient at US$38 (if
2018 numbers are taken and not 2020 numbers).31
Impact: The evaluation has measured impact with respect to institutionalization of ALPs across
provinces. This has been measured with respect to changes in the policy environment; curriculum;
recruitment and training of facilitators; provincial budgets; certification process and reintegration
mechanisms; and impact on OOSC and their families. Overall, the supported ALPs have contributed to
both prioritisation and institutionalization of NFE/ALPs across all provinces. The most significant
contributions are evident in terms of standardization of teaching and learning materials (including
curricula and facilitator training materials), and examination, certification and reintegration systems. The
assistance helped with drafting and approval of provincial NFE/ALP policies (i.e., KP, Punjab and
Sindh). While the intent and willingness to commit public funds for NFE/ALPs is evident across
provinces, none has so far allocated any funds. KP and Punjab have drafted Planning Commission
Form-I (PC 1), however these are not yet approved. The supported ALPs have been successful in terms
of defining the process for re-integration or mainstreaming ALP learners, however actual rates of re-
integration/mainstreaming are still low (i.e., Balochistan 13.1 per cent, KP 3.4 per cent and Punjab 2.5
per cent). However, since ALP learners are not individually tracked, these statistics may not be
accurate. Impact is evident in changing community (and parent) perceptions and willingness to let
children resume education; inclusion of disabled and refugee children in supported ALPs; and perceived
impact on delayed marriages for children (girls).
Sustainability: The evaluation team noted an absence of guidelines/exit planning for UNICEF’s
technical and financial disengagement from supported ALPs. Cross-province learning remained
minimal, hence constrained replication of successful practices/learning across provinces. There is
evident interest and willingness from provincial governments to continue supporting the ALPs. This has
translated into approved NFE policies (except in KP); standardised curriculum and training material;
and a defined process of certification and reintegration of learners into the formal education system.
However, at the time of the evaluation fieldwork, the provincial governments had not yet allocated
financial resources for the continuation and scale up of supported ALPs.
Non-DAC
Human rights-based approaches (HRBA): The supported ALPs were mostly consistent with HRBA
principles across all four provinces: participation (through engagement of rights-holders and duty-
bearers); non-discrimination and equality (supported ALPs were equally available for all target
beneficiaries); empowerment (ALPs enabled access to education leading to perceived sense of
empowerment in learners); and legality (compliant with local laws and provincial sectoral policies).
Supported ALPs were partially compliant with the accountability principle due to lack of an ALP-
supported feedback and grievance management system.
Gender Equality: Across all four provinces, the supported ALPs were found to be mostly compliant
with gender equality principles. Although a structured gender assessment was not conducted in any
province, implementation is assessed as gender responsive as both parents (male and female) were
sensitised on the importance of education; community-based ALP centres were established for easier
access to education (especially for girls); Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) kits were provided
for young adolescent girls to promote an inclusive and safe learning environment; and female facilitators
were used to comply with cultural norms. There are positive results as most of the facilitators engaged
were female (creating employment opportunities for women in target communities) and almost half of
the enrolled learners were girls (21096 out of 37340).

iii
Equity: Supported ALPs were found to be partially compliant with equity principles across all provinces.
The geographical targeting of districts to set up the ALP centres was based on equity parameters
including disadvantaged, underserved, crisis-affected and/or hard-to-access communities. The
implementation focused on including vulnerable groups (i.e., children from economically poor
households or children who faced discrimination due to age and/or identity factors (such as ethnicity,
religion, nationality, disability). The ALP reports/monitoring data do not offer disaggregated results on
equity parameters for the evaluation team to offer any commentary on them.
Lessons Learnt and Recommendations: Find below the lessons learnt (including best practices) and
recommendations drawn from findings and discussions with the UNICEF PCO team. Please note
lessons learnt and recommendations are in summary form and for details see the relevant chapter in
the main report.
Lessons Learnt: The provincial ALP centres contributed to the following good practices:
1. Post-training coaching/mentoring of the facilitators helped the facilitators to discuss and
seek guidance from mentors (titled differently in each province) and to access
appropriate/responsive solutions to teaching and operational bottlenecks. This has worked as
on-job assistance/support, appreciated by all facilitators who benefited. In KP, the practice of
professional development (PD) days has been identified as a good practice, where the facilitators
had regular opportunities to seek advice from Training and Mentoring Officers (TMOs) (including the
opportunity to discuss issues with fellow facilitators).
2. For adolescent learners the incorporation of skills-based learning is critical. This is essential
for attracting and retaining the interest of adolescent learners and enabling them to be gainfully
employed. This came up as a gap and merits immediate action in all provinces.
3. Policy priorities and actions that deal with complex concepts and practices (such as NFE
innovation) require simplified guidance whereby concepts are broken down into practical
actions for planners and implementers to comprehend and put to use. Moreover, it is critical
that innovative practices are documented well and shared widely for others to benefit. The
absence of guidance on innovation to a degree contributed to limited application of innovation.
Moreover, while some innovative models were applied (i.e., supported supervision for facilitators;
madrassa/government schools as ALP centres; technology-based learning assessment) there was
limited focus on documentation and dissemination of innovative ideas for possible replication across
provinces.
Recommendations: The shortened recommendations are as below.
1. The need for parallel mechanisms for OOSC (across all provinces) is evident and merits
further strengthening of NFE/ALP institutionalization and takeover of ALP centres by
provinces, building on momentum created under UNICEF supported ALPs. The
recommended actions for relevant provincial education and NFE actors (Balochistan:
Directorate of Education (DoE); KP: Elementary and Secondary Education Department
(ESED) and Programme Implementation Unit (PIU); Sindh: Directorate of Literacy and Non-
Formal Basic Education (L&NFBE); Punjab: L&NFBE) include:
• Critically review and revise existing NFE/ALP Policy Frameworks and lay added focus on
implementing systems for continuity of education/learning during emergencies (such as remote
teaching and learning).
• For KP, relevant education authorities must lobby (with other actors) to get approval of the draft ALP
Policy (2020).
• In line with provincial policy priorities, the relevant education and NFE departments should develop
multi-year NFE/ALP institutionalization plans (3-5 years and seek assistance from development
partners). The NFE/ALP institutionalization plans should provide a basis for development/revision of
PC1s (Balochistan and Sindh to develop afresh and KP and Punjab to amend where applicable) and
seek finances for institutionalization (including take-over of UNICEF and other donor-supported
ALPs) and scale-up of NFE/ALPs.
• In line with NFE/ALP multi-year institutionalization plans, provincial education and NFE departments
should undertake the capacity assessment of existing NFE/ALP management structures at
provincial/district levels; use findings to re-calibrate the NFE/ALP structures at all levels; and develop
a comprehensive capacity development plan.
• To attract and retain interest of disadvantaged children, provincial education and NFE departments
must explore and collaborate with social protection agencies such as Benazir Income Support
Programme (BISP) welfare etc. to seek financial and non-financial support for these learners.
• Provincial education and NFE departments should continue to implement community mobilisation
and engagement as an integrated part of NFE/ALPs. They should periodically assess and document
iv
the good practices/challenges and disseminate widely to encourage replication and scale-up (within
and across provinces).
• The current research, monitoring and evaluation structures and systems merit a critical re-
assessment to enable timely tracking of results and use of monitoring/research data for decision
making. Some of the recommended actions (provinces to internally discuss further) include creation
of monitoring and research units (at the provincial level); allocation of at least 7 per cent of NFE/ALP
resources for monitoring and periodic research; and expanding monitoring/results indicators (add
results indicators such as learning assessments, completion rates, transition and mainstreaming
rates, employment of completers, and enrolment numbers on children with disabilities and refugee
children).
• Unpack the concept of innovation for NFE/ALP (a policy priority for which provinces have only limited
understanding) by producing a ‘Guidance Document’. The document should elaborate what
constitutes innovation; scope and scale; funding mechanisms; documentation; and incentives for
inventors and implementers. Practical steps may entail creation of provincial innovation/challenge
funds; active engagement with private sector/IT firms/universities to help find innovative solutions
(around remote learning, learning assessments, etc); identification of innovation champions in
provincial NFE/ALPs to steer the process, implement, monitor and document innovation; and
organise regular dissemination events to showcase innovative ideas for intra- and inter-provincial
scale-up.
• For improved compliance to AEWG/accelerated education (AE) principles, the provincial education
and NFE departments should undertake (or hire a third-party entity) normative assessments to have
greater clarity around level of compliance (and non-compliance) and use the findings to plan for
greater coherence with respect to learners, facilitators, ALP management and coherence with
respect to policies and plans. A light touch assessment undertaken as part of the evaluation has
indicated weaknesses and gaps around promotion of inclusion (equity), gender-sensitivity and
protection practices into the ALP facilitator training materials.
2. The relevance of UNICEF PCO cannot be over-emphasized given the history of engagement
with provincial education authorities, successes and momentum created around ALP
institutionalization across all provinces. Future assistance must focus on following:
• Extend technical and financial assistance to the provinces in above listed areas where province/s
may seek assistance such as: review/revision and approval of NFE/ALP policies; formulation of
NFE/ALP institutionalization plans; capacity assessment and development of NFE/ALP structures;
systems strengthening around curricula, facilitator training, learning assessments, examinations and
mainstreaming; strengthening sector coordination, documentation and knowledge sharing;
strengthening of research and monitoring systems; AEWG normative assessment; improvisation of
community mobilisation; unpacking innovation through guidance documents and supporting
activities; and others.
• Lay out province specific assistance plans (in line with the above) and clearly define the results and
actions (impact, outcomes, outputs and others) which should be reflected in provincial partnership
agreements and UNICEF Rolling Work Plans (RWPs). Moreover, clearly define transition/exit plans,
and improve internal budgeting and expenditures reporting to enable better tracking of cost of
completion and cost/benefit calculations.
• Lend support to the relevant education/NFE stakeholders and explore avenues for expanded
engagement of CSOs, think tanks, academia, private sector in NFE/ALPs for potential partnership.
• Partner with relevant provincial actors to commission/undertake periodic research and assessments
to assess processes; map impact and outcome level results of interventions; and do cost efficiency
calculations to help develop investment case/s for NFE/ALP advocacy and lobbying.
• Improve documentation of successes around innovation in NFE/ALPs implemented so far (e.g.,
supportive supervision of facilitators, technology-based learning assessments and remote learning)
and disseminate them for intra- and inter-provincial use, replication and scale-up.
• UNICEF CO to support with country/federal level coordination forums to convene with regularity
(once or twice a year to invite provincial authorities and other actors working on NFE/ALP) to discuss,
reflect and share good practices and learning across provinces/national levels.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Object of the Evaluation – Provincial
Accelerated Learning Programme
This is the final report of the Formative Evaluation of Figure 1: Structure of the Report
Provincial Accelerated Learning Programmes
(ALPs)32 (hereinafter referred to as ‘supported ALPs’),
supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund,
Pakistan Country Office (UNICEF PCO). Supported
ALP centres are a model of NFE that provide flexible,
fast tracked education equivalent to the formal sector.
The supported ALPs aimed to provide learning
opportunities to out-of-school children (OOSC) (age 5-
16 years) via specialised facilities (intended to be more
accessible) and curricula for students who have either
not been admitted into the formal education system or
who have dropped out, In 2016, UNICEF initiated
technical and financial support to provincial
governments to institutionalize ALP centres in four
provinces of Pakistan (Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Sindh). The key implementers
include relevant education (formal and non-formal)
departments in all four provinces. The major donors
include Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) and Norwegian National Committee
(NATCOMM). UNICEF PCO provided technical
assistance as well as contributed financially using
funds under Regular Resources (RR).
AAN Associates (a Pakistan-based research and
evaluation firm) was commissioned to implement the
evaluation from December 2021 to September 2022. The evaluation scope focused on assessing
provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF in four provinces from 2016 to 2021. The
evaluation was designed and implemented in line with expectations set in the Terms of Reference (ToR,
attached as Appendix 1). The contents of this report are structured into five chapters (refer to Figure 1)
with a series of appendices. The report follows UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System
(GEROS) guidelines for an evaluation report.33
1.1 Intervention Context
This section provides a brief overview of the country and the context of the intervention at global,
regional and country levels. Refer to Appendix 2 for a more detailed analysis.
Global Context: OOSC are often defined as: children of official primary school age who are not in
primary or secondary education.34 Over the past few decades, considerable efforts have been
directed globally and regionally at increasing accessibility to education. For instance, Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) Target 4.1 focuses on ensuring all girls and boys complete free, equitable
and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.35
These efforts have included but have not been limited to lobbying, political declarations, pro-poor
financing schemes and school fee abolition schemes. Despite these efforts, an estimated 258 million36
children and adolescents were out of school for the school year ending in 2018. The situation has
worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in children dropping out as a result of
increased poverty, migration in search of economic opportunities and closure of schools.
There have been global efforts to provide learning opportunities to OOSC through ALPs or AEPs –
which are flexible, age-appropriate programmes, run in an accelerated timeframe. ALPs and AEPs aim
to provide access to education for disadvantaged, over-age, OOSC – particularly those who missed out
32 As per UNICEF definition, Alternative Learning Programme (ALP) is an umbrella term, which includes a variety of different non-formal education programmes.

on, or had their education interrupted Figure 2: AE Principles
due to poverty, marginalisation, or
conflict and crisis. On completion of
an ALP/AEP, the intention is for
learners to reintegrate into the formal
schooling system, enter into skills-
based technical and vocational
education, or to enter directly into the
workforce, but with core literacy and
numeracy skills in place.37
To provide guidance and standards
for planning, implementation and
monitoring of the ALP/AEP model, an
Accelerated Education Working
Group (AEWG) was established in
201438 which included a small
number of education partners
(including UNICEF). The AEWG
developed 10 principles in October
2017 (refer to Figure 2) divided under
four components to steer and guide
implementation of ALPs. Refer to
Appendix 3 for details on AWEG
principles.
Regional Context: In South Asia, the situation is precarious as there are an estimated 11.3 million
children of primary school and 20.6 million children of secondary school age, who do not go to
school.39 Poverty is the foremost reason behind children not attending the school or dropping out before
completion. Children belonging to poorest households are almost five times more likely40 to be out of
primary school. Children with disabilities and from ethnic minorities also face problems in accessing
education and are often left behind. Along with that, child labour, lack of awareness, and socio-cultural
norms (particularly around girls’ education) also contribute significantly to the problem of OOSC.
Barriers are higher for girls than for boys where 81 per cent of girls compared to 42 per cent of boys
are not in school.41
Country Context: The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is

(2020), 48.5 per cent of the population is female and 51.5 - National OOSC rate: 32%
- Out of school: 5.7%
per cent is male.42 Pakistan has more than 60 languages
- Never been to school: 25.8%
with Urdu being the national language and English being the

official business language. The country has experienced urban areas

of boys
rates, from 9 per cent in 2005 to -0.5 per cent in 2020.43
Pakistan has achieved notable progress in increasing access to education, however high numbers of
children and adolescents are still deprived of their right to education. The country is ranked amongst
the top three countries with the highest number of OOSC. Disparities based on gender, geographic
location, ethnicity and socio-economic status are significant (for statistics refer to Box 1).44 The key
contributory factors include: poverty, cultural norms causing gender disparities and limited access to
school due to lack of schools/infrastructure.
Provincial Context: Every province has unique context, policies and needs surrounding OOSC. A
snapshot of the provincial context of OOSC is presented in Table 1 (refer to Appendix 4 for more
information on non-formal education (NFE) and ALPs in targeted provinces):

Policy Framework around Education and OOSC: Access to education is a right of every child in
Pakistan. Legally, Article 25A of the Constitution binds the state to provide free education and has made
education compulsory for all children ages 5-16 years.46 In accordance with Article 37-b of the
Constitution, Pakistan has pledged to eradicate illiteracy within the minimum possible time. Pakistan
has also ratified several international and regional conventions which underline the significance of
education (such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC); SDGs).
The issue of OOSC is a policy priority for the Government of Pakistan (GoP). It was first taken up in
National Education Policy 1998 which aimed to eradicate illiteracy through formal and informal means
for expansion of basic education. Literacy and non-formal learning were also an important part of
Education Policy 200947 which focused on adult literacy, NFE programmes, development of a national
literacy curriculum, mainstreaming learners enrolled in NFE programmes, developing need-based
schedules for child labourers, and training NFE teachers, amongst others. National Education Policy
Framework 201748 reiterates the national commitment to literacy and NFE and provides a detailed
framework for restructuring and improving NFE in targeted areas and mobilising communities to support
enrolling and retaining OOSC. For more details on provincial sectoral policies and plans, refer to
Appendix 5.
The constitutional, national and Figure 3: Different NFE Models
international commitments, and
the large number of OOSC in
Pakistan underscore the
importance of NFE programmes
in Pakistan. These programmes
supplement the existing formal
system, either because provision
of formal education is limited, or
parents are unwilling or unable to
utilize them. In 2017 (at the time of
the initiation of UNICEF’s support
to ALPs) 1.42 million49 children
were enrolled in the NFE sector.
NFE schools (different models are
provided in Figure 3)50 play an important role in providing education to underprivileged OOSC,
adolescents and adults – especially in rural areas.
ALP centres are a model of NFE that provide flexible, fast tracked education equivalent to the formal
sector. The sites for such institutes are closer to the community and are highly inclusive in nature,
catering to all genders, and refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). In 2017, there were
35,059 institutes in Pakistan with 33,990 teachers.51 It was in this context that UNICEF PCO initiated

its support to provincial governments to institutionalize existing ALP centres and set new centres in all
four provinces of Pakistan.
1.2 Object of the Evaluation – Provincial ALP Models and Centres
This section describes the intervention that is being evaluated (also referred to as the object of the
evaluation). The description includes an overview, goals and expected results, geographic scope and
implementation status, stakeholders and their roles, resources, participants (beneficiaries), significance
of ALP interventions and the Theory of Change (ToC).
1.1.1. Overview of Provincial ALP Models and Centres
Since 2016, UNICEF has provided support to provincial governments to establish tailored province-
specific ALPs, benefiting 33,000 OOSC (48 per cent girls) and 720 facilitators living in disadvantaged,
underserved and/or hard-to-access communities in Sindh, Balochistan, KP and FATA (now known as
newly merged districts of KP).52 Despite this progress and considering the magnitude of the growing
OOSC population in the country, UNICEF continues to provide support to provincial governments to
expand and institutionalize ALP centres. The evaluation focuses on provincial ALP centres supported
by UNICEF from 2016 to 2021 in four provinces (Balochistan, KP, Punjab and Sindh) funded by three
streams (JICA, NATCOMM and UNICEF RR).53 As each province has autonomy in terms of structuring
government sectors and provision of public services, the provincial centres were shaped by provincial
structures, realities and needs.
Aim of Support to ALP Centres: UNICEF’s overall aim was to support provincial governmental
counterparts to institutionalize ALP as a relevant and functional NFE modality and establish centres
that enable OOSC children and adolescents (who were unable to start formal education or who dropped
out for any reason) to obtain an education, access mainstream education, or shift to vocational training
and/or employment.
Timeline and Geographic Figure 4: Geographical Spread of ALPs
Spread: Since 2016, UNICEF
has supported ALPs across
Pakistan (with JICA,
NATCOMM and UNICEF RR
support), however the timeline
for each province varies.54 The
geographic coverage includes
31 districts located in four
provinces (refer to Figure 4 for
the districts). JICA funding
focused on three provinces
(excluding Punjab) and
prioritized districts that were in
disadvantaged, underserved
and/or hard-to-access areas.
NATCOMM focused on
disadvantaged and crises
affected areas in all four
provinces.
Stakeholders and their Roles: UNICEF’s support to ALP centres involved active engagement of
multiple stakeholders in each province. Find below (in Table 2) the list of key stakeholders and their
role in the delivery of ALP interventions. Please refer to Appendix 6 for a detailed matrix.

1.3 Significance of Support Provided to ALP Centres
Find below key aspects of the ALP support that contribute to its significance:
• The support to ALP centres is significant as it provided a chance to 37,76758 OOSC (aged 5-16
years) (20,586 girls and 17,179 boys) to obtain education and skills, potentially helping them to
transition to the formal education sector, vocational training and/or employment. Moreover, the
support to ALP centres has enabled the GoP (by strengthening capacities of the public sector) to
deliver on its commitments around education as a right (under Article 26 (1) of the UDHR,59 Article
28 (b) of the CRC and Target 4.1 of SDG 4). Furthermore, to deliver as per the GoP’s policy
commitments under National Education Policy 2017.
• The support to ALP centres is significant for adapting to local contexts in each province. For each
province (where responsibility has shifted post-18th Amendment60) the approach and delivery
model is different and tailored to policy, programming priorities and needs on the ground.
• The significance of ALPs has increased due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
education sector as a whole. The provision of non-formal education services required adaptation to
changing realities in each province.
• ALPs are significant for OOSC who missed out on, or had their education interrupted by, poverty,
marginalisation, conflict and crisis, by providing them with a chance to access mainstream
education.
• UNICEF’s support to ALPs is significant as it contributes to institutionalization (i.e., documenting
key aspects of supported ALPs) and strengthening public sector capacity to deliver ALPs.
1.4 Theory of Change
UNICEF’s support to provincial governments was not guided by a pre-formulated ToC. As per
evaluation expectations, the evaluation team has developed a consolidated ToC for all provinces (refer
to Figure 6) which outlines the desired state of change (or goal): “All OOSC have completed
basic/vocational education and training and have either been mainstreamed (into formal education)
and/or been gainfully employed”. The ToC stipulates outcomes with associated output/strategies that
may lead to the desired change.

Chapter 2: Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, Scope and Key
Questions
This chapter explains the evaluation purpose, objectives, criteria, scope (chronological, thematic and
geographic), key evaluation questions, stakeholders’ role and possible uses of the evaluation results.
2.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
This is a Formative Evaluation,61 with an expressed focus to critically examine the supported ALP
models and centres (particularly pre/during COVID-19); assess the functionality of supported ALPs and
factors contributing to their success (or otherwise); identify challenges and bottlenecks faced by
supported ALPs (and possible solutions to address these gaps); and generate good practices and
lessons learnt. The intended users and uses of the evaluation are listed in Section 2.2.
The evaluation objectives as outlined in the ToR were reviewed and rephrased for precision and
clarity, and these changes were approved by the evaluation oversight forum i.e., Evaluation Reference
Group (ERG) upon approval of the inception report. The rephrased objectives are as below:
• To assess how effective the supported ALP centres have been across different components
(learners who attend supported ALPs, tutors/facilitators who work in supported ALPs, management
of supported ALPs, and alignment of supported ALPs with Ministry of Education (MoE) and policy
frameworks) pre/during COVID-19, and map commonalities and differences across provinces;
• To identify enabling and disabling factors that facilitated or hindered functionality of supported ALP
centres;
• To assess compliance to gender equality, equity and child rights principles (pre/during COVID-19);
• To review implementation in accordance with the Centre of Evaluation (CEval) approach (life-
course model, organization theory, innovation theory and sustainability);
• To outline conclusions, lessons learnt and recommendations for continuity and adaptation of ALP
centres.

2.3 Evaluation Scope, Evaluation Criteria and Key Evaluation Questions
This subsection outlines the evaluation scope, criteria and key questions separately.
2.3.1 Evaluation Scope
The evaluation scope with respect to thematic, chronological and geographic aspects is mentioned
below. The scope did not change as defined in the evaluation ToR.
• Chronological scope: All ALP activities implemented from 2016 to 2021.
• Thematic focus: Thematic focus on four components: i) learners; ii) tutors/facilitators; iii)
management of supported ALPs; and iv) alignment of supported ALPs with MoE and policy
frameworks).
• Geographic focus: UNICEF supported ALPs in 31 selected districts across four provinces –
Balochistan, KP, Punjab and Sindh (refer to Appendix 7 for a list of ALPs in selected districts). This
evaluation does not include ALP centres outside of the selected districts or funded by other donors.
2.3.2 Evaluation Criteria and Key Evaluation Questions
The evaluation followed standard criteria Figure 7: Evaluation Criteria
developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development – Development
Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC)63
comprising relevance, coherence,
effectiveness, efficiency, impact and
sustainability. There is also considered focus
on UNICEF’s cross-cutting programming
priorities including gender equality, equity and
human rights-based programming (particularly
concerning child rights) which have been treated
as non-DAC criteria.
The evaluation is further guided by accelerated education (AE) principles64 with the goal of assessing
support provided to the ALP centres in compliance with these principles. The evaluation has also
adopted the CEval Approach65 and assess the planning and delivery of support provided to ALP
centres through the lens of the life-course model, organization theory, innovation theory and
sustainability approach (for more details, refer to Section 3.1; see Appendix 8 for overlaps between
evaluation designs). The evaluation questions (as listed in the ToR) were critically reviewed,
discussed and rephrased (listed in Table 5) to fit into the evaluation matrix (see Appendix 9). These
changes were approved in advance by the ERG upon approval of the inception report. Find below the
final list of key evaluation questions for DAC and non-DAC criteria.
Table 5: Key Evaluation Questions
Evaluation Criteria Key Questions –DAC/Non-DAC Criteria

Chapter 3: Evaluation Design, Methodology, Quality Assurance and
Ethics
This chapter describes evaluation design, methodology and data sources, data analysis approach,
compliance to United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) norms and standards, limitations and
mitigation measures, and evaluation implementation and management.
3.1 Evaluation Design
The evaluation is guided by overarching Participatory66 and CEval approaches.67 The participatory
approach facilitated engaging all relevant stakeholders to inform the evaluation as well as provide
oversight functions to the execution of the evaluation. The evaluation was informed by the opinions,
experiences and suggestions of key stakeholders, including service providers (at federal, provincial and
district levels); rights-holders (parents of ALP learners); and technical and financial partners (UNICEF,
JICA and NATCOMM). While employing the CEval approach, the evaluation team has analysed the
ALP interventions against four elements (life-course model, organizational theory, innovative theory and
sustainability) and a separate section has been included in Chapter 4 (under effectiveness) with the
findings from this analysis.
Keeping in view the design and evaluation expectations, the evaluation team applied a Hybrid
Evaluation Design, featuring two sub-designs i.e., Contribution Analysis Design68 and Normative
Comparison Design.69 The contribution analysis design was applied to measure outcome
achievements of supported ALPs, whilst relating them back to the ALP interventions to establish or
ascertain possible contributions to the observed changes. The normative comparison design was used
to inform the design and operational compliance to the established standards, as available in the form
of AE Principles. It should be noted that AE principles were developed in 2017 and did not inform the
design of ALP interventions as they were initiated in 2016. The evaluation team has conducted a post
facto comparison of the AE principles with the support provided to ALP centres to trace overlaps or
departures at design and operational levels.
3.2 Evaluation Methods Figure 8: Evaluation Methods
The evaluation employed a Mixed-
Methods approach,70 whereby both
quantitative and qualitative methods (refer
to Figure 8) were applied to generate
usable evidence to inform evaluation
analysis, conclusions and
recommendations. The selection of
multiple evaluation methods enabled
gathering comprehensive information to
respond to evaluation questions, but also
kept a check on possible method-related
data and application limitations. Find
below an overview of the evaluation
methodology.
3.2.1 Desk review
The evaluation team reviewed 253 documents (106 provincial government documents, 112 donor
reports and 35 UNICEF documents) such as proposals, progress and financial reports, concept notes,
baseline, endline, monitoring reports, rolling work plans etc. The desk review remained an ongoing
process throughout the evaluation as it enabled a better understanding of the context, interventions,
results, challenges and learning. A systematic approach was applied during desk research. This
entailed initial screening and classification (whereby documents were organised and catalogued
66 Participatory Evaluation is an approach that involves the stakeholders of a programme or policy in the evaluation process. This involvement can occur at any stage of the
evaluation process, from the evaluation design to the data collection and analysis and the reporting of the study. Better Evaluation, ‘Participatory Evaluation’,

according to the type of documents), broader themes were identified (keeping in view the evaluation
matrix) and relevant information was extracted using word search and general reading. The information
gathered was used to appropriately respond to evaluation questions either on its own or with the support
of the primary data collected through field research. Refer to Appendix 10 for a complete list of
documents reviewed during the evaluation.
3.2.2 Qualitative Data Collection
Qualitative methods used in this evaluation include key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group
discussions (FGDs). Before providing details on each individual method, the following description
highlights the sampling approach that was applied to select districts and respondents for qualitative
data collection methods.
Sampling for Qualitative Data Collection: The evaluation team employed a purposive sampling
approach71 to identify the respondents of KIIs and FGDs. The selection of KII respondents was driven
by the purpose of involving all those stakeholders who were involved directly or indirectly in the design
and implementation of ALP interventions. This ensured gathering of a diverse range of opinions to
inform the evaluation findings. Participants for FGDs were selected based on having directly or indirectly
benefited or having been involved in ALP activities at the community level. In terms of district selection,
two districts per province (eight in total) were purposively selected for the primary data collection (refer
to Table 6). Rational for district selection included:
• High OOSC rates;
• Provincial capitals as these are not only the largest cities of the provinces (with significant number
of OOSC) but also have representation of diverse ethnicities, economic backgrounds and migrants
from across the country.

Key Informant Interviews (KIIs): The evaluation team conducted 41 Figure 9: Distribution of KIIs
KIIs (14 females and 27 males) with key stakeholders at the national,
provincial and district levels to understand their views on ALP design,
implementation, achievements, challenges and lessons learnt (refer to
Figure 9 for breakdown of the KIIs). The KIIs enabled the evaluation
team to collect first-hand information relevant to indicators (identified
in the evaluation matrix). The evaluation team used semi-structured
guidelines (refer to Appendix 11) which were approved by UNICEF
PCO during the inception stage (refer to Appendix 12 for a complete
list of stakeholders interviewed during KIIs).
Focus Group Discussion (FGDs): The evaluation team conducted
Figure 10: FGD Participants
32 FGDs with mothers, fathers and caregivers of the children enrolled
in the ALP centres and ALP facilitators to understand their opinions
and perceptions at the community level. A total of 300 participants
(130 male and 170 female) participated in group discussions. The
FGDs were conducted using a set of structured questions put into
FGD guides (refer to Appendix 13 for FGD guides) to steer the
discussions. Figure 10 shows the number of participants who
participated from each group category (refer to Appendix 14 for more
details on participants of the FGDs).

3.2.3 Quantitative Methods - ALP Assessment
The evaluation team conducted an observation-based assessment of 16 ALP centres from the same
eight districts where KIIs and FGDs were conducted. Centres were selected randomly from the
designated districts to ensure an equal chance of selection (refer to Appendix 15 for a selected list of
ALP centres). The purpose of these assessments was to ensure compliance with global AE principles
including the functionality of these centres. The checklist was drafted using a set of structured
parameters put into the checklist guides set by the AEWG.74 For the assessment tool refer to Appendix
16.
3.3 Data Consolidation, Processing and Analysis
A parallel mixed-method data analysis approach was employed whereby data from each strand
(qualitative and quantitative) was collected, processed and analysed to draw findings, conclusions and
recommendations.
Qualitative Data Analysis: Analysis utilized content and thematic analysis approach75 using
MaxQDA.76 The process involved: i) transcribing the qualitative data collected through KIIs and FGDs;
ii) compiling and consolidating field notes; iii) coding qualitative data; iv) collating and summarising data
into categories and themes, as deemed necessary to answer evaluation questions and sub-questions.
Quantitative Data Analysis: The evaluation team consolidated all secondary quantitative data
(progress reports, budgets, rolling work plans (RWPs)) and primary data (ALP assessments) to analyse
information on the evaluation parameters (as set in the evaluation matrix) and for triangulation of the
qualitative findings. The quantitative data analysis for ALP centres utilized province wise cross-
tabulation and frequency tables using Microsoft Excel.
3.4 Evaluation Quality Assurance Procedures
AAN has a robust quality assurance system, allowing the project management team to closely monitor
and supervise each evaluation activity. The evaluation team applied the following approaches and
processes for quality assurance of the data collection process.
Training and Pre-testing: The core evaluation team provided comprehensive face to face master
training for KIIs (provincial and district level), FGDs and centre assessment from March 8-9, 2022, at
AAN’s Islamabad office. Following the master training, the national partner organised the enumerator
training from March 11-15 for each province which was remotely observed by the evaluation team and
UNICEF for quality assurance (refer to Appendix 17 for the training agenda). Post-training, the data
collection tools were pre-tested in every province before fieldwork. The collected data was processed
and analysed, and minor language changes were made in the tools based on feedback from
enumerators.
General Quality Assurance: The evaluation team established and maintained strict quality assurance
field protocols. Key implemented measures included the deployment of field supervisors
(accompanying interviews, on-spot checking), dedicated quality assurance staff (random spot-checks),
gender-balanced teams, ensuring voice recordings of KIIs/FGDs, and maintaining close coordination
and communication among all field staff (Appendix 18 offers more details on actions implemented for
quality assurance).
Ethical Clearance: Ethical clearance from relevant external board or panel was not required as per the
evaluation ToR and consultations undertaken with UNICEF PCO during the inception phase of the
evaluation.
3.5 Integration of Gender Equality and Equity into Evaluation
UNICEF’s cross-cutting programming priorities (i.e., human rights-based approaches (HRBA), gender
equality and equity) were considered across all stages of evaluation – formulation of evaluation matrix,
selection of evaluation design and methods, field planning and implementation, analysis, and reporting.
Refer to Table 7 below for the measures taken by the evaluation team to ensure compliance with
UNICEF’s cross-cutting priorities during each stage of the evaluation.

Design Level - The evaluation matrix included a separate section to include specific questions, sub-questions and
indicators on GE, HRBA and Equity.
- The selection of evaluation methods ensured the inclusion or participation of duty-bearers and rights-
holders.
- Stakeholder-specific guides and methods (KIIs and community interviews) were developed and applied.
- Questions were framed to elicit opinions about access to quality education, factors behind low enrolment
and dropout. The evaluation team also explored opinions on innovative strategies adopted to address
these issues, particularly during COVID-19.
- Appropriate capacity-building of all evaluation team members was ensured.
Implementation - Gender balanced teams were deployed for data collection. Female staff were deployed to conduct FGDs
Level and centre assessments for the all-girl ALP centres for compliance with cultural norms.
- To ensure the perspective of both genders is included in evaluation findings, the evaluation team reached
341 participants through KIIs and FGDs (46% were male and 54% were female).
- For FGDs, separate discussions were conducted with mothers and fathers.
Analysis and - Analysis of data was disaggregated by the parameters of gender equality and equity.
Reporting - Distinct coding for gender equality, HRBA and equity was implemented to extract themes.
- The team purposively identified districts which have the highest rate of OOSC to conduct FGDs (with
communities) and do assessments of ALP centres. The synthesis of evaluation findings, conclusions and
recommendations were informed by key considerations above.
3.6 Compliance with UNEG and UNICEF Ethical Norms and Standards
Following is an overview of measures taken to ensure compliance with UNEG77 and UNICEF norms
and ethical standards. Details on compliance to the norms are in Appendix 19a and 19b.
• Independence and Impartiality: The evaluation team members had no conflict of interest and no
role in the implementation of programme activities, and the staff was able to evaluate the
programme without the influence of any outside party.
• Credibility: The evaluation team conducted participatory data collection and triangulated reported
findings using an analysis of evidence from both primary and secondary data sources.
• Utility: UNICEF is committed to publish and disseminate duly quality-assured evaluation reports in
the public domain without undue influence by any party.
• Professionalism: The evaluation team comprises professionals with extensive knowledge, training
and experience working with multiple clients on local and international projects.
• Avoidance of Harm: The evaluation team took requisite measures considering COVID-19
including social distancing, wearing masks and gloves, and use of sanitizer.
• Privacy of Participants: The evaluation sought informed consent from evaluation participants. The
feedback and opinions of the respondents included in the final report are anonymous to maintain
the confidentiality of the respondents.

defined institutionalization targets.
3.8 Evaluation Management, Implementation Phases and Deliverables
This section covers the evaluation management arrangements, evaluation team and functions,
implementation phases and deliverables under each evaluation phase.
3.8.1 Evaluation Management and Oversight
The evaluation is commissioned by UNICEF Pakistan and was supervised by the Research and
Evaluation (R&E) Specialist. UNICEF Pakistan has also formed an ERG which includes members of
key governmental, non-governmental and UNICEF staff. The ERG reviewed and provided feedback on
the content of the deliverables against the approved formative evaluation TOR and the inception report
(especially against its evaluation matrix and questions).
3.8.2 Evaluation Partners, Team, and Roles
AAN Associates worked in partnership with a local research firm Analytics Lab on this evaluation. The
AAN team included evaluation and sector experts, an evaluation project manager, evaluation project
officer, evaluation project associate and data analysts. The team led the design, analysis and reporting
for this evaluation. See Appendix 20 for evaluation team details.
3.8.3 Evaluation Implementation Phases and Deliverables
The evaluation was implemented from December 2021 to September 2022. The evaluation followed a
phased approach with five key phases, i.e., pre-inception, inception, field data collection, data
processing, consolidation and analysis, and reporting and dissemination. Each phase had a series of
activities/tasks (implemented both concurrently and sequentially) and associated deliverables (more
details in Figure 11). The evaluation followed an evolving work plan appended as Appendix 21.

Chapter 4: Evaluation Findings, Analysis and Preliminary
Conclusions
This chapter presents the evaluation findings, analysis and preliminary conclusions. The description
includes key findings drawn from primary and secondary sources for each question (and sub-question)
under each criterion. The evaluation team has attempted to provide findings succinctly while the details,
where required, have been appended as annexures.
In order to make this report meaningful and usable for each province and keeping in view evaluation
expectations, a considered focus is placed on presenting findings separately for each province (barring
the overlapping findings). This is deemed appropriate given the fact that ALP centres and support for
each province is tailored to the needs and provincial priorities. Appendix 2 and 4 provide the provincial
context of NFE and existing ALP models and centres prior to UNICEF support. A summary is presented

4.1 Relevance
EQ1 - To what extent did the supported ALPs incorporate interventions to address the
existing bottlenecks to ALPs (policy, systemic and operational); were aligned to provincial
education stakeholders’ objectives and adapted to the evolving context (particularly during
COVID-19)?
The relevance criterion has one main question and two sub-questions.
EQ1.1: To what extent did the supported ALPs identify and address bottlenecks (policy, systemic and
operational) to ALPs; and to what extent were interventions adaptive (particularly during COVID-19)?
The findings are grouped into two sub-sections, whereby the first section outlines findings around
identification and how/if bottlenecks to ALPs were addressed. The second describes the contextual
evolution and corresponding adaptations made in the design and delivery of provincial ALP centres.
Findings are drawn from primary and secondary data sources.

has also validated these bottlenecks as part of the evaluation (key implementers and service users
were asked to identify the bottlenecks) and found them relevant as they cover the extent of issues
faced by provincial ALP centres. The table below provides a snapshot of bottlenecks faced by ALP
centres, identifies where bottlenecks occurred, and explain s how support to ALP centres aimed to
address them. Refer to Appendix 22 for the detailed matrix.

II. Evolving Context and ALP Adaptations
3. The context for ALP centres remained unchanged from 2016 to 2020. However, after the
emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, all education facilities (including ALP centres) were
closed from March to September 2020 and from November 2020 to February 2021. This was
applicable to all provinces except in KP where ALP centres were allowed to operate under strict
precautionary measures (such as social distancing, use of masks and staggered attendance).
4. Several operational adaptations were made in the support provided to ALP centres across all
provinces. Key measures are mentioned below:84
• Balochistan: The COVID-19 lockdown resulted in
closure of ALP centres. In response, a home-based “To cater to COVID-19, UNICEF provided workbooks to the

backgrounds and had limited access to smartphones
and the internet, which restricted them from accessing
distance learning options. While efforts were made to continue providing access to students
remotely during the pandemic, some key steps were taken to safely reopen ALP centres. These
include standard operating procedures (SOPs) developed for safe reopening of ALP centres in
consultation with Health Department Balochistan and online consultative workshops by the
Department of Literacy and Non-Formal Education.
• KP: ALP centres were allowed to operate under strict precautionary measures. In coordination with
the Elementary & Secondary Education Department (E&SED) and with support from UNICEF’s
School Safety Cell, training of ALP facilitators on COVID-19 prevention and SOPs was
implemented. In addition, UNICEF printed and displayed information, education and communication
(IEC) material with prevention messages in all ALP centres. The centres also operated with reduced
hours which slowed down the pace of course coverage. As a result, ALP centres were allowed one
month of extra time to cover course content.
• Punjab: During the closure of ALP centres, UNICEF provided technical support to the provincial
government to integrate school sanitation and hygiene education, mental health and psycho-social

support in the training material. Additionally, a facilitator training plan was prepared and
implemented which included: training of project directors/managers; training on mental health and
psychosocial support for frontline workers; training of District Education Officers on office and
financial management; training of facilitators on compressed syllabus worksheets to ensure
continuity of learning and assessments during COVID-19; training of facilitators on disaster risk
reduction (DRR); and usage of first aid kits by Rescue 1122 teams. At the community level, most
of the facilitators remained in contact with the students through phone calls and continued with
remote educational activities as the centres were situated in the vicinity of communities.
• Sindh: During the COVID-19 lockdowns, UNICEF provided support to the provincial government
for continuity of learning by printing curriculum-based worksheets so learners could continue to
study at home with the support of their parents. However, long-term closure of the centres delayed
the completion of curriculum. As a response, the Directorate of Literacy and NFE with UNICEF’s
support developed a further condensed curriculum for the timely completion. Training for the
facilitators was informally conducted over WhatsApp due to assembly-related restrictions. High
levels of absenteeism/dropouts were also witnessed in urban slums due to the migration of families
in search of better livelihoods. Engagement and social mobilisation sessions were conducted with
parents in their respective communities to help mitigate absenteeism.
EQ1.2: To what extent did the interventions (supported ALPs) overlap (or otherwise) with those of key
public stakeholders, to what extent were they consistent with the provincial ALP context and to what
extent did interventions manage to draw agreements addressing provincial needs?
The findings are structured into two parts. The first part outlines the alignment between ALP
interventions and provincial sectoral policies. The second part describes the provincial agreements
developed to address ALP needs.
I. Supported ALP Interventions and Alignment with Provincial Sectoral Policies

II. Provincial Agreements Developed to Address ALP needs
5. Literature review shows that provincial education sector plans were developed which laid out the
provincial priorities and plans for the sector. As a response, UNICEF developed RWPs that served
as an agreement with the provincial authorities on UNICEF’s support to the planned activities and
targets for four years (2018-2021) in three provinces (Balochistan, KP and Sindh). In Punjab, the
RWPs were developed on an annual basis.
6. Across all four provinces, targets for NFE (more specifically for provincial ALPs) included: centres
benefitting from ALP interventions; facilitators to be trained, learners to be enrolled; engagement of
school councils and/village education committees through social mobilization; and support provided
to schools and communities for improved health and hygiene practices.
7. Discussions with UNICEF’s provincial offices indicate that the RWPs were developed depending
on the available funding under the country programme document (CPD). For NFE, the provincial
officials undertook a consultative approach where government counterparts were consulted to
identify and agree on priority ALP needs and targets. Government officials (from relevant agencies)
also confirmed participating in consultations for defining scope and targets of ALP interventions in
each province.
Preliminary Conclusions: Relevance
REL 1: The supported ALPs are found to be relevant at multiple levels. First, relevance is evident for the fact that a consultative process
was adopted to understand the provincial dynamics and needs to inform the design. The design is appropriate for addressing the province
specific ALP bottlenecks ranging from: absence of policy frameworks; shortage of ALP facilitators; absence of provincially-approved
condensed ALP curricula; absence of NFE-delivery apparatus; limited school structures; and weak monitoring systems. Limited focus of
provincial governments on vocational training (given the fact a considerable number of OOSC are adolescents) remains a missing link in
the design of ALP centres. Support to ALP centres was adapted due to COVID-19 to enable continuity of ALP centres while reducing the
spread of COVID-19.
REL 2: The evaluation concludes that ALP centres are province specific and overlap with policy priorities, objectives and strategies of each
province (Balochistan NFE Policy 2016-2030; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ESP 2020/2021-2024/25; Punjab Literacy & Non-Formal Basic
Education 2019-2020; and Sindh Non-Formal Education Policy 2017.). This highlights the relevance of support provided to ALP centres
with provincial priorities.
4.2 Coherence
EQ2 To what extent did the supported ALP interventions demonstrate consistency with
recommended programming guidelines for OOSC, harmonized with UNICEF’s internal
OOSC assistance and with other external actors?
The coherence criterion has one key question and two sub-questions.
EQ2.1: To what extent supported ALP interventions are consistent with AEWG principles and to what
extent UNICEF has been able to synchronise them with other UNICEF OOSC interventions?
The findings are divided into two parts: i) consistency of ALP interventions with OOSC standards (AE
principles); ii) internal coherence in terms of harmonisation of ALP interventions with other interventions/
programmes implemented for OOSC by UNICEF.
20
I. Consistency of Supported ALP Interventions with AE Principles
8. Discussions with UNICEF’s head office (in Islamabad) and provincial offices indicate that provincial
ALP centres were not designed in line with any specific guidance/standards for OOSC. This is
primarily because the technical support to the ALP centres started in 2016 while the AE principles
were developed in 2017. During implementation both Balochistan and Sindh offices conducted
workshops to assess compliance of supported ALPs with AEWG principles, however the findings
from these workshops were not utilized to operationalise AEWG principles in implementation. As
indicated in the evaluation design, the evaluation team has conducted a post facto comparison of
the AE principles with the ALPs to trace overlaps and departures at design and operational levels.
9. To make the assessment more objective, the evaluation team has rated provincial ALP centres
against each principle on a scale of relative alignment by applying the following rating criterion (refer
to Figure 12). Desk review and primary data collected as part of the observation of ALP centres,
KIIs and FGDs indicate that the UNICEF-supported ALP interventions were fully or mostly aligned
with the AEWG principles in Balochistan for nine principles (six fully and three mostly aligned);
KP for nine principles (eight fully and one mostly aligned); Punjab for seven principles (four fully
and three mostly aligned); and Sindh for nine principles (five fully and four mostly aligned). Refer to
Appendix 24 for a detailed matrix which includes assessment for each province.
Figure 12: Compliance of Supported ALP Interventions with AE Principles
II. Internal Coherence
10. Discussions with UNICEF’s provincial offices indicate that the support to ALPs are the only targeted
interventions for OOSC (under NFE) in all four provinces.
EQ2.2: To what extent did support extended to ALPs establish/strengthen mechanisms to collaborate
and coordinate with other actors involved in OOSC in each province?
The matrix below outlines the findings on coordination and collaboration on ALP interventions for each
province.
Table 12: External Coherence by the Province
Provinces External Coherence
Balochistan • The DoE is the key entity for implementation and coordination of ALP activities.
• The provincial ALP centres have been implemented with the support of relevant public sector entities. For instance,
curriculum was designed by the BoC; textbooks were provided by the BTBB; facilitator training guides were
developed and trainings to facilitators were delivered by PITE; and assessments were designed and are carried
out by the BAEC.
• A technical working group (TWG) on ALP under the Local Education Group (LEG) is formed for development,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Discussions with stakeholders indicate that coordination for ALP
interventions is frequent where the agenda is to share updates, review progress and work towards standardized
implementation.
• Key stakeholders shared that coordination among partners was useful during the COVID-19 pandemic as weekly
meetings were conducted to discuss measures to reduce dropout rates and develop SOPs for returning students
and facilitators.
• The non-formal education management information system (NFEMIS) developed by JICA (through the Advancing
21
Provinces External Coherence
Quality Alternative Learning Project) tracks enrolled children in NFE centres, eliminating any possibility of double-
counting or duplication of effort.
KP • ALP-PIU (formed during ALP interventions) is the key entity for implementation and coordination of NFE activities.
• The ALP centres have been implemented with the support of relevant public sector entities. For instance, textbooks
and facilitator guides were developed, approved and notified by the DCTE; trainings to facilitators were provided
by the DPD; collaboration was done with the Department of E&SE for advocacy and technical support to draft the
ALP policy; and assessment were designed and carried out by the DCTE.
• Discussions with stakeholders indicate that coordination for ALP interventions is frequent and relevant partners
(UNICEF, ALP-PIU, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), JICA) consult each other before
defining the geographic scope of their interventions.
• Coordination among partners was reportedly frequent but was mostly ad hoc and done on an informal basis.
• UNICEF and UNHCR maintained close collaboration for design and implementation of ALP interventions in KP.
UNICEF provided ALP curricula, teaching material and facilitator guides to UNHCR for 39 home-based girls schools
(HBGS) for Afghan refugee children. Furthermore, UNICEF provided support to UNHCR during COVID-19 in terms
of sharing COVID-19 prevention and safety messages to be used in UNHCR-supported schools.
• A non-formal working group was not operational by March 2022 (at the time of the fieldwork). Although a notification
has been issued for the formation of the group in November 2021.
• The NFEMIS developed by JICA tracks enrolled children in NFE centres, eliminating any possibility of double-
counting or duplication of effort.
Punjab • ALP interventions have been implemented with the support of the L&NFBE Department – the agency responsible
for the implementation of formal and non-formal interventions in the province.
• At the higher level, under the ESP Implementation Grant, a steering committee comprising the Special Education
Department (SED) and L&NFBE exists under the chairman of the Planning and Development Board (PND). The
committee supports formal and non-formal sectors to plan and collaborate education initiatives. At the operational
level, the Programme Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU – in SED) provides day-to-day management and
coordination support. Apart from this, a development partners group (Punjab Education Development Partners
Group) was formed where all development actors interact with the public sector (including SED) for ongoing and
future education programmes.
• Stakeholders expressed their satisfaction with the coordination support available through multiple forums. Frequent
meetings were convened among relevant partners to discuss ongoing challenges and troubleshooting.
• During COVID-19, UNICEF collaborated with SED for development and dissemination of prevention messages and
SOPs to both formal and non-formal schools/centres.
Sindh • The Directorate of Literacy and NFE (under the School Education and Literacy Department) is responsible for policy
and implementation of NFE activities within the province. The Directorate has further formed working groups for
five key components including: i) NFE Policy Development; ii) Strengthening of the Directorate; iii) Curriculum and
Material Development; iv) Facilitator Management; and v) Community Mobilisation and M&E. Discussions with
stakeholders indicate that ALP interventions were implemented with the support of relevant committees.
• In Sindh, ALP interventions were implemented with the support of IRC (the IP) unlike government-led
implementation in other provinces. Discussions with the Sindh provincial office indicate that the IP was needed as
the government required additional technical and human resource support for implementation.
• A non-formal working group exists comprising government agencies (curriculum, training, examination
departments), development partners and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, as per the
discussions with the stakeholders, the group has not convened in the last two years (during COVID-19) and
coordination was reportedly infrequent between partners.
• The NFEMIS developed by JICA tracks enrolled children in NFE centres, eliminating any possibility of double-
counting or duplication of effort.
Preliminary Conclusions: Coherence
COH 1: The support to ALP centres was designed without any specific guidance/standards for OOSC. This is primarily because the
support started in 2016 and the AE principles were developed in 2017. The evaluation team conducted a post facto comparison of AE
principles (developed by the AWEG) with the ALPs to trace overlaps and departures at design and operational levels. Results indicate
ALPs are mostly compliant in Balochistan, KP and Sindh for nine principles (noncompliant with the principle on alignment with the national
education system); and Punjab for seven principles (mostly noncompliant with curriculum component as it is not condensed).
COH 2: The evaluation team found that ALP interventions (implemented between 2016-2021) were the only significant interventions for
OOSC in all provinces. ALP interventions took a systematic approach where the provincial offices worked with the most appropriate
public sector partners for implementation which contributed to the institutionalization of ALP centres. The coordination across provinces
varied: in Sindh the coordination was infrequent while in KP it was informal (but effective), which merits improvement in the coordination
mechanism within these provinces.
4.3 Effectiveness
EQ3: To what extent did supported ALPs manage to achieve intended results (outputs and
outcomes – disaggregated by province) and what factors (internal and external) either
enabled or hindered achievements?
22
The criterion has one key question with three sub-questions. To map achievements, the evaluation
team has assessed progress of ALP centres against two funding streams (JICA and NATCOMM) as
information related to UNICEF RR was not provided. Three indicators were used for analysis: number
of centres established, number of learners enrolled and number of facilitators trained. The evaluation
team has used progress reports for the data on achievements, whereas targets were extracted from
UNICEF’s proposal to JICA and NATCOMM. Since the targets and achievements of ALPs are
cumulative for three years (2018-2020), it is not possible to gauge effectiveness by year. The evaluation
team has also mapped progress against provincial RWPs as part of the evaluation.
This section also covers the unintended results achieved by provincial ALP centres. The second part
of the section outlines enabling and disabling factors which either facilitated or hindered implementation.
The third section provides an overview of the innovative approaches implemented by supported ALPs.
The section ends with assessment on CEval (against four components life course model, organizational
theory, innovation and sustainability) integration in provincial ALP centres.
EQ3.1: To what extent did the supported ALPs manage to achieve intended/unintended results
(disaggregated by province)?
The findings are divided into three sections. The first section presents outcome achievements vis-à-vis
planned outcomes at the donor level (i.e., JICA and NATCOMM). It should be noted that data limitations
around unavailability of annualized targets and achievement pre/during COVID-19 constrained
assessment. Additionally, information on UNICEF RR was not provided to the evaluation team. The
second section lists findings around unintended results (positive, negative, direct and indirect) that
interventions have contributed to.
I. ALPs Effectiveness: Planned vs Achieved Outcomes by Province
This section maps the effectiveness of supported ALPs by presenting planned vs achieved outcomes
at the provincial level set by both donors as well as for the provincial RWPs (refer to Appendix 25 for
the calculation on provincial level achievements and the details on the progress against the provincial
RWPs).
Figure 13: ALP Achievements by Province
Keeping in view evaluation expectations, the achievements for each province are presented separately
with information that illuminates key highlights including comments on pre/during COVID-19
achievements.
Balochistan86
11. The province underachieved its targets as it achieved almost three-fourths of the intended targets
for centres established (198 out of 260) and children enrolled (8257 out of 11000 with 40 per cent
girl learners), while it almost achieved the target for facilitators trained (255 out of 260 with 32 per
cent female facilitators). In terms of gender-specific targets, the province achieved 62 per cent and
87 per cent of the enrolment targets for girl and boy learners, respectively. In addition, it achieved
60 per cent and 139 per cent of the intended female and male facilitators targets, respectively.
12. Desk review and discussions with stakeholders indicate that the province overachieved its target in
the last reporting period (2019), however with the impacts of COVID-19 on the education sector,
the results fell below the target. For instance, drop-out remained a challenge for supported ALPs
86 JICA and UNICEF, ‘Formal Progress and Utilization Report Sept 2020 and 2021’.
23
as reportedly 2423 (boys: 63 per cent and girls: 37 per cent) dropped out in 2021 due to loss of
interest, economic migration and poverty.
13. As for the province’s performance against the Balochistan RWP, the province has partially achieved
one target (8,257 out of 15,000 learners benefitting from ALPs) and fully achieved the other (53 out
of 53 children provided with access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services in
schools). The targets for the remaining three indicators were not set.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
14. The supported ALPs started in 2019 and the centres were operationalised by November 2020. The
delay in initiating activities is attributed to the absence of NFE-delivery apparatus and lack of an
NFE policy framework. To kick-start the supported ALPs, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was
formed under the ESED, with technical and financial support provided by UNICEF. Furthermore,
the initial plan was to open the ALP centres in April 2020, however, due to COVID-19 and
associated lockdown in the province, the opening of centres was delayed by a few months to ensure
uninterrupted learning for ALP learners. According to desk review and discussions with
stakeholders, KP utilized this time to conduct the standards-based written tests of potential
candidates already identified to serve as ALP facilitators and a final list of the facilitators was
prepared. This was followed by orientation, identification of centre locations, development of a
training plan, procurement of supplies and development of books and training manuals to mitigate
the risk of losing extra time once the schools re-opened.
15. The province has fully achieved the intended targets
for establishment of centres (230 out of 230), children “The training is outstanding, but it has few days. If the
training days will be added that will guide teachers
enrolled (6406 out of 6450 with 82 per cent girl
properly.” – ALP Facilitator on efficacy of trainings
learners), and facilitators trained (230 out of 230 with “ALP centre is very reliable especially for girl students and
84 per cent female facilitators). In terms of gender- my daughter was provided with each and everything like
specific targets, the province achieved 120 per cent books and stationery.” – Mother of ALP student
and 55 per cent of the enrolment targets for girl and
boy learners, respectively. In addition, it achieved 111 per cent and 66 per cent of the intended
targets for female and male facilitators, respectively.
16. ALP centres were not closed during the COVID-19 lockdown and remained operational with
enforcement of requisite safety measures. These measures included: flexible hours, division of
learners into two to three smaller groups attending school on alternate days, and adherence to
SOPs on handwashing, wearing facemasks and maintaining a safe distance. Meanwhile, Health
and Hygiene Committee members comprising students were mobilized by ALP PIU field teams to
ensure frequent handwashing by their peers and to check personal hygiene.87 Volunteer Network
Forum (VNF) members, comprising ALP facilitators, parents of learners and community elders,
were regularly briefed on SOPs and provided support ALP facilitators in observing them.
17. The province’s performance against the KP’a RWP shows that the province fully achieved one
indicator (380 out of 380 facilitators trained) and partially achieved the other (3480 out of 4500
adolescent learners accessing ALPs and receiving life skills basic education trainings). However,
targets for three indicators were not set and therefore have not been assessed.
Punjab
18. The province managed to overachieve targets in two of the three intended results: centre
establishment (240 instead of 80), children enrolled (16347 instead of 6000 with 49 per cent girl
learners), and training of facilitators (480 instead of 80). The potential reasons for these
overachievements include: use of government buildings as ALP centres (eliminating the need to
find space) and high pupil to teacher ratio as compared to other provinces (almost 50-60 learners88
in an ALP centre compared to 30 in others).
19. The L&NFBE Department closed all centres in March 2020, as required by the GoP in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. During COVID-19, UNICEF played a key role in supporting the L&NFBE
Department to roll out mental health and psychosocial support (MH&PSS) guides and SOPs
for safe reopening of schools. Online trainings were provided on MH&PSS and SOPs to support
the safe return of key department staff (77 in total) responsible for the 240 supported ALP centres
for children.89 In addition, the supported ALPs included wide dissemination of IEC materials to all
stakeholders, including parents and facilitators along with the provision of basic WASH supplies
and learning kits to keep the learning momentum ongoing during closures. As per the discussion
with UNICEF’s provincial office, only 2 per cent (in 240 centres) of students dropped out during

school closures. This low number could be attributed to proximity of facilitators to learners as they
were from same communities as the children.
20. As for the province’s performance against the provincial RWPs, the province has fully achieved four
out of five intended targets (number of facilitators trained, number of adolescent learners accessing
ALPs and receiving life skills basic education trainings, number of learners benefitting from ALPs
and number of children provided with access to basic WASH services). However, for one indicator,
a target was not set (number of ALPs provided with COVID-19 relevant supplies) and therefore was
not assessed.
Sindh
21. The province underachieved on targets. Only two-thirds of the intended targets for centres
established (230 out of 350), children enrolled (6757 out of 10500 with 59 per cent girl learners)
and facilitators trained (230 out of 350 with 64 per cent female facilitators) were achieved. Based
on discussions with stakeholders, one of the reasons to explain underachievement is limited
capacity of government stakeholders to implement supported ALP interventions. In terms of gender-
specific targets, the province achieved 67 per cent and 61 per cent of the enrolment targets for girl
and boy learners, respectively. In addition, it achieved 70 per cent and 59 per cent of the intended
targets for female and male facilitators, respectively.
22. Desk review and discussions with stakeholders indicate that the centres remained closed during
COVID-19. To mitigate learning losses, ALP learners were provided subject-based worksheets
through VEC members. To support a safe return to school, ALP interventions included development
of safe school reopening guides as well as IEC materials on COVID-19 prevention messages,
including posters and flyers. Some centres were also provided with critical supplies such as thermal
guns, soap, safe disposal bins and disinfectant sprays.90
23. The province’s performance against the provincial RWPs shows that Sindh has fully achieved three
out of five intended results (number of facilitators trained, number of adolescent learners accessing
ALPs and receiving life skills basic education trainings and number of learners benefitting from
ALPs). However, for two indicators (number of ALPs provided with COVID-19 relevant supplies and
number of children provided with access to basic WASH services), targets were not set and
therefore have not been assessed.
II. Unintended results (positive, negative, direct and indirect)
24. Find below the list of unintended results that supported ALPs have contributed to. These are
primarily drawn from interviews with stakeholders in the field, including both service providers and
beneficiary groups. The readers may note that these are mostly positive.
• Enrolled Children Acting as Agents/Champions of Change: Based on reports made during
FGDs, it appears that children have started to bring what they are learning at ALP centres home to
their families. Respondents of FGDs (mostly mothers) referred to children emphasizing the
importance of personal hygiene as a protection against COVID-19. Precautionary measures shared
with children at school were disseminated to their family members which influenced families to take
note and introduce household level precautionary measures.

data to back up this finding, it is a significant positive
unintended result of ALP interventions, even if it is only a perceived change.
• ALP Centres Promoting Inclusion: In Balochistan and KP, the records indicate ALP centres have
opened doors to Afghan refugee children, who face challenges enrolling in formal schools for lack
of documentation (such as birth certificates). Similarly, in several communities, ALP centres have
enabled access to education for disabled children, who often face discrimination at formal schools.
In light of the above, it could be argued that ALP centres are promoting inclusion by offering a

EQ3.2: What factors either enabled or hindered achievements, particularly COVID-19?
Find below a matrix that outlines factors which either facilitated or hindered the implementation and
achievements of intended results. These findings are based on both secondary and primary data
sources.

of ALP interventions. For instance, where implementation in Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab started in 2016, in
KP implementation was pushed back to late 2020 (as a result of lacking institutional
delivery apparatus).
Community-based approaches (by The ALP model focused on cultivating community ownership (through formation of
forming community groups) enabled community groups) proved useful in terms of engaging communities to identify facilitators,

communities and generated parental interest in enrolling children.

Recruitment and retention of qualified The identification of qualified facilitators came up as a challenge in several communities,
facilitators. especially in remote locations. This limitation was mitigated by lowering the requisite skill
set and qualification for selection of facilitators in certain communities. Where this enabled
centres to find facilitators, it may have affected the technical capacity of the facilitators to
deliver ALP interventions.
Heavy reliance on financial support from ALP interventions were primarily funded by UNICEF, JICA and NATCOMM and provincial
development partners. governments’ financial contribution was limited. This not only resulted in limited scale of
implementation (for instance, in Punjab, only 240 centres were established), but also
jeopardizes the sustainability of these interventions.
Closure of ALP centres due to COVID-19. COVID-19 restrictions posed challenges for ALP centres. The risk of dropout was
perceived as a biggest challenge across provinces. For example, in Balochistan 2,423
learners dropped out in 2021. The use of technology/operational adaption to continue
teaching/learning activity during COVID-19 was partially successful.
EQ3.3: To what extent did the supported ALPs encourage/enable innovation (around diffusion model)
and how did it relate to provincial policies?
The evaluation team did not find a documented definition of innovation from desk review. The evaluation
team defined innovation as any activity from the ALP life cycle that was planned and implemented
differently (meaning unconventionally) and resulted in saving time and cost to deliver the same/better
results. Additionally, the evaluation team has used the following definition for diffusion: “Diffusion of
Innovation originated in communication to explain how, over time, an idea or product gains momentum
and diffuses (or spreads) through a specific population or social system.”91 In other words, how different
innovative approaches/interventions were disseminated across provinces. The findings are structured
into two parts i.e., innovation and policy encouragement and innovation in practice.
I. Innovation and Policy Encouragement
Find below key findings around innovation as a policy priority for NFE across provinces, for details refer
to Appendix 26.
91 Behavioral Change Models, ‘Diffusion of Innovation Theory’, <https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/sb/behavioralchangetheories/behavioralchangetheories4.html>.
26
25. Balochistan NFE Policy 2016-2030 and Balochistan ESP 2020-2025: The ESP lays adequate
focus on innovation. For instance, the strategies call for innovation in planning and delivery of
services as per the local conditions. There are strategies that underline options for schooling
through the internet, television and radio to the extent these media exist in Balochistan (refer to
pages 58, 82 and 114 of the ESP policy for reference). The NFE policy does not include any
reference to innovation.
26. Sindh NFE Policy 2017: The policy lays focus on innovation. The objectives underline the need
for innovation whilst recognising that education sector objectives, and NFBE in particular, cannot
be met by continuing with business as usual. Furthermore, the policy focuses on innovation that
uses information communication technologies (ICTs) (refer to page 21 of the policy for reference).
27. KP ESP 2020-25: The plan underlines and makes specific references to leveraging innovation for
OOCS – in particular for enrolment and creation of cadres of teachers (refer to pages 12, 39 and
52-53 of the policy for reference).
28. Punjab L&NFBE 2019 and Punjab ESP 2019/2020 - 2023/2024: The Punjab ESP highlights the
use of innovation to offer NFE services. The NFE plan is does not reference use of innovation to
support OOSC.
II. Innovation in Practice
29. Find below consolidated findings on different sets of innovative activities planned and implemented
across provinces. The description highlights the results of such innovations:
• Supportive Supervision for Facilitators: All provinces introduced mentoring/coaching of
facilitators through a cadre of field monitors/mentors, who were tasked with providing on-the-job
support (mentoring) to help facilitators to adapt and improvise teaching/learning materials and
techniques to enable them deliver on their roles. In KP, monthly professional development (PD)
days were introduced as an innovation. During PD days, ALP facilitators and mentors met to discuss
progress and ongoing and upcoming challenges. This allowed cross-ALP learning and an
opportunity for course correction. Across provinces, the practice has emerged as good practice and
an innovation with useful results.
• Use of madrassa/government centres as ALP centres: ALP remained innovative in selection of
ALP sites, such as use of madrassas (Balochistan and KP) and formal secondary schools (Punjab)
to facilitate ALP centres.
• Learning Assessment through Technology: Punjab has introduced technology for learning
assessment of NFE learners. The technology used is called the Literacy Assessment Drive (LAD),
which enables quick and error free learning assessment, and consolidates assessment as feedback
to the facilitator. As ALP centres were co-located, the application was used in both ALP and
government supported centres
• Remote Learning and Use of Family Members for Continuation of Learning Activities:
Balochistan introduced use of remote learning by sharing learning content based videos via
WhatsApp groups with families of learners so they could continue to learn whilst centres are closed
because of COVID-19. It provided an alternative to centre-based learning, however remained less
effective due to issues of internet connectivity. Sindh introduced home-based student work sheets,
printed and shared with parents/learners to continue using them from home (whilst centres were
closed during COVID-19) and facilitators made themselves available to guide parents/caregivers
on how to keep learners involved.
30. The documentation of these innovations remains weak. Similarly, the evaluation team did not find
evidence of UNICEF convening regular cross-province meetings for knowledge and learning
exchange and replication of good practices across provinces.
III. Compliance of CEval in ALP Interventions
Keeping in view the evaluation objectives, this section offers an overview of how implementation of
supported ALP centres complies with CEval standards i.e., life course model, organizational theory,
innovative theory and sustainability approach. The Center for Evaluation (CEval)92 is a research and
training consulting institute, based in Germany. The four approaches have been consolidated into a
framework called CEval. The following section outlines key findings and conclusions around
consistency of implementation with CEval.
Note: The readers may see overlaps with multiple OECD-DAC criteria e.g., effectiveness, sustainability
and others.

Component 1: Life-Course Model93
31. The life course of a programme can be divided into three main phases: the planning and
implementation phases occur during programming and the sustainability phase follows termination
of funding. The following visuals (one for two provinces) outline key events that occurred in each
province from 2016 - 2021.

32. An innovation is understood to mean any form of new development (refer to Figure 16).
Programmes/interventions diffuse innovations in and through organizations by communicating
innovation through various channels over time among the members of a social system. The key
findings around innovation are as below:

the end of the period in which the
measures were funded (refer to Figure
17). To determine the sustainability of
a programme/intervention four
dimensions have been identified:
durability; range of impacts or the
benefits of a programme/intervention;
change in the system in which the
innovation was introduced; and ability
of a system or provider to adapt to
changing context in a flexible and
appropriate way. The key findings
around sustainability are as below:
34. Across all provinces the ALPs have
facilitated standardization of curricula;
recruitment and training of facilitators;
oversight and supportive supervision; and to an extent, monitoring and reporting management. With
these achievements, supported ALPs have been relatively less successful in securing public funds
for long-term continuity of ALPs. Discussions with the KP, Punjab and Sindh UNICEF offices
indicate that they are in the process of seeking financial allocations through PC 1. However, at the
time of fieldwork for this evaluation, this has not been finalised and/or approved.
Preliminary Conclusions: Effectiveness
EFF 1: To map achievements, the evaluation team has assessed progress of ALP centres against two funding streams (JICA and
NATCOMM). The effectiveness measurement was constrained due to data limitations stemming from lack of non-annualized targets (all
outcomes were set cumulatively for three years i.e., 2018-2020); reporting inconsistencies across outcomes and years; and lack of
information on results achieved through UNICEF RR. The evaluation team made efforts to use the available data to offer perspectives on
effectiveness of UNICEF’s support by assessing achievements at the provincial level.
EFF 2: The evaluation team has used three indicators for effectiveness measurement by comparing achievements with planned results
(i.e., number of centres established, number of learners enrolled, and number of facilitators trained). The results for provinces vary across
three indicators. In terms of relative effectiveness, Punjab and KP managed to fully achieve intended targets. However, Balochistan and
Sindh lag behind (Balochistan managed to achieve three-fourths of the intended targets and Sindh achieved only two-thirds of the targets).
COVID-19 derailed implementation across three provinces, whereas KP kept the centres open. The provinces planned and implemented
several mitigation measures to stem COVID-19-driven dropouts and loss of learning for the enrolled learners.
EFF 3: The supported ALPs contributed to producing several unintended results. The most significant ones include: enrolled children
acting as agents/champions of change (as they disseminated messages around COVID-19 protection); by learning mathematics the

30
learners are helping parents with accounts management; parents are delaying marriage decisions for girls to let them complete learning;
and ALP centres promoting inclusion by enrolling learners with disabilities and those from refugees families (noted in Balochistan and KP).
EFF 4: The ALP achievements were enabled by several factors. The most significant ones include: availability of institutional structures
and provincial policies/plans resulting in immediate and smooth implementation; use of community-based approaches fostering community
ownership of ALP centres; improved accessibility of ALPs (due to being based in the community); flexible hours; and locally recruited
facilitators resulting in winning over parents’ trust, accelerated enrolments and wider acceptance within the community. The disabling
factors that hindered achievements include: unavailability of qualified facilitators (especially in hard-to-reach communities); reliance on
financial support from development partners (affected the scale of implementation and jeopardizes sustainability); and COVID-19-driven
disruptions in teaching and learning activities and dropouts.
EFF 5: There is a considered focus on innovation as a policy priority across other provinces. However, the policy documents are silent on
incentivizing innovation. The supported ALPs managed to demonstrate innovation such as: supportive supervision for facilitators; use of
madrassa/government centres as ALP centres; and learning assessment through use of technology (LAD application). COVID-19
accelerated use of remote learning tools/applications, were proven effective with limited focus on documentation and dissemination for
adoption by other provinces.
4.4 Efficiency
EQ 4: To what extent did supported ALPs manage to achieve results within available time,
costs and human resources, and how did COVID-19 affect efficiency?
The efficiency criterion has one key question with one sub-question. It should be noted that efficiency
analysis faced data constraints since only cumulative budget allocations and utilization information (for
all four provinces) was provided to the evaluation team, thus limiting province level analysis. In addition,
NATCOMM progress and budget information for 2021 was not provided to the evaluation team. The
evaluation team has made efforts to do a usable analysis based on available information.
EQ4.1: Did supported ALPs manage to achieve intended results (outputs/outcomes) within available
funds, time and human resources and how did COVID-19 affect efficiency?
The findings below are divided into the following sub-sections: i) efficiency of achieved results vs time
and funds; ii) cost efficiency implementation modalities; iii) average cost per learner; and iv) COVID-19
impact on resource availability. Limited number of indicators are reported in the progress reports (as
highlighted in the effectiveness section) which constrained a comprehensive efficiency analysis.
I. Results Achieved within Allocated Time and Funds
35. The evaluation team has used progress reports to consolidate the achievements of supported ALPs
from 2018-2021100 for all provinces. Only three performance indicators are used for the analysis
i.e., enrolment of learners; centres established; and facilitators recruited/trained (the same
performance indicators used to analyse effectiveness).
36. Findings indicate that the Figure 18: Cumulative Results Achieved
supported ALPs managed to
exceed the planned targets for two
indicators and missed one by a
slight margin. For instance,
cumulatively supported ALPs
managed to enrol 37,767
learners against the target of
33,950101 (achievement rate
stands at 111 per cent) and
recruited/train 1,195 facilitators
against the target of 920
(achievement rate stands at 130
per cent). However, it managed to
establish 898 ALP centres (against
the target of 920), thus achieved 98 per cent of planned results. The reported performance data
indicates that the supported ALPs were successful in achieving the set targets, despite rollout
delays (in KP) or school closures during COVID-19 (for all three provinces except in KP). This is
partially explained by the fact that the intended targets did not change, and a no-cost extension was
sought from JICA and NATCOMM (for almost two years from both donors) to complete planned
activities.
100 Progress information for 2016-2018 was not available to the evaluation team.
101 JICA and NATCOMM, ‘Progress and Utilization Report 2021’.
31
37. The supported ALPs spent US$5.6 million out of the allocated budget of US$8.1 million102 (it
should be noted that the evaluation team did not have access to any information on funds spent by
UNICEF RR or a breakdown of provincial budgets/utilization). Cumulative funds utilization (JICA
and NATCOMM) remained at 68 per cent (from August 2018 to August 2021 for JICA and January
2018 to December 2020 for NATCOMM). Considering that the supported ALPs managed to exceed
the targets for two indicators (learners enrolled and facilitators trained) and almost achieved the
third indicator (centres established) without completely using the allocated budget, raises questions
as to whether budgeting was realistic. One plausible explanation for the underutilized budget is the
shift to virtual implementation and/or suspension of some activities due to COVID-19.
38. Discussions with stakeholders indicate that the supplies (furniture, Menstrual Hygiene Management
(MHM kits), stationery, soap) were adequate and distributed in a timely way to ALP centres.
Facilitators (interviewed as part of the evaluation) also expressed satisfaction with the quality of
supplies provided by UNICEF.
II. Cost Efficient Implementation Modalities
39. Discussions with stakeholders suggest that the following implementation modalities may have been
cost efficient. However, due to limited financial information shared, the evaluation team is unable
to determine the exact amount of money saved by implementing these modalities.
• Government buildings, madrassas or facilitators’ home as ALP centres: In all four provinces,
supported ALPs were established in government buildings (Balochistan: 8; KP: 165; Punjab: 240),
madrassas or facilitators’ homes. This modality helped in saving costs usually needed for setting
up the centres.
• Community-based facilitators: Engaging community-based facilitators in all four provinces not
only helped in obtaining the trust of parents/caregivers, but it also reduced commuting costs for
students. Additionally, the compensation paid to facilitators was less than the teachers in the formal
education system.
• Joint trainings of teachers (of Quaid-e-Azam Academy for Educational Development) and
L&NFBE facilitators: In Punjab, joint teacher trainings were planned and delivered for NFE
teachers and ALP facilitators as the curriculum is similar for both systems. The joint teacher
trainings helped in reducing costs that would have occurred if delivered separately.
• Use of existing NFE delivery apparatus: The supported ALPs relied on existing provincial
government human resources and NFE institutions to develop the ALP curriculum, assessments,
textbooks, etc. which potentially helped in saving costs.
III. Cost per Learner
40. The evaluation team has compared the annual cost per student/learner (utilized funds per
year/number of enrolled learners) enrolled in an ALP centre from 2018-2020. The cost has
significantly increased from US$38 (2018) to US$94 (2020).103 The evaluation team was unable to
find any contributory reasons (except in KP) behind the increase in the cost (by almost 2.5 times)
within two years. As per UNICEF’s KP provincial office, the increase in facilitator fees from PKR
16,000/month to PKR 22,000/month (to align with the government minimum wage policy) partially
contributed to increase in cost/learner. However, as majority of ALP centres were closed in 2020 in
Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh (due to COVID-19
Figure 19: Comparison of Cost/Learner
related restrictions) the increase in costs requires
further exploration.
41. The evaluation team also compared the annual
cost/student enrolled in primary school (in the
formal system) vs NFE sector. It was noted that for
formal schools, the annual cost was at US$173104
(in 2018), whereas in NFE schools, the cost/child
was US$49.105 ALP centres are efficient if the
costs incurred in 2018 (US$38) are compared with
formal/NFE schools. However, the gradual
increase in the cost/learner makes ALP centres
less efficient. This merits further exploration to
understand whether budgeting/utilization for
102 US$3.4 million from JICA and US$4.6 million from NATCOMM.

provincial ALP centres is realistic and aligned with industry standards. Refer to Appendix 27 for
calculations.
IV. COVID-19 Impact on Resources Availability
42. Discussions with UNICEF and government counterparts reflect that COVID-19 did not have an
effect on the disbursement of funds, human resources and materials/stationary.
Preliminary Conclusions: Efficiency
ECY 1: The measurement of efficiency remains incomplete due to data limitations. The budgets are cumulative hence constrained province
specific efficiency analysis. Similarly, outcome-based allocations are missing, and expenditures data is unavailable for all years.
ECY 2: Based on available information, the supported ALPs appear efficient for achieving three key indicators. For two indicators (i.e.,
learner enrolment and training of facilitators), the supported ALPs exceeded targets and for the third (centres established), the targets are
almost achieved. The supported ALPs have achieved these results whilst using 68 per cent of allocated funds hinting at over-costing.
ECY 3: The costs/learner for a year compared from 2018 to 2020 indicate that the costs have increased in the past two years (from USD$38
in 2018 to USD$93 in 2020). Where most of the ALP centres were closed in 2020, the exponential increase in cost/leaner needs further
exploration. The evaluation team also conducted a comparison for the cost/learner in formal vs NFE sector vs ALP centres. The supported
ALPs are efficient if the costs incurred in 2018 (USD$38) are compared with these two. However, the gradual increase in the cost/learner
makes ALP centres less efficient.
ECY 4: The stakeholders suggested that COVID-19 related closures resulted in longer time for learners to complete the package. However,
none referred to COVID-19 having any effect on the availability of resources (human, funds, material).
4.5 Impact
EQ5 - To what extent did supported ALPs contribute to improved enabling environment
(norms, systems and budgets) and the lives of OOSC across provinces?
This criterion has one key evaluation question and two sub-questions. It should be noted that supported
ALPs have not been implemented long enough to enable measurement of long-term change. For
instance, supported ALPs in KP were implemented in late 2020. To overcome this, the evaluation team
has disaggregated impact level results into the following categories i.e., i) policy environment; ii)
curriculum; iii) recruitment and training of facilitators; iv) provincial budgets; v) certification process and
reintegration mechanisms; v) impact on OOSC and their families.
EQ5.1: To what extent did supported ALPs contribute to improved enabling environment for provincial,
public-sector actors involved in ALP services i.e., norms, systems and budgets?
EQ5.2: To what extent did the ALP interventions contribute to improved lives of OOSC in target areas?
For evident overlaps the findings for two sub-questions (5.1 and 5.2) are merged.
43. Impact on Policy Environment: The results vary across provinces depending on the availability
of policy frameworks before the supported ALPs were introduced. For instance, Balochistan had
NFE Policy 2016-2030, hence no major contributions were made. However, the other three
provinces benefited from supported ALPs to help frame NFE policy frameworks. In KP, approval is
pending on the (draft) NFE Policy (2020) and Punjab and Sindh have approved NFE Policy 2019
and NFE Policy 2017, respectively. The formulation of NFE policy frameworks contributes to
defining provincial priorities and offering a guided framework for development partners to implement
NFE activities.
44. Impact on Uniform Curriculum: The supported ALPs benefited three provinces (Balochistan, KP
and Sindh) for curricula development. Punjab continues to use the same curricula for ALPs as is
used in the formal sector. The contribution to uniformity of curricula is crucial to ensure consistency
and standardization of learning material for both ongoing and future support to ALPs.
45. Impact on Facilitator Recruitment and Training Materials: Across all provinces, significant
contributions were made in this area. The standardization of training materials will enable relevant
stakeholders to train the facilitators (new and current) for both ongoing and future ALPs.
• In Balochistan, ALP collaborated with the PITE to develop training modules for facilitators to teach
ALP curricula.
• For KP, both recruitment criterion and selection process were introduced. Moreover, the supported
ALPs contributed to the development of multiple training guides (by engaging with DPD) during
2020 and 2021. These include: i) Facilitator’s Handbook for General Pedagogy; ii) Facilitator’s
Handbook for Packages A, B, and C for ALP Primary; and iii) Facilitator’s Handbook for Package
D and E for ALP Elementary.
• In Punjab, facilitator guides were prepared and introduced through the supported ALPs.
• For Sindh, the supported ALPs enabled preparing a pool of 45 master trainers (25 women) who
were jointly trained by IRC (IP) and Directorate of Literacy and NFE on NFE training manuals and
33
facilitator guides. The training of NFE facilitators on the Facilitator’s Handbook for Package A, B
and C was conducted at the beginning of each package with periodic refreshers.
46. Impact on Public Sector Allocations for NFE: The supported ALPs so far have been funded
exclusively by donors (UNICEF RR,106 JICA and NATCOMM). This remains an area where limited
impact is noted in terms of provincial governments allocating additional funds for NFE. Punjab and
KP government representatives shared that they have plans to take over the costs of ALP centres
and for that they have drafted PC-1. Sindh has a budget of PKR600 million, however, funds have
not been fully released as of the time of fieldwork. Balochistan plans to fund future interventions
through potential funding from the European Union (EU). Continued advocacy will be critical to
ensure public sector allocations are made for the continuation of support to ALP centres.
47. Impact on Examination, Certification & Reintegration of OOSC in Formal Schools: The
supported ALPs have contributed to setting up an assessment and certification system which can
potentially enable learners to transition into the formal education system. One limitation with
reintegration of ALP learners into formal schools is lack of availability of formal schools in target
communities. In addition, as individual child tracking is not done, the percentages mentioned below
for mainstreamed children may be underreported and should be read with caution. Province-
specific results are mentioned below:
• In Balochistan, supported ALPs (with JICA and BAEC) developed the ALP Assessment Framework
and trained ALP facilitators on student assessment. Moreover, the system was formalized and a
notification was given for the equivalency of the corresponding level of ALP for transition and
mainstreaming of ALP learners into formal schools. As a resultant, 13 per cent (1081 out of 8257)
of the total number of children enrolled in ALPs were mainstreamed into formal schools.107 Lack of
access to formal schools in target communities reportedly hindered learners’ reintegration to the
formal education system.
• For KP, three-tiered assessment (i.e., pre, formative and final assessments) is being carried out.
Where the pre and final assessments are undertaken by the DCTE, the formative assessment is
undertaken by the facilitators. The supported ALPs have facilitated approval of an ‘Equivalency
Framework’ which is incorporated in the Assessment Mechanism for Certification of Learners at
various levels. It is both part of the concept note for PIU and draft NFE policy. Out of the total
number of children enrolled, 3 per cent (218 out of 6406) successfully reintegrated into the formal
education system.108 Lack of access to formal schools in target communities reportedly hindered
learners’ reintegration into the formal education system.
• Similarly for Punjab, considerable work has been done around examination, certification and
reintegration. A customized application (LAD) was developed for learning assessments where
formative assessments are undertaken on a monthly basis by the facilitators to gauge the quality
of teaching. The certification system has been updated whereby those who have completed ALP
Package C (equivalent to Grade 5), are offered certificates and can potentially proceed to the formal
education sector. Out of approximately 16,000 learners enrolled in ALP centres, only 400 have
mainstreamed so far (2.5 per cent of the total).109 One plausible reason given by the stakeholders
for this low number is that many learners are over-age, which hinders reintegration into the formal
education system.
• For Sindh, an assessment system was developed by DCAR where after completion of Package C,
a certificate (equivalent to Grade 5) is issued by the Directorate of Literacy and NFE to the learner
for reintegration into the formal sector. For Sindh, the evaluation team does not have information
on the number of students mainstreamed out of 6757 enrolled learners.
48. Impact on Lives of OOSC/Learners: Across
provinces, qualitative discussions with community “In KP, whether it is south or north, early marriages is still
a norm. However, when the children, especially the girls,
members indicate that parents are more receptive to
get admission to the centres, it delays their marriages due

validate this finding.

Preliminary Conclusions: Impact
IMP 1: Supported ALPs have not been implemented long enough to allow measurement of long-term change. Instead, the evaluation
team has used immediate to medium level results/outcomes as impact comprising the following factors: policy environment; curriculum;
facilitator recruitment and training; provincial budgets; certification process and reintegration mechanisms; and impact on OOSC and their
families.
IMP 2: The most significant impact is noted around standardization of teaching and learning materials (including curricula, facilitator
training materials), examination, certification and reintegration systems. More specifically, the supported ALPs contributed to framing of
NFE policies for KP, Punjab and Sindh, and synthetization of curricula in Balochistan, KP and Sindh. The advocacy to make provincial
governments allocate public funds did not make much headway and merits continued advocacy and engagement with government
counterparts. Reintegration rates vary, for example Balochistan managed to mainstream 13.1 per cent; KP 3.4 per cent; and Punjab 2.5
per cent.
IMP 3: The evaluation concludes varied impact on OOSC. The most significant impacts include parents being more receptive to letting
children resume education; improved numeracy and communication skills in learners; inclusion of disabled and refugee children in
supported ALPs; and perceived impact on delayed marriages for children.
4.6 Sustainability
EQ6 To what extent supported ALPs may be sustainable with respect to strengthening
provincial/local ownership and advocacy to mainstream ALP models? What measures are
needed to enable continuity to run ALPs during/post COVID-19?
The sustainability criterion has one key question and two sub-questions.
EQ6.1: To what extent supported ALPs may be sustainable with respect to strengthening
provincial/local ownership and advocacy to mainstream ALP models?
The following section is divided into three parts: i) best practices/benefits replicated in other provinces;
ii) provincial government ownership to mainstream ALP models and associated risks for sustainability;
iii) community ownership to continue ALP interventions and associated risks for sustainability. The
findings have been consolidated for all provinces.

and adaptations.
II. Provincial Government Ownership to Mainstream ALP Models
51. UNICEF’s support to ALPs was not driven by clear guidelines on how it will responsibly discontinue
its assistance to provincial governments. Desk review and discussions with stakeholders indicate
that across all four provinces, the provincial governments have demonstrated ownership and
commitment to mainstream the supported ALPs. The provincial governments have contributed by
providing space for ALP centres (Balochistan: 8; KP: 165; Punjab: 240);110 providing textbooks and
human resources (deployed in relevant agencies); approving condensed curriculum and facilitator
training guides (except in Punjab which is using the single national curriculum); and certifying ALP
learners (for acceptance in the formal education system).
52. While the provincial governments have demonstrated commitment and ownership, there are
several risks associated with mainstreaming ALP centres. Firstly, timely release of committed funds
would determine the continuity of supported ALPs and as of March 2022 (at the time of fieldwork),
funds had not been released in any province (KP, Punjab and Sindh). Secondly, frequent transfer

ALPs to 20 districts (from 11 districts).
III. Community Ownership to Continue Supported ALPs
54. Communities in Balochistan and KP have contributed to supported ALPs by providing space
(Balochistan: 112 centres and KP: 215 centres) and facilitators for the ALP centres. All centres in
Punjab are government-owned and data for Sindh has not been provided. Volunteer forums111 were
formed through supported ALPs consisting of 7-8 community members who were also responsible
for day-to-day management and social mobilisation activities in their respective communities. It was
noted that these forums were also used as feedback mechanisms between parents and ALP
management.
55. Discussions with community members (parents, community influencers and facilitators) indicate
that communities are committed to continue supporting ALPs. However, respondents highlighted
the risk of not raising sufficient funds for the continuity of the delivery of supported ALPs.
EQ6.2: What measures are needed to enable continuity to ALPs during/post COVID-19?
This question is addressed under Recommendations Section 5.3.
Preliminary Conclusions: Sustainability
SUS 1: The evaluation team noted an absence of clear guidelines on how UNICEF will responsibly discontinue its assistance to provincial
governments. Moreover, there should be considered attention to promoting cross provincial learning and replication.
SUS 2: There is evident interest and willingness from provincial governments to continue and replicate the support provided to the ALPs
by approving NFE policies (except in KP), standardisation of curriculum and training material, and provision of textbooks and space for
ALP centres. However, the successes may fade if the committed public sector allocations are not materialised. There is expressed interest
from communities to see continuation of ALP centres, but they are not ready to fully fund them.
4.7 HRBA, Gender Equality and Equity
EQ7 - To what extent did design, implementation and monitoring of supported ALPs
integrate UNICEF programming priorities i.e., human rights-based programming (child
rights), gender equality and equity?
To demonstrate a concerted focus on evaluating integration (in terms of the ALP design and
implementation) of cross cutting priorities (for UNICEF), a separate criterion has been added which
includes assessment of HRBA, gender equality and equity. There is one key question with three sub-
questions, one each for the three cross-cutting priorities.
EQ7.1: To what extent did ALP integrate and produce results as per the HRBA principles?
This section brings together findings and analysis around supported ALPs’ compliance with the
HRBA112 principles (i.e., Participation, Accountability, Non-Discrimination and Equality, Empowerment
and Legality (often referred to as PANEL)). The findings are corroborated by both secondary and
primary data.
I. Integration of HRBA in Design and Implementation of Supported ALPs
Following is the evaluation team’s assessment on supported ALPs’ (consolidated for all provinces)
compliance with key HRBA principles.

Committees in Sindh.

36
Table 15: Supported ALPs’ Compliance with HRBA principles
HRBA Principles Findings and Evaluation Team’s Assessment
Participation113 The design and implementation of supported ALPs remained inclusive. Firstly, a consultative process was
undertaken with government counterparts to determine provincial priorities and needs. Secondly, the
implementation process was participatory with expertise of relevant government agencies acquired to develop
curriculum and training guides, deliver trainings to facilitators, develop assessment framework, etc. Lastly,
community-led interventions (social mobilization, formation of committees, local facilitators, execution of ALP
maintenance, etc.) included community members who directly contributed to the implementation of supported
ALPs.
Accountability114 The document review does not point to an ALP-led community feedback and/or a grievance management
system. Nevertheless, discussions with community members indicate that the feedback was shared through
committees: Parent-Teacher School Management Committees (PTSMCs) in Balochistan; learning mobilizers
(LMs) in Punjab; VNF in KP; and IRC’s field monitors in Sindh. However, the evaluation team did not find any
documentation of the feedback received and/or addressed by the supported ALPs in any of the provinces.
Non- The supported ALPs remained largely non-discriminatory (did not discriminate based on identity factors) as
discrimination and children from all religious, ethnic and cultural backgrounds had equal opportunity for enrolment in ALP centres.
Equality115 Discussions with community members (influencers, parents, facilitators) indicate that the supported ALPs were
inclusive and similar opportunities were available for refugee and disabled children. Most importantly, free of
cost education with distribution of books and stationery enabled children from economically disadvantaged
households to enrol in ALP centres.
Empowerment116 The supported ALPs enabled improved knowledge and awareness among community members on the
importance of education and has empowered them (parents mostly) to send their children to ALP centres. The
community-led structures (including local selection of facilitators and committees formed in each province) have
created ownership and empowered communities to plan and address issues/challenges arising in the ALP
centres.
Legality117 The supported ALPs are aligned with legality principle as they are compliant with the Constitution of Pakistan
(1973) and national policies including the National Education Policy (2009) and National Education Policy
Framework (2018). There is also evident alignment with the provincial sectoral policies (Balochistan NFE Policy
2016-2030; Balochistan ESP 2020-2025; Punjab L&NFBE 2019-2020; Punjab ESP 2019/20-2023/2024; Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa ESP 2020/21-2024/25; Sindh Non-Formal Education Policy 2017; and School ESP and Roadmap
for Sindh (2019-2024).
EQ7.2: To what extent did supported ALPs manage to assess/identify, integrate (in terms of strategies
and resources), and produce equitable gender results?
This description presents key findings around the integration of gender equality at design and
implementation levels. A light touch analysis of the integration of UN System-wide Action Plan (UN-
SWAP) on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women (GEEW),118 has been incorporated.
II. Integration of Gender Equality in Supported ALPs
This sub-section highlights how gender was incorporated in the supported ALPs and includes
viewpoints on how they have benefited both genders. Findings have been consolidated for all four
provinces.

breaches occur.
115 Non-discrimination and Equality: All individuals are entitled to their rights without discrimination of any kind. All types of discrimination should be prohibited, prevented and
eliminated.
116 Empowerment: Everyone is entitled to claim and exercise their rights. Individuals and communities need to understand their rights and participate in the development of
policies which affect their lives.
117 Legality: Approaches should be in line with the legal rights set out in domestic and international laws.

• Flexible hours were provided to enable male and female learners (who were mostly working in the
morning) to attend ALP centres.
• ALP centres were established in target communities to enable girls to access education at their
doorstep. The proximity of ALP centres to households addressed the fears parents had in sending
their children (especially girls) to formal schools.
• In order to sustain the regular attendance of adolescent girls, complementary activities on MHM for
young adolescent girls were integrated into ALPs. In addition, play-based learning (including sports
activities) was conducted for children to build a sense of agency. These integrated efforts attempted
to address social norms and encourage girls to continue their studies.
• In KP, female facilitators were recruited to comply with cultural norms and practices within the
province.
Results
59. Results for two indicators (reported to JICA and Figure 20: Gender-disaggregated Results
NATCOMM) are indicated in the adjacent visual.
About 72 per cent of the total facilitators trained
and employed were female, creating employment
opportunities for women in target communities.
Similarly, 56 per cent of the learners enrolled were

60. The evaluation team has reviewed the ALP results
(JICA and NATCOMM) to assess if the design
incorporated gender equality principles as per the UN-SWAP 2.0.119 There are 17 indicators broadly
divided under results-based management: oversight; accountability; human and financial
resources; capacity; and knowledge, communication and coherence. Of the six indicators that the
evaluation team assessed, the supported ALPs are compliant with three and non-compliant with
the remaining three. Refer to Appendix 28 which includes gender equality indicators and the
evaluation team’s assessment of the supported ALPs’ compliance and non-compliance with those
indicators.
EQ7.3: To what extent did supported ALPs manage to identify, integrate (in terms of results, strategies
and resources) and produce equitable results in particular for vulnerable groups?
This description presents key findings around the integration of equity at design, implementation and
results.
III. Integration of Equity in supported ALPs
This sub-section informs whether the supported ALP were aligned with equity principles and includes a
discussion on how they have benefited vulnerable populations.

areas in all four provinces.
Preliminary Conclusions: HRBA, GE and Equity
HRBA 1: The supported ALPs are mostly consistent with the HRBA principles of participation (engagement of duty-bearers and rights-
holders during design and implementation), non-discrimination and equality (supported ALPs were equally available for all target
beneficiaries), empowerment (by enabling access to education in OOSC leading to perceived sense of empowerment in learners for
reintegration with the formal sector) and legality (compliant with local laws and provincial sectoral policies and plans). It is partially compliant
with accountability principles due to lack of feedback and grievance management systems in supported ALPs.
GE 1: The supported ALPs are found to be mostly compliant with gender equality principles. Although a structured gender assessment
was not conducted in any province, the implementation is assessed as gender responsive as both parents (male and female) were
sensitised on the importance of education; flexible hours enabled male learners to attend ALP centres (important for those who work in
the morning); establishment of ALP centres in target communities enabled girls to access education at their doorstep; provision of MHM
kits for young adolescent girls to address social norms; and selection of female facilitators to comply with cultural norms. There are positive
results as most of the facilitators engaged were female (creating employment opportunities for women in target communities) and almost
half of the enrolled learners were girls.
EQY 1: The supported ALPs were found to be partially compliant with equity principles. The design was not based on any equity
assessment. The geographical targeting of districts to set up ALP centres was, however, based on equity parameters including
disadvantaged, underserved, crises-affected and/or hard-to-access populations. Implementation focused on including vulnerable groups
by including children from economically poor households or were discriminated due to their age and/or identity factors (such as ethnicity,
religion, nationality, disability). The ALP reports do not offer disaggregated results on equity parameters for the evaluation team to offer
any commentary on them. However, discussions with community members indicate inclusion of vulnerable and marginalized children,
including disabled and refugee children.

Conclusions,
Lessons Learnt and
Recommendations
40
Chapter 5: Conclusions, Lessons Learnt and Recommendations
The chapter comprises three sections, i.e., evaluation conclusions, lessons learnt and
recommendations. The first section lists evaluation conclusions drawn from the findings and preliminary
conclusions listed in Chapter 4. The second section outlines the key lessons learnt (including good
practices), framed as such to highlight the potential for replication across sectors and similar contexts.
The last section lists evaluation recommendations to inform future provincial ALP institutionalization
and support for continuity of ALP centres.
5.1 Conclusions
The evaluation conclusions are based on the evaluation findings and preliminary conclusions. At the
request of UNICEF provincial offices the evaluation team has drafted province specific conclusions.
This is done with the view to enable UNICEF provincial offices to present/share evaluation conclusions
(including recommendations – also tagged for provinces) to have more meaningful discussions on
future engagement with provincial stakeholders. Conclusions are framed using a four-dimensional lens
(i.e., learners, facilitators, programme management and alignment to provincial policy priorities). The
conclusions underscore strengths and limitations of the supported ALPs (in both design and
implementation). Moreover, insights and analysis are added to enable provincial stakeholders (including
UNICEF) to chart future engagement.
Balochistan: The ALP model is appropriate for a province like Balochistan which is spread out and
sparsely populated, and where one in every two school age children is out of school.120 Key strengths
of the provincial model for learners include: learners benefitting from unified/approved condensed
curricula; free of cost learning; accessible centres; inclusion of Afghan refugees, girls and children with
disabilities; provision of recreational and MHM kits; and the COVID-19 learner package (to avoid
disruption in learning activities). Moreover, there has been a considered focus to enrol girls, with
approximately 80 per cent of centres being either exclusively for girls or offering co-education. A
significant number of learners dropped out because of COVID-19 and family migration, which may
require mitigation measures in future planning. Learner-centric future interventions must focus on
continuity/upscaling of ALPs whilst factoring continuity of education during emergencies; focus on girl
learners; tracking mainstreamed learners and assessment and scale-up of existing vocational ALP
pilots.
UNICEF’s assistance has helped to standardise both recruitment of facilitators and post-training
supportive supervision; and to develop and deliver training and teaching guides. Hiring and deployment
of local facilitators helped with mobilising communities and higher enrolment of learners. However, the
recruitment of qualified facilitators – particularly female facilitators – remained a challenge (less than
1/3 were female). Future assistance should focus on incentivising recruitment of female facilitators;
post-training mentoring; higher incentives for teachers/facilitators opting to work in hard-to-reach
communities (with no local facilitators); and using madrassa facilitators for madrassa-based ALPs.
Provincial ALPs helped in supporting the institutionalization. The strengths of Provincial ALPs entail:
inclusion of NFE/ALPs into the Balochistan ESP 2020-2025; effective engagement of public sector
partners PITE, BAEC, BoC and DoE; piloting of the technical and vocational education and training
(TVET) ALP; approved ALP curricula; introduction of the learning assessment system; developing and
deploying corresponding facilitator training packages and guides; notification of equivalence for
mainstreaming of learners; and introduction of the HELP package (for continuity of learning). However,
support thus far has missed both enrolment and centre targets (enrolled 8257 against the target of
11000 learners and established 198 centres against the target of 260). In addition, public sector
allocations remained limited. The future must focus on upscaling of ALPs (including TVET) and
increased public sector allocations.
Design and delivery are found to be largely consistent with the Balochistan NFE Policy 2016-2030 and
Balochistan ESP 2020-2025. There is a high level of consistency with AEWG principles, however design
and delivery could be improved by greater focus on: integrating psychosocial well-being and life skills
in ALP curricula; improving ALP WASH facilities; fair and consistent payments to facilitators; and
defining pathways for learners’ mainstreaming and employment.
Punjab: Punjab had an ongoing L&NFBE programme, which helped with immediate adoption of
provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF. This programme was contextually

every four children between the ages of 5-16 years is not enrolled in school).121 The key strengths
around learners include: free of cost learning; accessible centres; flexible timing; and provision of
recreational and MHM kits. The 2020 data indicates a higher proportion of girl learners (56 per cent).
The gaps or weaknesses include: high number of learners per centre (80-100 per centre); low
mainstreaming rates (2.5 per cent); use of formal education curricula (not a condensed or accelerated
one); and absence of a skills component in the ALP curricula. Future assistance needs to prioritise
development of accelerated curricula (and include a skills component); upscaling of ALPs; reduced
numbers of learners per centre; and better tracking of learners who have been mainstreamed.
Recruitment of facilitators for ALPs is the same as recruitment for ongoing NFE programmes and
facilitators are trained on par with formal education sector facilitators. School learning kits (facilitator’s
aids) and training include additional contents/modules on DRR, WASH, first aid, MHM, and mental
health and psychosocial support. The availability of local facilitators helped with accelerated enrolment
and in reassuring parents to send children (in particular girls) to centres. Future interventions should
focus on continuing extensive facilitator trainings and higher incentives for facilitators.
UNICEF supported the institutionalization of ALPs in Punjab. Strengths of supported ALPs include
development of the NFE Policy 2019 through a consultative process with all stakeholders; utilizing the
same partnerships and structures as L&NFBE NFE centres; innovative use of technology (LAD for
learning assessments); and applying notifications and equivalence for mainstreaming learners (2.5 per
cent of learners mainstreamed). The province overachieved the intended results targets: 240 centres
were established (against a target of 80), 16347 children were enrolled (against a target of 6000), and
480 facilitators were trained (against a target of 80). Future assistance must focus on continuing the
use of technology, weekly/monthly monitoring of centres, advocating for upscaling of education and
ALP centres including public sector allocations; adding more indicators in public sector M&E systems
(such as number of learners who dropped out or who were mainstreamed); and continuing to
collaborate with TVET for skill-based cirrculum.
The design and delivery are found to be largely consistent with the Punjab ESP 2019/2020-2023/2024
and the Punjab L&NFBE Policy 2019-2020. Consistency with AEWG principles remains relatively weak
due to the use of a non-accelerated curriculum. Further improvement for the province can be done by
condensing the curriculum and making it age appropriate; improving ALP WASH facilities; ensuring fair
and consistent payments to facilitators; and defining pathways for mainstreaming learners and
employment.
Sindh: Variation in socio-economic status, educational attainment, inequity, high numbers of OOSC
(44 per cent122) across Sindh makes the ALP model appropriate for the province. Key strengths around
learner-centric interventions include: learners benefitting from unified/approved condensed learning
curricula; free of cost learning; accessible centres; inclusion of children with disabilities; provision of
recreational and MHM kits; and COVID-19 learner packages (to avoid disruption in learning activities).
Further improvements can be made by focusing on continuity/upscaling of ALPs; factoring in continuity
of education during emergencies; introduction of vocational curricula for ALPs.
The assistance so far has helped with standardising the recruitment of facilitators (including those for
madrassas); developing and delivering cascaded training and teaching kits; and post-training
supportive supervision (as monthly professional days). The hiring and deployment of local facilitators
enabled the intervention to mobilise communities and enrol a higher number of learners. Future
assistance should focus on post-training mentoring and monitoring mechanisms for facilitators.
Due to lack of technical and human resource capacity, implementation of supported ALPs in Sindh was
led by IRC (a civil society organization (CSO)) rather than the government. Key strengths of the
management include: integrating NFE-MIS into EMIS; notification of equivalence for mainstreaming of
learners; use of approved ALP curricula; and development and deployment of corresponding facilitator
training packages and guides. The government allocated funds for NFE in 2019. However at the time
of field work, the funds had not been fully disbursed. Future assistance must focus on advocating for
upscaling of education and ALP centres including public sector allocations; and placing a considered
focus on continuity of teaching and learning activities (including remote/home-based learning) during
emergencies (to remain effective).

The design and delivery of interventions was found to be aligned with Sindh NFE Policy 2017 and Sindh
ESP 2019-2024. There is consistency with AEWG principles, although this could be improved by
integrating psychosocial well-being and life skills acquisition into the curriculum; improving WASH
facilities; ensuring fair and consistent payments for facilitators; and defining pathways for learners to
access mainstream education and employment.
KP: The ALP model is appropriate as 32 per cent123 of children in the province are out of school with
a higher prevalence of girls being out of school. The Provincial ALPs placed considerable focus on
enrolling girls (82 per cent of total enrolments). Further key strengths include: learners benefitting from
unified/approved condensed learning curricula; free of cost learning; accessible centres; promoting
inclusion by placing ALPs at madrassas and enrolling Afghan refugees, girls and children with
disabilities; and provision of recreational and MHM kits. Moving forward, interventions must focus on
continuity/upscaling of regular and madrassa-based ALPs; factoring in continuity of education during
emergencies; assessment and scaling-up of the TVET ALP pilot.
UNICEF’s assistance has helped with standardising recruitment of facilitators (including those for
madrassas); developing and delivering training and teaching kits; and post training supportive
supervision (as monthly professional days and weekly mentoring visits by Training and Mentoring
Officers (TMOs). The facilitators were locally recruited, and a majority were female – resulting in high
enrolment and acceptance from the community. However, low literacy levels in some areas, made it
difficult to recruit qualified female facilitators. Future assistance must focus on awareness campaigns
to encourage parents to send their children to school, especially girls; incentivising recruitment of female
facilitators; offer higher incentives for teachers/facilitators opting to work in hard-to-reach communities
(with no local facilitators); and using madrassa facilitators for madrassa-based ALPs.
The provincial ALP model was delayed (compared to other provinces) due to unavailability of a delivery
apparatus for NFE. However, UNICEF supported the provincial government to develop the structure (in
the form of PIU) and draft NFE policy for future interventions. Further strengths entail weekly/monthly
monitoring and mentoring of facilitators; approved ALP curricula; introduction of the learning
assessment system; developing and deploying corresponding facilitator training packages and guides;
and notification of equivalence for mainstreaming of learners.
The intervention design and delivery are consistent with KP ESP 2020-2025 and AEWG principles.
However further improvement can be achieved by advocating for approval of NFE policy; integrating
psychosocial well-being and life skills’ acquisition in the curriculum; improving ALP WASH facilities;
ensuring fair and consistent payments to facilitators; and defining pathways for learners to access
mainstream education and employment.
5.2 Lesson Learnt
Find below the key lessons learnt (including good practices) around provincial ALP design and
implementation. The lessons learnt are drawn from both primary and secondary data. These include
the evaluation team’s analysis. Keeping in view the GEROS guidance, these are framed to demonstrate
replicability across similar contexts and other sectors.
1. Post-training coaching/mentoring of the facilitators helped the facilitators to discuss and
seek guidance (from mentors) and to find appropriate/responsive solutions to teaching and
operational bottlenecks. The post-training coaching and mentoring both at structural and process
levels (through placement of TMOs in KP, Learning Mobilizers in Punjab, and Field Monitors in
Sindh), proved useful in lesson planning and delivery and addressed routine operational issues.
This has worked as on-job assistance/support, appreciated by all facilitators who benefited from
this. In KP, providing facilitators with PD days to regularly discuss and seek advice from TMOs
(including the opportunity to discuss issues with fellow facilitators) was identified as good practice.
This remains applicable to both the formal and NFE education and for all those sectors where newly
recruited staff/volunteers are deployed to extend community services. This is also applicable across
contexts.
2. For adolescent learners in particular, the incorporation of skills-based learning is critical to
place them for jobs or self-employment (for those who do not intend to continue beyond
secondary education). This is essential for attracting and retaining interests of adolescent
learners and enabling them to be gainfully employed. The ALP curriculum is mainly focused on
primary/elementary education with very limited incorporation of skills-based learning. Only one

43
province (i.e., Balochistan) has introduced skills-based learning into elementary learning packages
in two pilot ALPs. Similarly, KP has engaged with TEVTA to seek technical advice and support to
incorporate skills learning into ALP curricula. The incorporation of skills-based learning into ALP
curricula is critical for the future and is valid for contexts with huge caseloads of adolescent learners
who should be prepared for skilled employment/self-employment.
3. The policy priorities/actions that deal with complex concepts/practices such as innovation
(for NFE) require simplified elaboration/guidance (whereby concepts are broken down into
practical actions) for planners and implementers to comprehend and put to use. Moreover, it
is critical that innovative practices are documented well and shared widely for others to
benefit: Despite innovation for NFE being a policy priority (in the existing NFE polices and plans),
the provinces did not have adequate guidance around different aspects of innovation in NFE/ALP
setting and what different incentives are attached with it. This has, to a degree, contributed to limited
application of innovation. Moreover, where some innovative models were applied (i.e., supported
supervision for facilitators; madrassa/government schools as ALP centres; technology-based
learning assessments; and promoting family based remote learning), there was limited focus on
documentation and dissemination of innovative ideas for possible replication across provinces. This
is an important lesson for the future – highlighting the need to strengthen capacities for
documentation (within provinces) and evolve/support forums for learning exchange for intra- and
cross-provincial adoption, adaptation and scale-up.
5.3 Recommendations
Find below the evaluation recommendations drawn from the findings and conclusions. The framing of
recommendations has been done keeping in view key actors that have played a part in the design and
implementation of supported ALPs and who will continue to hold significance in the future (e.g.,
provincial governments, UNICEF, JICA and NATCOMM). The structure of this section includes broader
recommendations followed by specific actions (expanding on the ‘what’ and ‘how’). To ease
implementation, each action is tagged to one or more relevant actors (as primary and secondary
stakeholders) considered relevant and responsible to take action. Moreover, each action is prioritized
as either immediate, short-term or medium-term.124 Where applicable, the recommended actions are
referenced to specific preliminary conclusions.
The process of developing recommendations included a series of questions (in each evaluation
instrument or tool) that asked stakeholders (UNICEF, public sector partners, donors and communities)
to understand their experiences and aspirations for the future. Recommendations have benefited from
feedback received on the draft evaluation report from UNICEF and other ERG members.
Recommendations have also benefited from the expertise and experience of the evaluation team.
Keeping in view the expectations of UNICEF provincial offices, the following recommendations have
been grouped as per AEWG categories i.e., learners, facilitators, programme management and
alignment with MoE policies/plans. Moreover, the recommendations have been tagged to the province/s
where these are applicable and are attached as Appendix 29.

and other donor-supported ALPs) and scale-up of NFE/ALPs. This may involve active
engagement with respective planning and development and finance departments to
seek approvals for public funds to implement NFE/ALP institutionalization agenda/plan
(IMP 2, SUS 2);
• Keeping in view the NFE/ALP institutionalization plan (a multi-year plan), the education
and NFE departments should undertake capacity assessment of existing NFE/ALP
management structures at provincial/district levels, and use findings to re-calibrate the
NFE/ALP structures at all levels. Moreover, use the findings to develop a
comprehensive capacity development plan for the re-calibrated structures and seek
assistance for capacity development (SUS 2);
• To attract and retain interest of disadvantaged children – girls, working boys and girls,
children with disabilities, and others, the provincial education and NFE departments in
provinces must explore and collaborate with social protection agencies such as BISP,
social welfare etc. to seek financial and non-financial support for these learners (GE 1,
EQY 1, EFF 3);
• The provincial education and NFE departments should continue to implement the
community mobilisation and engagement as an integrated part of NFE/ALP. The
provincial stakeholders to periodically assess and document the good practices and
challenges around community mobilisation and engagement and disseminate widely
to encourage replication and scale-up (within and across provinces). The evaluation
findings indicate that these processes have been instrumental in accelerating wider
community acceptance (of ALPs) and cultivating ownership of such groups and efforts
(EFF 4, SUS 2);
• The current research, monitoring and evaluation structures and systems merit a critical
re-assessment to enable timely tracking of results and use of monitoring/research data
for decision-making. Some of the recommended actions (provinces to discuss
internally further) include Monitoring and Research Units (at provincial levels); allocate
at least 7 per cent of NFE/ALP resources for monitoring and periodic research; expand
the monitoring/results indicators (add result indicators such as learning assessments,
completion rates, transition and mainstreaming rates, employment of completers,
enrolment numbers on disabled and refugee children etc). For promotion, allocate
funds for research – develop annual research agenda (around gender barriers,
NFE/ALP impact on child marriage, participation in labour market, employability after
ALP completion, develop investment cases for ALPs etc.); form research committees
to supervise and engage academia; think tanks for collaborative research; commission,
publish and disseminate research findings and studies (GE 1, EQY 1, IMP 1);
• Unpack the concept of Innovation for NFE/ALP (a policy priority for which provinces
have only limited understanding) by producing a ‘Guidance Document’. The document
should focus on innovation both in terms of concept and practice around NFE/ALPs –
elaborating what constitutes innovation, scope and scale, funding mechanisms,
documentation, and incentives for inventors and implementers including other aspects.
Some ideas for innovation management: create provincial innovation/challenge funds;
engage with private sector/IT firms/universities to help find innovative solutions (around
remote learning, learning assessments, etc); identify innovation focal points within
provincial NFE/ALPs to steer the process, implement, monitor and document
innovation; organise regular dissemination events to showcase innovative ideas for
intra and inter-provincial scale up (EFF 5);
• For improved compliance to AEWG/AE principles, the education and NFE departments
are recommended to undertake (or hire external third-party entity) normative
assessments to have greater clarity around compliance (and non-compliance) and use
the findings to lay plan for greater coherence with respect to learners, facilitators, ALP
management and coherence with policies and plans. A light touch assessment
undertaken as part of the evaluation has indicated weaknesses and gaps around
promotion of inclusion (equity), gender-sensitivity and protection practices into the ALP
facilitators training materials (COH 1).

• Lay out province-specific assistance plans (in line with the above) and define clearly
the results and actions (impact, outcomes, outputs and others) which should be
reflected in provincial partnership agreements and UNICEF RWPs. Moreover, define
clearly the transition/exit plans, and improve internal budgeting and expenditures
reporting to enable better tracking of cost of completion and cost/benefit calculations
(IMP 1, ECY 1, EFF 1, SUS 1);
• Lend support to the relevant education/NFE stakeholders and explore avenues for
expanded engagement of CSOs, think tanks, academia, private sector in NFE/ALPs
for potential partnership (SUS 1 and SUS 2);
• Partner with relevant provincial actors to commission/undertake periodic research and
assessments to assess processes, map impact and outcome level results of
interventions (at broader level than at present), and do cost efficiency calculations to

• Improve documentation of successes around innovation in NFE/ALPs implemented so
far (e.g., supportive supervision of facilitators; learning assessment through technology
and remote learning) and disseminate them for intra and inter-provincial use,

Formative Evaluation of Provincial ALP Models and Centres
1. PROGRAMME AREA & SPECIFIC PROJECT INVOLVED:

models and centres supported by UNICEF in Pakistan before and during COVID-19 (2016 –
2021) of Federal RWP E-R1
NATURE & PURPOSE OF CONSULTANCY:
Study Documentation Facilitation Technical Evaluation Clerical/Secretarial

1. Background
Since 2016, UNICEF have supported the implementation of a specific education programme,
Accelerated Learning Programme (ALP) for out-of-school children (OOSC), i.e. children who are not
enrolled in primary or secondary education due to poverty, marginalization, conflict, and crisis.
The ALP programme offer out of school children (most of them over primary school age) the
opportunity to complete their primary education in less time than the usual timeframe. Due to the
context in Pakistan, this programme has a special emphasis on enrolling girls and young women.
As per UNICEF definition, Alternative Learning Programme (ALP) is an umbrella term, which includes
a variety of different Non-Formal Education programmes. Their one unifying factor is that they are an
alternative to formal education, that reaches out to children in the 5-16 year old age group who for
different reasons have not been admitted into, or who have subsequently dropped out of the formal
education system, and provides them with a second chance to achieve basic levels of competency
in literacy and numeracy.
According to the latest official statistics, there are around 22.8 million of OOSC in Pakistan
(MoFE&PT, 2018) which amounts to 44 per cent of the total population in this age group. Therefore,
ALP is relevant for the country and constitutes a flagship initiative for UNICEF. Through ALP, it is
expected that graduated participants are enabled to shift into formal education, vocational training,
or employment. Due its importance, different federal policies and legislations focused on OOSC were
issued in Pakistan during the last twenty-five years. The National Education Policy 1998-2010 (MoE,
1998) was the first piece of policy which recognized OOSC as a pending wide-nation problem. This
NEP highlighted that the provision of education to OOSC went through non-formal education (NFE)
schemes (ALP part of them).
The National Education Policy 2009 (MoE, 2009) was the second milestone in terms of policy which
reaffirmed the attention of OOSC through non-formal education programmes. This policy promoted
not just the allocation of more public budget to the attention of OOSC, but strengthening of NFE
alternatives in terms of development of standards, curriculum, accreditation and equivalence
systems, training mechanisms of facilitator s, engagement of international cooperation actors, etc.
The development of ALP for the attention of OOSC demanded the gradual expansion of NFE
modalities in the country. In this way, NFE supplemented formal education especially in rural
contexts where the formal system has limitations in terms of coverage.
48
Based on what entity oversees its management, four categories of ALPs exist in Pakistan: a) Federal
programmes, b) Provincial programmes, c) Non-Governmental Organization programmes and d)
Madrassah programmes. Under the first category, ALP centres are administered by Basic Education
Community School (BECS) and National Commission for Human Development (NCHD). All ALP
centres directed by provincial governments are under the second category. When the administration
is managed by any (national or international) NGO or Civil Society Organization (CSO), it falls under
the third category of ALP centres. The last category corresponds to ALP centres under management
of religious schools.1
In each province, different ALP models and centres have been implemented and UNICEF Education
has supported them through interventions funded by diverse sources: Government of Japan / JICA,
Norwegian National Committee, and UNICEF Regular Resources (RR). Table 1 shows where and
for how long UNICEF have supported provincial ALP models and centres.

As each province has autonomy in terms of structuring governmental sectors and provision of public
services, the specification of UNICEF support to ALP models and centres was shaped by provincial
structures, realities, and needs. It means that there was not a unique manner for institutionalizing
and delivering provincial ALP models and centres. Some general information about programmes
related to specific funding sources is given in the next paragraphs, but it is important to clarify that
this formative evaluation is not focused on any of these interventions.
The main purpose of the programme funded by Government of Japan / JICA (Japanese International
Cooperation Agency) was to provide technical support for enhancing the quality of existing flexible
and age-appropriate and accelerated models in a total of 13 districts in three provinces: Balochistan
(7 districts), KP (3 districts) and Sindh (3 districts). This initiative included the generation of evidence
of cost-effective ALP models which could be used for the upscale and institutionalization of ALP
delivery methods at provincial level.
In the programme funded by the Norwegian National Committee, the purpose was to create access
to accelerated basic education for OOSC and adolescents in the four provinces and to promote
values of resilience, cohesion, trust, and positive interaction. Its geographical scope consisted of 24
remote and crisis affected districts distributed among the four provinces.
ALP interventions funded with UNICEF Regular Resources (RR) during the current country program
spans all four provinces. Direct support is provided through paying salaries of some ALP
department staff (in the case of KP), financing training activities of ALP tutors/ facilitators125,
supporting the development of

was planned for February 2021.

49
accelerated curriculum, etc. Activities supported by UNICEF RR complement investments made by
the Government of Japan / JICA and the Norwegian National Committee or cover unplanned gaps.
A few years ago, the Accelerated Education Working Group (AEWG) was set up by a group of
international actors with the main purpose of strengthening the quality of accelerated education
programming. A harmonized and standardized approach for designing, implementing, monitoring,
and evaluating Accelerated Education Programmes (AEPs) was proposed globally (Myers & Pinnock,
2017).126 Since its start, among other UN agencies and international NGOs, UNICEF has been part
of the AEWG.
After a rigorous process of evidence-based reflection, AEWG proposed 10 Accelerated Education
Principles (AE Principles) and organized its action points in four key dimensions: a) learners, b)
teachers, c) programme management and d) alignment with Ministry of Education (MoE) and policy
frameworks. The mentioned AE Principles stand for aspirational goals which should frame any
intervention focused on accelerating education process. The action points define specific and
operational actions associated to AE Principles. For its implementation, both AE Principles and action
points need to be contextualized. A strategic assumption of this formative evaluation is that ALPs in
Pakistan is a form of AEP.
UNICEF have supported provincial governmental counterparts to institutionalize ALP as a relevant
and functional Non-Formal Education (NFE) modality. To be able to identify hand-on courses of action
for improving its delivery in the future, there is a need to learn how provincial ALP models and centres
supported by UNICEF (thereafter referred to as supported ALPs for simplicity) operated before and
during the COVID-19 pandemic. A formative evaluation, using international evaluation criteria,
standards, and good practices, including mentioned AE Principles and its action points, pre pandemic
and pandemic contexts will provide evidence-based findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
The evaluation will cover the following targeted formative evaluation components: a) the life course
of provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF; b) the (internal and external) changes
that provincial governmental counterparts and UNICEF have experienced during implementation, c)
innovations or new developments implemented by provincial ALP models and centres supported by
UNICEF before and during COVID-19 and d) the established mechanisms/ procedures for its
continuity and improvement during implementation, especially in the context of the pandemic.127
As mentioned previously, this formative evaluation is not focused only on described UNICEF
interventions but goes beyond. It is focused on the institutional experience of provincial counterparts
and UNICEF related to supported ALP models and centres (decisions established, mechanisms set
up, strategies defined, practices implemented, etc.). This formative evaluation does not include the
assessment of a specific theory of change. At the contrary, based on evidence, it is expected to
identify the logic which guided what has been done in each province related to supported ALPs before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Evaluation purposes, aims, objectives and scope
Purposes
It is proposed that the design of this formative evaluation is based on the CEval evaluation approach
(Stockmann, 2013). It means that the expected assessment must integrate the following theories with
some adaptations, including considering pre-pandemic and pandemic contexts: a) life-course model,
b) organization theory, c) innovation theory and d) sustainability approach.128 As described above,
these theories constitute the components of this formative evaluation.
The core of this formative evaluation is to assess to what extent, before and during the COVID-19
pandemic, supported ALPs were functional and what made them successful or unsuccessful. The use
of updated OECD – DAC criteria (assumed as a set of lenses for achieving an holistic approach and
126 These authors recognize that there are some academic discussions on interlinkages and differences among AEP and ALP.
127 These four dimensions are part of CEval evaluation approach which must be applied for developing this assignment. It is expected that any proponent
must critically review the chapter 2 (from pages 93 to 105) of the mentioned text written by Stockmann (2013).
128 These theories will be concretely applied in the formulation of the evaluation questions. The main content of the formative evaluation report must offer
evidence-based answers to them.
50
mentioned EA Principles with its action points (assumed as inspirational goals and specific proposed
activities to be applied) must be used for the proposed evaluation.129
Aims
As this is a formative evaluation, its main aims are insight and development. According to
Stockmann (2013), the first one (insight) implies the production of systematic and thorough
knowledge about the evaluand.130 In this case, it is expected that the evaluation will gather
information, data and evidence about supported ALPs, including data and evidence from before and
during the pandemic.
Expected social enlightenment is possible based on the clear definition of assessment criteria
(Stockmann & Meyer, 2013). This formative evaluation will be delivered using the following OECD –
DAC (2021) evaluation criteria: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and
sustainability.9 It is expected that the mentioned evaluation criteria will interact with AE Principles and
its action points and CEval evaluation approach through the evaluation questions.
The second aim (development) is focused on further progress of provincial ALP models and centres
supported by UNICEF. On one hand, good practices and lessons learned and, on the other hand, gaps,
bottlenecks, and challenges will be |critically analyzed considering pre-pandemic and pandemic
contexts. It is expected to generate lessons learned for the improvement of new stages of current
supported ALPs or future formulation of new support mechanisms (Stockmann, 2013).
Objectives
The proposed general and specific objectives of this formative evaluation are the following:
General:
Assess the performance of provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF during the last
six years (including during COVID-19 pandemic) regarding targeted components (learners, teachers,
programme management and alignment with MoE and policy frameworks), based on gender, equity,
and child rights approaches, CEval evaluation approach and international evaluation criteria,
standards and norms.131
Specifics:
• Analyze what has or has not been working in supported ALPs regarding targeted components
(described in section 3.2) and what multiple and causal factors explains its success or failure before
and during the current pandemic.
• Identify differences and commonalities regarding targeted components among provinces before
and during the pandemic and the reasons behind the differences.
• Examine how gender, equity and child rights approaches have been applied in the targeted
components of supported ALPs before and during COVID-19.
• Explain what evidence-based knowledge can be extracted from supported ALPs in terms of life-
course model, organization theory, innovation theory and sustainability approach covering before
and during COVID-19.
• Based on findings and conclusions related to actual performance of supported ALPs, propose
pragmatic and measurable recommendations for its future improvement considering the pandemic.
Scope:
This formative evaluation will be focused on supported ALPs located in four provinces (Balochistan,
KP, Punjab and Sindh). The term provincial ALP model refers to the way that this NFE modality is
institutionalized in each province. As mentioned above, each province is autonomous in terms of how
to structure and deliver its public services. The term ALP centre refers to the place where this NFE
129 More information on 10 AE Principles and respective action points is available at: https://inee.org/collections/accelerated-education
130 The evaluand is the entity to be evaluated. In this case, the evaluand is the provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF in the last years in
Pakistan. 9 These six evaluation criteria correspond to the updated version of OECD-DAC evaluation criteria done during 2017 – 2019 (opportunity where
the definition of the criteria was revised and one criterium -which most of the time was used in evaluations focused on humanitarian environments- was
included: coherence).
131 The four targeted components mentioned here correspond to the dimensions around which the 10 AE Principles and its correspondents APs are
organized.
51
service is provided. This term alludes to an institutional location managed by a specific (governmental
or non-governmental) organization.
In terms of temporal scope, the period to be covered is from 2016 to present, which means that this
formative evaluation covers part of the previous Country Program (2016 - 2017) and the first four years
of the current one (2018 – 2021) and, includesCOVID-19 implications to provincial ALP models and
centres during last and current year. As mentioned above, this formative evaluation is focused on four
targeted components. The first component refers to aspects related to learners who attend supported
ALPs. The key aspects are learners’ age range; flexibility of class time and location; learning-
readiness for children who has never attended school; compressed curriculum and learning;
inclusiveness and safeness; and access to water and sanitation facilities.
The second component refers to tutors/ facilitators who work in the context of supported ALPs. Some
of the aspects included in this component are tutors/ facilitators’ recruitment, training, support, and
supervision; teaching and learning strategies related to integrated contents; and practice of inclusion,
gender-sensitivity and protection.
Programme management of supported ALPs is the third component. Some of the aspects included are
student enrollment, attendance, dropout, retention, completion, and learning; transition/ integration to
formal education, vocational training and/or employment; community engagement’s mechanisms and
benefits’ sensitization.
The last targeted component is focused on alignment of supported ALPs with Ministry of Education and
policy frameworks. The specific aspects are articulation to federal and provincial enabling environment;
examination and certification processes of basic competencies; and institutionalization of reintegration
mechanisms.
3. Evaluation Framework

continue in the future? What are its requirements in institutional, economic, and financial terms?
How will it be managed in the context of COVID-19?
4. Audience
Assuming the typology of receivers of evaluation results proposed by Mathison (2005), the main
audience of this formative evaluation is, on one hand, UNICEF staff at federal and provincial level
engaged in the provision of technical and financial support and UNICEF staff at the regional level and,
on the other hand, governmental education functionaries and officials at federal and provincial level
responsible for its management and implementation. In the various levels of government, education
officials (policymakers, technical and administrative personnel) responsible for the management,
implementation, and monitoring of ALP centers compose expected users of the formative evaluation
results. They look for objective information about how well ALP models and centres are delivered and
what improvements are needed and possible to implement in the future.
Additionally, designers of accelerated/ condensed curriculum, developers of learning materials,
authorities responsible of training, assessment and data management systems, and facilitators/ tutors
may be included as subaltern audiences of the formative evaluation. Staff members of current funder
institutions (Government of Japan / JICA and Norwegian National Commission) and international
development actors present in Pakistan are part of the audience.
5. Intended use
In the short term, the formative evaluation results are critical to documenting key aspects of supported
ALPs. In the medium and long term, this effort will contribute to federal and provincial institutional
memory of this NFE programme.
Another practical use of the formative evaluation results is to adjust and improve the current supported
ALPs in some key areas: provincial enabling environment, learners’ age range; institutional flexibility;
learners’ enrollment, attendance and completion; compressed curriculum and learning; tutors/
facilitators’ recruitment and training; inclusiveness, safeness and learning-readiness; skills’
assessment and certification; community engagement; etc. It is expected, at the same time, that
formative evaluation results will be used to identify how global standards, trends and practices related
to accelerated education programmes can be adapted and implemented in current and new efforts
around supported ALPs in Pakistan.
The expected use of the formative evaluation results constitutes, as explained by Mathison (2005), the
manner how looked-for findings, conclusions and recommendations will affect effectively what is
evaluated in the future, in this case, provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF in the
country.
6. Stakeholders
To conduct this formative evaluation, the identification and engagement of the appropriate stakeholders
are crucial because, as argued by Brughai & Varvasovszky (2000), their characteristics affect the way
that decisions are made and its content. Stakeholder analysis will be carefully performed.
Friedman & Miles (2006) offers general criteria for the selection of appropriate stakeholders: consider
as stakeholders the groups of people which have an identifiable relationship with the evaluand. The
mentioned relationship could be positive/ negative, in favor or opposing, active/ passive, etc.
Assuming these methodological recommendations in the framework of this formative evaluation of
supported ALPs, the choice of stakeholders would include:
• Designers of provincial ALP models and centres: UNICEF technical staff and provincial education
functionaries and representatives.
55
• Implementers of provincial ALP models and centres: provincial education officials and tutors/
facilitators.
• Users of provincial ALP models and centres: OOSC (children and adolescents, male and female)
enrolled and attending ALP services, parents, and local opinion leaders.
• Funders of provincial ALP models and centres: bilateral donor, national committees, and UNICEF
Pakistan.
7. Evaluation Methodology
As mentioned above, this formative evaluation will be developed assuming CEval evaluation approach.
At the same time, it will apply the use of mixed method and the effective engagement of the
stakeholders described in the earlier section. The method to be implemented for conducting this
assessment must integrate international evaluation norms and standards132 and ethical principles133 as
defined by United Nation Evaluation Group (UNEG, 2020), UNICEF Evaluation Policy (UNICEF,
2018)13and procedure on ethical standards (UNICEF, 2021).
As referred by Mertens (2018), mixed method includes, first, the development of quantitative and
qualitative strategies to collect and analyze information related to the evaluation questions (which
operationalize the evaluation objectives), and second, the combination of the results of those strategies
(usually named as triangulation). The evaluation consulting firm to be selected will collect, produce,
and use primary and secondary data and present the evaluation results (findings, conclusions, and
recommendations). The primary information is formed by the declaration, speech, performance, etc. of
all the (directly and indirectly) stakeholders engaged with supported ALPs. It is expected that, according
to Booth et al (2016), the collection of qualitative information must cover standard questions: who/ what/
when/ where/ how/ why.
In the context of this formative evaluation and considering COVID-19 restrictions, some techniques to
be used for producing the expected primary information are the following: in-depth interview and focus
group which could be delivered face-to-face or remotely (using a specific communication platform). The
evaluation consulting firm to be hired will propose how these qualitative techniques (or other ones) will
be delivered in the context of COVID-19.
The secondary information is composed by all the existent sources of information about provincial ALP
models and centres supported by UNICEF such as project documents, donor reports, rolling-work
plans, monitoring frameworks and reports, interinstitutional agreements, meeting minutes, Country
Office Annual Reports (COARs), Results Assessment Module (RAM), Strategic Management
Questions (SMQs), databases, financial statements, institutional letters, products of consultancies
(studies or surveys), etc. are part of that kind of information. As suggested by Bryman (2016), the
quantitative information to be used and/ or produced must take into consideration key aspects as
measurement, causality, generalization, and replication of the used information.
The following core activities will be completed by the evaluation consulting firm to be selected:
a) Comprehensive desk review: the evaluation consulting firm is expected to analyze key secondary
sources of information (mentioned previously) related to supported ALPs from 2016 onwards. This
critical review must include the current situation of provincial education departments related to NFE
and ALP. In other words, it is expected that the evaluation consulting firm will do background
research (Kara, 2017) on the nature, performance, and results of provincial ALP models and
centres supported by UNICEF.
b) Elaboration and submission of a detailed and thorough inception report: based on the results
of the desk review, it is expected that the evaluation consulting firm produces a complete inception
report (first deliverable), including the following components: a summary of provincial ALP models
and centres supported by UNICEF (including specific and common elements of the logic of the
interventions and assumptions), operationalization of proposed CEval evaluation approach,

limitation of the scope, specification of methodology, elaboration of a final evaluation matrix
(including criteria and questions and sub-questions) and evaluation tools, tentative evaluation
schedule (specifying proposed sequence of activities), definition of the structure, length and
characterization of the formative evaluation report and other expected evaluation deliverables.
More evaluation components could be added to the inception report by the evaluation consulting
firm. Its maximum length must be 20 pages (excluding annexes). This document must be approved
by UNICEF Pakistan.
c) Collection, analysis, and triangulation of evidence related to UNICEF provincial
interventions on ALP: in addition to the desk review and after the approval of the inception report,
the evaluation consulting firm will gather qualitative and quantitative information, aligned to the
evaluation purposes, objectives, evaluation criteria and questions, etc., about the nature,
implementation process and results of supported ALPs.
The collection of information (fieldwork) will be guided by the technical note which guides
evaluation function in the framework of COVID-19 (UNICEF, 2020) following the “no-harm”
principle. The evaluation consulting firm must follow the recommended precautionary measures
using virtual data collection approaches and tools when needed.
The period dedicated to collecting primary information must be aligned to the proposed timeframe
described in the approved inception report. The collection, analysis, and integration of the
information to be collected must be defined based on the evaluation matrix (evaluation criteria and
questions) which is a key part of the mentioned report.
d) Elaboration and submission of a draft version of the formative evaluation report: based on
the triangulation of the collected (quantitative and qualitative) information and according to the
evaluation matrix, the selected evaluation consulting firm will develop the draft version of the
formative evaluation report offering straight forward evidence-based answers to the evaluation
criteria and questions and highlighting evidence about how gender, equity, and child rights
approaches informed or not the design and implementation of supported ALPs.
When developing the report, the evaluation consulting firm must assume the perspective of the
reader: the language to be used must be simple and direct, the arguments must be substantive
and show quality, etc. (Booth et al, 2016). As explained by Gerring (2017), it is expected that this
report will offer arguments characterized by truth, precision, coherence, prudence, relevance, and
commensurability. The structure of the draft version of the formative evaluation report will be the
one proposed and approved in the inception report. The maximum length of this report must be 40
pages (excluding annexes). This document must be submitted to UNICEF Pakistan according to
the approved timeframe. It will be reviewed by the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) set up by
UNICEF Pakistan. Within ten days, the consulting evaluation firm will receive written feedback
which must be assessed and incorporated in the final version of the report.
e) Finalization of formative evaluation report: the final version will include all the feedback received
from the ERG. The structure of the formative evaluation report will be the same one proposed and
approved on the inception report and used in its draft version. As mentioned previously, the
considerations about language and arguments are applicable here. The maximum length of the
final version must be 55 pages (excluding annexes). Its submission must be done according to the
calendar set up in the contract.
f) Facilitation of a public presentation of formative evaluation results: The evaluation consulting
firm must deliver a public presentation of the main findings, conclusions, and recommendations of
the formative evaluation. Depending on the development of COVID – 19, this presentation could
be done face-to-face or remotely. The presentation must include a discussion about the relevance
and feasibility of the proposed recommendations.
It is expected that the draft and final version of the formative evaluation report will include the
identification of the main conceptual, methodological, and operational concerns that the evaluation
consulting firm faced along the assessment process and how those concerns were overcome and
effected the results of the evaluation. The total number of slides must de 15.
8. Ethical considerations
The development of this formative evaluation must apply the ethical considerations promoted by UNEG
(United Nations Evaluation Group) and assumed by UNICEF. As some people will be treated as
sources of information, they must be referred carefully without any specification about their identity
57
(Booth et al, 2016). When any stakeholder is approached for information, full information about the
evaluation and its purposes must be provided (Kara, 2017).
The selected evaluation consulting firm will perform the assignment assuming an ethical conduct which
in this context is crucial for the following reasons: the credibility of the findings, conclusions and
recommendations, and the responsibility in terms of use of resources.
The selected contractors involved in field work are required to undertake ethics training.
The selected evaluation consulting firm must act based on the following obligations: independence,
impartiality, credibility, honesty, integrity, and accountability. If the evaluation consulting firm finds any
conflict of interest in any stage of the assignment, they must inform UNICEF Pakistan at once. The
mentioned ERG will assess, among other things, the compliance of the expected ethical commitments
and quality assurance processes.
9. Structure of the reports and PPT
Inception report
The inception report is the first deliverable prepared and presented by the evaluation consulting firm.
Its content (maximum of 20 pages) must reveal a deeper understanding on the use of CEval evaluation
approach, AE Principles and its action points and gender, equity, and child rights approaches. It must
present a thorough summary of the desk review. It must clearly define the evaluand, focus and scope
of the assignment. It must reconstruct the actual theory of change which supported the interventions.
It must offer a critical analysis of assumptions of the interventions. It must describe the selected
evaluation methodology. It must offer a judgement about the reviewed sources of information (desk
review results) and offer some consideration about the identified limitations. It must describe the
internal process for quality assurance of the deliverables, specifically for the final version of the
formative evaluation report. It must describe the deliverables and timeline of the assignment. It must
include functional annexes and evaluation matrix and tools.
The basic structure of the inception report is the following:
• Introduction (rationale, context, object, and scope of the formative evaluation) Purposes, objectives,
and evaluation criteria and questions (evaluation matrix).
• Main results of the desk review. o Reconstruction of the theory of change of UNICEF provincial
interventions on ALP.
• Analysis of horizontal and vertical logic of the programme and accuracy and functionality of
indicators and sources of information.
• Evaluation methodology (adaptation of CEval evaluation approach, data collection process, data
analysis strategies, evaluation tools, limitations, and challenges).
• Proposed internal quality assurance of the formative evaluation report. o Timeframe and
deliverables.
• Annexes (consulted literature, evaluation tools and TORs).
It is expected that the inception report must receive feedback (including comments and suggestions
from ERG) or approval from UNICEF Pakistan within ten working days after its submission.
Draft and final evaluation report
There is no substantive difference in terms of structure between the draft and final reports. The
difference between them is their length and the accuracy of their content. It is expected that, through
the (draft and final) evaluation report, the evaluation criteria and questions are answered using
evidence. It is expected that the content of the entire document and the level of precision, functionality
and specificity of the findings, conclusions and recommendations are improved from one version to
the other one.
58
The following structure of the (draft and final) evaluation report is based on UNEG, UNICEF and
GEROS (Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System) standards for an excellent quality evaluation
report:134
• Title (1 page).
• Acronyms (1 page).
• Executive summary (5 pages).
• Introduction: including background, evaluand description, and reconstruction of theory of change
of UNICEF provincial interventions on ALP, evaluation purpose, evaluation objectives, evaluation
matrix including criteria and questions, identification of stakeholders and their contributions, etc.
(10 pages).
• Evaluation Purpose, objectives, and scope
• Evaluation methodology, : including evaluation focus, evaluation criteria and questions, design,–
quantitative and qualitative strategies, sampling, data collection methods, and triangulation
integration of cross-cutting areas in the design (e.g. gender), identification of limitations of the
methodology and mitigation strategies, ethical considerations applied, etc. (10 pages).
• Findings: organized by OECD – DAC criteria and covering all the approved evaluation questions,
including summary of findings related to the use of proposed CEval evaluation approach (20
pages).
• Evidence-based conclusions lessons learned, and recommendations explicitly linked to the
findings.
• Annexes. Terms of reference, list of indicators, evaluation matrix, evaluation tools, list of
interviewees, table of sample size, and sample site as appropriate, field work plan, roles and
responsibilities of the team, consent form and other relevant aspects.
It is expected that the draft version of the formative evaluation report will receive feedback and/ or
approval from UNICEF Pakistan within ten working days after its submission. For the final formative
evaluation report, feedback and / or approval will be given within fifteen working days after its
submission as it requires circulation among the members of the ERG.
Presentation of formative evaluation results
The structure of the PPT file must be based on the structure of the final formative evaluation report,
concentrating 60 per cent of the slides on findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Its design
must be simple and attractive, using few words in each slide, avoiding long paragraphs. Its maximum
length must be of 15 slides (which must be presented using around 40 minutes).
10. Management arrangements
This formative evaluation will be managed by the Research and Evaluation (R&E) Specialist (Social
Policy section). Education section will provide, under the guidance of the Chief of the section,
coordination support through Education M&E (Monitoring & Evaluation) Specialist and Education
Specialist in charge of ALP matters. The R&E Specialist will be the authorized focal point for
coordination and discussions related to technical and logistical matters with the selected evaluation
consulting firm. The selected evaluation consulting firm will submit all the deliverables according to
the agreed timeline. The R&E Specialist will circulate among the members of the ERG and compile
their feedback for onwards sharing with the evaluation consulting.
According to existing UNICEF technical notes about the conformation of ERG, UNICEF Pakistan will
set up one related to this formative evaluation. Its members will be key governmental, non-
governmental and UNICEF staff experienced in the object of evaluation. This ERG will review and
provide feedback on the content of the deliverables against approved formative evaluation TORs and
inception report (especially against its evaluation matrix and questions). ERG will make suggestions
for how the deliverables can be improved.
134 Global Evaluation Report Oversight System (GEROS) is a global UNICEF mechanism focused on the quality assessment of evaluation reports uploaded
by any country office to the corporate Evaluation and Research Database (ERDB). Its public link (where its handbook is available) is the following:
https://www.unicef.org/evaldatabase/index_GEROS.html
59
The selected evaluation consulting firm will interact, with the support of UNICEF Pakistan, with relevant
governmental and non-governmental partners at federal and provincial level. This formative evaluation
will not include the direct engagement of children at any stage.
In case of travel restrictions due to measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, the formative evaluation
will be remote / home-based.
11. Evaluation management response
When the final version of the formative evaluation report is approved by UNICEF Pakistan, an
evaluation management response will be drafted by UNICEF Education section, supported by Social
Policy section, based on the evaluation recommendations. The draft version of the management
response will be discussed and assessed with UNICEF management. Its final version will be sent
among Programme Coordination Group (PCG) members and uploaded in Evidence Information
Systems Integration (EISI) database.
The management response will specify to what extent each recommendation is doable and what
specific actions will be taken by UNICEF Pakistan. the response from management will specify the
staff responsible for each action and set a realistic timeline for its delivery.
12. Evaluation results dissemination
Further dissemination of the evaluation results will be made based on the presentation (PPT)
prepared by the evaluation consulting firm, but its content will be adapted according to the nature of
the audience.
A set of key evaluation findings and results will be published on UNICEF Pakistan website. The
Executive
Summary of the formative evaluation report will be edited and circulated electronically among
governmental, non-governmental, academia, media, and international cooperation entities. In all the
cases, the name of the evaluation consulting firm will be referenced.
13. Communication processes
The development of this formative evaluation will imply the establishment of different communication
processes. The first one will have a preparatory purpose. It will be done at the design stage identifying
the need of this assessment among targeted stakeholders and collecting their inputs on its purpose,
use and audience. The second communication process will have the purpose to provide regular
updates regarding the evaluation process. It will be done during the formative evaluation when
milestones (deliverables) are achieved.
Communication channels will be established with the members of the ERG and with the public. The
first one will have a specialized character because the members of the mentioned entity are specialists
on evaluand and/or methodological aspects and their feedback on the deliverables will improve the
quality of its content. The second one will have a social character and through different and regular
means (emails, notes, pictures, etc.) the general audience of the formative evaluation will know the
status of the assessment process and will be able to raise any issue.
The third and final communication process will be performed when the final formative evaluation report
is presented. A public presentation, focused on main results, conclusions, and recommendations, will
be held. This will be an opportunity to confirm the content of the formative evaluation and to discuss
the relevance, validity and use of the proposed recommendations.
REASONS WHY THE ASSIGNMENT CANNOT BE DONE BY A UNICEF STAFF MEMBER:
(Please give specific reasons to justify usage of consultant or Contractor (Individual or Institutional):
This assignment encompasses various and complex areas of work, particularly evaluative thinking
related to governmental legislation (enable environment) and institutional structures on ALP at federal
and provincial level, examination and certification processes of basic competencies, and
institutionalization of reintegration mechanisms. This assignment includes deeper analysis of particular
ALP’s dimensions as learners’ age range; flexibility of class time and location; learning-readiness for
children who has never attended school; compressed curriculum and learning; inclusiveness and
safeness; and access to water and sanitation facilities. At the same time, it is needed critical
examination of tutors/ facilitators’ recruitment, training, support, and supervision; teaching and learning
60
strategies related to integrated contents; and practice of inclusion, gendersensitivity and protection.
Additionally, aspects as student enrollment, attendance, dropout, retention, completion, and learning;
transition/ integration to formal education, vocational training and/or employment; community
engagement’s mechanisms and benefits’ sensitization must be assessed.
As this is a formative evaluation, it is needed to assure the independence of the professionals who will
deliver it. Not all these areas of work fall under UNICEF expertise hence it is important to hire an
institutional contractor with specific expertise to deliver this formative evaluation and, based on its
evidence-based results, propose thorough findings, conclusions and recommendations regarding
provincial ALP models and centres supported by UNICEF in Pakistan.

Appendix 2: Intervention Context around OOSC
Country Context - Pakistan
Pakistan is ranked amongst the top three countries in the world that have the highest number of out-of-
school children. It is crucial to understand that huge socioeconomic disparity exists in Pakistan not only
between rural and urban regions but also between the country’s diverse provinces. Further, these
disparities have a big impact on educational outcomes, including vast gaps in access to education and
overall educational attainment139. Out of School consists of children aged 5-16 years who have never
been to school and those children who attended school and left afterward, shows that out of school
children at the national level is 32 percent in 2019-20140.
The overall regional comparison shows that out-of-school children are higher in rural areas with 37
percent as compared to 22 percent in urban areas. Overall Punjab has the lowest out of School children
with 24 percent while; Baluchistan has the highest out of school children with 47 percent141.

Access to education is right of every child in Pakistan. Legally, Article 25A of the Constitution binds the
state to provide free education and has made education compulsory for all children of the age of 5-16
years.143 In accordance with Article 37-b of the Constitution, Pakistan has pledged to remove illiteracy
within minimum possible time. The Literacy Act 1985144 made literacy mandatory for certain privileges
including employment, driving and arms licenses and passports etc. Pakistan has also ratified several
international and regional conventions which underline the significance of education (see Table 18 for
details).
Table: Pakistan’s Global Commitments on Education
Treaty/Convention Commitment
Universal Declaration Article 26 (1)145: Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least

Development Goals quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning
(SDGs) outcomes
The issue of OOSC is a policy priority for the Government of Pakistan (GoP). It was first taken up in
National Education Policy 1998 which aimed to eradicate illiteracy through formal and informal means
for expansion of basic education through involvement of community. Literacy and non-formal learning
were also an important part of Education Policy 2009149 which focused on adult literacy, non-formal
education (NFE) programmes and development of a national literacy curriculum. National Education
Policy 2017150 reiterates the national commitment to literacy and non-formal education and provides a
detailed framework for non-formal education.

The Government Agenda
The government has initiated various efforts to Box: Policy Frameworks for OOSC
improve access to and quality of education through
- Constitution of Pakistan (Article 37b)
policy interventions and expenditure allocations. In this
- National Education Policy 1998
regard, the National Education Policy Framework has
- National Education Policy (2009)
been formulated to combat the multiple challenges - National Education Policy Framework (2018)
faced by the education sector with the following priority - National Plan of Action on Education for All (2001-
areas: 2015)
- Minimum Standards for Quality Education in Pakistan
Priority 1: Decrease Out of School Children (OOSC) - National Curriculum Framework Pakistan
and Increase School Completion: To address OOSC,
the government proposed key actions related to i) school infrastructure, ii) finance which comprised
removing financial barriers through cash transfers, improving the existing provision of stipends to girls
and improving coordination with the finance departments to ensure efficient and timely transfer and
utilization of education budget, iii) improving teacher and student knowledge, iv) providing free online
education and v) improving access to education in remote areas.
Priority 2: Achieve Uniformity in Education Standards: To ensure uniform education, the government
aims to introduce a uniform education system for all that could ensure equality in quality across the
three systems of schooling in Pakistan, i.e., public, private, and madrassa. This could be achieved
through a selection of a common curriculum framework, streamlining national teaching, and learning
standards, ensuring a multilingual policy, strengthening regulatory bodies to ensure coordination across
the different school systems, and raising awareness about the quality of government school education
through campaigns, reforms and strengthening community action through the dissemination of
educational information.
Priority 3: Improve the Quality of Education: To improve the quality of education, the government
focuses on improving teacher management while ensuring the continuous professional development of
teachers for the purpose of multi-grade teaching, implementing a meritocracy in the teacher's placement
process, ensuring implementation of early childhood education, ensuring the availability of teaching and
learning resources and their utilization in schools and increasing access to information about nutrition
and stunting for mothers and students.
Priority 4: Enhance Access to and Relevance of Skills Training: To enhance access to skill training, the
government promoted public-private partnerships with industry, including setting up industry-led skills
councils, increasing the number of skilled workers in priority areas, strengthening and improving quality
and the institutional framework and introducing a national skills information system to ensure better
student placement and planning.
Intervention - Non-Formal Basic Education151
Non-Formal Basic Education (NFBE) comprises of a number of departments/organizations like Basic
Education Community Schools (BECS), National Commission for Human Development (NCHD),
Punjab Literacy & NFBE Department, Sindh Education and Literacy Department (SELD), Sindh
Education Foundation (SEF), Baluchistan Literacy and NFE Department and Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs). This segment has been a significant feature of policy debates around education
in many countries for three decades. It has drawn attention to the importance and potential of education,
learning, and training that takes place outside recognized educational institutions. Under the second
chance education phenomenon, NFBE provides options in the form of an alternative education model
that is flexible, fast track, and equivalent education. Such models are known as Accelerated Education
Programs (AEPs)/Accelerated Learning Programs (ALPs). These models serve the learning needs of
a specific group of out-of-school children especially those who missed their early school years or
dropped out before completing the primary or elementary education cycle.The NFBE work under
AEP/ALP model, which is one teacher and one room, where the space is generally provided by the
community and is highly inclusive in nature. It addresses diversity by including the excluded especially
refugees, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and those with minor or moderate learning difficulties
151 http://library.aepam.edu.pk/Books/Pakistan%20Education%20Statistics%202017-18.pdf
68
through multi-grade, multi-age, and multi-language teaching and learning approaches. Teachers’
professional qualification is low, but their capacity is enhanced through extensive and enabling in-
service Continuous Professional Development (CDP) programs.
Class timings are flexible and are offered as per the availability of learners in the condensed and
accelerated time frame. The primary model offers a primary cycle in 32-36 months while the elementary
model offers this cycle in 18-24 months including selected skill courses. The assessment and
examination are carried out through authorized assessment bodies for equivalence and valid
certificates, which ensure continuing education and mainstreaming. This model is highly participative
and involves the community in all its operations for sustainability and lasting impact. Considering the
current financial constraints the model is economical. The cost per child per month ranges from Rs.
300-500. Therefore, this model can be adopted to address the issue of out-of-school children with
minimum financial inputs.
There are 35,059 institutions imparting non-formal basic education in the country in the public sector.
Students enrolled in NFBE are 1.425 million with 0.727 million (54%) and 0.699 million (46%) males
and females respectively. There are 33,990 serving teachers, out of which 34 percent are male and 66
percent female teachers.
Provincial Context – Pakistan
The proportion of OOSC varies considerably among and within provinces.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government is spending 28% of their provincial Annual Development Plan
(ADP)152 on education, which is the highest spending on education by any province in Pakistan. Despite
huge investment on education, the sector is struggling to produce adequate results as around 32
percent153 between the ages of 5 and 16 are out-of-schools. Out of the total 32 percent of OOSC, 44%
are girls. There are 2.5 million out of school children in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province including
1.678 million girls and 0.823 boys. A high percentage (82.2%) of the out of school children are between
the ages 10 to 16 years while there are 17.8% out of school children in the province between age 5 to
9 years old154.
Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan (44 percent land area), with an estimated population of
12.3 million155. Most areas are sparsely populated, with an estimated average of 35 persons per square
kilometer156. Effective services delivery in the province remains a remote reality due to a myriad of
operational bottlenecks; notable being access challenges which include: a sparse population
(35persons per Square Kilometer), perennial insecurity, rough and rugged terrain, poor and dilapidated
infrastructure (e.g. roads, schools, health facilities, et cetera), long distances to key service centers
including major markets. Specifically, on education, Baluchistan faces acute limitations in governance,
access, and quality of education, which is evidenced by indicators of alarming scales. Baluchistan has
the highest out-of-school children with 47 percent.
Sindh is the second most populated province in Pakistan with a population of more than 47 million
people (Unpresented Nations and Peoples Organization-UNPO, 2018). The increase in population size
is 60 percent over the period of last ten years. As a result, Sindh has a very young population; more
than 60% of the population of Sindh is estimated to be under the age of 15. Sindh is identified as the
most urbanized area of the country, but the rural areas’ population is almost half—approximately 23
million people of the total population of the province. The education system of Sindh is challenged by
three key bottlenecks including poor access to education, low quality of education, and weak
governance. Teachers’ attendance is low in government schools and there is a dearth of basic facilities
such as boundary walls, separate toilets for girls and boys, electricity, libraries, science labs, etc., in a
large number of schools (SESP&R 2019-2024).

In Sindh province, there are a total number of 46,039 government schools, out of which 41,724 are
primary schools with an enrollment of 3 million (SEMIS Census 2014-15). From a gender perspective,
out of the total enrollment in government schools, the ratio of boys’ enrollment is 63 percent, and the
ratio of girls’ enrollment is only 37 percent. According to the last census report published in 2017, 44
percent157 of children in Sindh are still out of school—the children either have never enrolled in school
or have dropped out of the school after getting enrolled. Looking at the gender disparities, the estimates
say that out of the total number of out-of-school children, 51 percent are the girls158.
The figures regarding out of school children show a dismal picture as from age 6 to 10, there are 13.8
percent of children who have never been enrolled in schools, and the percentage of drop-out is 1.6
percent, however, from the age of 11 to 13, 0.9 children have never been enrolled and drop-outs are
6.8 percent, from age 14 to 16, there are 2.6 children who have never been enrolled and 12.9 percent
who have dropped-out. Looking from the gender perspective, from age 6 to 16, the dropout ratio for
boys was 6 percent while it was slightly high for girls which was 7 percent159. These children have
missed the appropriate time for mainstream schooling due to some demand and supply-side issues.
The demand side issues include; poverty, child labor, as boys support in agriculture fields and/or other
family profession and girls help in household errands and/or taking care of younger siblings. Early child
marriages and child labor is another major issue. Due to poverty, children, especially boys also work
to increase their family earnings., and societal barriers—especially for girls. The supply-side issues
include; dysfunctional schools—closed schools due to lack of school staff or the condition of the school
buildings are declared to be dangerous, functional schools are located 1 to 5 kilometers away from
home, schools lack basic facilities such as boundary walls, iron gate, separate toilets for both boys and
girls, etc. In many schools, there is a lack of appropriate furniture, the teachers are not punctual, or
sometimes once the teacher has retired or transferred, that teacher has not been replaced by another
teacher. Due to these causes, the children have either never enrolled or have dropped out of school.
Although there is an option of private schools in many areas—both urban and rural areas of Sindh due
to poverty, the children are deprived of the facility. Keeping in view the high number of OOSC and
declined rate of literacy, there have been significant efforts taken by the government and non-
government organizations to support the Non-Formal Education as a significant option to accompany
such deprived students in achieving educational targets to address the shortfall of the formal education
system. There are 10,042 NFE centers across the country with 359,633 learners enrolled in these
NFEs. Sindh province has the highest number of 160,433 non-formal students among them 83,364 are
boys, and 77,069 are girls160.
Punjab: More than one-fourth of the total provincial population is of school-going age. 24%161 of children
between the ages of 5-16 are OOSC in Punjab. Most of the 110 million people living in this province
(63.3%) reside in rural areas. While 6.3% of the population in urban areas of Punjab can be considered
poor under the multidimensional index, the incidence soars to 43.7% of the population in rural areas.
The southern districts of the province are more deprived than the central and northern districts. A
breakdown of multi-dimensional poverty highlights that deprivation in education (43%) and living
standards (30.5%) are the major contributors to the multidimensional poverty index in the province.162
There are four major reasons for low enrolment and high dropout levels in Punjab. Two are supply-side:
distance from school and quality of education. Two are demand-led but linked to supply-side
constraints: financial constraints and the low value placed on education. For example, the quality of
schooling is associated with the demand for schooling. Often, low, and late enrolments and high
dropouts in public schools are associated with the perception of low quality of public schooling in
Punjab. Even if parents can enrol their children into school, the low to negligible returns to schooling do
not create an impetus for them to ensure that their children start at the right age, attend regularly,
perform well, and stay on.

The labour market is characterized by a high level of informality, low participation of women in the labor
force, and high levels of youth unemployment and disenfranchising. Investing in women’s education
would produce the highest returns. At 54%, the proportion of the working-age population of Punjab that
is employed is quite low. However, the disaggregation of this average by gender reveals that less than
30% of the women of working age are employed compared to 80% of men. The youth unemployment
rate doubles the overall unemployment rate. Moreover, a large proportion of young people -29%- are
neither in school nor working. For women, the proportion rises to 47%.163

Appendix 4: Provincial Landscape of ALPs
Due to the unavailability of latest data, the information on provincial context and prevalent ALP
structures are from 2014-15.
Baluchistan
Due to a high number of out-of-school children, multiple ALP strategies were introduced under different
Programmes. There were about 633 community-based schools in 32 districts of the province. These
schools catered to almost 26,136 children. These community-based schools were run under the
Baluchistan Education Foundation and the Basic Education Community Schools (BECS). Baluchistan
Education Support Project (BESP) in 2013/14, implemented by the Baluchistan Education Department
with support from UNICEF, introduced the Accelerated Learning Programme in the afternoon shift. This
model has been run in 39 learning centers with a total enrolment of over 2,500 learners. Madrassas are
another platform where religious education is coupled with a non-formal school curriculum. These
madrassas enrolled around 220 boys aged 8-20 years. Azat Foundation has also implemented a
Programme for girls who have dropped out after completing middle school. Azat claims to have
mainstreamed all 175 learners however, this is not verified. National Commission for Human
Development established feeder schools in areas where no government primary school existed within
a 1.5 km radius. NCHD has a sizable presence in Baluchistan, with 440 learning centers catering to
13,295 children in 24 districts of the province.
Regardless of these ALP strategies; Baluchistan continues to face several challenges in the educational
sector. Some of them are mentioned as follows:
Effective services delivery in the province remains a remote reality due to a myriad of operational
bottlenecks; notable being access challenges which include: a sparse population (35persons per
Square Kilometre), perennial insecurity, rough and rugged terrain, poor and dilapidated infrastructure
(e.g., roads, schools, health facilities, et cetera), long distances to key service centers including major
markets. Large distances between small settlements mean that provision of a school is frequently
unrealistic, without the minimum number of children living nearby. Finding qualified teachers is also
another challenge in such remote areas.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Several strategies/models have been introduced by organizations to cater to the out-of-school situation
especially access for girls in KP. Community-based schools have been introduced in the past for
catering to non-formal education supported/established by Elementary Education Foundation (EEF),
Sarhad Rural Support Program, Khwendo Kor, The International Rescue Committee (IRC), and the
Basic Education Community Schools (BECS). Further, Accelerated Learning Programme models were
run by the National Institute of Rural Management. This project was funded by UNICEF however, no
track of this project was found after 2014. A drop-in centre for the working or street children was another
model introduced by ITA in the Swat district. Other than these, Feeder schools were established by
NCHD (with 105 learning centers catering to 4,100 children) and BRAC (100 non-formal Early
Childhood Education Centers) in more than 24 districts of KP and FATA. Another ALP model for
refugees was introduced in KP by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). IRC runs 74 LCs in KP
and FATA. Madrassas have a great presence in KP. Even though Madrassas are used as a model to
address the issue of out-of-school children, the majority of these madrassas only focus on religious
studies and very few offer basic non-formal education in addition to religious studies.
Even though the aforementioned strategies were implemented in KP prior to 2016, however, 1) there
was no dedicated governmental institutional setup for ALP/NFE within the Elementary & Secondary
Education Department (E&SED). Non-Formal Education lies under the domain of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Foundation (ESEF) (attached organization of E&SED) is only working in service
delivery mode without any regulatory guidelines that set the direction right in areas pertaining to
standards, curricula, teaching & learning materials, and systems for trainings, assessment, and data
management164 and, 2) there was no NFE policy framework in KP prior to 2019165. Furthermore, there
was no centralized system-wide coordination mechanism at the provincial level which means that there
was no data tracking regarding the OOSC because of which data reporting and decision making
regarding NFE intervention remained weak. Another alarming bottleneck identified was the non-
164 Concept Note (KP) - ALP PIU – September 2019 – Final and Notified
165 Education Sector Plan (KP)- 2020-2025
74
availability of approved ALP curricula (primary and elementary) or teaching-learning materials to
support learning prior to 2017/18. 166
Sindh
Prior to 2016, NRSP introduced Girls’ primary classes in the afternoon shift of established schools, they
found villages where there were no primary schools for girls. They signed an MOU with the government
and utilized the building of the government boys’ school to run classes for girls in a second shift. Feeder
schools for girls and boys of primary age group established by NCHD. However, the situation on paper
differs from the on-ground realities. The Provincial government is running only one ALP, the Mobile-
Based Post-Literacy Programme implemented by the Education Department, Reform Support Unit
(RSU) with funding from UNESCO. This Programme targets 15 to 25-year-old females and aims to
develop basic functional literacy skills. The Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), Indus Resource Centre
(IRC) along with PILER established community-based schools where they teach the condensed
curriculum to children who have migrated from conflict-prone areas. Plan International is one of the
biggest organizations working on the Girl’s middle school Programme in Sindh. The Programme has
enrolled around 600 girls. Sindh Radiant Organization is a local NGO that only has its office in
Thatta/Sajawal districts. They run the Secondary School Certificate Project with funding from Ilm-
Ideas/UKAid. SRO has set up 18 centers with 517 girls enrolled in Grades 6 and 7. Also, ITA is running
3 drop-in centers in Karachi, for street working children.
Despite several interventions being implemented in Sindh; the alarming number of OOSC in the
province calls for a realization that previous measures have proven insufficient, and there is a need to
adopt alternate strategies in education. Some of the bottlenecks identified are as follows:
One of the major issues faced in Sindh is the shortage of post-primary schools due to which many
learners especially girls are unable to continue their education. Additionally, a large number of schools
suffer from poor infrastructure or are missing basic facilities167. Prior to 2016, the curriculum was also
not aligned to reflect the priorities of the education sector (formal and NFE); textbooks were not learner-
friendly and lacked alignment with the curriculum168. Natural disasters especially floods create
disruptions in the learning cycles of children both in formal schools and in ALPs. They are the reason
behind the displacement of thousands of children and the destruction of hundreds of schools. The
education sector takes years to recover from these setbacks.
Punjab
To address the problem of out-of-school children, the Literacy & Non-Formal Basic Education
Department is running several mega-projects in the realm of ALP, the main one being the Punjab
Accelerated Functional Literacy Programme. While many of these Programmes are for adults, the ALP
Review study focused on NFBE projects targeting children aged 5-16 years. All LNFBED projects follow
the same basic strategy or model. Several NGOs such as Bunyad Foundation, Hayat Foundation,
UNICEF/IKEA Foundation (through implementation partner NCHD), Adult Basic Education Society
(ABES), Grassroots Organization for Human Development (GODH), and Kawish Foundation, are
contributing effectively to ALPs in Punjab. While most of the accelerated Programmes are for primary
schools, two providers also cater specifically to middle school learners: 1) Kawish Foundation operates
120 LCs catering to 4,000 children in 3 provinces of the country. They run two separate Programmes:
an ALP for primary school children under the banner of Iqra, and a separate program for middle school
children, and 2) NRSP runs a fast-track school program in Vehari District, for girls who have dropped
out after completing the primary cycle. Currently, 280 LCs are functional with 6500 girls studying in
them. Additionally, NCHD has a sizable presence in Punjab, with nearly 2,000 learning centers (feeder
schools) catering to 70,000 children in 17 districts of the province. Feeder schools mainly focus on girls
and boys of primary-going age (preference given to grades 1-3) with a duration of 3 years. Further, ITA
is running drop-in centers in Rawalpindi, for street working children. They have developed their own
curriculum which focuses on basic literacy, hygiene, and life skills. It is a condensed curriculum, divided
into terms of 3-6 months each.
The main challenge faced by Punjab is the limited opportunities available for AEP children to pursue
middle education due to the absence of formal schools in the nearby vicinity as well as engagement in

the labor force, especially for boys. Due to the lack of educational facilities, a large number of children
have either never been enrolled in schools or have dropped out.
Literacy & Non-Formal Basic Education Department requires technical staff to plan and implement
literacy and NFBE Programmes which leads to a coordination gap within the Department. There is no
clear mechanism, nor a statutory platform or regular forum exists for coordination among the L&NFBE
Department, SED, and its field formation or other district-level government institutions, and NGOs
working in the sub-sector. 169 Furthermore, L&NFBE Department also faces challenges because of a
shortage of budget. Instead of increasing the financial resource allocation for the Department, it is
decreasing since 2014-2015 and for the financial year 2019, the situation seems very similar to it was
five years before. 170

Appendix 18: Quality Assurance Measures Implemented
General Quality Control During Fieldwork
The following key measures were implemented to ensure the quality assurance of all the processes
during field data collection; In addition to these measures, the evaluators implemented various safety
and protective protocols (See next section) to ensure that all research participants/respondents and
evaluators themselves are not exposed to any possible risk under COVID-19 pandemic.
- Continued support and supervision: The consultants (both international and national) with
support from the local partner provided support and supervision in the field whenever
necessary.
- Experienced staff was engaged for field data collection.
- Comprehensive training of all the field staff was ensured. The core team trained the master
trainers at regional level, which in turn trained the other staff.
- Gender balanced staff was deployed
- Informed Consent from each respondent was taken by explaining the purpose of their activity
and its relevance to them.
- Collection of Field Evidence of the events was done with prior approval from the concerned
respondents/participants of the KIIs and FGDs.
- Confidentiality and anonymity of the participants was maintained, and findings were
summarized to an appropriate level of aggregation without revealing the identity of
respondents.
Independent (Survey) Quality Monitoring
In addition to the quality control measures mentioned above, the Evaluators identified and deployed a
team of independent field monitors who carried out the following activities:
- Spot-checking: The team performed a spot-checking exercise on 5% of the total sampled
respondents.
- Field Protocols Monitoring: Through its local partner, the Evaluation Team observed all
enumeration teams to check whether the asking of questions, recording of responses and treatment
of respondents is compliant with the standards.
- Accompanying Interview: The field monitors observed fieldwork protocols to ensure that
respondents are selected appropriately, and that the replacement procedure is carried out
according to standards/guidelines. At least 10% of total interviews were observed and supervised
for on-spot counselling to the enumerators to ensure quality data collection.

224 Almost, 36% of the functional schools in Sindh continue to lack boundary walls, 28% washrooms and 42% drinking water, which has a negative impact
on the participation, particularly for girls after primary grades.
225 Among all the functional schools, the data in School Profile 2019 indicates that about 88.4% schools in the system are Primary Schools, while only 6% of
the functional schools offer Middle and Elementary level education. However, 5.6% schools are higher secondary schools.

More rationalization for recruitment and deployment is needed (female and -
specialist facilitators especially in the rural areas as they play a major role
in convincing parents to send their children to schools)228.
Mitigation: UNICEF, with the support of Directorates of Literacy and NFE,
organized a 5-day training of 150 NFE facilitators (95 women) on facilitator
guides for package C, including interactive teaching and play-based
learning methods. UNICEF also provided teaching-learning materials on
package C to both learners and facilitators229.

• Balochistan: The province has partially achieved one target and fully achieved the other. The
targets for remaining three indicators were not set.
• KP: KP has fully achieved one indicator and partially achieved the other. However, targets for three
indicators were not set and therefore have not been assessed.
• Punjab: Punjab has fully achieved the set targets (4 out of 5). However, for one indicator, target

and left-behind children, NFE and ALP Programmes can bridge this
gap and facilitate the provision of education245.
- It is also proposed to develop the NFE Management Information
System (MIS) to maintain details of left-behind children. It is also
suggested that the EMIS is updated on an annual basis through the
conduct of surveys246.
- To provide access to the left-behind children, it is also proposed that
the existing ALP Programmes running in the province and E&SEF’s
community schools Programme should be scaled-up247.
Sindh - Survey of out-of-school children of ages 5 to 16 will be conducted
at the union council and village/town level to determine the numbers
and distribution of these children (across gender, household
income, and geography)248.
- Preferably, no child below the age of 9 will be admitted to a non-
formal education Centre if a regular school is operating and
functional in the vicinity, within a range of 1.0 km249.
Priority Programme focuses on non-formal strategies for children aged
above 9 years, whereas through robust campaigning and involvement
of communities, especially School Management Committees; the
children of Primary School aged 5-9 years will be enrolled in the formal
schooling system250.

service delivery KP - The development of the NFE Management Information System
(MIS) will help maintain details of the OOSC for example, children
who might be at ‘risk’ to drop out or those who have low attendance
rates, etc. The database will help keep track of the OOSC. Over
time this will enable better targeted, more responsive Programmes
for the various target groups listed257.
- The draft Khyber Pakhtunkhwa NFE policy has been developed to
guide the NFE sub-sector in the province. The policy aims to
strengthen the NFE governance structure, financing system, and
mechanism of design and quality delivery of NFE programs in line
with the systems and set up in place for education in the province258.
Innovation in Balochistan Government of Balochistan will review and develop new and equivalent
curriculum curriculum for NFBE, adult literacy and vocational programmes, which
are suitable to the diverse socioeconomic and cultural needs of children,
youth and youth and adults of Balochistan province in partnership with
multiple stakeholders259.
Punjab L&NFBE Department shall develop a literacy curriculum260 and identify
the instructional material, teacher training modules and professional
development programmes to support the curriculum. The curriculum
shall be skill-development driven, so as to facilitate assimilation of
trainees into mainstream economic activity, by imparting skill training as
per local needs and market trends. The material should also contain
contents on safety and protection of children particularly girls, and
women261.
Enhance access to NFE for children and adolescents, youth and adults,
and ensure mainstreaming of children in formal schools 262.
Sindh - Integrated curricula will be prepared for each level (primary and
post-primary) that include learning objectives of regular school
curricula, life skills-based education, and the ability to impart
general skills to improve employability263.
- Skill-based components of the curricula will be developed keeping
in view the relevance to the economy and market needs of a given
district, following defined standards264.

Appendix 29: Provincial Recommendations
This appendix is added based on feedback from UNICEF that recommendations in last chapter are
tagged for AEWG Principles/Components i.e., Learners, Facilitators, Programme Management &

components, appropriate additions are made. Moreover, each recommendation is tagged with
province/s where action/s need to be taken.

Recommendation
e for
The need for parallel mechanisms for OOSC (across all provinces) is evident and merits further strengthening the NFE/ALP
institutionalisation (momentum has already been created under UNICEF supported ALP) and takeover of ALP centres by
provinces. The recommended actions for relevant provincial actors include:
All provinces to critically review and revise the existing NFE/ALP Policy Frameworks Programme All
and lay added focus on implementing systems for continuity of education/learning Management/Alignment with provinces
during emergencies (such as remote teaching and learning). The policy gaps became MoE and Policy Frameworks
more evident during Covid-19, and provinces struggled to come up with effective tools
and mechanisms to enable continuity of teaching and learning (EFF 2);
KP remains the only province where NFE/ALP Policy is not approved yet. The relevant Programme KP only
education authorities must push/lobby (with other actors) to get approval of the draft Management/Alignment with
ALP Policy (2020) (REL 1, SUS 2); MoE and Policy Frameworks
In line with provincial policy priorities (revised preferably), the relevant provincial Programme All
offices should develop Multi-year NFE/ALP Institutionalisation Plans (3-5 years and Management/Alignment with provinces
seek assistance from development partners). The NFE/ALP Institutionalisation Plans MoE and Policy Frameworks
should provide basis for development/revision of PC1s (Balochistan and Sindh to
develop afresh and KP and Punjab to amend where applicable) and seek finances for
institutionalisation including take-over (of UNICEF and other donors supported ALPs)
and scale-up of NFE/ALPs. This may involve active engagement with respective
planning and development and finance departments to seek approvals for public funds
to implement NFE/ALP institutionalisation agenda/plan (IMP 2, SUS 2);
Keeping in view the NFE/ALP Institutionalisation Plan (a multi-year plan), undertake Programme Management All
the capacity assessment of existing NFE/ALP management structures at provinces
provincial/district levels, and use findings to re-calibrate the NFE/ALP structures at all
levels. Moreover, use the findings to develop a comprehensive capacity development
plan for the re-calibrated structures and seek assistance for capacity development
(SUS 2);
To attract and retain interest of disadvantaged children – girls, working boys and girls, Programme Management/ All
children with disability, and others, relevant public stakeholders in provinces must Learners provinces
explore and collaborate with social protection agencies such as BISP, social welfare
etc. to seek financial and non-financial support for these learners (GE 1, EQY 1, EFF
3);
Continue to implement the community mobilisation and engagement as integrated part Programme Management All
of NFE/ALP. The provincial stakeholders to periodically assess and document the provinces
good practices and challenges around community mobilisation and engagement and
disseminate widely to encourage replication and scale-up (within and across
provinces). The evaluation findings indicate that these processes have been
instrumental in accelerating wider community acceptance (of ALPs) and cultivate
ownership of such groups and efforts. Build community capacities for monitoring and
oversight functions by demonstrating trust in social accountability (EFF 4, SUS 2).
The current research, monitoring and evaluation structures and systems merit a Programme Management/ All
critical re-assessment to enable timely tracking of results and use of Learners/ Facilitators provinces
monitoring/research data for decisions making. Some of the recommended actions
(provinces to discuss internally further) include Monitoring and Research Units (at
provincial levels); allocate at least 7% of NFE/ALP resources for monitoring and
periodic research; expand the monitoring/results indicators (add result indicators such
as learning assessments, completion rates, transition and mainstreaming rates,
employment of completers, enrolment numbers on disabled and refugee children etc).
For promotion, allocate funds for research – develop annual research agenda (around
gender barriers, NFE/ALP impact on child marriage, participation in labour market,
employability after ALPs completion, develop investment cases for ALPs etc.), form
research committees/penal to supervise, engage academia and think tanks for
collaborative research, commission, publish and disseminate research findings and
studies (GE 1, EQY 1, IMP 1).

Recommendation
e for
Unpack the concept of Innovation for NFE/ALP (a policy priority for which provinces Programme All
have only limited understanding) by producing a ‘Guidance Document’. The document Management/Alignment with provinces
should be around innovation both in terms of concept and practice around NFE/ALPs MoE and Policy Frameworks
– elaborating what constitutes innovation, scope and scale, funding mechanisms,
documentation, and incentives for inventors and implementers including other
aspects. Some ideas for innovation management: create provincial
innovation/challenge funds; engage with private sector/IT firms/universities to help find
innovative solutions (around remote learning, learning assessments, etc); identify
innovation focal points within provincial NFE/ALP to steer the process, implement,
monitor and document innovation; organise regular dissemination events to showcase
innovative ideas for intra and inter-provincial scale up (EFF 5).
Keeping in view the recent experiences of Covid 19, the provinces are advised to take Programme Management All
proactive approach to use innovative technology solutions to ensure continuity of provinces
teaching and learning activities and avoid possible dropouts. The provinces must
introduce relevant technology solutions and advocate to leverage technology for
access\ and delivery of ALPs such as family/peer led teaching learning methods
(worksheets and others); remote learning (through YouTube/ and TV/Radio) and
others (EFF 5);
For improved compliance to AEWG/AE principles, provinces are recommended to Programme Management All
undertake provincial normative assessments to have greater clarity around provinces
compliance (and non-compliance) and use the findings to lay plan for greater
coherence with respect to learners, facilitators, ALP management and coherence with
policies and plans. A light touch assessment undertaken as part of the evaluation has
indicated weaknesses and gaps around promotion of inclusion (equity), gender-
sensitivity and protection practices into the ALP facilitators training materials (COH 1)
The relevance of UNICEF PCO cannot be over-emphasized given the history of engagement with provincial education
authorities, successes and momentum created around ALP institutionalisation across all provinces. The future assistance
must focus on following:
Extend technical and financial assistance to the provinces in multiple areas (proposed Facilitators/Learners/Programm All
above for the provinces) such as: review/revision and approval of NFE/ALP Policies; e Management/Alignment with provinces
formulation of NFE/ALP Institutionalisation Plans; capacity assessment and MoE and Policy Frameworks

facilitators training, learning assessments and examinations, mainstreaming etc.;
strengthening sector coordination, documentation and knowledge sharing;
strengthening of research and monitoring systems; AEWG normative assessment;
improvisation of community mobilisation; unpacking innovation through guidance
document and supporting activities; and others (IMP 1, IMP 2, ECY 2, EFF 1);
Layout province specific assistance plans (in line with the above) and define clearly Programme Management All
the results and actions (impact, outcomes, outputs and others) which should get provinces

Moreover, define clearly the transition/exit plans, and improve internal budgeting and
expenditures reporting to enable better tracking of cost of completion and cost/benefit
calculations (IMP 1, ECY 1, EFF 1, SUS 1);
