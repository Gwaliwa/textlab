EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Malawi Country Programme
The Government of Malawi and UNICEF Country Programme of Cooperation 2019-2023 (henceforth, “the
CP”) aimed to contribute to the realization of children’s rights in line with international conventions and
standards. UNICEF has introduced the integrated life cycle Pillar approach to ensure that its work makes
the greatest impact during key windows of opportunity in the lives of children. The CP pillars are: (a) early
childhood development (0-5 years); (b) school-age children (6-18 years); and (c) child-friendly, inclusive,
and resilient communities. To support the implementation of the CP, a cross-sectoral management structure
applying the principle of Matrix Management was adopted. The CP was implemented across the three
regions of Malawi.
Evaluation Purpose, Focus and Methods
The Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) had a dual purpose: (a) learning from the CP implementation
to inform the next programme cycle (2024-2028); and (b) accountability of UNICEF Malawi for results to
diverse stakeholders, including the UNICEF Executive Board, international donors, and the government of
Malawi. The CPE gives particular attention to the following areas of focus: gender, equity, human rights,
and inclusion; UNICEF’s positioning and strategic advantage in Malawi; the cross-sectoral/Pillar approach
and its contribution to national and programmatic results; the linkages among international, regional,
national, and institutional strategies; the humanitarian-development nexus; the performance monitoring
systems; Public Financing for Children (PF4C); innovation; and youth empowerment and climate change.
The CPE adopted a combination of approaches, including the Theory-Based Approach, the Utilization-
Focused Approach, the Participatory Approach, Systems-based Approach, and Human-rights, Gender
Equality and Equity-based Approach. The CPE was guided by the OECD/DAC criteria of relevance,
coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and orientation towards impact. Different lines of inquiry
informed the CPE, including document review, key informant interviews, an online perception survey, and
focus group discussions. The CPE began in June 2022, with a field mission in all three regions of Malawi
and in the five districts of Lilongwe, Chikwawa, Mangochi, Kasungu and Mzimba, from September 19 to 30,
2022. The field visits coincided with the school holiday period in Malawi, which reduced participation of
children, including adolescents.
Findings
Relevance
The CP is closely aligned with the national development strategies and sectoral priorities of the Government
of Malawi (GoM), the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF – 2019-
2023), UNICEF global priorities, and with SDGs. Overall, the CP has been consistent with the needs of
children, including adolescents, and young people in Malawi. However, programming to meet substantive
needs of street connected children, children with disabilities (including those with albinism), and vulnerable
boys has fallen short. The CP is highly recognized for being flexible, responsive, and adapting to contextual
changes, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and other successive emergencies.
The CP is human rights centred and has integrated gender, with some gender transformative interventions,
though inconsistently. Inclusion is a key deliberate aspect of interventions such as social cash transfer, but
specific vulnerabilities, including disabilities, are not robust in the design of pillar interventions. The CP
included initiatives that aimed to involve adolescents and youth in development efforts, as well as climate
change related interventions.
Coherence
The Pillar approach and the Matrix Management structure stand out as coherent due to their alignment with
the key bottlenecks in addressing the needs of children in Malawi. The CP has made progress in
implementing these change management approaches, which has improved internal programme coherence.
xi
However, they remain a work in progress and require regular review and adjustments until they are fully
part of the Country Office’s organizational culture.
The CP has well integrated UNICEF’s Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs) and
UNICEF Gender Action Plan (GAP). UNICEF’s interventions have been highly complementary to other
interventions and programs under the UNSDCF, with strong evidence of complementarity with other UN
Agencies, and to the efforts of the national government and other development partners. However, working
as one UN Team remains a challenge and joint coordination between UN Agencies in Malawi is far from
optimal as there is still competition for funds between each other and the Agencies have procedures that
vary between them.
Finally, as the UN Agency with a children rights mission, UNICEF is perceived to be strategically well
positioned in Malawi, with a well-defined niche and a vast range of experience and expertise. It has a clear
comparative advantage in capacity development and institutional strengthening, as well as having a strong
network in Malawi, in particular with government institutions.
Effectiveness
The CP has generally made good progress towards achieving planned downstream results related to
improved access to social services by children in Malawi, and upstream results related to systems and
capacity strengthening. However, the achievement of holistic results has been challenging due to factors
such as insufficient funding and limited awareness of the Pillar approach by UNICEF’s donor and
government partners. There is evidence of effective cross-sectoral collaborations across pillars, but such
collaborations are not equally and fully operational in all three pillars, which has slowed down provision of
integrated children’s services.
Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) activities have been effective in some areas to contribute to changes
in social norms and behaviours of targeted individuals and communities, but less effective at transforming
gender norms. SBC activities are perceived as receiving the least funding and are generally of a short-term
nature, which limits their contribution to programme results.
The CP has supported the introduction of promising innovations, with some concrete results in terms of
responding to the humanitarian and development needs of children. However, the lack of a clear innovation
governance framework and of long-term funding mechanisms limit the contribution of UNICEF’s innovation
work to overall programme results.
The CP’s monitoring system is adequate for planning and measuring progress towards Programme
objectives and is also specific enough to capture Pillar/sectoral and output differences. However,
inconsistency in generating and/or utilizing appropriately disaggregated data sometimes challenges the
ability to underline the concrete contribution of gender, equity, and social inclusion approaches to pillar
results.
The CP interventions have contributed to the empowerment of the Malawian youth, notably by
strengthening the enabling environment for them, equipping them with civic competencies, as well as
creating job opportunities through social innovation and entrepreneurship. The CP also made significant
contributions in terms of building resilience to reduce the impacts of climate. PF4C interventions were, to a
large extent, able to deliver the planned outputs and contribute to the CP results. However, these
interventions are contingent on institutional changes and reforms at all levels of government, which requires
further time for their full potential to be realized.
The CP has not been able to apply the geographic convergence approach, to provide coordinated, sectoral
inputs in the same geographic locations. This approach has been challenging to implement due to factors
such as lack of common understanding on the approach and the constant need to respond to emergencies.
The CP has been effective in supporting the GoM's responses to various emergencies, in particular the
response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks (e.g., cholera), while ensuring continued access
to basic services during emergencies. The CP has also contributed to improved emergency preparedness
and resilience in Malawi, by strengthening the capacity of relevant stakeholders, including communities.
Notwithstanding, efforts to apply the nexus approach at national level could be improved.
xii
Efficiency
Overall, mobilizing adequate funding resources has been a persistent challenge for the CP. Nevertheless,
mobilized financial resources were generally appropriately allocated and used effectively in most
interventions given the effective management approaches. There are areas for improvement, including
timely delivery, overcoming bureaucracy, lack of equity and gender-targeting, and addressing high
overhead costs. The staff complement of the Country Office has been optimal throughout, with required
capacities in the relevant fields of the CP. The application of the Pillar approach and Matrix Management
style has led to cost-effective use of human resources. However, the fact that the CP funding was largely
mobilized sector wise has constrained efforts towards joint programming, thus limiting the cost-
effectiveness of activities.
Sustainability
The likelihood that the benefits of the CP continue after the end of the Programme is both variable and
moderate. Some results may be sustainable over time (e.g., system for cold chain in place, knowledge, and
capacity), but others require ongoing resources to ensure sustainability. While collectively the CP strategies
have contributed to addressing capacity gaps at various levels (national and sub-national) and, as such,
helped to ensure sustainability over time, implementation of interventions through NGO partners is
perceived as less likely to foster government ownership and sustainability of results.
Orientation towards Impact
The CP has contributed to progress in children’s rights at the strategic level in terms of strengthening the
enabling environment (through a range of national strategies, systems frameworks, plans and programmes)
and in so doing enhanced the capacity of the GoM and other duty bearers to realize children rights. Some
interventions have already registered positive impacts on the living conditions of children at school and in
their homes, as well as on women. However, potential impacts from other initiatives are likely to occur in
the medium-to-long term. Some unintended negative impacts have been registered as well (e.g., tension
amongst and within households as a result of cash transfer top-ups).
Conclusions
Relevance
The CP programming was highly aligned with the GoM’s plans and policies and is perceived to have
remained relevant (over time) with evolving priorities, despite major changes in the country and global
context since 2019. The CP interventions provided responses to the most pressing needs of vulnerable
children, including adolescents, in Malawi. In terms of integrating cross-cutting issues, the design of the CP
is strong on human rights and gender components, but it is ‘mixed’ from an equity and inclusion perspective.
Programming to meet substantive needs of children with albinism, street connected children, vulnerable
boys, and children at risk of child marriage has fallen short.
Coherence
Generally, the CP is coherent internally and has integrated key UNICEF strategies and international
commitments. The ambitious innovations launched during the CP, including the Pillar approach and the
Matrix Management style, have been successfully rolled out and demonstrated their potential to achieve
results. Externally, this CPE paints a positive picture of UNICEF strategic positioning in Malawi, given its
comparative advantages in terms of upstream and downstream work. The CP’s work has been highly
complementary to the work of other partners, including other UN Agencies. However, there is a need to
continue to maximize efforts in joint programming, delivering as one, alongside regularized, joint monitoring
with other UN Agencies.
Effectiveness
The CP has had a positive performance and is on track towards achieving the targets of outcome and
output-level indicators. Nevertheless, the optimal achievement of results at country level has generally been
challenging due mostly to insufficient funding.
xiii
The WASH sector remains an area that needs to be prioritized, given its implications on other sectors such
as health, nutrition, and education. Despite the significant increase in terms of birth registration, more work
is needed to ensure data is entered in a timely way, and that people obtain birth certificates in a timely
manner. The education sector has suffered from insufficient funding due, in part, to the re-focusing of donor
priorities. The lack of robust integrated packages of interventions across the three pillars has limited the
achievement of the desired results. This is largely associated with donor funding modalities which are still
sector-driven, as well as the fact that the GoM is still organized in a sectoral, not child-centred manner.
Efficiency
Generally, mobilized financial resources were appropriately allocated and used effectively in most
interventions given the effective management approaches implemented. Gender interventions benefited
from the strategic allocation of resources due to the comprehensive articulation of gender action points for
each pillar. Human resources have been adequate to implement the CP.
Sustainability
Overall, in Malawi, sustaining many results remains highly reliant on international development funding,
and given changing donor priorities, their sustainability is questionable. A trend has been noted of bilateral
donors having to reduce and re-focus priorities because of COVID-19. Gaps in consistency in funding can
lead to successful pilot programs not being scaled up and/or terminated due to lack of resources, thus
limiting the likelihood of being sustained.
Orientation towards Impact
The CP has enhanced the capacity of the GoM and other duty bearers to realize children’s rights as well
as created changes in living conditions of children at school and in their homes. However, many
interventions implemented by the CP are only likely to register impacts in the medium-to-long term (e.g.,
SBC interventions addressing norms). It will be important for the negative unintended impacts of the CP
interventions to be mitigated to ensure long-term impact over time.
Cross-cutting Issues
The CP was designed with the deliberate purpose of promoting children’s rights (including adolescents)
across all its pillars and promoting gender equality. In both development and humanitarian contexts, the
CP has achieved good gender results, though grey areas remain. Inclusion intervention results are
inconsistently addressed although consciousness of the issue of disability is starting to increase. Equity-
related results are generally hard to discern from most of the results. The CP has achieved results in terms
of youth empowerment, but contributions have not necessarily been made based on a clear definition of
the role of UNICEF in promoting the youth development agenda in Malawi. The CP has been responsive
to climate change issues, with a results framework which included climate specific indicators, thus
influencing achievement of results in this area.
Lessons learned
The following lessons learned about the CP performance in Malawi are considered as transferable to other
country programmes in Malawi and in other contexts.
Lesson 1: Implementing a LCA in a Country Programme involves complex processes and requires
important changes (in people’s mindsets and organizational systems, structures, and practices) both within
the implementing organization and external partners. These changes must happen before the LCA can
influence change in results for children.
Lesson 2: Close partnerships and coordination are strong success factors for a development cooperation
program.
Lesson 3: Piloting innovative approaches is a necessary condition for identifying good practices in a
particular context, their scaling up is a sufficient condition to bring about lasting changes in the situation of
children at the societal level.
Lesson 4: In a country where communities are repeatedly hit by different shocks, short-term and reactive
emergency responses can save lives, but their longer-term development effects are limited. These can only
xiv
occur when emergency and humanitarian actions are included as part of the overall planning, as these will
always be a key part of the Country Programme.
Lesson 5: For geographical convergence to produce the results expected, it needs to be mainstreamed
within the Country Office, understood, and adhered to by all stakeholders concerned, internally and
externally.
Lesson 6: Deliberately and consistently implementing gender transformative and socially inclusive
programming at scale, as well as institutionalizing it in workflows, is what will ensure sustainable and
comprehensive programming that ‘leaves no one behind.’
Recommendations
The recommendations presented below are focused on enhancing the strategic positioning of UNICEF,
both internally and externally, as well on institutional and implementation mechanisms in next Country
Programme.
Strategic Recommendations
Recommendation 1: The next Country Programme of Cooperation should prioritize programmatic areas,
initiatives, and geographies, with a strong equity focus. Prioritization should be based on UNICEF’s
comparative advantages in Malawi, the potential risks in the global and national programming environment,
as well as continuity of key results achieved in the in the Country Programme 2019-2023.
Recommendation 2: Build on the achievements and progress of the life cycle Pillar approach and Matrix
Management structure and advance these approaches with the objective of improving programme
coherence and demonstrating results.
Recommendation 3: Reconsider the focus on geographical convergence in the next Country Programme
of Cooperation. Geographical convergence should be intimately linked with the life cycle Pillar approach to
reinforce each other to accelerate results for vulnerable children.
Operational Recommendations
Recommendation 4: Consolidate UNICEF Malawi’s innovation work and ensure a governance framework
that helps to continuously respond to practical needs for innovation across the Programme.
Recommendation 5: UNICEF Malawi should continue providing critical support for the Malawian
government responses to emergencies (e.g., health and nutrition-related emergencies, climate change
shocks such as floods and drought), while ensuring integration of emergency and humanitarian actions into
its overall planning through an enriched NEXUS-based approach.
Recommendation 6: UNICEF Malawi should continue paying particular attention to youth empowerment
as a cross-cutting dimension and clearly define the role of UNICEF Malawi, based on its comparative
advantages.
Recommendation 7: Build on the gains made by sustaining and strengthening the institutionalization of
gender, as well as inclusion, to ensure alignment of the Country Programme with the agenda of the new
UNICEF Gender Policy and GAP III.
Recommendation 8: Consider further investing in and developing MCO capacity to greater align with the
Government of Malawi’s decentralization policy.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Universalia Management Group Limited (hereinafter, “Universalia”) is pleased to submit this final report
to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO) for
the Country Programme Evaluation (CPE) of the Government of Malawi (GoM) and UNICEF Country
Programme of Cooperation 2019-2023.
The CPE covers the full programme cycle, in accordance with the Terms of Reference (ToR) (see ToR in
Appendix I). The evaluation had a macro level focus on the Programme management and results structures,
as well as a focus on service delivery outcomes and outputs. The evaluation assignment began in June
2022, with a field mission in all three regions of Malawi and in the five districts of Lilongwe, Chikwawa,
Mangochi, Kasungu and Mzimba, from September 19 to 30, 2022.
The purpose of this evaluation is dual: (1) learning from the implementation of the CP to inform the design
of the next UNICEF CPD 2024 to 2028; and (2) accountability of UNICEF Malawi for results to key internal
and external stakeholders, including the UNICEF Executive Board, international donors, and the
Government of Malawi.
This report consists of six sections. Following the introduction, Section 2 includes a description of the
country context and object of the evaluation. Section 3 provides an overview of the evaluation purpose,
objectives, focus, scope, and Section 4 summarizes the evaluation approach and methodology. Evaluation

2 CONTEXT AND OBJECT OF EVALUATION
2.1 Country Context
2.1.1 Geographic and demographic Context
Malawi is a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, bordering Zambia, Tanzania, and Mozambique, with a
surface area of 118,484 km.1 The country is administratively divided into three regions (Northern, Central,
and Southern) and 28 districts, with a population that is currently estimated at 19,907,178 of which 51.7%
is under the age of 18 and 66% under the age of 25.2 The population is projected to reach 30 million by
2030, with the number of children projected to almost double to 16.2 million.3 The majority of Malawians,
84.4%, live in rural areas whilst 15.6% live in urban areas.4
2.1.2 Socio-Economic and Political Context
Malawi remains one of the least developed countries in the world, ranking 169 out of 189 countries on the
Human Development Index.5 Poverty remains high, with 50.7% of the population living below the poverty
line in 2019/20, and 60.7% of children being multidimensionally poor.6 Malawi’s gross domestic product
(GDP) declined to 0.8% in 2020 from 5.4% in 2019 which is largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic

but rebounded to 2.8% in 2021.7 Despite efforts to improve child well-being, the country has not made the
adequate investments to counter the extensive deprivations (including child mortality, child labor,
malnutrition, poverty, food security, and dietary diversity) endured by its children, owing to the small size of
its budget, and the limited capacity of its economy to produce the required revenues. Malawi is facing a
challenging and rapidly deteriorating macro-fiscal outlook characterized by increasing exchange rate
pressures, unsustainable levels of domestic debt, and limited available fiscal space.8
Malawi is a multi-party democracy, with three branches of government (the executive, legislative, and
judiciary). The country has successfully held regular elections including peaceful transfer of power for
decades. Devolution of governance in Malawi operates through local government structures and traditional
authorities (Tas). The local government system consists of 28 district councils, four city councils, two
municipal councils and one town council, elected in 2014 for a duration of five years.9
2.1.3 Key Development Issues in Malawi
Malawi faces many interconnected developmental challenges which impact the realization of children’s
(including adolescents’) rights in the country. They are briefly discussed below across a range of areas that
are of strategic importance to UNICEF-Malawi.
Health
Progress has been made in reducing under-5 mortality, as this dropped from 232 per 1,000 live births in
1990 to 56 per 1,000 live births in 2019-2020.10 Yet, some 40,000 children under five years of age die every
year from preventable or easily treatable diseases.11 Mother-to-child transmission of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) decreased by 84% between 2000 and 2016;12 and the incidence of stunting
fell from 47% in 2010 to 35.5 % in 2019-2020.13 Maternal mortality in Malawi is among the highest in the
world, despite declining from 1,100 to 439 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births over the period of the
MDGs (2000-estimates-2015).14 This is in part due to high rates of early sexual debut, child marriage and
adolescent birth rates with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. During the past five years, there has
been a downward trend of vaccination in Malawi, which has put the focus on increasing coverage, to ensure
that children have adequate vaccines and receive the full schedule of immunizations.15 Malawi remains a
high HIV-burdened country despite great strides in the prevention and treatment response which has seen
national prevalence decline from 9.4% in 2015 to 8.9% in 2021.16 HIV prevalence remains
disproportionately higher among the female youth 15-24 years at 2.8% compared with 1.4% among the
male counterparts.17
Nutrition
Malawi has made significant strides in reducing nutrition related deprivation in terms of wasting and
undernutrition, but stunting remains steady for children under-5: boys (39%) and girls (32%).18 Moreover,
feeding statistics indicate a deteriorating condition whereby the country has experienced a downward trend
from 2010 to 2015 in both the exclusive breastfeeding of infants aged 0 to 6 months (71% to 61%) and the
complementary feeding of children aged 6 to 23 months (19% to 8%). 63% of children aged 6 to 59 months
are anaemic and many children in Malawi often suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, which include
anaemia and zinc deficiency.19 A leading cause of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies is poor diets,

with only 8% of children aged 6-23 months meeting the minimum acceptable diet.20 The key barriers to
improved nutrition are sociocultural behaviours and beliefs,21 low levels of education, access to information,
a lack of food variety at the household level, recurring external shocks, and WASH and health related
hazards.
Child Protection
Violence is a daily reality in the lives of children in Malawi, as 82% of children experience violent discipline
at home, out of which 17% are severe forms of punishment. Gender-based violence among adolescents is
unacceptably high as one in five girls and one in seven boys experience at least one incident of sexual
abuse before the age of 18. Malawi has historically had one of the highest rates of child marriage in the
world, with 38% of women who are 20-24 years of age and 21% of women 15-19 years of age married
before the age of 18. The primary reasons for early marriage are the desire to form a family, poverty, and
unwanted pregnancies. Birth Registration for children under-5 has seen a significant increase to over 50%,
however the percentage of children who receive a certificate is low at 22%.22 The number of Child Care
Institutions has increased significantly in the last decade from 104 institutions in 2011 to 169 in 2017.23
However, the number of children in institutional care has decreased from 10,136 in 2014 to 8,049 in 2017.24
According to the ILO’s Support for the National Action Plan Programme, designed to combat child labour
in Malawi, over 5,511 children have been withdrawn or prevented from entering child labour.25
Education
Attendance at early childhood education (ECE) programmes is low at 34% and much more likely among
urban children (51%) than rural (31%) and higher among the richest (51%) than the poorest households
(21%).26 While free primary education has led to 91% net enrolment in primary school,27 the completion
rate for primary school is just 50%.28 Girls (38%), children living in urban area (65%), and the richest
households (67%) have a higher chance of completing primary school than males (29%), children in rural
areas (27%) and children in the poorest households (11%).29 In terms of primary school net attendance
rate, 93% of children of primary school age attended primary school or a higher level (MICS, 2021).
According to the Education Statistics Report 2021, the primary school dropout rate increased from 4% in
2020 to 4.4% in 2021.30 Some 12% of children of lower secondary school age attend lower secondary
school or a higher level.31 Lower secondary school completion rate is low (23%), especially for children
living in the poorest households (3%).32 Only 10% of children of upper secondary school age attend upper
secondary school or a higher level.33 Upper secondary completion rate is very low (4%), especially for poor
households (less than 1% for children living in households in the first three quintile).34 Moreover, dropout
rates at upper secondary school ages are high, with girls (37%) at a higher risk of dropping out compared
to boys (31%).35 These high dropout rates suggest the need to expand access to alternative and
accelerated learning through multiple pathways and ensure these programmes lead to examination and
certification equivalent to those in the formal system.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
The 2021 MICS report indicates that three in every four households in Malawi have basic drinking water
services: 91% in urban areas and 71% in rural areas.36 At the same time, 46% of the household population
use basic sanitation facilities in rural areas while the proportion of the urban population using limited
sanitation services is 49%.37 Of the households without water on premises, 26% in urban areas spent over
30 minutes fetching water per day (in 2021) compared to almost half (48%) in the rural areas.38 28% of the
population has basic hygiene services: slightly declined from 51.5% in 2015/16 to 50.7% in 2019/20,39 more
than 1 person in 2 in urban and 1 person in 4 in rural areas. In 2021, over half of the urban population (53%)
used shared sanitation facilities and 37% in the rural areas.40 Children in Malawi are prone to diarrhoea,
cholera, and other water-borne diseases mainly because of poor sanitation and hygiene. Only 10% of
Malawians wash their hands with soap, according to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, while
73% experience inadequate access to sanitation and 30% have no access to improved water services.41
Social Protection
Poverty remains high in Malawi and people’s living conditions have been exacerbated by recurring external
shocks including COVID-19. The social protection (SP) sector in Malawi is guided by the National Social
Support Policy (NSSP), which is operationalized through the second Malawi National Social Support
Programme II (MNSSP II) (2018-2023).42 There are limitations to social protection programmes in Malawi.
For example, the Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) is implemented in rural areas only and, apart
from the COVID-19 Urban Cash Intervention implemented in Malawi's four cities, poor urban dwellers have
not received regular cash assistance. In fact, poverty rates have increased between 2017 and 2020.43
Moreover, the SCTP is limited in terms of coverage; the current modality targets the 10% of the poorest per
district which excludes significant vulnerable populations.44 The SCTP monthly transfer value is not
adjusted for inflation; hence, the transfer value continuously erodes given spikes in inflation.45
Climate Change
In the last decade, Malawi has experienced climate change and climate variability, which has contributed
to various devastating climate shocks (such as erratic rainfall, droughts, prolonged dry spells, and strong
winds) and affected various sectors of the country’s economy.46 Climate change-related issues impacting
Malawi’s children include, but are not limited to, a lack of energy access, floods and droughts, and water
scarcity. UNICEF Malawi’s second Climate Landscape Analysis for Children (CLAC) report found that
climate change is worsening multidimensional poverty indicators in the country, as 25 out of the 28 districts
were found to have high social and economic vulnerability to climate change due to poor access to health,
nutrition, WASH, and other services.47
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic stagnated Malawi’s economy, as evidenced by the deceleration of growth to 1.7%
in 2020 from 5.7% in 2019, due to a partial lockdown of the economy, resulting in subdued economic
activities—mainly in tourism, the accommodation and food subsectors, transportation, and agriculture.48
The impact of COVID-19 on children’s poverty, survival and health, learning, and safety are far-reaching,
but its effects have been disproportionately severe among the most disadvantaged. For example, UNICEF’s
rapid assessment of teen pregnancies and child marriages during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic

found an 11 per cent increase in teenage pregnancies in the period from March to July 2020 compared to
the same period in 2019.49
2.1.4 National Response to Development Issues
The GoM has developed several responses to the above issues, underpinned by the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy and the Malawi 2063 Vision (MW2063) and operationalized by the Malawi 2063 first
10-Year Implementation Plan (MIP-1) 2021-2030.50 There are several other sectoral policies and plans that
aim to contribute to the achievement of Malawi’s development objectives. These include, but are not limited
to, the following: (1) National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) 2018-2022;51 (2) National Resilience
Strategy 2018-2030;52 (3) National Multi-Sector Nutrition Strategic Plan 2018-2022;53 (4) Malawi National

2.2 The Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme 2019-2023
2.2.1 Presentation and Objectives
The Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme (hereinafter, “CP”) under review started in 2019 and is being
implemented until 2023. The CP aims to support the GoM to meet its commitment to respect, protect and
fulfil children’s rights in line with international conventions and standards. This mission is carried out through
an integrated life cycle Pillar approach to programming, aligned with the UNSDCF pillars. The CP pillars
are: (a) early childhood development (0-5 years); (b) school-age children (6-18 years); and (c) child-friendly,
inclusive, and resilient communities. The Pillar approach was conceived to ensure that UNICEF’s
programming makes the greatest impact during key windows of opportunity in the lives of children in
Malawi.62
To support the implementation of the CP, a cross-sectoral management structure applying the principle of
Matrix Management was adopted (along with other tools). The UNICEF Malawi Country Office (hereinafter,
“MCO”) commissioned a developmental evaluation (DE) to accompany and inform the operationalization
of these programmatic and organisational changes. Phase I of the DE resulted in, among other deliverables,
a theory of change (ToC) that depicts a pathway to MCO’s goal of structurally facilitated integration (also
referred to as change management), learning frameworks, as well as the timing for the change
management strategies.63 Phase II of the DE focused on facilitating continuous learning and rapid real-time
feedback to the MCO to accompany the ongoing change process and to enable ‘course correction’ through
informed changes along the way.64
The CP was implemented across the three regions of Malawi. Details on the geographic locations (including
districts) of the CP interventions are provided in Appendix II.

In 2020, the MCO commissioned a Comprehensive Programme Review (CPR) to rethink the CP priorities,
with a vision towards optimization, strategic focus, and agility, allowing the delivery of better, accelerated,
and impactful results for the children in Malawi. The overall conclusion of the CPR was that the CP key
outcomes and theory of change (ToC) remained valid. The output results were all reviewed, and the result
structure made leaner and more focused, with a reduction in the outputs from 12 to 9, and a revision of all
output indicators to incorporate predominantly standard programme indicators. Strategic shifts were made
in the Results and Resource Framework (RRF) to align with Malawi Vision 2063, including a shift from
service delivery to system strengthening, modelling for scale-up, reinforced engagement in lagging
agendas (such as Early Childhood Development (ECD)/ECE, inclusive education, child marriage) and
accelerated action in public financing for children (PF4C), Youth and Climate Change.
2.2.2 Budget and Key Implementing Partners
As of November 2022, the CP allocated budget is about USD 262 million for the period under review. The
current utilized amount is USD 216 million. Detailed analysis of the CP budget and funds utilization by
programme component is provided in Section 5.4.1. The main funding partners and/or donors include the
Government of Malawi, Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCDO), Government of
Germany, Government of Ireland, Government of Japan, Government of Norway, United States Fund for
UNICEF, United Kingdom Committee for UNICEF, United States Agency for International Development
(USAID)/Food for Peace, Swiss Committee for UNCIEF, and the Finnish Committee for UNICEF.
The CP is jointly executed with the government and other national partners, spanning from the civil society,
private sector, United Nations (UN) Agencies and academia. Table 2.1 presents the key government
partners by outcome area.65 The main international NGOs include United Nations Multi Partner Trust,
Global Partnership for Education, and GAVI. While UN Agencies include Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and World Food Programme (WFP).

2.2.3 Theory of Change
The MCO developed a theory of change (ToC) for the CP and specific ToCs for each Pillar. These ToCs
describe the pathways through which results are expected to be achieved and the assumptions that
determine success. Appendix III presents the ToC diagram developed for the CP as a whole, while
Appendices IV V, and VI provide the theories of change diagrams for the Pillars.
The CP ToC (Appendix III) outlines the highest-level change the CP intends to contribute to in the current
context as follows: “girls and boys in Malawi, especially the most disadvantaged and deprived, realize their
rights”. This change is achieved through four outcome areas: three “Pillar -related outcomes”: early
childhood; school-age children; child-friendly, inclusive, and resilient communities; and “programme
effectiveness” which provides quality assurance and support to the pillars. These outcome areas are
articulated in an integrated way to respond to the major deprivations of children in Malawi. The ToC further
discusses the key bottlenecks the CP seeks to address, the core programme implementation strategies,
expected changes at outcome level, pathways to these changes, and key assumptions. Finally, the ToC
identifies gender equality, equity, human rights, inclusion and participation, and resilience as cross-cutting
themes that are incorporated into different aspects of the CP’s work.
3 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
3.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
The broad purpose of this evaluation, as per the Terms of Reference (ToR), is dual as follows:
• Learning from the implementation of the country programme to inform the design of the next
UNICEF CPD 2024 to 2028, while promoting effective decision-making.
• Accountability of UNICEF Malawi for results to key internal and external stakeholders, including the
UNICEF Executive Board, international donors, and the government of Malawi.
The specific objectives of this evaluation are to:
• Assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, sustainability, and orientation towards
impact of the Malawi Country Programme 2019-2023 with particular focus on the implementation
of the cross-sectoral/Pillar approach and change strategies and their contribution to national and
programmatic results, equity, gender equality, child rights, as well as UNICEF’s strategic
positioning in relation to its child rights mandate.
• Identify and document key lessons from the current MCP implementation to make the best use of
UNICEF’s change strategies, good practices, and innovations.
7
• Provide a set of forward-looking and actionable recommendations to strengthen programmatic
strategies and introduce new interventions in the design of the next Malawi Country Programme,
taking into consideration national development priorities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development in the country.

3.3 Scope of the Evaluation
Drawing on the ToR and inception interviews, the various elements that define the scope of the CPE are
presented in Table 3.2.
Table 3.2: Malawi Country Programme Scope
SCOPE DESCRIPTION
Temporal • The evaluation covers the MCP work since 2019 until the end of the field work
(September 2022).
Geographic • National (high level analysis), with emphasis on remote and poorest areas and
districts where MCP programmes converge.
Programmatic • The entirety of UNICEF’s engagement in the country, and therefore, covers
interventions funded by all sources, and includes any humanitarian or emergency
response supported by UNICEF Malawi during the period under evaluation. The
CPE also examines the contribution of the MCP to advancing national
development results (MGDS III) and the SDGs through the UN Cooperation
Framework results. However, the evaluation is not meant to be an assessment of
the full results framework.
8
SCOPE DESCRIPTION
Organisational • The human and financial resource mobilization and use, the management
structure, the monitoring, and reporting systems of the MCP.
The CPE had a particular focus on the following areas of concern:
• Gender, equity, and human rights as cross-cutting themes across evaluation criteria and
evaluation questions.
• UNICEF’s positioning within the development community and national partners in relation to its
child rights mandate.
• The cross-sectoral/Pillar approach and its contribution to national and programmatic results,
considering the Theory of Change (ToC).
• The linkages among international, regional, national, and institutional strategies to bring about
overall improvement in the status of children with a view to clarify the roles and responsibilities
of national stakeholders and how UNICEF interventions can add value and contribute to policy
development and systemic improvements.
• The humanitarian-development nexus and whether the MCP is building resilience in a context of
cyclical shocks (floods, drought, disease) in Malawi.
• The performance monitoring systems in place at national and UNICEF levels, the quality of
indicators and their capacity to estimate, measure and communicate results, including the
measurement of horizontal issues (gender, participation, equity, most vulnerable, disability).
• Deep dives into programmes not evaluated during the current Country Programme, such as
PF4C and Innovation.
• Youth empowerment and climate change as cross-cutting issues.
4 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
4.1 Criteria and Questions
The CPE structured its assessment around the OECD/DAC evaluation criteria of relevance, coherence,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and orientation towards impact.66 With the latter, the CPE did not
aim to draw conclusions about the impact of the current CP, but to assess the likelihood of the intended,
positive impacts becoming a reality. The main evaluation questions that guided the evaluation process,
identified in relation to the criteria, are shown in Table 4.1.
Table 4.1: Main Evaluation Questions
CRITERA MAIN EVALUATION QUESTION
Relevance To what extent and how has the Government of Malawi and UNICEF Country

4.2 Evaluation Matrix
Based on the evaluation questions suggested in the ToR, an evaluation matrix was developed to serve as
the overall analytical framework for the evaluation, guiding the data collection, analysis, and reporting
processes. The evaluation matrix also reflects the main evaluation criteria and includes, for each of the
main evaluation questions, sub-questions, indicators, data sources and proposed data collection methods
(see Appendix VII). Worth noting is that some of the evaluation questions suggested in the ToR were slightly
refined by the evaluation team or complemented with a few additional questions to reflect insights from
inception interviews. A second effort was to separate the main evaluation questions (see Table 4.1) and
the sub-questions operationalizing the main questions. A summary of the changes made to the questions
in the ToR can be found in Appendix VIII.
4.3 Evaluation Approach
The CPE was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Group Norms and Standards (UNEG),67 UNEG
Ethical Guidelines,68 UNEG Codes of Conduct for Evaluation69 as well as recent UNICEF Guidance
provided on Country Programme Evaluations.70 The evaluation team adopted a combination of approaches
for undertaking the CPE (see Table 4.2).
Table 4.2: Evaluation Approaches
APPROACHES DESCRIPTION
Theory based The TBA was used to assess the contribution of the CP to the desired changes
approach (TBA) (outcomes) about promoting children’s rights in Malawi. The evaluation team
used the CP ToC to undertake analysis and draw conclusions about whether
and how the CP contributed to observed results.
Utilization-focused In adopting the UFA71, the evaluation team pursued and prioritized the
approach (UFA) usefulness of the CPE to its intended primary and secondary users. Doing so
ensured the relevance, utility, and uptake of recommendations of the
evaluation, towards informing the onward trajectory of the MCO work in Malawi.
Participatory This approach was adopted to ensure a meaningful involvement of the widest
Approach possible representation of stakeholders involved in the CP implementation,
triangulation of data, and appropriation and buy-in of findings, conclusions, and
recommendations among stakeholders. Throughout the evaluation process,
the evaluation team worked with the UNICEF ESARO and MCO offices to
mobilize the participation of key stakeholder representatives at country,
regional, district and/or community levels.
Systems-based
By adopting the systems approach,72 the evaluation team assessed not only
Approach
the progress made by the CP towards achieving the results defined in its results
framework but also the systemic factors influencing the results, including the
limitations of the broader system, and how the relationships among the different
actors in the system facilitated or inhibited the achievement of results.
Human-rights, As required by UNEG, the evaluation applied this approach to assess the
gender equality and extent to which these principles were mainstreamed in CPE design, delivery
equity-based strategies and results achievement. The assessment was mainly framed
approach around the Leaving No one Behind (LNOB) principle of the UN Sustainable
Development Agenda 2030.73

4.4 Methodology
The team used several methods to collect and analyse data as detailed below.
4.4.1 Data Collection Methods
Sampling
The evaluation team used a nonprobability sampling, mixing convenience sampling and purposive
sampling. Two levels of sampling were considered in this evaluation as follows:
• Stakeholder Sampling: The selection of the specific informants at national, regional and
district levels followed a purposive, rather than a randomized sampling approach, while allowing
for both snowballing and opportunistic sampling. Furthermore, the following criteria were
considered: familiarity with the CP interventions and level of interest in the evaluation, to ensure
information richness; likelihood of conducting interview (i.e., accessibility of stakeholders by the
evaluation team); gender, to ensure the mix of stakeholders represent gender diversity; and
diversity of stakeholder perspectives (example, ensuring a good mix of stakeholders at national
and sub-national stakeholders. The major categories of sampled stakeholders included: UNICEF
MCO staff, central government, local government, other implementing partners, international
development partners, and community level beneficiaries. The selection of participants to FGDs
was based on the same criteria and on practical inputs from field teams and on the types of CP
interventions that were to be visited in selected districts. Adolescents and youth were also
interviewed in this CPE, and a gender lens was equally applied in both their sampling and
involvement. The evaluation team ensured to visit both male and female youth activities supported
by UNICEF in selected districts.
• Geographic Sampling: The CPE had a national scope from a high-level analysis standpoint,
covering all three regions of Malawi. However, the team determined a geographic sampling strategy
for field data collection, allowing for in-depth analysis of some of the CP interventions at district
level. Five districts were sampled for field visits, namely: Lilongwe, Chikwawa, Mangochi, Kasungu
and Mzimba. Details on these districts and the criteria followed to select them are provided in
Appendix IX.
Document Review
A preliminary review was undertaken during the Inception Phase, supporting the refinement of the
evaluation methodology and the development of the evaluation matrix. Throughout the Data Collection
Phase, an in-depth review was conducted, to answer the evaluation questions as outlined in the evaluation
matrix. Approximately 250 documents were reviewed (the list can be found in Appendix X).
Semi-Structured Interviews and Focus Group Discussions
Semi-structured interviews with selected key stakeholders were conducted during both the Inception Phase
and the Data Collection Phase, and through video conference or phone/Skype as needed. Inputs from 173
(102 male/71 female) key informants and 14 FGDs (155 participants: 44 male/111 female), including two
FGDs with adolescents/youth (3 male/10 female), were gathered for this assignment (see List of
Stakeholders Consulted and FGD organized in Appendix XI). All consultations were guided by interview
protocols organized around the main evaluation questions. These protocols are presented in Appendix XII.
Perception Survey
An online survey was deployed between 07-30 October 2022 to gather perceptual data from key
stakeholders on UNICEF’s relevance and strategic positioning within the development community and
national partners in relation to its child rights mandate. Input from 46 stakeholders (out of 108 targeted) was
gathered through the e-survey. Based on the stakeholder map/list developed at the inception phase, the
selection of respondents was guided by the following criteria: familiarity with UNICEF and its work in Malawi,
their level of interest in the evaluation, and diversity of perspectives (e.g., inclusion of stakeholders at
national and district levels, government stakeholders, donors, etc.). The survey questionnaire (consisting
of Likert-scale and open questions) used during the data collection phase is presented in Appendix XIII.
11
Debriefing Presentations
At the end of the fieldwork in Malawi on September 30, 2022, the evaluation team presented the preliminary
observations to the MCO teams. On October 24, a presentation on preliminary findings and
recommendations was made to UNICEF teams and external stakeholders. Both presentations were
followed by a discussion with participants. This enabled the evaluation team to validate emerging evaluation
findings and engage in discussions around potential recommendations.
4.4.2 Data Analysis
Descriptive, Quantitative, and Qualitative Analyses
To analyse the data, the following methods were combined: i) descriptive analysis was used as a first step
to understand the context in which the MCO operates and the results achieved through the implementation
of CP before moving on to more interpretative approaches; ii) quantitative analysis and descriptive statistics
were used in the analysis of CP performance data, collected mostly from regular monitoring reports and
other outcome and process monitoring reports and dashboards, as well as annual reports. Descriptive
statistics was applied to the data collected from the online survey; iii) qualitative analysis was used for
content analysis applied to the material from different lines of inquiry (e.g., documents interview data) to
analyse and identify common trends, themes, and patterns in relation to the evaluation questions.
Triangulation
Triangulation was at the core of the data analysis process, ensuring that the evaluation findings were
informed by several lines of evidence. This increased the reliability of information and contributed to the
quality, integrity and credibility of the evaluation conclusions and recommendations.
Contribution Analysis
The CPE examined the contribution of the CP to advancing national development results (MGD III) and the
SDGs as well as the contribution of the MCO to emergency responses resilience building. In so doing, the
CPE recognized the important roles that the government and other stakeholders have played in producing
national-level results and framed the CP’s contribution to the overall national results accordingly.
4.5 Quality Assurance
The CPE was subject to both internal and external quality assurance processes for all deliverables.
Internally, in addition to the Team Leader, who ensured high quality outputs and deliverables assigned to
each team member, the evaluation team worked with a dedicated Senior Quality Assurance Advisor, who
reviewed all major deliverables prior to submission to ESARO. Externally, CPE deliverables were reviewed
by the MCO, ESARO, and the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG) established for this evaluation process.
The ERG consisted of both internal and external stakeholders and was chaired by the ESARO Evaluation
Section.
4.6 Ethical Considerations
The CPE adhered to UNEG evaluation norms and standards, the revised UNICEF Evaluation Policy of
2018, approved by its Board of Directors, as well as the UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in
research. Accordingly, the evaluation team ensured safeguarding and ethics throughout the evaluation
process. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring informed consent, protecting privacy, confidentiality,
and anonymity of participants, ensuring cultural sensitivity, respecting the autonomy of participants,
ensuring fair recruitment of participants (including women and socially excluded groups) and ensuring that
the evaluation results did no harm to participants or their communities. Regarding participation of young
people, the evaluation team consulted those aged at least 18 and above (the youth), and adolescents aged
15 and above. For schooled minor adolescents, evaluators ensured obtaining parental permission through
school principals and administrators. For unschooled minor adolescents, the process of obtaining parental
(or other guardian’s) permission was facilitated by UNICEF’s implementing partners working closely with
this category of adolescents. Details on the specific actions undertaken by the evaluation team to conform
to the above norms and standards of the highest ethical level can be found in Appendix XIV. The Inception
Report was subject to independent ethical review by the Health Media Lab (HML) Institutional Review
12
Board; suggested revisions were made before the final Inception Report was approved. The ethics review
approval letter is provided in Appendix XV.
4.7 Evaluation Limitations
There were a few limitations to the evaluation, related mostly to availability of stakeholders, as described
below.
While all evaluations face the challenge of stakeholder availability, the CPE was conducted at a time when
some stakeholders in Malawi were yet more difficult to access. In particular, the data collection phase
occurred at a time when many other evaluations were being conducted in Malawi, looking to collect data
with many of the same stakeholders (examples: evaluation of UNDAF, WFP Malawi CSPE). In many cases,
stakeholders had weak internet connections, especially in the district; there were instances where certain
stakeholders were either not consulted or consultations were not conducted as planned (e.g., some
meetings were shortened; others were postponed several times and ended up not happening because
stakeholders could not make it). These limitations were mitigated through two key strategies: first, the
evaluation team allocated more time than usual to planning interviews and FGDs; second, multiple options
for communication were offered to key informants, such as calls via Skype, Zoom, or in writing.
Another challenge is that only a few children, including adolescents, participated in focus group discussions
in this evaluation due to the difficulty to mobilize them, as the field visits coincided with the school holiday
period in Malawi. The evaluation team mitigated this limitation by ensuring that questions about participation
of children (including adolescents) in the CP and respect for their rights were asked to the parents and/or
guardians who participated in the evaluation. Their testimonies were further triangulated with those of
consulted teachers and other UNICEF’s implementing partners working closely with children, such as
NGOs. Altogether, these duty bearers were able to provide insights into the effects of the CP activities on
children, including adolescents.
5 EVALUATION FINDINGS
5.1 Relevance
5.1.1 Alignment with global, national, and sectoral priorities and frameworks
Finding 1: The objectives and interventions of the Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme are closely
aligned with the national development strategies (i.e., MGDS III – 2017 – 2022, Malawi 2063) and
sectoral priorities (examples: nutrition, health, WASH, education, child protection) of the Malawi
Government. They are also aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation
Framework (UNSDCF – 2019-2023), itself aligned with the MGDS III, and with most UNICEF global
The CP is aligned with national strategic areas of focus to address children rights related challenges in
Malawi. With the goal to support the GoM to meet its commitment to respect, protect and fulfil children’s
rights in line with international conventions and standards, the CP is consistent with the long-term national
and international development frameworks such as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III
(MGDS III) 2017 – 2022 and Malawi 2063 Vision (MW2063), MW2063 Midterm Implementation plan (MIP)
2021 – 2030, and the SDGs. Originally, the CP was linked to MGDS III and over the course of its
implementation it has been aligned to the Malawi 2063 including the First 10-Year Implementation Plan
(2021-2030). The MIP 2021 – 2030 guides Government’s efforts to transform Malawi into a productive,
competitive, and resilient nation, progressively realizing the Sustainable Development Goals and the Africa
2063 vision of prosperity, well-being, unity, and integration. Specifically, the CP is aligned with SDGs 1, 2,
3, 4, 5,6,8,10,11, 13, 15, 16 and 17.74
Guided by the principles of children’s rights, equity, gender equality, inclusion, and resilience, and

visible the child rights agenda in MW 2063. The CP design considered the life course of children and
focuses on the windows of opportunity in early childhood (especially the first 1,000 days) to provide every
child with the best start in life and early adolescence, to keep girls and boys in learning settings and on
course to optimally transition into a healthy and productive adulthood.
The CP interventions were designed to respond to the challenges identified in different sectoral
policies and strategies as outlined in the CP document, Pillar, and sector Strategy Notes. For example,
Pillar III interventions are aligned with the MGDS-III’s key priority areas (agriculture, water development
and climate change management; education and skills development; health and population) and other
development areas (disaster risk management and social support; gender, youth development, persons
with disability and social welfare; human settlement and physical planning; environmental sustainability;
HIV and AIDS management; nutrition; peace and security).75 PF4C interventions are aligned with the
Decentralization Policy and Fiscal Decentralization, Public Finance Management Act and Local
Government Act, that are key elements of the public sector reform efforts to create an enabling environment
to support adequate, efficient, effective, equitable and transparent budgeting for social sectors.
Alignment of the CP with the country’s needs and priorities is also evidenced by the fact that its three
Pillar outcome areas76 mirror those of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation
Framework (UNSDCF – 2019-2023), namely Pillar 1 (Peace, Inclusion, Effective Institutions), Pillar 2
(Population Management and Inclusive Human Development), and Pillar 3 (Inclusion and Resilient
Growth).77 The CP further draws on UNICEF global goals and priorities as described in the UNICEF Global
Strategic Plan (2018-2021), largely inspired by the SDGs, notably: ensuring that every child: (a) survives
and thrives; (b) is protected from violence; (c) lives in a safe and clean environment; and (d) has an
equitable chance in life.78
Finally, the CP is well aligned with human rights and gender priorities at national level, the UNICEF
Strategy and Gender Action Plan, and broader UN Joint agenda, envisioned by UNSDCF. This is evidenced
by how the CP is supporting Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to domesticate the CRC and
to deliver on their mandates through the development and/or implementation of a wide range of laws,
policies, national action plans, systems and programmes supporting childcare and protection (including in
areas of justice, education, nutrition, health, HIV and AIDS, ECD and WASH). There are specific
interventions that utilise not just gender responsive approaches but also gender transformative approaches
that instil positive masculinities and behaviours in male learners,79 as well as changing cultural norms
related to menstrual health and hygiene.80
Consulted stakeholders at all levels confirmed the alignment of the CP with the GoM priorities. In their
views, this alignment has been ensured by the fact that government is the main partner in all of UNICEF’s
programme areas and has a leadership role in coordinating the programme design and planning. For
example, they cited the annual joint work plan that reflects the priorities and collaboration mechanisms in
the CP implementation, and which is developed between the GoM and the United Nations in Malawi.81
Although the CP is generally well aligned with national priorities, the following gaps were observed.
On the one hand, government respondents felt that by implementing interventions related to positive
parenting practices mostly through Pillar 1 (the first 1000 days), the CP has not sufficiently aligned with the
priority of the GoM to target parental behaviour change throughout the child lifecycle.82 However, it seems
that this priority has only become more prominent under the new National Child Protection Strategy (2022-
2026), after the development of the CP. Interestingly, the UNICEF Gender Action Plan (2022-2025) is also
moving beyond the first 1000 days by targeting the strengthening of “parent and caregiver outreach
strategies to address the formation and impact of gender norms for children, including adolescents.”83 On
the other hand, consultations with the Ministry of Health (MoH) indicated that initiatives such as Baby

Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI)84 which is believed to have contributed to improving infant and young
child feeding indicators in the past has not been considered in the current CP interventions. The review of
the UNICEF’s health and nutrition strategy notes confirmed that BFHI was not an intervention area for the
current CP.85
5.1.2 Alignment with the needs of children, adolescents, and young people
Finding 2: In general, the Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme aligns with the needs of children,
including adolescents, and young people. However, given the call and UNICEF’s mandate to “leave no
child behind” there are questions on whether the Programme has aligned well with the needs of
marginalized children, especially street connected children, children with disabilities (including those
with albinism), and vulnerable boys.
The CP is well aligned with the development and humanitarian needs of children, including
adolescents, and young people. Through the alignment with the national policies, the MCO has ensured
these needs are integrated. The annual joint work plans include specific activities that will lead to the
achievement of results at output and outcome levels, thus ensuring the needs of children are met. The
interventions are available to children, including adolescents and youth, through ensuring systems
strengthening, service delivery and demand creation as verified through interviews with direct beneficiaries
of the interventions as well as review of relevant documents. As a central government interviewee detected,
“UNICEF’s support is found in almost every area of developing appropriate statutory and strategic
documents on child protection.” NGOs also remarked that among the UN agencies, UNICEF has been the
most instrumental in pushing for and supporting the development and review of laws, policies and strategic
frameworks affecting children in Malawi (including girl children) in pursuant to CRC standards.
Under Pillar I, the CP recognizes the particular needs of adolescent girls, who have targeted interventions
such as Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation implemented at the national level. Generally, there is
action to meet the needs of children regarding strengthening Early Childhood Development (ECD) services,
which focus on positive parenting and early stimulation at household level and foster the creation and
capacitation of Community Based Child Care Centres (CBCCs). These are outlined in the RAMs, ECD
Pillar Strategy Note, and the 2017 National Policy of Early Childhood Development. In the area of health
and nutrition, needs of children have been met through Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM)
of malaria and nutrition in outreach clinic services for hard-to-reach areas. In 2020, the Country Office
reports “one hundred and twenty village clinics were opened in two hard to reach areas of the two districts
where sick children are being managed for malaria, diarrhoea and fast ARI (fast breathing) following training
of 120 Health Surveillance Assistants.”86 The use of the Care Group model under the Afikepo programme
was also seen by FGD participants as a vital strategy in strengthening community and household
knowledge in nutrition, gardening, exclusive breastfeeding, hygiene and vaccinations. Beneficiaries in the
central region remarked “there has not been a malnourished child here since this project started two years
ago.”87 Pointing to assets (vegetable gardens and livestock), beneficiaries in the North remarked: “we have
healthy children who are being fed nutritious food as we now grow our own crops and rear livestock for
meat. We don’t struggle to buy food anymore.”88 However, beneficiaries identified some gaps, including
access to irrigation water, fertilizer, seed, and accessible health centres.
Under Pillar II, a review of relevant documents displays that using the life-cycle approach, the country
programme supports initiatives to ensure that children, including adolescents, will access integrated social
services through schools and other learning platforms. Pillar II makes strategic interventions at the primary
school level such as flexible learning spaces to increase children’s access to safe primary schools;
supporting second shifts improving the teaching, learning and assessment processes to enhance learning
outcomes and ensuring that children acquire foundational and life skills in line with national standards; and
reintegrating teen mothers into school or other learning opportunities. At the secondary level, focus was on
operationalizing open and double shifts; ensuring school safety; reducing financial barriers to lower

secondary education; and ending child marriage. Specific strategies have been developed to get and keep
girls in secondary school. Alternative, non-formal and second-chance learning has been scaled up, with a
focus on teen mothers. Respondents, including school children, highly commended the introduction of
WASH facilities and services in schools, including the fact that surrounding communities benefit from these
water facilities. However, some FGD and local government respondents were concerned that it is mostly a
few (surrounding) communities that have easy access to school taps, and that women and girls living further
from the schools still walk long distances to access the school taps or they continue to rely on unpotable
water. With regards to inclusive education, reviewed documents revealed successful joint advocacy with
the Royal Norwegian Embassy and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
ensured the development of an Inclusive Education Policy addressing specific education needs of children
with disabilities, out of school children and promoting girls’ education along the implementation of the
National Education Sector Plan 2020-2030.
The core of Pillar III is to provide an enabling environment and systems for children, including adolescents
and youth in Malawi to realize their rights. The Pillar was designed based on sound analyses and available
evidence about children’s (including adolescents’) rights in Malawi. The Pillar Strategy note (2018) identified
the challenges related to children’s rights in Malawi as being rooted in a combination of issues, spanning
from harmful social norms and socio-cultural factors, weak family and community institutions, weak
implementation of policies, limited enforcement, and monitoring of legislation to ensure children’s rights to
protection, lack of supply-side capacities, and lack of demand-side knowledge.89 To respond to these
challenges, Pillar III interventions are focused on the following four areas: (a) social accountability, (b) social
norms, behaviours and practices, (c) resilience of households and communities, and (d) a national and
decentralized administrative system. Interviews with stakeholders at national, district and community levels
confirmed the relevance of these intervention areas, indicating that all together they had the potential to
address children’s policy and legislative needs, while enabling activities at district level with outreach to
communities.
In terms of addressing the needs of vulnerable children with multiple deprivations, the evaluation found that
programming to meet substantive needs of children with albinism, street connected children, and
vulnerable boys has fallen short. With regards to street connected children, the common concern, among
UNICEF, Government and NGO interviewees, is that just including this group in case management is not
good enough, since “all the needs relating to survival, nurturing relationships, age-appropriate activities,
and psychosocial support (SNAP) affecting vulnerable children are more pronounced in street children
compared to other children.”90 As for children with disabilities, interviewed UNICEF staff and consulted
documents suggest that, under Pillar II, efforts have been made to address the needs of children with
disabilities, including albinism and children requiring diverse assistive devices with assistive devices. Still,
the issue emerging from document review as well as interviews with other donors, UNICEF staff and
government officials is that, apart from Pillar II, other pillars have inconsistently addressed children with
disabilities/albinism; and that more still needs to be done to meet the substantive needs that can truly help
the children to thrive at scale. Furthermore, because financial support in education is targeting girls, many
government respondents felt that the exclusion of vulnerable boys from poor households is only contributing
to their high school dropout rates as well.
5.1.3 Adaptation and responsiveness to changing context
Finding 3: Across the three pillars, the Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme has aligned with current
contextual challenges, children’s needs (including those of adolescents), and priorities of the last four
years, while being flexible. In so doing, the Programme has been responsive and adapting to changes
underway given the shifting political and economic situation and other circumstances in Malawi,
particularly in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and other successive emergencies (the 2022 Tropical
Storm Ana, and subsequently Cyclone Gombe, Polio and Cholera Outbreaks, etc.).

The CP is viewed by most consulted stakeholders at all levels, including with the Malawi government and
donors, as generally being flexible, adaptive, and responsive to a changing context and emerging issues
and needs, more so than many other implementing partners or donors. According to interviews and
document review, the CP underwent modifications during implementation necessitated by a number
of external and internal changes in programme contexts. First, external changes included changes in
the politically elected leadership that resulted in shifts in government priorities (e.g., fighting corruption;
addressing poverty and creating jobs, especially for youth, women and the deprived; investing in
infrastructure, agriculture and boosting housing, energy, and water sectors), making it necessary for the
CP to make adjustments. Secondly, measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19, including
restrictions in travel and human contact, led to operational changes requiring review and adjustment of the
programme priorities, and what could be feasibly delivered in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. As
revealed by UNICEF staff, the MCO was able to effectively renegotiate in certain cases the repurposing of
funds to address emergencies in the wake of COVID-19. Thirdly, adaptations to activities, indicators and
outputs were made to address COVID-19 based on gaps, needs in different areas, and availability of
funding.91
For COVID-19, this included focusing on port of entries; offering remote education during lockdowns notably
through private and community radio broadcasting; providing radios and printed self-study materials;
intensified UNICEF support for school-based continuous professional development for teachers during the
pandemic; training of teachers in child pedagogy; mentorship and remedial education to support
accelerated learning after the reopening of schools; and provision of COVID-19 prevention supplies. As
noted in interviews, district government officials were of the view that the CP adapted very quickly to COVID-
19 demands, ensuring that partners had capacity to utilize online communication tools, but also to ensure
that school learners and communities (e.g., caregivers under the Afikepo92 nutrition program and other
participants in community projects) were safe through the provision of COVID-19 prevention supplies
(masks, pails, soap).
Adaptations were also made to address other emergencies such as cholera and polio outbreaks, flooding,
and cyclone emergencies.93 Door-to-door campaigns for COVID-19 and polio vaccinations were viewed as
part of the country programme’s agility. During Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe, UNICEF was quick
to support the Department of Disaster Risk Management (DODMA) in affected districts with gender
responsive technical assistance as well as resources to support the education and other needs of children,
including adolescents. The CP also expanded social protection programming by introducing Shock
Responsive Social Protection to address food insecurity during lean seasons.
In view of the changing programme context, the MCO management team commissioned a CPR in 2020
that resulted in adaptation of the CP, including a shift from service delivery to system strengthening,
modelling for scale up, reinforced engagement in lagging agendas (ECD/ECE, inclusive education, child
marriage) and accelerated action in public PF4C, Youth and Climate Change, all aligned with Malawi Vision
2063.94 In general, the key priority areas as defined at the beginning of the CP remained unchanged (in
terms of the key outcomes and theory of change (ToC), but the approach to achieving the results changed.
According to interviewed stakeholders, these shifts have allowed the CP to remain coherent with evolving
global and national priorities in relation to the rights of children, including adolescents, in Malawi.
Intervention specific adaptations based on evidence of efficiency and cost effectiveness were also
reported. For example, as noted in interviews, there was a shift in vitamin A supplementation from
campaign based to routine and integration in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI); inclusion
of adolescent nutrition; introduction of the complementary feeding bowl to improve complementary feeding
at the household level; and distribution of multiple micronutrient powders. When these adaptations were
being considered, the food system approach to nutrition should also have been considered. However, this

was not the case, even though the UNICEF Nutrition Strategy 2020–2030,95 which has guidance on the
food systems approach, had been published at the time of the CPR, when other priorities such as the
adolescent agenda were included in the CP.
5.1.4 Integration of Gender, Equity, Human Rights, and Inclusion Dimensions
Finding 4: The design of the Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme is human/child rights centred in
furtherance of key international frameworks. The UNICEF Gender Action Plan (GAP) II inspired the
centrality of gender integration in the CP design and the development of a country Gender Equality
Strategy that responds to the child life cycle. While GAP II’s emphasis was on mere gender responsive
programming, the CP included some gender transformative interventions, though inconsistently. Child
poverty and equity-focused criteria were key to the selection of target districts, resulting in coverage of
some remote and hard-to-reach areas across Malawi, albeit limited. Inclusion is a key deliberate aspect
of interventions such as social cash transfer, and the CP’s Strategy Notes exhibited intent to include
the most disadvantaged boys and girls. However, specific vulnerabilities, including disabilities, are not
robust in the design of pillar interventions, and the country Gender Equality Strategy is ‘inclusion’ blind.
The evaluation found that the design of the CP is strong on human rights and gender components,
and integrated equity considerations; but it is ‘mixed’ from an inclusion perspective. In terms of
human (children) rights, the CP is guided by the UN CRC, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms
of Discrimination against Women, and the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development and related
frameworks.
The theory of change (ToC) across the CP programming areas, support the four pillars of child rights under
the CRC, namely survival, development, protection, and participation. 96 For example, the ToC for Pillar I
promotes positive parenting in support of ECD, care and learning; as well as high-impact early childhood
services – which uphold the rights of the child to survival, development, and protection. The ToC for Pillar
II pursues the right of all children to education, including through integrated social services at school level,
with the aim of holistically ensuring the development, protection, and participation of the child in both
development and humanitarian situations. The ToC for Pillar III supports the development of a sustainable
enabling environment to strengthen national and decentralized systems and services for child survival,
social and child protection, child development, and participation of young people in decision making.97
Strategy Notes for the CP explained how the human rights centred approach would be pursued through
identifying and transforming attitudes, practices and behaviours undermining the promotion of child rights
through the life cycle approach and service delivery platforms.98 Generally, all envisaged outcomes and
related outputs in the CPD were designed with a view to promote and strengthen child rights in different
phases of a child’s lifecycle based on sound analyses and evidence about the situation of children’s and
adolescents’ rights in Malawi.99
With regards to gender, at the program level, gender inequality is recognized as one of the most significant
barriers to reducing poverty, sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices. The UNICEF Malawi
Gender Equality Strategy used available evidence to systematically identify strategic gender action points
and indicators across the CP’s three pillars and in workflows.100 However, key informants noted some
gender related gaps in program design, including that focus was on collecting quantitative sex
disaggregated data, and not on qualitative data to explain the statistics. Relatedly, focus was on
mere gender responsive programming, as opposed to gender transformative programming. For
example, Pillar I has not reached the point of transformation outlined in a recent UNICEF review of gender
transformative approaches in health, nutrition, and HIV in Africa, namely that “a gender transformative

approach addresses: policies, legislations and budgets; formal systems and services; and underlying social
structures with the underlying intent to transform unequal gender power relations.”101
While gender responsive programming produced some results across the pillars (e.g., deliberate effort to
include women or men, or boys and girls in community/school level structures and committees; girls being
provided with education scholarships and washrooms, etc.), there was no consistent emphasis on
interventions to aid structural shifts to gender roles, norms, and attitudes across all areas of
programming. Of course, exceptions were found in some interventions, such as those implemented by
Ujamaa Pamodzi Africa (which target male and female learners in empowerment transformation trainings,
resulting in the boys’ behavioural and attitudinal changes towards girls and women) (see also section 5.3.6);
the Afikepo (targeting changing social norms so that men too can acquire skills to prepare nutritious foods;
the Positive Gender Socialization Training Pack for CBCCs developed by the Ministry of Gender to address
discriminatory roles, expectations and practices among children from an early age, and to promote gender
equality in the delivery of ECD and parenting services.102 The call for gender transformative social protection
under UNICEF GAP III (2022-2026) is likely to strengthen the quality and quantity of gender transformative
programs in UNICEF.103
The conceptualization of equity versus inclusion needs to be clarified better as the two concepts
tend to overlap. However, to the extent that equity stands for geographical reach, the design of the
Strategy Notes was informed by the need to have “target districts” with representative geographical
coverage, as well as to address high levels of poverty and inequalities that trigger poor human development
indicators. Site visits witnessed interventions in remote areas (e.g., schools at far ends of districts where
NGOs hardly go), and hard-to-reach areas (e.g., those with difficult terrain and difficult to pass, especially
in rainy seasons). Door-to-door and mobile vaccine services have been introduced with the intention to
reach those in hard-to-reach areas and those who cannot easily access a health facility, including due to
disabilities, poverty, etc. However, the evaluation found that the concept of “UNICEF districts” limits equity.
This is because UNICEF only covers a few Traditional Authority areas in such districts. Also, it was felt that
the UNICEF districts are few, and the lack of national coverage translates to low equity. Furthermore, the
fact that UNICEF “wants to do everything” concerning the child in the UNICEF districts was perceived as
short-changing equity goals, since resources/interventions are very thinly spread and do not reach every
deserving child in the targeted districts. Nevertheless, UNICEF has tried to be equitable by selecting its
target districts across the three regions of Malawi.
In terms of inclusion, the CP intentionally included key interventions such as the SCTP and the shock
responsive social protection program (Pillar III), which by design are meant to target the ultra-poor, who are
both socially excluded by others and who typically exclude themselves. The SCTP was strengthened by
conceptualizing it more broadly, thereby benefiting ultra-poor children in both rural and urban areas – but
targeting them by specific vulnerability criteria is work in progress (this is further discussed in section 5.3.2).
Worth mentioning is that the recent UNICEF Malawi Gender Program Review report has made a
recommendation for UNICEF to advocate for redefinition of the SCTP targeting criteria to include gender
vulnerability markers.104 Contextualizing this recommendation within the scope of UNICEF’s global strategic
direction implies considering how social cash transfer programming could facilitate the achievement of the
global indicator on gender transformative and gender responsive social protection.105 Therefore, this would
go beyond merely targeting women as SCTP beneficiaries, to ensuring that their specific socio-economic
outcomes are being deliberately planned and monitored. 106
By design, Pillar II sought to improve the identification of persons with disabilities (PWD), support the
delivery of services to them, and improve accessibility to them. The CP reports regularly on the number of
children with disabilities accessing basic education through UNICEF-supported programs, although

disaggregation by sex and type of disability is not reported for these numbers. Under Pillar I, inclusion
(disability) is integrated in some areas.
In 2020, a Situation Analysis of Children with Disabilities was completed leading to the Malawi government
formulation of a policy framework on children with disabilities.107 Activities to promote inclusion of children
with disabilities have been included in the CP rolling work plans (2022–2023). 108 Birth registration
certificates have been designed to capture disability. However, most disabilities are invisible at birth, and
the challenge is to figure out how programming can capture hidden disabilities that manifest as a child
grows. Despite these efforts, there is agreement among UNICEF and external stakeholders that disability
is not consistently and comprehensively addressed in interventions under Pillars I and III. A
contributing factor is that the design of the Country Gender Equality Strategy is skewed towards gendered
interventions (including those targeting pregnant adolescents, adolescent mothers, and adolescent
fathers), and does not visibly integrate other socially excluded and marginalized groups, in case: those with
disabilities. The fact that the MCO’s focus has been on having a ‘gender’ specialist and a ‘gender’ strategy
leaves issues of social inclusion at the peripheral.
5.1.5 Integration of Youth Empowerment and Climate Change
Finding 5: The Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme included initiatives that aimed to involve
(engage) adolescents and youth in development efforts. The development of the National Youth policy
and the National Youth Investment Plan provide an opportunity to further promote youth empowerment
and employment, in line with the Malawi government agenda. Climate change has been supported
directly and indirectly by the Country Programme activities, primarily through Pillar III community
resilience initiatives. There is an opportunity to develop an integrated approach to embed climate
change considerations in a more structured, direct, and intentional way into the design and
implementation of the Programme, as seen through the development of the Climate Resilient WASH
Finance Strategy (2022-2032).
Youth Empowerment
The evaluation found that, by design, the CP sought to empower youth through participation in
decision making processes, encouragement, and support to the development of youth-led organizations,
as well as ensuring their participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting of
development initiatives. A central part of the UNICEF approach also involved supporting the development
of youth targeted policies and strategies, but also advancing the position that youth issues should be
reflected in all sectoral policies and strategies.
Relating to Pillar I, the CP planned on strengthening and improving youth friendly health services,
supporting, and educating youth living with HIV (and their parents), and improving services for youth with
disabilities. Alongside this was to engage and support the GoM to design and implement youth national
programming. A secondary and complementary aspect of the approach involved increasing community
participation and positive empowerment through education on issues of sexual and reproductive health
(SHR) and HIV.
Under Pillar II, the CP included a focus on youth empowerment through life skills training, including their
participation as advocates. The CP ensured that the approach involved the GoM embracing the need to
actively engage youth in decision making processes. The CP included initiatives such as the Joint
Programme for Girls Education (JPGE) empowering students and strengthening accountability and
management of primary and secondary schools, through the registration of school-based councils
established in UNICEF supported districts. This was complemented by support to the registration of youth-
led organizations with the National Youth Council of Malawi (NYCOM) – facilitating their recognition, access
and enabling their work. In addition, the CP planned collaboration with CSOs/NGOs working with Youth,
such as Plan International to host the 2019 Generation Unlimited Youth Challenge in Malawi. A specific
focus on re-engaging out of school youth, such as teen mothers, to ensure they are provided with

alternative, non-formal or second-chance learning opportunities was planned, as were collaborative
initiatives advancing life skills, and productive livelihoods (such as education for small farming for out-of-
school boys).
Under Pillar 3, the CP planned to engage and empower youth participation by amplifying their voices
through those identified/appointed as “UNICEF Youth Advocates”. Notably, these advocates were
advanced as key participants and leaders promoting climate resilience, raising awareness of climate
change issues, and changing attitudes, encouraging, and promoting resilience and preparedness. Another
saliant initiative targeting youth specifically is the “Child and Youth Friendly Communities Initiative” (CYFCI).
This UNICEF-led initiative sought to support municipal governments in realizing the rights of children and
youth at the local level, notably by enabling them to have a voice and actively participate in the development
that the district intends to achieve. Interviewed District Officials in Chikwawa expressed appreciation of this
initiative, indicating that it will empower the district youth to demand services that correspond to their
prevailing needs. Details on the progress made towards implementation of the CYFCI and other initiatives
evoked above are discussed in Section 5.3.7.
Finally, through its Research, Evaluation, and Knowledge Management (REKM) Section,
the MCO initiated a ground-breaking partnership with academia to engage young people in evidence
generation and dissemination activities. MCO’s ‘Fun and Funky’ approach won the UNICEF global
knowledge management award for the innovative engagement with young student artists to disseminate
the evidence generated by UNICEF through the use of performing arts. The approach has gained
appreciation and is now being used by other universities and public sector organizations in Malawi. This
innovative approach has helped young people to learn more about high quality evidence produced by
UNICEF and use the approach for advocacy for child rights in Malawi.
Climate Change
The MCO acknowledges that Malawi is vulnerable to the effects of climate change and has made climate
resilience a target of the CP and many of its interventions.109,110 Climate change has mainly been
mainstreamed directly through Pillar III as reflected in its output 3: “Households and communities are
resilient to climate change and economic shocks and are supported to overcome chronic vulnerabilities that
affect children”. In so doing, the CP included climate specific indicators in the results framework, which has
influenced the achievement of results. Pillar III has envisioned activities that aimed at fostering the climate
change agenda at national and community levels. Examples of such activities include the following: support
to the conduct of climate studies, setting up systems for preparedness to mitigate against climate-related
emergencies, support to community-led climate and disaster resilient Water Safety Plans (WSP),
community-based catchment management and water conservation, introduction of climate-sensitive water
systems, and support to the development of climate sensitive strategies.111
Other CP Pillars have mainstreamed climate-change only indirectly. In Pillar I and Pillar II, the WASH
section has taken the lead in this area, by building on the work of other sections. For example, there are
aspects of the Pillar I health system strengthening work that can be linked to climate change as a secondary
focus, such as the solarization of health facilities. The nutrition section has worked on capacity building to
respond to continuous droughts/lean season and this degree of integration has increased over time,
particularly since 2019. The Pillar I rolling work plans (2021 – 2023) have activities on systems
strengthening for risk informed programming, including climate change and resilience at the sub-national
level through provision of technical and financial support to national and district health offices to develop
policies, guidelines and strategies for emergency preparedness response and resilience building (e.g., for
COVID-19, Ebola, cholera, polio, drought, floods). However, climate change activities specific to Pillar I are
wanting. The RAM report for 2020 indicates that climate change alongside other activities were temporarily
shelved due to funding and human resource gaps.112

5.2 Coherence
5.2.1 Coherence of Change Management Approaches and Strategies
Finding 6: The Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme’s fundamental purpose has been to enable a shift
from a sector-driven approach to a life cycle Pillar approach to programming, with Matrix Management
structure for human resources as an enabler, and in so doing, foster inter-sectoral convergence and
respond in a holistic manner to the needs of children, including adolescents, and women, especially the
most marginalized. Progress has been made in implementing these approaches, which has contributed
to considerable learning and improved internal Programme coherence, but they remain a work in
progress and require regular review and adjustments to further increase their coherence.
The CP launched an ambitious innovation, the Pillar approach, aimed at enabling a shift from a
sector driven approach to a life cycle approach (LCA) to programming. To operationalize the Pillar
approach, the Matrix Management style, a new integrated office organizational structure,113 was adopted
along with Task Teams. This evaluation has established that the MCO has made notable progress in
implementing these approaches, particularly during the first two years of CP implementation, which has
contributed to considerable learning and improved internal programme coherence, but they remain a work
in progress and require regular review and adjustments to further increase their coherence.
Through testing and experimentation, the MCO has gained a deeper level of conceptual clarity about
the functionality of the Pillar structure, notably by moving from the initial four pillar configuration114
to the current three pillars, which serve as the CP result areas, with cross-sector Task Teams working to
achieve pillar outcomes. Consulted UNICEF teams and documents revealed that Pillar coordinators are
responsible, among other things, for coordinating the work within and across the pillars, while accountability
for results remains the responsibility of Task Teams Leads and their team members.115 However, reflections
about the relevance and governance of each of the three Pillars as structures for effectively delivering the
CP remain a work in progress.
During interviews, most UNICEF staff felt that achieving integration and child-centred ways of working has
been easier in Pillar I and Pillar II than in Pillar III, as the former involve less sectoral and leadership
complexity. Pillar II is mostly made up of education sector professionals, with only a few matrixed staff, and
involves one section Chief (of education) who also serves as Pillar coordinator. Pillar I is dominated by
health and nutrition sectors – which are traditionally used to working closely with each other and involves
two section Chiefs of whom one must serve as Pillar coordinator. On the contrary, Pillar III is far more
heterogenous, with several interrelated disciplines 116 and more than four section Chiefs of whom one is
responsible for the Pillar coordinator role. There is a shared feeling among many interviewees that the
activities promoting children friendly, inclusive, and resilient communities could be incorporated within the
other two Pillars, and the documents reviewed in this evaluation suggest that this perception is not new.117
The differences in the degree of complexity pose the question of whether the same leadership arrangement
should be equally applied in each of the three pillars.
As reflected in both interviews and documents, the MCO has fairly achieved the desired shift in
management and staff’s mindset, one which sees cross-sector collaboration as the key to effective
service delivery and achieving holistic results for children. Most consulted UNICEF staff consistently
acknowledged that cross-sector work is a necessity for the CP to be child-centred and felt that the Pillar
approach has provided an opportunity to overcome sectoral thinking and achieve real programme
convergence. However, during interviews most UNICEF staff indicated that the approach could be improved
to enable achievement of results. These findings echo the results and conclusions of the DE II report,
indicating that MCO staff, both national and international, have high levels of satisfaction with the Pillar
approach and are confident and optimistic about working in an integrated manner. “The MCO has moved

114 Initially “Programme effectiveness” was considered as a 4th Pillar, but it is now considered as the operational support required for
each of the three Pillar rather than a result area in itself.

from the excitement generally associated with applying new ideas through the complexity of putting these
ideas into practice and all the other challenges associated with the day-to-day detail of change. (….) the
fact that most staff are “happy” is a testament to the success and progress with how the MCO is handling
the change management process in its specific context” (p.25).118
Finally, according to consulted UNICEF teams, working through programmatic Pillars, Task Teams,
and Matrix Management has improved the relevance and quality of the CP programming and
implementation in the MCO, although there is still room for improvement, especially in terms of
streamlining leadership roles and accountability mechanisms. Despite not being fully changed, the Office’s
modus operandi has significantly embraced the integration principles. For example, Pillar I allows for
integration, under the same management structure, of health, nutrition, education, protection, WASH and
Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) interventions, all of which are equally relevant for a sound ECD. In
Pillar II, integration allowed to pay attention to issues of student health and hygiene and aspects of
protection of children while at school, in addition to aspects of access to and quality of education. Moreover,
the attention to water and sanitation facilities at schools, support to inclusion of life-skills into the curriculum
and promotion of non-violent forms of discipline in schools are important aspects of a more holistic approach
applied to the work in this pillar.
The evaluation has found that the Pillar approach has enabled the CP to better mainstream the cross-
cutting issue of gender. First, UNICEF interviewees observed that, under the Pillar approach, the
implementation of gender actions has been more coordinated and comprehensive, because different
sectors in a pillar have worked towards the same gender results. With the support of the Gender Specialist,
the Pillar approach made it easier for sectors to holistically appreciate gender-specific issues in their sector
and integrate these issues in programming. As a result, the value of sex-disaggregated data across the
organization is appreciated better and the collection and reporting of this data became more consistent in
pillar-based and mid-year/annual reporting. There is also increasing consciousness to collect disability data
(although consistency is still needed), resulting in some efforts to improve inclusive programming and
results.
Second, the Pillar approach enhanced close collaboration of sectors within UNICEF through the
establishment of UNICEF gender Task Teams.119 According to the outgoing Gender Specialist, these Task
Teams became a key entry point to obtain resources for gender programming from sectors that would not
have ordinarily felt an envisaged gender intervention was their business: “Nutrition gave us money for the
development of Positive Gender Socialization Training Packs for Social Workers and Caregivers. We also
got a lot of money under Pillar II because the CPD facilitated close and better interaction between ‘Gender’
and UNICEF education colleagues.”. Task Teams such as the Prevention of Sexual Abuse Task Team
have galvanized various UNICEF sectors to collectively focus on achieving same gender and human rights
centred results across various programming areas.
Third, consulted UNICEF staff explained that the Pillar approach has brought visibility to gender as a
strategy for enhancing program effectiveness. Gender mainstreaming in workflows has been
systematically and practically achieved and influenced a new way of doing business within the MCO. For
example, the CP institutionalized gender in workflows by: developing guidelines to integrate gender in the
partnership agreement document, ensuring that all proposals and concept notes and technical assistance
to government have a gender perspective, and providing guidance on including a gender marker in resource
mobilization (financial and human), etc. And overall, the institutionalization of gender in workflows has
strengthened the political will of managers and leadership. Of course, other staff felt that more needs to be
done in this area, to ensure that the depth of gender mainstreaming by section Chiefs, leadership and staff
becomes a regular corporate practice within the Country Office.

Finding 7: The Pillar approach, the Matrix Management style, and the Social and Behaviour Change
(SBC) as implementation strategies stand out as coherent due to their alignment with the key
bottlenecks in addressing the needs of children in Malawi. While, overall, UNICEF Malawi leadership
and teams are positive about these approaches and believe that they should be pursued, going forward
there is wide acknowledgement that some challenges need to be addressed through continuous review,
discussion, and adjustment, until the approaches are fully part of the Country Office’s organizational
culture.
The Pillar approach, the Matrix Management style, and the SBC strategies are integral part of the theories
of change120 that were developed for the CP. While the Matrix Management style was perhaps a new
concept in the MCO, the principles underlying the Pillar approach and the SBC were not totally new.
However, all together, these approaches and strategies stand out as coherent due to their alignment
with the key bottlenecks impeding meeting the needs of children in Malawi.
To begin with, consulted UNICEF staff acknowledge that the Pillar approach was coherent with the need
to ensure that MCO interventions were more integrated and carried out in a multi-sectoral fashion. By using
age groups to define its outcomes, the CP aligned with the lifecycle approach, which is generally perceived
as a means of maximizing results for children, enabling them to enjoy the right to the best start to life and
reach their full potential as they pass from infancy to adolescence. The Pillar approach and Matrix
Management style are generally seen by UNICEF teams as having added value, by institutionalizing
systems and structures fostering integration.
Despite the general agreement about the need to keep the Pillar approach, many interviewees felt that its
effective implementation has remained a persistent challenge due mainly to organizational management
issues. A general feeling among UNICEF interviewees is that pillar-related leadership needs to be
further clarified, as the responsibilities of Pillar Chiefs and the boundaries of their power are not
always understood by all – especially that decision-making power remains with section chiefs. For
example, it appeared to be confusing for some staff, from the hierarchical point of view, when a particular
pillar section Chief is requested to report to the pillar coordinator, yet both Chiefs are at the same level.
This arrangement was also seen as causing challenges in resolving in-pillar issues, as when both Chiefs
need equal share of resources to implement interventions.
Linked closely to the Pillar approach is the structure of Task Teams which was also introduced to
encourage cross-sectoral work. As reflected in both interviews conducted for this evaluation and previous
studies, UNICEF staff felt that Task Teams have somewhat shown their potential, by enabling different
thematic expertise within the MCO to come together to collectively address an issue. Examples of
successful Task Teams which were cited during interviews include the cholera Task Team and the Staff
Safety COVID-19 Task team. However, interviews revealed that the concept of Task Teams appears to
have lost momentum recently. Some staff argued that the MCO has introduced so many Task Teams
that only a few were operational, and that there is a permanent tension in terms of balancing section work
with involvement in various Task Teams. This tension has lowered down staff participation in Task Teams
and negatively affected the effectiveness of this structure. Besides, interviews indicated that some Tasks
Teams – such as the “disability task team” and “adolescents task team”, were shadowed by the successive
emergencies which the MCO had to attend to. Overall, there is sparse evidence that the cross-sector
thematic and programmatic Task Teams have facilitated the achievement of expected results to-date. It
would be more appropriate to say that they have operated alongside the Pillar Teams and not in an
integrated manner.
Responding to the competing demands of sectoral interventions for funding inside pillars appeared to be a
challenge that needs to be addressed by the MCO, as it can potentially lead to competition over financial
resources. The implementation of the approach has demonstrated, in fact, that the potential for competition
over staff and program resources identified in the Development Evaluation has arisen and needs to be
addressed (i.e., eliminated) to ensure smooth implementation. For instance, all sections in Pillar I hold
responsibility to deliver towards certain outputs with maximum financial outlay for the nutrition and health
sections and least for the education section. As the core sectors in the Pillar I, nutrition and health raised
more resources for the pillar budget than others; however, it seems that there was competition over these

resources when early childhood education (ECE) outputs got discontinued, and the related activities could
not be implemented due to lack of funding, which limited results in this area.
On the other hand, UNICEF teams’ perceptions on the coherence of the Matrix Management style are
generally positive, as reflected in both interviews and documents.121 Indeed, most staff agreed that the
adoption of this form of organizational structure allowed cross-collaboration between staff and sections that
did not always have opportunities to work together previously. This in turn has improved cross fertilisation
of knowledge as well as communication within the MCO. Interviews indicated that even the “operations”
staff, who had initially remained largely untouched by integration, are increasingly adhering to the matrix
style, as evidenced by the budget officers who seat in the PPM section, being responsible for budget of this
entire section and working closely to clear the communication challenge. Even though these budget officers
are not officially matrixed, they are working that way, and it has improved work.
Consulted UNICEF matrixed staff acknowledged that the
Matrix Management style has offered them the opportunity Box 5.1: Perception on challenges and progress
to work outside their traditional technical sections and/or made by matrixed staff
“Matrixed staff often face the issue of dealing with two
hierarchical structures, which further strengthened their
bosses, especially when these are new to Office and do
interpersonal skills and helped them develop new skill not necessarily understand the new approaches. For
sets. At the same time, they recognize that at the beginning example, every manager, line manager and technical
of the CP, there were a lot of uncertainties, conflicts of manager, would want you to be in a meeting at the same
time. If the technical boss does not understand it, that can
responsibilities, confusion, and ambiguities with reporting
mess up the life of a matrixed staff!! For me, I have sorted
lines. Some reported that there has always been an issue it out with my technical boss: I am full-time in the Pillar

working in Pillars that are dominated by colleagues from on ad-hoc basis. This has worked very well.”
Source: Interviews (UNICEF staff)
one or two technical backgrounds. Notwithstanding, it
appeared that, overall, matrixed staff are increasingly
finding their way and continue to benefit their ‘home’ Pillars (see illustrative quote in Box 5.1).
This evaluation has identified a few issues that ought to be addressed for matrixed staff to be more
comfortable with this structure. First is the issue of lack of clear division of responsibilities of matrixed
staff between their functional and technical roles. According to most interviews, what is expected from
matrixed staff in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs) is not clear for both the matrixed staff and their
functional and technical managers. In the absence of well-defined KPIs, matrix staff are confused about
how to satisfy their functional and technical managers’ expectations. Second is the issue of work overload
for the matrixed staff due to competition over them by their managers. This issue was consistently
emphasized during interviews and attributed mainly to the confusion about the power dynamics between
the functional and technical managers, as well as the poor communication between them and matrixed
staff. Consulted teams felt that many managers who have had no first-hand familiarity with Matrix
Management tended to have difficulties to quickly appreciate the merits of the structure, while others tried
to maximize their own advantage vis-à-vis others, thus overwhelming the matrixed staff.
Finally, all stakeholders consulted acknowledge that the MCO’s SBC strategy has been critical in
promoting children’s rights in Malawi. SBC interventions aimed to change the environments in which
duty bearers act, making it easier for individuals and communities to influence protective practices for
children. These interventions addressed the key challenges affecting children rights in Malawi, as
demonstrated by various studies.122 Most consulted stakeholders felt that SBC interventions should be
continued and intensified, to ensure that parents, teachers, children, local government, and community
leaders across Malawi recognize the devastating impact of violence in schools, families and other social
spaces and take action to promote positive practices and norms and ensure these spaces are safe for
children to live.

5.2.2 Coherence with key UNICEF strategies and international commitments
Finding 8: The integrated services approach has yielded improved collaborative efforts, while delivering
on UNICEF’s Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCCs) and UNICEF Gender
Action Plan (GAP). There has been good progress in addressing prevention, mitigation, and
preparedness measures through both direct response efforts and by leading efforts to coordinate
responses through the cluster approach. The country programme has mostly been on track in meeting
sectoral commitments in the CCCs, although some gaps remain, including in the area of disability
CCCs.
Overall, key UNICEF strategies and international commitments are integrated. The CP’s approaches have
been primarily centred towards facilitating the implementation of UNICEF’s GAP (2018-2021)123 and display
alignment with the CCCs. An illustrative example is the fact that nutrition priorities indicated in the GAPs
(2018–2021, 2022-2025) are integrated. Adolescent girl’s nutrition, specifically indicated in both strategy
documents, is a priority nutrition intervention in Malawi. So is quality maternal nutrition, to ensure that every
child, including adolescents, survives and thrives with access to nutritious diets, quality primary health care,
nurturing practices and essential supplies. With regards to gender priority actions generally, the CP’s June
Mid-Year Review displayed consciousness for programming to start adapting to the UNICEF GAP III (2022-
2025), and identified key intermediate priorities that align with the GAP III for the MCO to implement in year
2022/23 (e.g., adolescent nutrition and pregnancy care; HIV and Human papillomavirus (HPV)
prevention).124
The evaluation found that the CP has good integration of CCC principles. For example, an analysis
of the scale of implementation of six health CCCs (leadership and coordination; maternal and neonatal
health; immunization; child and adolescent health; strengthening of health systems and services; and
community engagement for behaviour and social change) established the integration of all these CCCs in
the CP intervention areas. These have been achieved through, among others, UNICEF’s leadership in
COVID national planning and response, as well as leading as Vice Chair of Health Donor Group and Chair
of HIV and AIDS Donor Forum, etc.125 Similarly, an analysis of the integration of three HIV related CCCs
(prevention and testing; access to HIV treatment; and community engagement for behaviour and social
change) found that that all three have been integrated in the CP programming. Interventions have included,
but not limited to, HIV prevention messaging to adolescent girls through schools, HIV testing for infants and
pregnant women, and engagement via peer support, mentor mothers and teen clubs.126 While an analysis
showed that eight nutrition related CCCs have been integrated in the CP intervention areas, this has
involved, among others, co-leading the nutrition cluster at national level, supporting the DHIS2/Community
Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) database, supporting the development of policy frameworks to
deal with stunting and micronutrient deficiencies,127 food fortification, IFA supplementation, etc. (full analysis
can be found in Appendix XVI).
Humanitarian action in the CP has been seen in the context of Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe,
the COVID-19 crisis, and the Shock Responsive Social Protection Programme. In this area, there have
been mixed results in the integration of CCCs on humanitarian cash transfers, as well as cross-cutting
CCCs on gender and disability in the CP programming. For example, with regards to the CCC to promote
unconditional and unrestricted humanitarian cash transfers, the CCC recognizes that while a range of
implementation models can be used to implement cash transfer programs, UNICEF should first consider
the possible use of existing national social protection systems.128 UNICEF Malawi has been doing this by
working solely through government systems. The CP has supported Shock Responsive Social Protection
(SRSP), which has enabled extended coverage of support to the ultra-poor within and beyond the
mainstream SCTP, so long as they are food insecure. UNICEF has invested extensively in system
strengthening for SRSP, promoting several innovations (harmonized GRM, e-payments, among others)

26
that resulted in donors being able to increasingly channel resources through the national SCTP. However,
a UNICEF evaluation study noted that SRSP has encountered the inherent limitation of under-coverage
since other food insecure ultra-poor in project communities are excluded, leading to tensions at times.129
Under the 2022 Cholera Response, UNICEF provided affected districts with acute watery diarrhea
periphery and community kits, nutrition screening services, and WASH supplies. The MCO also supported
risk communication and community engagement strategies.130 One of the key lessons is that more funding
is needed to accelerate the integrated response to contain and manage the current cholera outbreak and
prevent further outbreaks during the rainy season.131
One of the core commitments for UNICEF during emergencies is AAP (Accountability to Affected
Populations), which entails ensuring that affected children and families participate in the decisions affecting
their lives, are properly unformed and consulted, and have their views acted upon.132 The CPD utilized
social and behaviour change communication as a key channel for disseminating critical information to
affected populations during the COVID-19 Outbreak Crisis, as well as during Tropical Storm Ana and
Cyclone Gombe. UNICEF interviewees shared that during the COVID response, UNICEF’s participation in
the Early Multi-Partner Gender Rapid Assessment aided the development of relevant strategies to guide
the practical response to gender related COVID-19 challenges on the ground. Since UNICEF works with
IPs and uses evidence generated by these partners in programming, this CCC could have been met to an
extent. However, an evaluation of the COVID 19 Response found that AAP was not well
accomplished, and more engagement with communities on issues affecting them (access to health
services, protection, referral) was necessary in order to accomplish AAP. The challenge in satisfying AAP
lies in identifying agents of change at community level, and engaging youth groups so that AAP
mechanisms are not one-way communication or fluke two-way communication.133 As this section later
reveals, inclusion gaps related to affected children with disabilities in the COVID-19 response were
discovered and addressed because of feedback received during monitoring – which illustrates the flexibility
of the CPD to act on views from the ground.
There are several gender CCCs,134 one of which targets ending GBV, GBV prevention, and risk mitigation.
UN partners consulted for this evaluation explained that UNICEF co-chairs the Protection Cluster which
houses the GBV sub-cluster – chaired by UNFPA.135 As such, while the CP may not have directly
implemented GBV interventions during Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe, it supported the Ministry
of Gender to deploy District Gender Officers from non-humanitarian districts to help with gender
interventions in humanitarian districts. Generally, as co-lead of the Protection Cluster, the MCO has used
advocacy and capacity development to ensure humanitarian systems and services are safe, clean,
protective, and responsive to the needs and rights of children and women. And as a Cluster Lead for Child
Protection and WASH, UNICEF played a key role in supporting vulnerable populations to gain and maintain
access to continued delivery of social and protective services in emergencies. The CP, however, made
direct and robust GBV input during the COVID-19 response. This included “developing special mechanisms
for reporting on human rights abuses, including prevention from PSEA, collecting and analysing data of
COVID-19 secondary impacts on children and women, and technical support for inclusion of specific rights,
needs and vulnerabilities of women and children.”136
The deployment of district gender officers to humanitarian districts during Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone
Gombe contributed to the integration of another gender CCC aimed at achieving “gender-responsive
programming, including a lens on adolescent girls.” A contribution to this CCC was made through the active
and strategic role of the MCO Gender Specialist to ensure the integration of a gender perspective in all
response mechanisms across COVID-19 clusters, as well as the collection of data according to gender and
gender-based vulnerabilities.137 The CCC on “supporting gender-responsive interventions that address the

different needs of girls, boys, men and women” was also integrated to an extent, allowing vulnerable
children and women to access emergency services.
With regards to disability CCCs,138 the evaluation of UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 Outbreak Crisis
in Malawi observed the lack of indicators to capture data on children with disabilities. Similarly, other child-
related vulnerabilities, such as ultra-poor street children, and school dropouts were not accounted for.139
Positively, the evaluation recorded that due to monitoring feedback, UNICEF supported the distribution of
braille materials to about 1,000 children with disabilities in 17 learning centres.140 This partially meets the
CCC commitment that barriers faced by children with disabilities will be included in needs assessments and
analysis, and incorporated in humanitarian program planning and monitoring. However, more can be done
to conduct these assessments prior to implementation of interventions.
Overall, the responses to children with disabilities fall short of the CCC commitments on inclusion, namely
that children with disabilities will participate in the design of programs and in the decisions that affect their
lives; that children with disabilities and their caregivers will have safe access to humanitarian programs.
The need for robust disability data to inform programming is clear from the UNICEF GAP II (2018-2021),
which guided that “to fully identify which children are disadvantaged, to what extent and in what manner,
disaggregation of data by sex is essential, but often in combination with other disaggregated data (age,
poverty, disability, etc.). UNICEF will prioritize the collection and analysis of disaggregated data and
promote more sophisticated measures of gender inequality, beyond gender parity.”141
5.2.3 Complementarity and Coordination with efforts of other development partners
Finding 9: The Country Programme’s interventions have been highly complementary to other
interventions and programs under the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation
Framework (UNSDCF), with strong evidence of complementarity with other UN Agencies. Although the
UNSDCF clearly outlines coordination mechanisms - some of which are UNICEF-led, working as one
UN Team remains a challenge and joint coordination between UN Agencies in Malawi is far from optimal
as there is still competition for funds between each other and the Agencies have procedures that vary
between them. The Programme support has also been complementary to the efforts of the national
government and other development partners.
The CP strongly promotes a collaborative mechanism for the MCO to work alongside stakeholders including
(but not limited to) Government institutions, UN agencies, international financing agencies, and NGOs/CBO
partners. Being a long-standing partner for Government and other agencies, UNICEF has leveraged on its
comparative strength, and planned, implemented, and advocated for children’s issues, in complementarity
with other players. Complementarity is generally seen at three levels: coordination/joint programming,
policy/programmes, and use of existing (government) structures.
When it comes to joint programming, the evaluation found that UNICEF has been involved in more
than 10 UN Joint Programmes, including the Promoting Sustainable Partnerships for Empowering
Resilience (PROSPER),142 the SDG Joint Programme/UN Joint Programme SP4SDG – Social Protection
for SDGs,143 the Afikepo Nutrition programme,144 the Joint UN Work on Health Systems Strengthening

(HSS)145, the Spotlight Initiative146, and the JPGE III. 147 The MCO has also engaged in various
partnerships, including a strategic partnership with USAID, which has facilitated the implementation of the
Adolescents Girls and Young Women Strategy (AGYW) and the establishment of its secretariat within
Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Culture. The partnership for AGWY implementation at district level has
expanded with many local and international NGOs participating to upscale minimum package of activities.
UNICEF has further strategically partnered with the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB)
and leveraged financing for urban sanitation, a traditionally underfunded sub-sector with high fiduciary risks.
Based on modelled climate resilient approaches, the MCO collaborated with other development partners
to support the development of a Climate Resilient WASH financing strategy.148 Finally, in partnership with
Airtel Africa and the Ministry of Education, the MCO finalized a 5-year continental project, which aims to
make digital learning across Malawi a reality.149,150
Consulted UN partners indicated having positive experiences of working and coordinating with
UNICEF in these programmes. They see UNICEF as very collaborative and very visible in diverse UN
joint programming affecting girls, women, and vulnerable children (including in humanitarian programmes).
UNICEF is particularly appreciated for providing complementary technical inputs and playing leadership
roles in UN coordination mechanisms such as Joint Work Plans, Joint Strategy Meetings, M&E, Gender,
and Human Rights (including leading the last two). Currently UNICEF leads UNSDCF Pillar 2 on Population
Management and Inclusive Human Development (and co-leads the Education Sector Joint Fund).
Development partners confirmed that UNICEF generally consults them to discuss pertinent issues through
bilateral donor meetings and/or sector working groups, which enables them to design interventions that
complement one another, avoiding overlaps. In addition to discussing and reflecting on their respective
programs, development partners pursue advocacy together with the MCO and perceive UNICEF as adding
value.
The CP’s strategic choice to implement the interventions within government systems helps to avoid
duplication.151 The close working relationship between UNICEF and GoM offers greater collaboration in
the processes of policy and program formulation, implementation, and monitoring. It promotes efficiency
and offers opportunities for capacity development. Practically, as seen before, UNICEF-supported
interventions are both aligned with national policies and relevant sectoral plans and strategies, as well as
integrated into national systems for delivering services. UN partners unanimously acknowledged that
UNICEF has been behind momentous policy and advocacy results for children, with policy, legal and
strategic frameworks produced in various areas of social policy, child protection, ECD, health, nutrition, and
education.
Notwithstanding the above progress, several challenges were noted by interviewees and in document
reviews. First, although there is joint planning, joint coordination during implementation and monitoring
remains weak and this interrupts the aspiration of “delivering transformation as One UN.” Some key
informants cited a “lack of coordination within the UN agencies from the start of the proposal and moving
forward and not acting as a joint program” and that “there appears to be territorial boundaries with agencies
with each agency trying to protect their own interests”, which sometimes affects achievement of
geographical convergence of UN agencies’ work. Hence, from the point of view of some interviewees, there
is an opportunity for UN organizations to work better together. This is not necessarily viewed as a UNICEF
issue per se, but an overall UN issue where the various UN agencies are competing for funds between

each other and have procedures that vary between them that make it an added challenge to
comprehensively work together.
Second, some national stakeholders indicated that the UNICEF planning process is still primarily top-down,
driven by headquarter and regional priorities aimed to harness UNICEF’s comparative strengths. This
approach at times fails to accommodate robust programming around pressing national issues that are not
ranked as global priorities (the case of street connected children was cited as an example). At the district
levels, stakeholders were generally of the view that unlike in the past, they are no longer consulted by
UNICEF teams to identify and prioritize interventions that need attention at the ground level: “the ultimate
projects and areas of focus are generally decided by UNICEF, and District Implementation Plans have to
bend towards UNICEF priorities at times.”
5.2.4 Comparative advantage and Strategic Positioning of UNICEF
Finding 10: As the UN Agency with a children rights mission, UNICEF is perceived to be strategically
well positioned in Malawi, with a well-defined niche and a vast range of experience and expertise. It
has a clear comparative advantage in capacity development and institutional strengthening. UNICEF’s
strong networks in Malawi, in particular with the government of Malawi, provide a comparative
advantage. UNICEF used its comparative advantage to maintain its strategic position, notably through
partnerships with other development partners, NGOs, and facilitating partnerships between GoM and
the private sector.
Consulted external stakeholders consistently acknowledged that one of the key comparative advantages
of UNICEF is its focus on children. This is equally recognized by UNICEF staff, development partners,
government and implementing partners. The survey conducted for this evaluation confirms that UNICEF’s
child rights mission is the comparative advantage of UNICEF compared to other UN agencies (81% stating
that this is a comparative advantage to a significant extent). In addition, 93% responded that UNICEF
played a leadership role in child protection to some or a significant extent.
Other comparative advantages for UNICEF include the fact that UNICEF has established strong
partnerships and buy-in and ownership with government institutions at national and local levels,
enabling its presence at all levels. The survey conducted for this evaluation shows that 64% of respondents
felt that the nature of UNICEF’s relationship with government was a comparative advantage to a significant
extent. All sources informing this evaluation confirmed that this allows UNICEF to influence government
plans and policies. In addition, UNICEF’s brand recognition was seen as a major comparative advantage.
More than half (55%) cited UNICEF’s brand recognition as a comparative advantage of UNICEF to a
significant extent. This positive reputation was confirmed in interviews across stakeholders.
As the only UN Agency that focuses solely on children rights, which are multidimensional in nature, UNICEF
has developed vast experience and expertise across Topic Areas, which is perceived as a clear value
added. In the survey conducted for this evaluation, 45% of respondents felt that UNICEF’s sectoral
programme coverage was a comparative advantage (to a significant extent) for UNICEF relative to other
UN agencies. Overall, 89% responded that in health, UNICEF played a leadership role to some or a
significant extent. In both nutrition and education, this was 86%, with 80% stating the same for adolescent
and youth involvement (engagement). Three quarters said this was the case to a significant or some extent
for gender equality (75%) and humanitarian action/emergency (74%).
UNICEF Malawi’s comparative strength compared to other UN agencies and development partners
is also perceived to be in the PF4C area, where not only interventions are viewed as crucial to the GoM
public financial management reforms, but also the GoM is dependent on the technical support in social
protection provided by the MCO. Given this comparative strength in the public financial management reform
space, other UN agencies and development partners have sought partnerships with the MCO which have
provided useful inputs for their own programs. Namely, PF4C interventions have partnered with the IMF in
the development of sectoral data on social sector spending, which was an input in the new financing
facility/ECF between the IMF and the GoM. District and national stakeholders also emphasized UNICEF’s
strong comparative advantage over other partners in capacity building and institutional
development/strengthening. The evaluation survey highlighted that 48% felt that UNICEF’s technical
expertise was a comparative advantage to a significant extent.
30
In terms of positioning, the UNICEF MCO implemented a set of new approaches which gives the Office
the position of strategic influence it requires to promote children’s rights (including those of adolescents)
in Malawi in the coming years. Consulted UNICEF staff believe that the programmatic convergence
implemented through the Pillar approach is a strategic positioning factor for UNICEF. The same staff added
that the Office has increased presence in platforms and fora for advocacy, with improved upstream
presence resulting in better budgeting for children (including adolescents); this is another area which
strategically positions UNICEF. Finally, many of the national-level instruments developed with UNICEF
support such as the Climate Resilient WASH financing strategy confer to UNICEF’s position of strategic
influence in the country.
5.3 Effectiveness
5.3.1 Achievement of outcomes and outputs – an overview
Finding 11: The Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme has generally made good progress towards
achieving downstream results related to improved access to social services by children in Malawi,
including adolescents, and women, especially the most vulnerable, and upstream results related to
systems and capacity strengthening (e.g., policies, plans, institutions, training of professionals). As of
2021, the Programme was on track towards achieving most outcome and output results across the
three Pillars and other outcome areas. The results achieved have laid the foundation for fostering
changes in the conditions of children, including adolescents, in Malawi.
Progress made towards achievement of CP outcomes
The Results Assessment Modules – (RAMs) generated from inSight152 and reviewed by the evaluation team
indicate that, for the period until 2021, the CP was overall on track towards achieving outcome and
output-level results under the three pillars and other CP outcome areas. The figures below provide a
summary of the CP performance at outcome and output levels. Appendix XVII displays the detailed CP
performance matrix.
The results presented in Figure 5.1 (b) suggest that, for the period 2019-2021, 45.8% of the outcome
indicators have their targets fully achieved, 41.7% of the outcome indicators have their targets partially
achieved, while 12.5% of the outcome indicators have no data consistently reported on their targets. From
Figure 5.1 (a), it appears that all outcomes have their overall status described as On Track for the period
under review.
• Under Outcome 1 – Early Childhood Development (Pillar I), it appears that 67% of the
indicators have their targets fully achieved, while 33% have their targets partially achieved for
the period under review. All indicators were reported on consistently across the years.
• Under Outcome 2 – School Aged Children (Pillar II), it is noted that only 40% of the indicators
have their targets fully achieved, 40% of the indicators have their targets partially achieved,
while 20% of the indicators have no data consistently reported on their targets. Across the
years, progress values towards set targets were consistently reported on all indicators but
one.153
• Under Outcome 3 – Community Resilience (Pillar III), the findings show that 50% of the
indicators have their targets fully achieved, 33% of the indicators have their targets partially
achieved, while 17% of the indicators have no data consistently reported on their targets.
• Under Outcome 4 – Operational Effectiveness, it is noted that 25% of the indicators have their
targets fully achieved, 50% of the indicators have their targets partially achieved, while 25% of
the indicators have no data consistently reported on their targets.
• Under Outcome 5 – Programme Effectiveness, it appears that 33% of the indicators have their
targets fully achieved, while 67% have their targets partially achieved for the period under
review.

Progress towards achievements of outputs
The analysis of the overall performance of the CP at output level is presented in Figures 5.2 (a) and (b)
below. Figure 5.2 (b) suggest that, for the period 2019-2021, 62% of the output indicators have their targets
fully achieved, 22% of the output indicators have their targets partially achieved, 3% of the output indicators
have their targets not achieved, while 5% of the output indicators have no data consistently reported on
their targets. This Figure shows also that 8% of the CP outputs have been discontinued as of 2021.
The results displayed in Figure 5.2 (a) show that, for the period 2019-2021, 6 outputs had their status
described as Met, 14 outputs were On Track, while the remaining seven outputs had their status described
as Discontinued. Five of the 7 discontinued outputs belong to the Outcome 2 (Pillar II). These outputs were
discontinued following the CPR and PBR approval in March 2021.

Likelihood of the CP achieving output and outcome results
In view of the above results, it is likely that, at the current funding level and given the lifting of some of the
COVID-19 restrictions that has allowed for close monitoring of implementation of the CP interventions, the
set targets for certain outputs (e.g; outputs 1.2, 1.4; 4.1, 4.2, 4.4) could be achieved by the end of the
current CP. For example, for Pillar I, UNICEF has reached many of its targets over the past 4 years,
including progress in HIV testing and treatment, vaccinations, and WASH in health facilities. The CP has
come close to reaching targets consistently in areas of birth registration and quality of MNCH, but only
partially achieved the target for percentage of children with diarrhoea receiving zinc and oral rehydration
salts. If funding in health continues, and a focus remains on addressing health, it is likely that all output
targets can be met. Across the Pillars, several of the CP activities helped GoM’s institutions to move from
policy to implementation and to provide direct services to children and their families. In so doing, the CP
interventions created changes in their living conditions, and thus contributed to outcome-level results.
However, given that these are mostly of medium-to-long term nature, they are likely to be achieved beyond
the lifetime of the current CP.
5.3.2 Contribution of Pillar and Matrix Management approaches
Finding 12: The three Pillar approach – comprising early childhood, school age, and inclusive
communities - and Matrix Management style have been satisfactorily rolled out and in a complementary
manner during the current Country Programme. There is evidence of the contribution of these
approaches to achieving country programme-level results. However, the optimal delivery of integrated
program responses and achievement of holistic results in the UNICEF-supported districts has been
challenging due to several factors, including internal (e.g., insufficient funding) and external (limited
awareness of the Pillar approach by UNICEF’s donor and government partners) factors.
Roll out of Pillar and Matrix Management approaches
Evidence collected from documents and interviews demonstrates that the three Pillar approach and the
Matrix Management style have been satisfactorily rolled out, producing results in humanitarian and
development domains.
Since its design, the CP laid a strong focus on joint programming and each Pillar Strategy Note
included outputs that reflected all relevant sectoral lenses, translating into pillar-oriented results frameworks
and workplans. Interviews revealed that the planning process for each Pillar is primarily conducted through
the overall planning process used for the entire CP and is anchored by the Programme Planning and
Monitoring section. The overall plans are further refined on an annual basis through the development of
rolling-work-plans which outline the Pillar outputs, implementation strategies, as well as monitoring and
reporting frameworks to track progress. The evaluation found a match between the Pillar strategic notes
and annual workplans, which has enabled achievement of country programme-level results. There are also
indications that the use of Matrix Management has started producing results towards the outcome structure.
Improved access to basic services
The available data and assessments suggest that the CP interventions contributed to improving and
expanding quality basic services for children through the three Pillar approach, as demonstrated by the
achieved progress on some indicators.
In Pillar I, the integration of CMAM into ICCM of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea, and integration of
HIV testing services in sexual and reproductive health is believed to have enabled achievement of good
results. For example, over the period of the CP, the percentage of HIV exposed infants receiving a
virological test for HIV within 2 months of birth has increased from 61% in 2018 to 85% in 2022, while the
percentage of children living with HIV receiving ART increased from 61% in 2020 to 74% in 2022. Despite
the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the country has sustained high vaccination coverage
due to UNICEF support to the Ministry of Health (MoH). The percentage of children vaccinated with three
doses of DTP/Penta containing vaccines increased from 84% in 2018 to 94% in 2021. While the number of
health facilities with functioning cold chain increased from 839 in 2020 (baseline) to 1095 in 2022.154

The CP interventions also contributed to the expansion and improvement of quality of nutrition
services for children under 5 and school age children in Malawi. Micronutrient supplementation with
IFA for adolescents in and out of school and vitamin A integrated in EPI were expanded. The percentage
of health facilities providing Vitamin A supplementation increased from 50% in 2021 to 68% in 2022, with
371,400 children receiving Vitamin A supplementation in 2022. Access to treatment of acute malnutrition
also improved in the period under review, as the cure rate (% of children recovered) in the Community
based management of Acute malnutrition remained consistently higher than the baseline and the target;
and significantly above the SPHERE standard for good programme performance of 75%. To expand access
to nutrition screening services and early detection of malnutrition, the CP introduced family Mid Upper Arm
Circumference (MUAC) and trained caregivers to assess nutritional status of their children. Additionally,
complementary feeding bowl has been introduced to improve food intake among children under five.

The Afikepo programme, which integrates health, nutrition, WASH and agriculture to address the
whole child, is another example demonstrating how integrated programmes contributed to country-
level results. For example, exclusive breastfeeding increased from 60.8% at baseline to 64.4% in 2020;
while households with handwashing facilities increased from 22.6% at baseline to 62.3% in 2020.155 Also,
as part of the EPI, the MCO introduced support to integrated delivery of child interventions in which
immunization campaigns included distribution of Vitamin A and deworming tablets.
Birth registration has been promoted in Pillar I as part of the Child Protection programme which
belongs to Pillar III, and thanks to this cross-pillar integration nurses and midwives have been given the
mandate to fill in birth notification forms. This has resulted in an increase of under 5 birth registration rates
in Malawi, from 2% in 2018 (baseline) to 50% in 2022.156 Despite this achievement, there is an outstanding
gap that needs to be tightened, namely the challenge of improving the speed of printing and
collection/distribution of birth registration certificates. According to UNICEF and district government
interviewees, this challenge persists partly because the operations of new registered births (NRB) are still
quite centralized despite having district offices and there is low community demand for birth certificates.
Some argued that there has been no clear engagement over how the UNICEF governance team could be
more involved in the civil registration system (CRVS) through ensuring that devolved NRB systems are
working effectively and efficiently to serve their jurisdictions. UNICEF interviewees also emphasized that
the challenge is associated with the fact that civil registration indicators are not adopted across
departmental targets within UNICEF. Furthermore, the UNICEF health sector is yet to explore integrating
the CRVS and the Health Information Management System.

In Pillar II, the MCO approach, which focuses on facilitating support for the Ministry of Education (MoE),
has made contributions towards the Pillar outcome achievement. Within the framework of the Malawi
Education Sector Improvement Project (MESIP) supported by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE),
the World Bank (WB) and the Government of Norway, the CP contributed to improved access to primary
education, including by supporting the construction of 158 new primary schools. The MCO leveraged WB
and EU support to secondary education through the implementation of the EUR 36 million “Improving
Secondary Education in Malawi” programme and the US$100 million “Equity and Quality Learning at
Secondary (EQUALS)” programme led by the WB. With USAID support, UNICEF Malawi worked on
improving access to secondary education by constructing some additional 250 secondary schools. As
shown in Figure 5.4, there has been great progress in the pupil per classroom ratio as a result of these
efforts.
In Pillar III, the CP interventions contributed to improving and expanding government service
delivery, as demonstrated by the achieved progress on some indicators. For example, the “Number
of girls and boys reached by cash transfer programmes through UNICEF-supported programmes” has
increased from 431,700 in 2020 (baseline) to 619,295 in 2021 (against a target of 500,000). There has
been an increase in the “Share of public spending on sectors benefiting children”, from 29.4% in 2018
(baseline) to 33.1% in 2021 (against a target of 31%). Furthermore, in 2020, budget allocation to the EPI
increased by 282% and the Government’s contribution to social cash transfer program increased by 61%
in its 2019/20 budget.

In the Child Protection domain, the CP contributed to increased reporting on violence, increased
access to psycho-social support services, and combatting child marriages. Evidence collected from
UNICEF annual reports show that, throughout the CP period, thousands of new cases of violence against
children have been reported each year: 30,000 were reported in 2022 (mid-year), against 35,000 cases in
2021, 58,000 cases in 2020, and 37,000 cases in 2019. Concurrently, the Programme reached out to
161,936 as of September 2022, against, 117,787 in 2020, and 30,000 in 2019 children aged 6 to 18 with
psycho-social support services through Children’s Corners across the country including in emergency-
affected districts and evacuation sites. In 2022, and in partnership with Nkhoma Synod,157 the Programme
reached over 1,900,000 congregants (with messages on child protection including ending child marriages).

Reportedly, thanks to this partnership, no marriages involving children have been officiated within the
Nkhoma Synod congregations in the same year.158
In the Social Protection domain, the CP supported national scale-up of the Malawi SCTP resulting in
increased numbers of children in households receiving cash assistance. The number grew to over
294,000 beneficiary households in 2019, up from 276,000 in 2018, while the number of children in
households receiving consumption support increased from 431,700 to 622,323.159 In 2022 (September),
over 303,800 vulnerable households (1,333,286 individual members of which 583,174 are children) were
receiving monthly cash transfers via SCTP through UNICEF continued support to government.160
Furthermore, the CP supported the design, testing, and institutionalizing of shock-sensitive
elements in the Malawi National Social Support Program. This led to an estimated 177,687 people
(among them close to 100,000 girls and boys in areas affected by food insecurity or flooding) receiving
cash-based emergency assistance through the existing channels (vertical expansion) in 2019; while the
programme also benefited about 38,900 shock-affected households during the lean season with additional
top-ups in 2020.161 Finally, the Programme supported the design and operationalization of the government
led COVID-19 Urban Cash Intervention (CUCI), helping the GoM to expand its social protection system to
accommodate the needs created by the pandemic. In 2020, 199,640 households were registered under the
CUCI, and it reached more than half a million individuals who were classified as informal workers and/or
poor, across four major cities.
The evaluation has found that the Pillar approach has contributed to the achievement of several
results towards gender institutionalization. For example, in terms of staff training, there was a target to
train 35 UNICEF staff in gender transforming programming,162 which was partially achieved in 2021 by
training 24 staff members (69%). Thus, decent strides were made although ideally, all staff members ought
to have the same level of knowledge if gender transformation is to be fully institutionalized in all aspects of
UNICEF programming. In terms of training of UNICEF Implementing Partners (Ips) on gender integration
skills, the target was fully achieved (according to the 2022 RAM document). From a baseline of zero in
2020, 34 staff members were trained in 2021, against a target of 35. Still, it is unclear if the original target
of having these trainings annually is being met.
The presence of gender integration tools has also been tracked, and this was partially achieved in 2021,
with two sector specific checklists on gender integration for UNICEF programming developed against a
target of 3 (baseline was zero in 2020). Interviewed local NGOs and central government stakeholders felt
that the NGOs that UNICEF works with are mostly international, and therefore capacity building of local
NGOs is still a gap. However, this is not to say that UNICEF is completely not working with national NGOs,
because the NGO Child Rights Coalition and the Malawi Local Government Association (MALGA) are
notable examples.
Despite the above achievements, the optimal delivery of integrated program responses and
achievement of holistic results at country level, or at least in the UNICEF-supported districts, has
been challenging. In the WASH area, under Pillar III, limited progress has been made on key indicators.
Notably, the “percentage of the population using basic drinking water services” in Malawi has slightly
improved over the CP period, as in 2021, this population was 69% (against a baseline of 67% in 2018). No
progress has been made on the “proportion of population using basic sanitation services”: this population
was estimated at 26% in 2021 (against a baseline was 42% in 2018).163 Overall, despite the progress made,
Malawi is off-track to meet SDGs 6.1 and 6.2 and the country needs to accelerate progress to meet the
targets set for the first 10 years of Vision 2063.
It appears to have been challenging for the CP to translate some of its broad and ambitious WASH
intents into concrete action. In casu, the CP had envisioned the support to community-led climate and
disaster resilient Water Safety Plans (WSP), research and development activities for groundwater

37
development, support to community-based catchment management and water conservation, etc. However,
implemented interventions were mostly WASH-focused, whereas efforts to support water resources
management have been limited.
In the child protection area, despite some notable progress made, the level of violence against
children in Malawi has unfortunately remained high, as evidenced by the fact that 82% of all children
in Malawi aged 1-14 years were subjected to some form of violent discipline in 2021.164 Consulted MCO
and government interviewees noted that, at 38% of girls who were married before they turned 18 in 2021,
165,166 the envisaged result of eliminating child marriage is far from being achieved and this is of serious
concern.
Moreover, the conceptualization of ‘the most vulnerable children’ under Pillar III is unclear to allow
for concrete tracking of interventions affecting them, as well as how such interventions contribute to
programme results. Street connected children, children with disabilities and vulnerable boys emerged
during all child protection related interviews (UNICEF, government, and NGOs) as being left behind. Central
government interviewees recognized the need for systematic disability data to transcend the education
sector to the child protection system, “children with disabilities, including those with albinism, are one of the
vulnerable groups and there is need to provide evidence-based guidelines on how Social Workers, the
judiciary and police can protect them more.” The omission to substantively include responses for these and
other vulnerable children in the new National Child Protection Strategy (NCPS II, 2022-2026) is thus a
glaring gap. NCPS II’s monitoring framework has nothing on children with disabilities and special needs.
The strategic action mentioned is the promotion of “sex, age, and disability data use to inform policy and
programming,”167 which is difficult to attain without deliberate results-based outputs, activities, and
indicators. As for street connected children, they only appear in NCPS II’s implementation strategy without
a prior situation analysis, and indicators specific focus on the street child herself/himself.
In the area of education, despite the MCO contributions, Malawi faces challenges as evidenced by
national statistics. For example, the primary school dropout rate has been increasing. The dropout rate
in 2021-2022 academic year was 4.7%168 (against 3.4% in 2021), while the secondary enrolment rate
continues to be low, making the prospects of Malawi reaching SDG 4 secondary education targets by 2030
unlikely. In terms of total number of primary schools, the period 2017-2021 evidenced a growth of
approximately 1.71 % per annum,169 which was expected to reduce the distance from school and have an
impact on addressing several challenges in critical areas, including quality of learning, accessibility, safety,
community participation and retention. However, measured against the location of students and the number
of additional schools during the period, Malawi is still challenged to have enough schools within the optimal
distance area.170
Consulted UNICEF and central government interviewees felt that promoting children’s right to education
will be difficult to achieve if existing coordination challenges between Pillar I and II continue to exist.
Government interviewees noted, “half of the 1 million learners who enrol in primary schools from ECD
centres annually either repeat or drop out, reflecting weak transitioning strategies that leave most primary
schools unprepared for the ECD graduates.” Questions that need to be answered include how collaboration
between ECD caregivers and the primary school teachers can be strengthened. Additionally, since
pedagogy in preschool is different from that in primary school, there is need to examine how primary school
and ECD curriculum (which is delivered through an offline tablet)171 could be aligned to teach those
graduating from ECD effectively.
Finally, the overall transition rate between lower and upper secondary education was 22% in 2018
(baseline) and had not changed by 2022. The transition rate between primary and lower secondary

38
education has barely moved for both boys and girls in Malawi. At baseline (2018), 35% of girls and 34% of
boys were transitioning; yet by June 2022, only 36% of girls and 37% of boys were transitioning from primary
to lower secondary education (against the targets of 41 percent of girls and 38 percent respectively). The
fact that vulnerable boys (e.g., street connected children, boys from ultra-poor households) are omitted
from UNICEF’s education scholarships is also viewed as impacting poorly on overall education results.172
However, some UNICEF staff justified this exclusion of boys on the basis that the UNICEF scholarships
are mainly targeted at adolescent girls because of the vulnerabilities they encounter in accessing secondary
education, and yet secondary education is very essential for their development outcomes and future
potential. NGO stakeholders remarked that, overall, Malawi is still lacking a functional education system
that can deliver desired results for both girls and boys.
Systems Strengthening
The CP has strengthened the capacity of government institutions and CSOs, notably through the
development of sector planning documents, strategies, and policies opening pathways for system
strengthening. This is evident in the work of all three Pillars as demonstrated below.
In Pillar I, the CP contributed to the review of the Food and Nutrition Bill which is awaiting tabling in
the Malawi National Assembly for passing into law. The Code of Marking Infant and Young Child Foods
has also been reviewed. The CP supported enforcement of laws such as those on food fortification; and
integration of nutrition commodities such as ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF) into the Essential Health
Package (EHP).
In Pillar II, the MCO analytical work and policy consultations have contributed to the development
of national education strategies and policies. Of note, the Education Sector Analysis informed the
development of the National Education Sector Strategy (2020-2030), with key recommendations focusing
on affordable cost of secondary education, learning outcomes, and linking secondary education with skill
development. Besides, a review of free primary education was initiated focusing on quality improvements,
while an assessment of the implementation of the National Teacher Education Strategy was completed
with key recommendations focusing on reinforcing the continuous professional development of teachers,
especially women, and including persons with disability in the teachers’ workforce. Finally, a readmission
policy for girls who dropped out from school due to teenage pregnancy, early marriage and GBV was
introduced, and 600 girls were readmitted to complete secondary education.
In Pillar III, the MCO’s advocacy activities contributed to the Presidential assent to the National
Children’s Commission Act, as well as the passing of the Parliamentary motion to prioritize children in all
Parliamentary sittings and draft a Bill to establish a National Children’s Commission, which was passed and
assented to by the President in 2019. The adoption of the Social Work Practitioners Bill seeking to
professionalize the social service workforce and the signing of a “Call to action to end child marriage in
Malawi” are two other important achievements.173 In the systems strengthening and capacity
development domain, an important milestone consisted in the national scale-up of the SCTP through
improved targeting using the Unified Beneficiary Register, and through vertical and horizontal expansion
during annual lean season and scaling up of harmonized e-payment system.174 The Programme also
supported the rolling out of programme-based budgeting to local authorities to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of budget utilization, as well as a comprehensive review of the fiscal decentralization systems
in Malawi to improve the functionality of local government and strengthen sub-national PFM systems. An
action plan was developed on how to improve public finance management within the local government
system (see also Section 5.3.8).
The contribution to the SMS reporting systems for the Malawi Police Service, which allows police to
track changes in trends and frequency of reports of violence, and the continuous support to the collection
of administrative data through Rapid Pro for police, judiciary, and social welfare, as well as One Stop
172 By June 2022, only 37 percent of boys were transitioning from primary to lower secondary education from a baseline of 34
percent.
173 UNICEF Malawi Annual Reports (2019, 2020, 2021)
174 As of 2022, the national harmonized e-payment system has been scaled up to 4 districts and being used to disburse social cash
transfers to 39,527 households (over 97,000 individual members)
39
centres, are equally commendable. These elements of systems strengthening were widely viewed by
national and district stakeholders consulted in this evaluation as critical to break the silence on violence
against children and women and ensure they receive the services they need.
Finally, several policies and strategies aimed at putting the child at the centre of all government
planning were developed and/or revised with the MCO support. These include: the review of the
National Decentralization Policy, the revision of the National Youth Policy and the development of a National
Youth Investment plan; the development of a Climate Resilient WASH financing strategy, the development
of the National Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy (2018-2023), the development of a 2-year National Plan
on Mental Health and Psycho-Social Support (MHPSS), the review of Adoption Act, the review and
gazetting of Regulations for the Child Care, Justice, and Protection Act to improve implementation, the
development of National Child Protection Strategy (2022-26) and its National Plan for Action (NAP).
All categories of stakeholders consulted at national and sub-national levels acknowledge that the
strengthened national and sub-national systems and institutional capacities constitute an important
building block for effective provision of improved basic services in Malawi. However, they recognize also
that the technical and financial capacity required to implement these instruments remains problematic in
the absence of continued support by UNICEF and other partners.
Challenges in achieving optimal results
Internally, the issue of insufficient funding has been consistently emphasized by consulted stakeholders
as having played a significant role in limiting the achievement of results. Although financial resources may
have been adequate for delivering on most planned intermediate results, such as piloting interventions,
revising policy documents, and delivering trainings, resources have remained insufficient for meeting the
CP objectives.
Externally, the issue of limited awareness of the Pillar approach among UNICEF partners has been
cited by many interviewees as an important impediment to achieving results. Consulted UNICEF staff
acknowledge that, initially, section chiefs and top management did a lot of presentations to government and
donor communities to explain the new MCO’s approach, but it seems that achieving buy-in has been
challenging. The interviews established that the GoM does not apply the LCA and, as such, all MDAs, and
government structures still work with the MCO through a sector-based approach that generally aligns with
the technical sections (education, protection, WASH, etc.). Interviewees noted that more work needs to be
done to encourage the integration across different sectors at the Malawi government level.
For example, there were challenges identified in differences between the MoE and MoH on their approach
to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Notably, the MoE will not allow people to go into
schools to teach on comprehensive sexual health education and will not allow the distribution of condoms
given different opinions about sexual education. Hence, UNICEF and other partners are trying to find
common ground in terms of policies between the two ministries.
Donor funding modalities is another factor emphasized during interviews as limiting the effects of the
Pillar approach on children results. UNICEF staff confirmed that, for the most part, MCO resources
mobilisation strategy is still sector-driven, which often limits efforts towards pillar programming and
operationalising joint interventions. This is linked to the fact that not many donors are flexible, as they
tend to have target areas and make funding available primarily through thematic interventions,
which often made it challenging to allocate pillar budget in a cross-sectoral and integrated manner. Due to
these factors, the current CP has suffered from lack of significant integrated packages of intervention
funded by donors and implemented in an integrated manner. Consulted UNICEF staff felt that there has
not been full integration and programmatic convergence in part because the current CP interventions were
designed as standalone interventions. As such, integration efforts have often been done after the
interventions have already been designed and funded.
40
Finding 13: While there is evidence of effective cross-sectoral collaborations across pillars, such
collaborations are not equally and fully operational in all three pillars. Sectoral silos continue in practice,
which has slowed down provision of integrated children’s services and achievement of results.
The evaluation found evidence of effective cross-sectoral collaborations within and across the three
Programme pillars, but they are limited to a few sectors.
Cross-pillar collaborations are best reflected in programmes like WASH in schools and WASH in
health care facilities which are implemented through Pillar II and Pillar I respectively, with
contributions of WASH experts who technically belong to Pillar III. According to interviews, this arrangement
allowed for effective and efficient utilization of the budget allocated to WASH services in Pillar I and Pillar
II, which was previously not easy without the technical knowledge of a WASH specialist. The latter also
contributes to Pillar I proposal writing processes, ensuring that WASH elements are considered and have
budget once funding is granted.
The MCO has also made efforts to increase cross-pillar collaboration through joint proposal
development, and joint programming, although these efforts are still limited. For example, consulted
UNICEF Teams and documents in this evaluation confirmed that the three pillars jointly prepared a multi-
sectoral proposal, which helped the MCO to mobilize enough resources and implement a holistic COVID-
19 Response Plan.175
The MCO has also identified some important “inter-pillar programme priorities” which are
underpinned by the Pillar approach and are expected to boost cross-pillar collaborations and facilitate
the achievement of more cross-sectoral results. These priorities include the Child and Youth-Friendly
Community (CFYC) Initiative, ending child marriage and climate change.176 At the time of this evaluation,
the CFYC Initiative has been piloted in two districts of Chikwawa and Nsanje, demonstrating how sectoral
integration can be done in real-life involving all pillars into a multisector focus. Consulted district officials
confirmed that Chikwawa has already developed a CYFC Initiative strategic plan for the period 2022-2026
to guide the implementation (see also Section 5.3.7).
Despite the progress made, collaborations are not equally and fully operational across all three pillars
- sectoral silos continue in practice, which has slowed down achievement of integrated children’s
services and results. While the CP was able to deliver in a cross-pillar manner for certain sectors like
WASH, the same cannot be said for other sectors such as social policy and child protection. There were
some UNICEF interviewees who, according to their experience, viewed the Pillar approach as obstructing
collaboration at times. For example, the child protection section is represented in each of the Programme
pillars,177 but it seems that this has more weakened than strengthened the section, in terms of collaboration
with other sectors. Other staff indicated that cross-sectoral collaboration would happen in earnest when
there is more joint monitoring and joint proposal writing.
Similarly, interviews indicated that while Pillar I and Pillar II are supplied with matrixed staff by Pillar III (e.g.,
local governance experts who technically belong to the social policy section), the opposite is not always
true in the case of Pillar III. Furthermore, all sections that may need particular “matrixed staff positions”
have not necessarily obtained them, which has hampered achievement of sound results. For example,
during interviews, child protection staff felt concerned that the biggest gap in child protection was SBC
because every section, except theirs, has it. It is felt that a strategic way to address this gap is to matrix
SBC to child protection so that there is always someone to focus on the sensitive issues the portfolio tackles,
instead of only accessing SBC staff when they are not busy elsewhere. Overall, there seems to be an equity
issue in Human Resources across pillars, as some pillars have special budget officers that other sections
or pillars do not have, while some sections have more Temporary Appointments than others.

5.3.3 Contribution of SBC
Finding 14: There is evidence that SBC activities implemented through the three Pillars have been
effective in some areas to contribute to changes in social norms and behaviors of targeted individuals
and communities for the benefit of the rights of children. But in other areas, SBC has been less effective
at shifting perceptions and transforming gender norms, and more work needs to be done to develop
and implement effective strategies. Despite being generally recognized as central to work across three
pillars, SBC activities are perceived as receiving the least funding and are generally of a short-term
nature, which limits their contribution to Programme results. SBC activities that can spur transformation
could be further prioritized by UNICEF since some are not even part of program design but are only
introduced years after implementation has started. While some behaviors changed during COVID 19,
this change was not comprehensive enough due to limitations of Risk Communication and Community
Engagement (RCCE) strategies.
The evaluation findings demonstrate that SBC (then C4D) interventions have been child-centric and
gender responsive and have increased uptake of services. Interviewed stakeholders both within the
MCO and implementing partners believe that SBC activities fostered programmatic convergence (across
all three Pillars) and helped many duty bearers (e.g., parents, families, district councils, and community
leaders) to be aware of their responsibilities in ensuring respect of children’s rights. They also acknowledge
that children as rights holders (especially the poor and vulnerable) were targeted to help them understand
and realise their rights and, ultimately, foster their inclusion in local and national development processes.
Focus group discussions in visited districts have confirmed that these SBC activities have helped them
change the way they behave and their attitudes to different issues. In that regard, community members
have been enabled to prepare and act timely to reduce the possibility of harm and loss from disasters,
parents have started adopting child-friendly practices, etc.
Under Pillars I and II, there has been general awareness on desired health, sanitation and hygiene
and nutrition behaviours and corresponding improvements on the indicators as reported in specific
project level evaluations. In 2021, a total of 4,905,609 primary caregivers of children aged 0-23 months
received Infant and Young Child Nutrition (IYCN) counselling in the context of COVID-19. Complementary
feeding of children 6-23 months improved via the care groups and care givers in households who are trained
on infant and young child feeding with a focus on complementary feeding module. The proportion of children
being fed Minimum Dietary Diversity rose from 30.4 percent to 39.3 percent and Minimum Acceptable Diet
(MAD) from 24.3 percent to 26.6 percent (Afikepo KAP Survey 2020 and 2021, respectively).178 In 2022,
over 10 million people were reached with lifesaving messages on COVID-19, cholera, and polio, with
400,000 having engaged in feedback.179
In terms of gender responsive SBC interventions, interviewees and documents indicate success in
acceptance and uptake of HPV vaccination, with 233,000 girls vaccinated in 2019.180 Furthermore,
interviewees mentioned that under Pillar I, gender responsive interventions included campaigns, such as
on violence free child disciplining by parents and guardians. Positive fatherhood campaigns were also
conducted to raise awareness of the role of fathers in child caring practices. It has been reported that in
2022, 1,423,043 parents and caregivers have been reached “with targeted parenting programmes at
community level”, with an additional 1 million “online audiences…engaged with information on positive
parenting through “Global parenting month” (and) ECD media campaign.”181
SBC further addressed gender bias in child feeding practices to ensure that girls’ nutrition is not
compromised by cultural taboos that prevent girls from eating certain foods. Furthermore, for ECD, a
‘positive socialization package for caregivers’ was developed. As for Pillar II, SBC interventions included a
general campaign on menstrual hygiene management (MHM), which involved the development of MHM
Training Manuals and Guidelines in collaboration with Ministry of Education. One high impact outcome of
this campaign was that at national level, Parliament removed taxes on menstrual pads. SBC also tackled
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and child marriage as issues overlapping Pillars II and III,

including by strategically working with thousands of faith and traditional leaders to ensure vulnerable
populations, including adolescents, young women and children with disabilities, are reached with critical
information.
Under Pillar III, there was consciousnesses to ensure that Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) materials were not perpetuating gender stereotypes. With regards to specific
campaigns focused on WASH and menstrual hygiene, interviewed teachers and learners said the cultural
practice of locking up a girl who had started menstruation was significantly reducing. UNICEF and NGO
interviewees also noted that Pillar III SBC efforts promoted boys’ and girls’ participation in decentralization
structures, and this included district campaigns for girls and boys to contribute to discussions in Village
Development Committees (VDCs), Area Development Committees (ADCs) and District Executive
Committees (DEC). Program results do not vividly demonstrate the results of these campaigns at the three
levels; however, a Spotlight Initiative partner in Mzimba gave the example of a Youth Club that engaged
the ADC to construct a health centre with a maternity wing in order to meet health needs of children and
pregnant mothers, among others. A site visit by the evaluation team confirmed ongoing work to construct a
big health centre with funding from the Community Development Fund (CDF). With respect to inclusion,
UNICEF and NGO interviewees observed that under Pillar III, IEC materials have been deliberately
inclusive. For example, messages were simplified by using pictorial materials, which effectively reached
the illiterate and those who are slow to grasp written content.
However, not all SBC work has been as effective. For example, there are issues with COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance as identified in interviews and documents, with men having a lower uptake rate overall.182 And
issues of culture and traditional practices are still noted in many documents as a challenge. For example,
the endline evaluation of the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) Survival programme noted that
“in both the project and comparison districts patriarchal societies are the main drivers of low demand in
accessing MNCH services.”183
Generally, the evaluation identified some areas of SBC improvement. To start with, site visits to schools
(e.g., in Kasungu and Mzimba) found that learners participating in platforms that have been created under
Spotlight or Safe Schools/JPGE III are just given verbal information on child-related rights/issues, with no
IEC materials in sight (e.g., posters) to continue reinforcing the messages daily.
In the case of JPGE III, there are concerns by UNICEF and NGO staff that SBC campaigns have been
generic without focusing on and addressing context specific factors that facilitate poor education attainment
by girls and boys in different localities. For example, it was noted that some localities are notorious for the
migration of young men to South Africa; some for fishing activities; and some for sending out young girls to
urban/peri-urban areas to work as domestic workers. As a UNICEF interviewee noted, “customized SBC
interventions that say to communities ‘we understand and are keen to respond to the peculiar
needs/challenges facing your children/young people’ would be more effective at driving change.”
Another challenge identified by NGO partners is that SBC in some programs is not treated as important
as in other program areas. As an NGO interviewee observed, “for example, under the JPGE, SBC
activities, implemented through Story Workshop, were only initiated three years after the start of the
program instead of right from the beginning.” In addition, interviewees felt the MCO had not prioritised SBC
as seen from three perspectives: low funding (some implementing partners experienced what they called
“unrealistic budget cuts” in their proposals to UNICEF); short-term nature of the SBC projects; and not
including SBC from the programme design stage: “We think some resources were not fully mobilized and
allocated. For instance, Social and Behaviour Change Communication was not fully integrated from the
beginning” (interview).
On their part, FGDs of Afikepo caregivers joined government district staff in observing that branded
materials such as T-shirts and clothes wrappers (zitenje) are usually in short supply despite being a way of
disseminating information, giving project participants a collective identity, and inspiring others who have not
yet joined the interventions. A uniform approach would communicate to relevant project beneficiaries that
UNICEF cares about equity and equality.

Overall, UNICEF staff and UN partners recognized the fact that in the quest to achieve gender
transformative results, SBC should comprehensively address the issue of gender norms as a subset of
social norms, instead of generalizing ‘social norms’. In terms of inclusion, the police noted the absence of
messages targeting children with albinism despite the life-threatening challenges that they face (e.g.,
abductions for ritual/black magic purposes).
Generally, while the SBC activities implemented with the support of UNICEF Malawi are widely
perceived by the partners as likely to make a significant contribution to shifting individual and
community beliefs, values, and social norms in the field of children's rights in Malawi, it is still difficult to
achieve their ultimate impact at societal level, if they are not implemented at scale. Certainly, the
SBC activities have created important output-level results, but it is still early to tell whether these results will
lead to sustainable shifts in social norms. As indicated by most implementing partners, notably NGOs, most
of these SBC interventions were implemented within the framework of short-term plans (e.g., three months)
and some as pilot initiatives. All stakeholders informing this evaluation acknowledged that the SBC-related
initiatives have created some momentum, which should be kept and brought to scale and through long-
term interventions to create meaningful shifts in social norms. This should include ensuring that SBC is
universally matrixed to all programming areas within UNICEF, including those working towards positive
cultural and gender norms, e.g., through child protection and other development interventions. Furthermore,
for SBC to reinforce foundational systems to work with communities across pillars, there is a need for a
high-level coordination of the SBC capacity in the Office, with real technical supervision of the matrixed
staff by the SBC manager.
Under the COVID-19 response, UNICEF remarkably applied innovation to quickly establish platforms for
capturing and sharing feedback, such as U-Report, SMS and the Humanitarian Field Monitoring
Dashboard.184 Furthermore, the MCO and its partners refocused SBC activities on emergency activities,
and collaborated with the media to highlight the impacts of COVID-19 on children and families.185 Risk
Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) was deployed as one of the main channels to raise
awareness and capture feedback from communities. However, an evaluation of the COVID-19 response
acknowledged shortcomings related to contradictions of public messages as well as misinformation;
cumbersome processes to get messages validated for dissemination; resistance by some health staff to
adopt protective measures; and limited access to messages in rural communities.186 The evaluation
observed that “one key lesson was that RCCE in rural areas achieved limited results due to poor access to
radio and other media and lack of adequate engagement with communities. While there were occasional
face-to-face or van messaging platforms, they could not achieve permanent awareness and behavioral
change due to lack of consistent reinforcement of the messages.”187 Another lesson drawn was that
“influencers and youth clubs at community level can be the drivers of change on awareness and practices
but need more support to become the link between the new messaging and the traditional communities.”188

5.3.4 Contribution of Innovation
Finding 15: The Malawi – UNICEF Country Programme has supported the identification and
introduction of promising innovations for application in Malawi. Innovation activities to date have been
aligned with Programme objectives, with efforts to improve access to data and information tools, and
to support real-time monitoring. Various degrees of successful piloting and scaling of innovations were
observed in different districts in Malawi, with concrete results in terms of responding to the humanitarian
and development needs of children. Although the Country Office has been able to mobilize innovation
capacity internally (by setting up an innovation unit, with staff), the lack of a clear innovation governance
framework and of long-term funding mechanisms to bring UNICEF-supported flagship innovations to
scale limits the performance of the innovation unit and the contribution of innovation approaches to
overall Programme results.
The evaluation found that the CP has made important contributions in introducing potential innovations to
help accelerate results for children in Malawi. As of 2022, the CP has a large innovation portfolio comprising
47 innovation initiatives that fall under three major bins: (1) digital innovations, (2) programme innovations,
and (3) data innovations.189 Appendix XVIII provides details of the CP innovation portfolio. innovation
portfolio comprises technological and non-technological innovations, which, according to some
interviewees, has contributed to shifting the perceptions of MCO staff who generally used to equate
innovation with “technological innovation”. The MCO’s innovation activities are highly aligned with the CP
objectives, as they aimed mostly to improve access to data and information, while responding to the
humanitarian and development needs of children. The following examples demonstrate that various
degrees of successful piloting and scaling of innovations have been achieved, with concrete results.
With reference to digital innovations, accounting for 47% of the total portfolio, a variety of initiatives and
approaches have been supported. These include the “Intelligent Community Health Information System”
(ICHIS) which was piloted in Kasungu district in 2021 and aims to improve access to and use of community-
based data through an integrated digital platform.190 The “Child Protection Information Management
System” (CPIMS) has been migrated to the RapidPro platform and, following a pilot phase, was scaled up
nationally and is now successfully used by the Police, the National Child Justice Forum, and the Ministry of
Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare (MoG CDSW). Also, worth mentioning are RapidPro-based
applications such as the “COVID-19 Quarantine management” (mQuarantine) that allowed the Ministry of
Health to interact with those in self-isolation and quarantine and track in real-time their conditions,191 and
the RapidPro-based Nutrition Commodities Tracking System which was scaled up nationally and was being
utilized by 270 health facilities to monitor stocks across 28 districts nationwide in 2019,192 and the U-Report,
a free mobile-based opinion polling service, which regularly collects perspectives from young Malawians.
Support to programme innovations, which represent 28% of the total portfolio, has benefited initiatives
such as the “African Drone and Data Academy” (ADDA) which seeks to equip youth in Malawi and
elsewhere with skills they need to use drones to benefit children and their communities. Interviews revealed
that, at the time of the evaluation, about 675 young people193 from 25 countries (60% female, 50%
Malawian) have graduated from the ADDA (see also Section 5.3.7). The MCO also supported the
integration of “Human-centred and design thinking techniques” into the various programs to accelerate
service delivery. UNICEF-supported programme innovations also include the “COVID-19 Youth Innovation
Challenge”194 which enabled 6,200 participants to obtain design thinking skills and ideate solutions to
combat the pandemic.
Finally, data innovations, which represent 13% of the total portfolio, appear to be an increasing priority in
the MCO innovation work. The evaluation found that real-time data collection, geo-information and satellite
imagery have been used to inform programme design and that data-related technology has been invested
in and scaled up to strengthen the implementation, effectiveness and focus of the CP. The use of drones
and geospatial technologies in the areas of emergency response, disaster preparedness and community

resilience, and strengthening of health supply chains, illustrates the importance of this type of innovations.
For example, the 4P2C Data Intelligence, a GIS data hub, has been scaled up to support oversight and
decision-making of Nutrition, Social Policy, Education, and Community Development and Resilience (CDR)
programs.195 Collected data is organized and analysed into a common infrastructure under the 4P2C data
platform.196 Worth mentioning is also the “Climate Change Flood Modelling initiative” which aims to
strengthen the communities and government’s capacity to prepare for and respond to flood disasters, using
remote sensors and satellite imagery.197
Despite the above achievements, there are several factors which still limit the performance of the MCO
innovation programme and its influence on the CP results. During interviews, it was consistently recognized
by UNICEF staff that the innovation programme has suffered from lack of a strong institutional
architecture and clear governance framework. Until recently, the Office did not have an explicit
innovation strategy, which implied insufficient clarity about how MCO intended to go about innovation, what
it intended to achieve, and how staff across the pillar’s sections could contribute.
In 2022, an innovation strategy was drafted but, at the time of writing, this strategy has not yet been
endorsed and adopted (as it was still getting inputs from the UNICEF ESARO and HQ for finalization).198
Consulted UNICEF staff at country and regional level felt that the adoption and implementation of this
strategy would constitute an important step towards consolidating innovation achievements. The draft
strategy highlights the gravitas of a governance framework that will help MCO to rethink its innovation
programme, notably by focusing on a more well-balanced portfolio that delivers high impact across the CP
pillars.
Although the MCO has established an innovation unit with a formal responsibility of facilitating innovation
work across the CP pillars and other components, the dual misalignment on the role of innovation and
its value added to Programmes has limited its influence. The mentality in the past was that innovation
involves standalone (digital and technological) experiments that are separate from broader country office-
level outputs or - assumed - to have their own. The lack of understanding that innovations should be
Programme-led (and supported by the Innovation Unit) is believed to have contributed to the
miscoordination of innovation interventions. Interviews also indicated that, at times, the innovation unit
suffered from a lack of continued leadership and, at the time of this evaluation, the Programme Officers for
various innovation streams in this unit had different “temporary” reporting lines, which was due to vacancies
in the section, most notably the Innovation Manager.199 Consulted staff, including from the innovation unit,
emphasized that this situation has negatively affected how innovation and the innovation unit are perceived
internally, by other MCO teams.
Another challenging feature of the MCO innovation work is that many of the supported initiatives are
pilots of which costing analysis is yet to be done to gain an in-depth understanding of their cost-
effectiveness (compared to possible alternatives). For example, all consulted sources, including the
summative evaluation of the drone initiative,200 emphasize the need to understand the cost of using drones,
to objectively give guidance on sustainability or scaling up of the drone technology.
Finally, it appeared that the mainstreaming (and scale up) of UNICEF-supported innovations into national
systems requires preconditions which are not readily available in Malawi, notably government
leadership in public innovation financing. Interviews with MCO and ESARO innovation experts revealed
that, although the GoM is generally open to and supportive of innovations, it lacks financial resources to
bring promising innovations to scale. The situation is further complicated by the fact that innovation
initiatives in Malawi are often donor driven; yet not many donors are committed to the objective of achieving
scale. Most consulted stakeholders believe that as MCO’s innovation work evolves and takes on new
challenges, new partnerships will be important to bring successful pilots to scale, including engaging the
private sector.

5.3.5 Contribution of Performance Monitoring system
Finding 16: The Malawi – UNICEF Country Programme’s Results Framework includes intermediate
and impact results, as well as process-oriented and outcome-oriented indicators. The monitoring
system is adequate for planning and measuring progress towards overall Program objectives and is
also specific enough to capture Pillar/sectoral and output differences. Timely technical tracking of
progress has been done and indicators are measured and monitored through RAMs, but there is room
for improvement, as there are many indicators where evidence needs to be generated in a more timely
manner to improve tracking progress on output targets and progress towards Outcome achievement.
The evaluation found that the performance monitoring system of the CP results is based on a Results
Resources Framework that is presented at detailed level, associated upwards with UNICEF, UNSF,
UNDAF and SDGs I in the CP Plan. All relevant results are presented with associated baseline, and
gender disaggregated targets. Results expected are associated with targets on process-oriented and
outcome-oriented indicators. As such, the monitoring system is adequate for planning and measuring
progress towards overall Program objectives. Annual reports from RAM follow global guidelines for
reporting focusing on assessment of progress for outcomes and outputs, based on progress in achievement
of annual indicator targets.
Concerning the location of UNICEF inputs and results identified in the MCO Monitoring Framework,
the evaluation found that geolocation associates the relevance of the expected results, targets and
indicators at the Outcome and associated Output level. This aspect of the results attribution is highly
important for the purposes of attribution and reflecting where UNICEF is targeting its resources, expects
results and the relevance of its work. Yet for Outcome 1-4 and associated outputs, geolocation identifies
Malawi – MW. Only Outcome 5 indicates Central - MW2, Northern - MW1, Southern - MW3, Malawi – MW
as the geolocation.
With regards to on-site verification/observation, the assessment showed that two new indicators
were added in Output 5.7 - cross cutting programme coordination support: indicator 5.7-13 - Percentage
of programme visit recommendations completed (69865) and indicator 5.7-17 - Percentage of spot-check
recommendations closed (69866). This is attributable to the need to identify progress towards
implementation of initiatives and to verify the appropriateness of efforts. In addition, spot checks and site
visits often yield opportunities to observe unintended results or consequences, to identify specific needs for
technical assistance for example. Worth mentioning is that UNICEF uses external field monitors, and they
were highly praised by district stakeholders as playing an important role in facilitating quality delivery of the
CP interventions (particularly in the health sector). Importantly, the MCO achieved or was on track to
achieve most HACT targets.
Data gaps have been identified indicating that some aspects of evidence gathering are challenging
for the MCO. For example, there is strong evidence to show that social protection is not only important as
an income multiplier, but also contributes to human capital formation, through education and skills building
as well as health and nutrition improvements in Malawi. Due to gaps in technical data, UNICEF has provided
technical assistance to government-led data collection and information management systems that have
supported targeting and programming.
In addition, M&E frameworks in many MDAs have data gaps issues and cannot conduct essential analysis
for preparation of MDAs progress reports – which affect the extent to which the CP performance monitoring
and evaluation can be conducted.201 Child protection is supporting various information management
systems, but there is a need for capacity building for SWs and police to be generating robust data.
There is a strong need for data upgrading. For example, the evaluation found that violence against
children data was last compiled in 2013. It is very costly, and the new CP should incorporate this as priority.
MICS missed data on access and quality of justice (diversion), violent discipline in homes and home care
institutions. Sexual abuse and violence against boys remain a grey area since most interventions are
focusing on girls. However, through the innovation section, the CP has introduced some innovations aimed
to improve the situation. Among others, the MCO introduced new digital technologies to accelerate results

47
such as RapidPro and drones as part of digital innovations and used advanced data science applications
to improve UNICEF’s programmatic response such as 4P2C, Flood Modelling as part of data innovation
(see also section 5.3.4).
The MCO has established a Research, Evaluation and Knowledge Management (REKM) section which
supports programme management, monitoring and evaluation. The focus of this section goes beyond
regular programme evaluations to generate (and disseminate) evidence on the performance of the CP
interventions, to include studies in response to national priorities as well as other research in an effort to
consolidate lessons learned and facilitate knowledge-sharing. The REKM section also participates in
programme monitoring and annual reviews with government and other counterparts to assess progress
and to determine required action/interventions to achieve results.
Finally, when it comes to reporting, the CP uses Results Assessment Module (RAM) in programme
assessment with a statutory reporting requirement of twice a year. Assessment reports are produced
regularly and documented. In addition, through the programme effectiveness section, the CP supports the
National Statistical Office (NSO) to carry out surveys to track outcome level indicators. A closer look at the
RAM and Annual Reports (2019, 2020, 2021, Mid-2022) showed that they are thorough and well prepared
and accompanied by output level results, narratives, and measurement of progress towards target
achievement. These are aligned with Annual Management Plan (AMP), RAM and COAR where pillars are
colour coded and the associated RAM report by WBS code. The code is reflected in all documents.
Programme performance is established, innovations/best practices, gaps are identified, and remedial steps
are well documented. For example, during COVID-19, a number of technological innovations were
implemented including development of platforms such RapidPro, U report helped continue service provision
through remaining in touch with programme beneficiaries.
Two useful tables contained in the AMP 2020-MCO 2019-2023 Hierarchy of Results and Annual
Management Plan Indicators were not contained in the AMP 2021. These two are well presented and clear
tables which allow users to easily identify programmatic emphasis and the indicators of change. Finally, the
performance monitoring system has positively contributed through providing dashboard and
comprehensive programme implementation status. The statutory requirements for programme review twice
a year are adhered to and documented as seen from internal reports.
5.3.6 Contribution of gender, equity, human rights, and inclusion
Finding 17: The Malawi – UNICEF Country Programme’s life cycle approach has provided an
opportunity to identify practical gender-responsive interventions for all phases of the child’s life cycle,
thereby facilitating child-centred, gender equality (and sometimes inclusive) results in the pillars.
However, inconsistency in generating and/or utilizing appropriately disaggregated data sometimes
challenges the ability to underline the concrete contribution of gender, equity, and social inclusion
approaches to pillar results.
Under Pillar I, the MCO Gender Equality Strategy has amplified gender responsive health and nutrition
services.202 Local government nutrition staff identified the Afikepo Programme as having contributed to
program results even in remote parts of Malawi203 through its deliberate focus on children under five,
pregnant women, adolescent mothers (who, according to district staff, were being left behind) and gate
keepers (men and other local decision makers who influence social norms that affect child health and
nutrition). The CP also utilized the gender approach to build a culture of positive parenting practices
in ECD, including to overcome low male participation in these programmes by working with male
champions called ‘super dads.’ However, the absence of disaggregated baseline and monitoring data at
times makes it difficult to account for the contribution of such interventions to pillar results. For example,
the MCO generically reported reaching 587,810 mothers, fathers, and caregivers through parenting
programmes in 2021,204 as well as “a slight increase in fathers' involvement in care giving to their children

. . . and timely vaccination of 92 percent of children.”205 Figures showing how the numbers of involved
fathers have improved overtime are lacking.
Indeed, the MCO reporting (RAMs)206 betrays a general pattern of omitting gender disaggregated
data under Pillar I, a concern for other evaluations too. For example, the evaluation of an MNC project
noted that “there were no gender and human rights targets and indicators in the project results framework.
Consequently, there were no data collection tools for capturing gender and human rights indicators in the
project.”207 The lack of monitoring data for people with disabilities is also noted as a challenge.208 Though
door to door and mobile vaccine services have indisputably reached those with disabilities as well as those
in hard-to-reach areas,209 no specific data is routinely provided on how many were reached this way. Where
people with disabilities were reportedly reached by health interventions (e.g., for COVID-19 messaging),
the number is way below the proportion of people with disabilities,210 which is 11.6% of the total Malawi
population above 5 years.211
Under Pillar II, there is a direct correlation between human rights and equity considerations and the
CP results that have been witnessed through the provisional of educational support to vulnerable rural
communities during emergencies (e.g., COVID-19 and tropical storms/cyclones). Several interventions
were inherently gender responsive (e.g., Safe Schools under JPGE III, Spotlight Initiative’s SGBV
interventions) and led to the achievement of several milestones under the results framework. For example,
in 2021, it was reported that 262,627 children (128,702 girls and 123,927 boys) had improved confidence
and skills to prevent and protect themselves from violence and were able to demand protection services
and access violence reporting, referral and response services.212 Results have been equally achieved in
terms of addressing the needs of children with disabilities, including albinism. For example, it has been
reported that, in 2022, with UNICEF support, 108,906 children (56,617 girls) including out-of-school children
were screened at the school to identify children with various functional difficulties. This screening on early
identification of children with disabilities was done by 640 specialist teachers (324 females) who received
comprehensive training prior to conducting this activity. Over 270 children (52 percent girls) were identified
and referred for further clinical assessment. This was the first time ever that the Ministry of Health closely
collaborated with the Ministry of Education to conduct mobile clinical assessments. The provision of
assistive devices and treatment has helped children to fully participate in classes, thereby contributing to
their learning experience.213
Quantitatively, some transformational gender approaches in interventions such as Safe Schools
Program are challenging attitudes and beliefs, and changes in gendered social norms are starting
to be visible (for example boys respecting and protecting girls more through empowerment transformation
trainings).214 Additionally, WASH interventions (e.g., construction of girls’ washrooms), as well as provision
of girls’ scholarships and construction of boarding hostels have aimed at improving education results for
girls. Interviewees at school level confirmed that girls’ washrooms have reduced girls’ absenteeism.
Inclusive programming is inherently part of Pillar II strategies, resulting in markable improvements in the
quality of disability data in EMIS. For example, 2021 EMIS data meticulously captures sex-disaggregated
data on students with disabilities, further disaggregated by area of functional difficulty (e.g., learning
difficulty, visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical disability, albinism, and deaf/dumb).
Under Pillar III, the CP has supported the social protection flagship program, the SCTP – which aligns well
with the GoM’s objective to eradicate poverty. Child protection interviewees at UNICEF, government and
NGO levels further highlighted that Pillar III results are being harnessed by interventions to address

key national child protection issues such as birth registration, child marriage, child labour and
gender-based violence in both development and emergency settings. Generally, interviewees
suggested that the pillar is supporting MDAs to achieve their statutory mandates in various ways, including
through ensuring that there is civic education on national (child) laws (Law Commission), that laws related
to children as well as juvenile offenders are being implemented from a child protection perspective (police),
and that births are registered (NRB). For example, interviewees at the national police headquarters
emphasized how provisions relating to diversion (alternative means of sorting out child cases to prevent
detention) under the Child Care and Justice Act have received sharp focus under the CP, and middle
managers were trained on how they can support diversion efforts of police child protection officers better.
This has been important for marginalized groups of children in conflict with the law who often lack a voice.
5.3.7 Contribution of Youth Empowerment and Climate Change
Finding 18: The Malawi-UNICEF Country Programme interventions have contributed to the
empowerment of the Malawian youth, notably by strengthening the enabling environment for them and
by equipping them with civic competencies that enable their participation in decisions that affect their
lives and the lives of their communities. Although on a limited scale, some Programme-supported
interventions have also built the skills of youth and created job opportunities through social innovation
and entrepreneurship. By mainstreaming climate change in its interventions, the CP achieved many
results in terms of building resilience to reduce the impacts of climate on the most vulnerable children
in Malawi.
Youth Empowerment
The CP has promoted youth empowerment in Malawi through the creation of an enabling
environment for them, notably the revision of the National Youth Policy and the development of a National
Youth Investment plan. These two instruments provide an opportunity to develop an integrated approach
to embed youth empowerment in a more structured way into the design and implementation of the
Programme’s activities and initiatives. There are early indications of such a shift, with UNICEF addressing
youth empowerment more directly and intentionally, as seen in the design and piloting of the CYFCI in
Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts. District stakeholders consulted in Chikwawa acknowledge that the pilot
has demonstrated the potential of the CYFCI to foster youth participation in development issues. Of note,
they also confirmed that active participation of young people through District council structures has been
critical to the development of the District’s CYFCI strategic plan for the period 2022-2026. Consulted
UNICEF staff and external stakeholders believe that, if implemented at scale, the CYFCI is likely to help
the Government of Malawi and other duty bearers to respond to the challenge of realizing the rights of youth
in communities.
Consulted stakeholders further observed that throughout the CP period, young people were
empowered to engage in decision-making processes at the school and community levels, through
student clubs and councils, for example. In 2020 alone a total of 200 youth led organizations were registered
with the National Youth Council, providing more opportunities for young people to voice their concerns and
contribute to the national dialogue about developmental issues. Almost 4,000 out-of-school clubs in 28
districts were established as a platform for youth participation at community level. UNICEF provided training
and support to district-level authorities and frontline staff members, which allowed approximately 10,000
adolescents (4,200 girls and 5,800 boys) and young people to access improved youth-friendly services,
including skills training and sports activities provided by the youth centres.215
The CP has also supported interventions that aimed to equip youth with entrepreneurship skills
and/or open opportunities for them to get a job. According to the ADDA manager at MCO level, the
surveys conducted to determine the impact of the ADDA have revealed that 70% of responding graduates
either got a job, promotion, or are involved in consultancy. In Malawi, particularly, the ADDA initiative has
attempted to link graduate students with employers. At the time of interviews, at least 11 graduates were

being employed by three drone operators in the Country,216 and the MCO was discussing with the operators
about having an MoU to formalize the partnership.
Another initiative which aimed at strengthening youth entrepreneurship skills is the COVID-19 Youth
Innovation Challenge. Hosted by the MCO in partnership with Segal Family Foundation and the Social
Impact Incubator Malawi, the initiative benefitted a total of 6,248 people (aged 14-35 years) who participated
in the challenge by submitting their innovative ideas on how to fight COVID-19. Of this number, some 10
finalists went on to participate in a 21-day social impact incubation and mentorship programme and worked
to repurpose their ideas into market-based solutions. It has been reported that each of the top five was
awarded US$2,000 to build a prototype of their solutions with post-incubation support.
Climate Change
The CP achieved many results in terms of building resilience to reduce the impacts of climate change on
the most vulnerable children’s populations in Malawi. On the one hand, the CP supported the conduct of
Malawi’s second CLAC which identified all 28 districts in Malawi as being directly exposed to climate
hazards and indicated that drought and flooding are becoming more common in certain parts of the
country.217 Consultations with key stakeholders in this evaluation, including UNICEF staff, donors, and
government representatives, consistently emphasized that the CLAC study has contributed to increased
focus on climate change in UNICEF’s domains of interventions in Malawi.
Based on the information collected through both secondary and primary sources, the CP has implemented
interventions which provide sustainable access to WASH services in schools, healthcare facilities
and communities, while addressing the risks associated with climate change.218 In particular,
UNICEF-supported solar-powered water systems were widely viewed among consulted WASH
stakeholders as making a big contribution to improved access to sustainable water services by the people
of Malawi.
For example, in 2020 alone, UNICEF supported the construction of 13 solar water schemes (serving more
than 57,000 people) and piloted market-based sanitation services in rural areas, benefiting 24,000
people.219 In 2021, an additional 14 solar powered water schemes were constructed, serving 89,450 people
(communities: 51,232 in development context and 19,550 in humanitarian situations; 16,737 learners; 164
teachers; 1,767 pupils in children’s corners, and 62,018 people gained access to basic sanitation services).
These results made a little, yet useful contribution to improving the WASH situation in Malawi.
In Pillar I and Pillar II, the WASH section contributed to streamlining of climate change and climate resilience
interventions by building on the work of other sections. Notably, there are aspects of the health system
strengthening work (e.g., solarization of health facilities) that can be linked to climate change as a
secondary focus. For example, in 2022, 17 health care facilities received climate resilient safe solar
powered water supply220 while solar panels for solar direct drive fridges were provided in 29 districts in
2019.221
At the enabling environment level, the MCO collaborated with other development partners to support the
development of a Climate Resilient WASH financing strategy and Programmatic Framework.222
Developed for the next ten years in alignment with the Malawi Nationally Determined Contributions,223 which
feature adaptation measures specific to the WASH sector, this strategy presents an opportunity for the
MCO to pursue an integrated approach to embed climate change considerations in a more structured,
direct, and intentional way into the design and implementation of the programme.

5.3.8 Contribution of Public Finance for Children (PF4C)
Finding 19: Public Finance for Children (PF4C) interventions were, to a large extent, able to deliver
the planned outputs and contribute to the Country Programme results. However, PF4C interventions
are contingent on institutional changes and reforms at all levels of government, which requires further
time for the full potential of PF4C interventions to be realized.

has been the enactment of the National
Children’s Commission Act and establishment of the National Children’s Commission.224
The Commission facilitates multisectoral coordination of children’s issues and programmes across
ministries and departments to ensure implementation of children’s rights. It also monitors allocations of
domestic and international resources earmarked for children’s programs.225 These results were achieved
thanks to UNICEF-supported research on public finance for child protection and strategic engagement with
relevant institutions including the Parliament and the President Office.226 As testament to the sustainability
of this structure (the Commission), Government and NGO interviewees noted that in the last two budget
cycles, GoM has funded processes to ensure that the Commission becomes operational.
During the CP period, the MCO began publishing budget briefs by section, as evidence generation
tools to provide inputs for advocacy efforts with the MoFEA and local ministries to mobilize funding
for children. In total, 46 budget briefs have been published since 2019. PF4C interventions have had a
significant influence on public spending in Malawi. PF4C has cultivated a space for public financial
management to be actively engaged with, produced several solid evidence-based advocacy initiatives, and
identified a niche for UNICEF to play a leading role with Government and other stakeholders. Most notably,
UNICEF has actively shaped discourse regarding policy and legal frameworks through the design and
operationalization of various processes, including financial instruments.
In fact, it has been reported that, in 2019, the MCO successfully advocated a 61% increase in the
government’s contribution towards the National SCTP.227 In addition, UNICEF analysis and advocacy
helped make education spending more equitable by eliminating school fees for the poorest and setting up
a public fund for scholarship for girls.228 As evidenced by the RAM, an indicator directly pertaining to PF4C
interventions regarding the share of public spending on sectors benefiting children indicates the actual
reported share of spending for 2019 was 32% of the national budget, equal to the 2021 target.229
Furthermore, PF4C activities contributed to the increase in budget allocations for vaccine procurement by

5 times in 2020/21 (from MK200 million in 2019/20 to MK1 billion in 2020/21).230 Finally, as of 2022, the
MCO had successfully mobilized USD 2.1 million in resources for PF4C related initiatives.231
The CP has strengthened capacity of stakeholders in budgeting at all levels of government to
improve spending outcomes for children. Notably, UNICEF has been working with the Malawian
Parliament to strengthen budget oversight function and with the Ministry of Finance, the National Local
Government Finance Committee and International Finance Institutions to reinforce the country’s public
financial management system.232 As a result, there has been an improvement in the budget allocations in
social sectors and programmes for children, including increases for vaccinations, secondary education,
early ECD, expansion of SCTP to cover urban areas, and increases in funding to Expanded Program on
Immunization (EPI).233,234,235 The CP has also supported local governments to implement plans and budgets
that reflect local child priorities and functioning social accountability mechanisms, which has implications
for both PF4C and CDR related outcomes. In 2021, 2% of local governments, including municipalities, have
implemented functioning social accountability mechanisms and specific activities to address child priorities,
which is half of the intended target for 2021.236 Furthermore, the CP has facilitated strategic, multisectoral
approaches in an integrated manner working with national, district, and community level structures to
enhance community engagement and participation, community feedback mechanisms, and
accountability to affected populations within COVID-19, and beyond.
The contribution of PF4C interventions to sustainable increases in public spending for children in Malawi is
still constrained by various factors. First, PF4C interventions are contingent on institutional changes and
reforms at all levels of the government, yet such changes are generally slow and take time to be fully
implemented and show results. Furthermore, as stated by several interviewees, both within UNICEF and
Government stakeholders, the MCO would benefit from the development of more communicative tools,
similar to factsheets and policy briefs, that illustrate the various initiatives undertaken to advance public
financial management and PF4C, including collaboration with various UN agencies and CSOs, for
stakeholders beyond direct implementing partners. Arguably, this could support resource mobilization for
the implementation of policy and legal frameworks and objectives.
5.3.9 Geographic Convergence
Finding 20: Despite the initial desire to focus on geographical convergence, the Malawi – UNICEF
Country Programme has not been able to provide coordinated, sectoral inputs in the same geographic
locations to address children’s needs in a holistic manner and create maximum impact in the living
conditions of children. Geographic convergence has been challenging to implement due to factors such
as lack of common understanding on the approach and the constant need to respond to emergencies.
At the design of the current CP, the MCO envisioned to follow a geographical convergence
approach,237 as stated in the CP document: “… the country programme will support targeted districts and
traditional authorities, selected on the basis of evidence, to enable integration and synergy to effectively,
holistically and equitably address children’s rights.”238 However, consultations with UNICEF staff and
external stakeholders indicated that there was a lack of application of geographical convergence as a
programme strategy despite being emphasized in the CP document. Document review confirmed that in
lieu of application of this approach, the CP was implemented across the three regions of Malawi (see
UNICEF Intervention Map in Appendix II).
The CP interventions have had various geographical scopes. For instance, the Afikepo programme was
implemented in 10 districts of Malawi; the MoH’s integrated ICCM platform targeted 13 districts, the MNH

53
network learning Health Facilities support was provided to nine targeted districts, while the community
behaviour tracking mechanism was scaled-up in 10 districts. Surely, each of these interventions has
addressed some issues of vulnerable and underserved groups and responded to needs of children and
women in the targeted districts, as the latter proved to be deprived of a variety of social services. However,
the fact that the different interventions did not necessarily target the same districts has limited their
collective impact; this has not allowed the many interventions to holistically address the needs of the same
target groups in the same areas, which is the aim of the geographical convergence approach.239 Many of
the consulted stakeholders acknowledged that the lack of convergence deprived the CP of various
advantages, including avoiding spreading the resources too thinly and providing an opportunity for joint
programming between the CP and development partners.
It appeared from interviews with UNICEF staff and external stakeholders that the implementation of the
geographical convergence approach has been hampered by a lack of a common understanding amongst
the MCO staff and staff of other partner agencies on what the core of the approach is and how it is to be
implemented in the context of Malawi. For example, the evaluation also found that geographical
convergence as an approach has not been taken up by other UN organizations. The successive
emergencies during the CP period have also been cited as a factor which forced the MCO to spread its
interventions across the three regions of the country to respond to the needs of affected populations.
Interviewees at national and sub-national levels finally consistently evoked the lack of clear guidance on
what the approach entails and how it can be implemented in Malawi.
Documents reviewed as well as interviews consistently refer to the “UNICEF – targeted districts” (or simply
“UNICEF districts”).240 Some of the stakeholders felt that, while the districts selected for the current CP
implementation were chosen supposedly because they had the lowest indicators data, there has not been
any re-assessment over the years to validate the consistency of the district selection. The districts with the
lowest data from the 2017 assessment, may not have remained in this position throughout the CP
implementation. Some stakeholders at national level argued that the support to “UNICEF districts” needs
to be adapted over time to reflect results achieved and capacities built, which will allow phasing out
of support which is no longer required and further targeting of most vulnerable groups of children and
women. All this suggests that there might be a need for a rotation to other districts in future interventions.
5.3.10 Responding to Emergencies
Finding 21: The Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme has been effective in supporting the Malawian
Government's responses to various emergencies, in particular the response to the COVID-19 pandemic
and other outbreaks (e.g., cholera), while ensuring continued access to basic services (e.g., ARVs)
during emergencies. Although UNICEF emergency funding sometimes takes too long to reach
implementing partners in the field, UNICEF support in these areas has generally allowed access to
quality and child-centred humanitarian services to children and their families. In some cases,
emergency interventions have transitioned to development successfully (e.g., oxygen plants from
COVID-19) but, overall, UNICEF responses to emergencies are generally short-term in nature and
reactive to the circumstances.
The evaluation found that the CP effectively responded to emergencies, in line with some benchmarks set
in Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action241 as demonstrated below.
Preparedness and Timeliness
The CP has high levels of emergency preparedness. The MCO leads development of multi-hazard
contingency plans at a national level as part of emergency preparedness. Informants in emergency prone
areas reported that “UNICEF appears prepared, and they know exactly what to do when there is an
emergency”. Consulted RAM documents suggest that the CP contributed to improved detection and
management of outbreaks in Malawi, as evidenced by the “percentage of outbreaks detected and
responded to within 72 hours” which has remained 100% throughout the evaluated period.242 Interviewed

242 UNICEF Malawi: RAM (2019, 2020, 2021)
54
stakeholders at all levels acknowledged that the MCO responds rapidly when emergencies hit. For
example, cholera outbreaks in 2019 were responded to within 24 hours and contained in less than a
week.243 However, a major challenge is the time it takes for funding disbursement for UNICEF to reach
implementing partners in the field during emergencies (and in regular programming)244 due to internal
UNICEF processes and procedures. This is noted as too long, and results in this work not truly being
emergency-based (e.g., for the tropical storm Anna in January 2021, funding came in June 2021).
Equity
This evaluation established that the CP has responded to the needs of the most disadvantaged
children (including adolescents) and women during emergency situations, regardless of the kind of
crisis. Various emergency responses were supported,245 including the 2019 humanitarian response to
cholera, food insecurity and Cyclone Idai induced flooding disaster benefiting over 600,000 people
(including 329,030 children), the COVID-19 pandemic whose response covered the entire country, the
delivery of emergency top-ups during the lean season reaching approximately 15,495 children and their
families, the humanitarian response to food insecurity and floods benefiting about 480,000 people (including
244,000 children) in 2020, and the “cash-plus” interventions that supported resilient to climate-related and
economic shocks in 2 districts (Balaka and Ntcheu) in 2021, reaching over 2,500 households with the VSLA.
Also, in 2020, the CP supported the design and operationalization of the government led CUCI.
While equity was considered in emergency interventions, more work could be done to ensure the
most vulnerable populations are the focus in an emergency. It was noted in interviews and documents
that UNICEF’s emergency responses generally prioritize affected districts and the most vulnerable
communities, including reaching the hard to reach through door to door. Notwithstanding, it was consistently
highlighted by informants and FGD participants that addressing specific needs of people with disabilities is
not done in a systematic manner. Similarly, other child-related vulnerabilities, such as ultra-poor street
children, and school dropouts were not accounted for.
Humanitarian-Development Nexus: Transition to Development
In terms of applying the humanitarian-development nexus approach,246 efforts have been made but there
is still room for improvement. Interviewed UNICEF staff indicated that the current CP has been informed
by risk programming principles, and the CDR team specifically facilitates cross-sectoral integration and
harmonisation of programmes for long term resilience. New initiatives have been put in place focusing on
emergency prone districts of Chikwawa and Nsanje where focus is on supporting emergencies such as
floods, cholera, drought, while implementing development programmes such as child and youth friendly
communities. Some of the emergency responses supported by UNICEF Malawi have been integrated in
ongoing development work, but in a reactive manner. In that regard, the Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF’s
Response to the COVID-19 pandemic found that the CO linked most of its COVID-19 related interventions
to an outcome of the CP or added new outputs related with the COVID-19 emergency response, which
shows the adequate connectedness of COVID-related interventions.247
Informants indicated that UNICEF plays a key role in humanitarian work, including ensuring ongoing access
to services throughout an emergency. For example, interviewees mentioned ensuring continued access to
ARVs for people living with HIV in emergencies to ensure ongoing adherence. As noted in interviews and
in documents, in some cases, emergency responses can be easily transitioned to development, for
example in the case of oxygen plants, testing platforms, infection prevention and control capacity building,
newborn care and infection, and access to water in health facilities.248 For example, UNICEF, donor, and
national level government interviewees noted that oxygen plants can be used to provide oxygen for other
needs beyond COVID-19, including for neonates. Standard operating procedures are being developed so
that healthcare workers can know when oxygen is needed. However, trained bioengineers are needed to
keep these oxygen plants up and running. In addition, momentum for funding of this work is needed to
continue after an emergency as well, as UNICEF interviewees noted that donor interest can wane following

an emergency. Furthermore, continued work including research and evaluations is needed to ensure that
UNICEF is implementing the most cost-effective interventions in emergencies (e.g; the case of drone
technology in section 5.3.4). Other gaps remain to transition. For example, interviews indicated that, apart
from linking the survivors to the AFIKEPO programme, currently there is no package given to emergency
survivors to enable their transition.
Stakeholders consulted at national and district levels consistently indicated that despite being
comprehensive and containing an adequate integration of a variety of components, UNICEF
responses to emergencies are generally short-term in nature and reactive to the circumstances.
They do not always consider the likelihood that some emergencies will endure in the long-term and/or re-
occur, despite the country's obvious vulnerability to emergencies. Some stakeholders emphasized that,
given that communities in Malawi are repeatedly hit by different shocks, it is crucial to acknowledge the
importance of recovery activities (3-9 months after the shock) in addition to the immediate shock-responses
which comes in during the first days and weeks after the shock.
It was identified across interviewees that UNICEF, with its long-term presence in Malawi and partnerships
with Government and districts, is well placed to support recovery efforts - particularly in areas insufficiently
covered by the emergency response or in areas where there is need to protect the gains made on longer-
term development projects. One successful example is the Floods Cash Recovery Transfers, where
UNICEF enabled the Government to utilize direct funds made available by donors for floods recovery
efforts.
Coordination and Partnerships
The CP responded effectively to emergencies through coordination and partnerships. For example,
it was noted in documents and interviews that UNICEF played a critical coordination role for the COVID-19
response, which was prepared in line with the GoM plan.249 Internal coordination at the MCO level is judged
by informants as optimal. UNICEF staff confirmed that in time of emergencies, the Office swiftly coordinates
sections’ work to address challenges presented by the emergencies and quickly coordinates with partners
to intervene. As noted in the Situation Analysis report, UNICEF is an active participant in the Humanitarian
Country Team and the Inter-Cluster Coordination Fora, as well as co-lead for education, nutrition, and
WASH clusters.250 UNICEF was a “key partner” in the health cluster throughout the COVID-19
response,251,252 and the supply chain coordinator for the COVID-19 response in Malawi.253 At the national
level, UNICEF co-leads/co-chairs the nutrition cluster (the chair is the government’s department of nutrition,
HIV and AIDS) which gives UNICEF the authority to coordinate and mobilise resources for emergency
response. However, the coordination is only pronounced at the national level. UNICEF has been criticized,
by the district interviewees, for not sufficiently supporting district level coordination of the nutrition
emergency response. The district level expects the level of coordination happening at national level to be
replicated at district level considering a coordination structure is available at the district level.
5.3.11 Contribution to Emergency Preparedness
Finding 22: The Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme has strengthened the capacity of relevant
stakeholders (including communities) to prepare themselves for natural disasters, contributing to
improved emergency preparedness and resilience in Malawi. Most stakeholders recognize that despite
the wide recognition that emergencies will continue to happen in Malawi, efforts to apply the nexus
approach at national level in a meaningful way have been limited, mainly due to limited funding required
to conceive and implement such an approach.
The evaluation found, based on interviews and document analysis, that promoting the resilience of
Malawian communities remained one of the priorities of the CP. Several initiatives were implemented
that contributed to enhancing the capacity of different categories of stakeholders at different levels (national,
district, community) to better understand, assess needs, plan, and coordinate responses to emergency

56
situations. At the national level, the Programme supported the implementation of the National Resilience
Strategy254 and strengthened the capacity of the MNSSP II, enabling it to flexibly cover emergency
responses. As part of this strengthening, the Shock Sensitive Social Protection (SSSP) has been further
institutionalized and now forms part of the new 5-year Strategic Plan of the SCTP.255
At a more sectoral level, interviews and documentation showed that UNICEF’s work in emergency
preparedness in health and nutrition sectors includes provision of equipment, technical support, and
capacity building. For example, with COVID-19, this included development and capacity building related to
oxygen plants256 and providing capacity building to government and Malawi Red Cross staff for COVID-
19.257 At sub-national (and community levels), the CP strengthened government’s preparation and
mitigation mechanisms for emergencies and improved district-level coordination in preparation for
possible disasters.258 Notably, interviews confirmed that the Local Government Ministry was supported to
establish an innovative dashboard system for effective planning, coordination and decision making about
emergencies. The skills of the DODMA and District Civil Protection Committees (DCPCs) were enhanced
to act with speed before, during and after a disaster has occurred, according to documentation.259 In a
similar vein, in partnership with Malawi Red Cross, the capacities in humanitarian assistance of
implementing partners260 were strengthened.261
Finally, UNICEF worked with COOPI and district councils to assess community based early warning
systems infrastructure in Chikwawa and Nsanje.262 As identified in interviews, the findings of this
assessment informed and guided the restoration of damaged infrastructure as well as upgrading of
systems. This has strengthened the capacities of local authorities in these districts and their communities
in responding to climatic shocks. However, the infrastructure has suffered from vandalism, implying that
efforts to educate community members on prevention of vandalism need to continue.
Overall, stakeholders consulted at the national level and in the districts recognize that these capacities have
contributed to improved emergency preparedness and resilience by the Malawian government and other
relevant stakeholders (including communities). An important challenge emphasized by most stakeholders
is that the implementation of the plans, strategies, and the actual use of strengthened skills, is not
guaranteed given the weak capacities of beneficiary institutions, either to replicate the trainings to
more professionals and implementing partners or implement the plans due to limited funding from the GoM.
Most key informants indicated that, generally, ministries and departments in Malawi lack financial capacity
to intervene during emergencies.
Another challenge identified in many interviews with UNICEF staff and UNICEF documents263 is that
development work has been affected by many emergencies, including COVID-19, cyclones, floods, cholera
outbreaks, and polio outbreaks. However, it is also noted in interviews and documents264 that these
emergencies will continue to happen and need to be planned for and integrated as part of the overall
development work. In addition, while UNICEF is known for focusing their work on children, this focus can
be a challenge, especially during emergencies. This was seen with COVID-19, as illustrated in the real-
time evaluation report: “it is also of key importance for UNICEF not to lose the focus on child needs and
vulnerabilities”.265 UN partners observed that more still needs to be done to prepare in advance for
humanitarian gender responses as, currently, resources are often hastily mobilized when the emergency
occurs. Furthermore, both UNICEF staff and UN partners agreed that gender interventions to harness
resilience remain weak.

5.3.12 Factors influencing the achievement of CP results
Finding 23: The Country Programme has been positively and negatively influenced by internal and
external factors during its implementation. Externally, the programme was delivered under strong
government leadership and clear policy priorities and direction. On the other hand, the programme was
delivered in a context of emerging multiple emergencies (such as COVID-19, Russia – Ukraine war,
tropical storm Ana and cyclone Gombe, polio and cholera outbreaks) resulting in resource constraints
and restricted overall programme implementation.
Internal Factors
Internally, the Pillar approach and Matrix Management structure were reported conferring the
advantage of knowledge cross-fertilisation and strengthening programme response. However, the lack of
robust pillar level integration packages, implemented at scale, has been cited as hindering the
achievement of results, and full intervention convergence has not been achieved as programmatic silos
have continued. Also, data management issues across programs led to under-reporting and lack of
consistency.266 UNICEF is working on innovative ways to rectify some of these issues including m-
quarantine, and different e-surveillance modalities.267
On the other hand, as noted in this evaluation, UNICEF has a positive reputation, is viewed as a convener
and trusted partner. Altogether, these elements have positively influenced the CP results. Many consulted
stakeholders also emphasized the importance of UNICEF technical capacity and knowledge of the
Malawi national and local context as an important factor explaining the CP achievements.
External Factors
On the one hand, the GoM leadership in providing policy priorities and direction and implementation
oversight, has been cited as an important factor in the achievement of the CP results. Similarly, the
government implementation and coordination structures (for example in nutrition) are well articulated in
Malawi.
On the other hand, the implementation of the CP interventions was impacted by the need to deliver on
emerging priorities caused by the global health pandemic of COVID-19 and other unanticipated
emergencies such as the tropical storm Ana and cyclone Gombe, polio and cholera outbreaks. The
resource allocation to these emergencies has affected the continuity of some regular interventions. On the
practical side, the COVID-19 pandemic has generated delays due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. This
was particularly problematic for projects that involved field work, resulting in remote support to partners and
limiting UNICEF’s ability to validate implementation and reporting of the activities. On the positive side, it
has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic created opportunities to boost innovation activity at the
MCO. Notably, opportunities to use drone operations for delivering test samples were used to quickly
decongest border reception centres. A COVID-19 quarantine management system (mQuarantine) allowed
the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) to interact with patients in self-isolation and quarantine and
track in real-time their conditions, and a COVID-19 data modelling platform offered MoHP real-time
predictive analytics for national and district level projections. A SCTP e-payment system was introduced as
well.
Finally, many interviewees in this evaluation indicated that the inadequacy of financial resources in
Government institutions to spend on social sectors and inadequate fiscal devolution in context of
decentralisation are important factors that affected the work of the CP. At the same time, UNICEF staff and
donors have recognized that external factors (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, conflict in Ukraine, and other
priority challenges) have inhibited donors from providing support at anticipated levels. The pandemic also
had secondary impacts on children, including adolescents (e.g., increase in pregnancies, domestic
violence, and early marriages).268

5.4 Efficiency
5.4.1 Financial Resources
Finding 24: In the current context of dwindling international development assistance and unanticipated
crises such as COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, mobilizing adequate funding resources has been
a persistent challenge. Nevertheless, mobilized financial resources were generally appropriately
allocated and used effectively in most interventions given the effective management approaches.
However, there are areas for improvement, including equitable distribution of funds across programme
components, timely delivery, overcoming bureaucracy, lack of equity and gender-targeting, and
addressing high overhead costs.
The analysis of the CP budget and expenses has shown that, overall, resource mobilization has
been a challenge. As shown in Figure 5.5, the MCO has failed to achieve the intended funding target for
each CP component but has achieved a high degree of utilization of allocated funding. The largest shortfall
between funding target and funding allocated is for Pillar II by USD 33,257,581. Programme Effectiveness
has the smallest shortfall in funding by USD 17,086,251. Noticeably, the UNICEF Malawi CPD (2019-2023)
did not specify funding targets for Operational Effectiveness. Considering the funds allocated and utilized
in nominal terms, the MCO has achieve a high degree of utilization of the existing funds across programme
components. The gap between allocated and utilized funds was very low, ranging from USD 208,792 for
Programme Effectiveness to USD 1,214,669 for Pillar I which was the largest programme component of
the Country Programme. These findings indicate that despite the challenges in resource mobilization, the
MCO was highly efficient in the use of the funds allocated. Figure 5.6 provides further evidence of the
findings from Figure 5.7, that the MCO has been highly efficient with the utilization of funds across program
components. The utilization rate from 2019 to 2022 indicates that across programme components almost
a 100% of total funds have been used by the MCO.

Overall, the funds utilized for the program components are consistently falling short of the funds needed to
accomplish the CP objectives. As illustrated in Figure 5.7, the CP has been functioning with insufficient
funding to achieve its goals, despite achieving the majority of planned outputs. Pillar II, Pillar III, Operational
Effectiveness, and Programme Effectiveness have a reported financing gap between the funds utilized and
the funds planned. However, there is variability in these gaps, ranging from a minimal gap as in the case
of USD 8,317 for Operational Effectiveness to USD 15,684,740 for Pillar II and USD 14,914,334 for Pillar
III, which constitutes around a quarter of the total funds planned. Notably, Pillar I, the largest programme
component, has utilized more funds than planned by an excess of USD 2,258,099. These findings suggest
that the MCO should review the distribution of funds across programme components to address these
imbalances.

According to most consulted stakeholders, allocated funds have for the most part been adequate for
delivering the CP planned intermediate results, such as piloting interventions, revising policy
documents, and delivering trainings. However, resources have remained insufficient to accomplish the full
totality of the activities needed to meet the needs of children. For example, the CP resources have been
insufficient for supporting the GoM to meet its commitment to ensure access to drinking water by all children
in Malawi. Funding has also been insufficient for taking advantage of, and building on opportunities,
particularly in scaling up successful pilot interventions, such as climate resilient water schemes, etc. Given
these objectives are beyond the scope of the current CP, there is an argument to increase financial support
for Malawi.
60
Factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have resulted in a reduction
in funds allocated to the CP. As evidenced by document reviews and key informants, these conditions
caused a shortfall in Other Resources Regular (ORR) funding in 2020 resulting in a 54% reduction or USD
50.8 million from the anticipated USD 94.7 million in ORR receivables and deviation of anticipated funds
towards the COVID-19 response.269 An important caveat is the contrast between old and new funding in
the COVID-19 response. The MCO received a total of USD 17 million for programme activities and USD 6
million for procurement services; these resources did not represent new funding but rather a reprioritization
of donor funds towards the COVID-19 emergency response.270 The negative consequence of a lack of new
funding is demonstrated by the three joint UN programmes that UNICEF participated in, financed by the
FCDO, which have forgone a reduction in budget and an estimated net loss of USD 50.8 million for the
MCO (as seen above).271
As a result, austere measures were undertaken by the MCO, including a hiring freeze, staff layoffs,
prolonged vacancies, abolishment of positions, and project loss of USD 11.2 million against staff salaries
and operations support cost.272 Noticeably, staffing costs accounted for around 25% of the budget whilst
total overhead, including staff costs, accounted for 35% of the budget, justifying the decision for
consolidation of overhead costs and reprioritization of funds.
Financial resource allocations have been enhanced by the Programme Budget Review process which
provides the opportunity to periodically assess allocations in a participatory manner. Moreover, the HACT
workplan has identified the achievement of cross-sectoral programme delivery in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness, including meeting or exceeding output targets for programme visits, follow-up, and spot
checks.273 However, several consulted UNICEF staff mentioned that challenges remain in terms of timely
disbursements of funds which are hampered by arduous UNICEF administrative processes and
funding delays. These burdens are acute in emergency response situations and were noted across all
Pillars. For example, the NGO Coalition and Child Rights has a five-year framework agreement with
UNICEF MCO in which planning is for immediate activities only and thereafter, funds are liquidated.
Planned activities for the Coalition are expected to be implemented in about three months but take six
months of administrative processing with UNICEF to approve. These redundancies underscore the need
for medium to long term support to allow proper programming to meet the needs of children, which would
allow for more deliberate targeting of children needs.
The modality for the delivery of financial resources has been identified as an area of concern by
several Government stakeholders at the national and district level. They felt that greater efficiency and
cost effectiveness could be achieved if UNICEF MCO opted to fund the district councils directly and
strengthened financial management oversight to prevent abuse. These stakeholders also stated that the
current funding of interventions through NGOs is expensive and unjustifiable, given that there is increasingly
technical and financial capacity within the Government to manage resources. However, the modality of
delivery through NGOs has been propagated by the Cash Gate scandal,274 which brought into question the
reliability of Government led delivery modalities.
The evaluation found that within UNICEF, there is a positive perception that gender interventions
benefited from the strategic allocation of resources due to the comprehensive articulation of gender
action points for each pillar under the Country Gender Equality Strategy. However, there is a lack of financial
reports based on equity and gender dimensions. This deficiency warrants reflection on the reporting of
equity and gender related financial outputs, indicators, and targets in the next CP. Notwithstanding,
inclusion related financial reporting is visible in the COVID-19 response, the education, and WASH sector
interventions.
Documents reviewed indicated that the MCO responded to stakeholders’ observations that children
with disabilities were left out by allocating resources to distribution of braille materials to about 1,000
children with disabilities in 17 learning centres.275 During this period, UNICEF MCO allocated financial

resources to enhance the understanding of mental health problems and psychosocial difficulties survivors
of SGBV.276 Site visits documented the construction of WASH facilities for children with disabilities, which,
according to interviewed head teachers, had attracted children with disabilities students to enrol at their
schools. As noted by UNICEF staff, Government stakeholders and development partners, the CP did not
adequately target street connected children and children on the move, which suggests no or fragmented
allocation of resources towards full inclusion of children with multiple vulnerabilities.
5.4.2 Human Resources
Finding 25: Human resources have been overall adequate to implement the Country Programme.
Despite experiencing staff changes during the Programme period, the staff complement of the Country
Office has been optimal throughout, with required capacities in the relevant fields of the Country
Programme.
Overall, the MCO’s leadership is viewed by consulted staff as having been able to effectively and efficiently
mobilize and allocate the human resources, given the many changes (such as changes in the politically
elected leadership that resulted in shifts in government priorities, the simultaneous rotation of MCO senior
leadership - Representative and Deputy Representative, at the beginning of the CP) that occurred in the
CP environment, posing significant challenges to maintain a motivated workforce. Administratively,
throughout the CP period, MCO continuously identified and addressed needs for additional staff to enable
the implementation of the CP.
During the implementation of the CP, the MCO experienced staff changes due to various factors. On the
one hand, following the Comprehensive Review of the Programme undertaken in 2020, which included an
affordability analysis of the CP, adjustments were made to the programme’s human resources (e.g.,
abolishment of some posts) to fit within the dwindling funding.277
The recruitment of needed human resources to replace leaving staff has generally been timely done. As a
result, at the time of this evaluation, the MCO had sufficient staff: most positions were filled across all
units and UNICEF was in the process of recruiting for all vacant positions. Overall, the staff complement of
the MCO has been optimal throughout, with required capacities in the relevant fields of the CP. Thus, it is
reasonable to believe that the human resources that were available were utilized efficiently to register the
results seen in the context within which the programme has been implemented.
5.4.3 Role of Pillar approach and Matrix Management
Finding 26: The Pillar approach and Matrix Management style have somewhat enabled sectors to
cross-collaborate under the same structures (the Pillars, Task Teams), which has led to cost-effective
use of human resources. However, the fact that the CP funding was largely mobilized sector wise has
constrained efforts towards joint programming and operationalizing joint interventions, thus limiting the
cost-effectiveness of activities.
Prior to the introduction of the Pillar approach and Matrix Management style, the CP was siloed into a sector
driven model and there were issues with resources to support collaboration across sectors. Since
implementation, the two approaches have somewhat enabled sectors to cross-collaborate under the
same structures (the Pillars, Task Teams), which has led to cost-effective use of both human and
financial resources. The reduction of silos and funding barriers through budget allocations has supported
the timely and effective delivery of results. For example, UNICEF staff remarked that the Pillar approach
ensured that instead of just relying on the Gender Specialist to produce gender results, most staff in their
respective pillars took ownership to produce data disaggregated by age, sex and at times even disability
and location (rural vs urban). The Pillar approach also ensured the earnest co-option of the Gender
Specialist in COVID-19 and other humanitarian responses (i.e., tropical storm Ana and cyclone Gombe).
All this meant that resources were used more effectively to timely uncover gender needs and gaps for
practical programming across all pillars. With regards to resource use within pillars, the Gender Specialist
confirmed that her work plan managed to get more resources (from nutrition and education sectors)
276 Ibid.

62
because of the Pillar approach and the convergence strategy, thus affecting the optimal realization of
human rights for children (see also section 5.2.1).
Sources informing this evaluation consider that Pillar activities have been overall implemented within
the intended timeframes, despite the delays in disbursing funds, especially in emergency response
situations. However, some UNICEF staff from smaller sectors (e.g., social policy and child protection) felt
that timely delivery of results was at times affected. On the one hand, this happened while seeking to access
funds from pillar resources in order to implement an intervention, only to discover that the money had
already been utilized by others. On the other hand, outputs were affected by the fact that matrixed staff
tend to be overworked as they report to two managers. Some sector Chiefs viewed their staff as doing more
work under a sector to which they were matrixed, than for their main section, which constrained human
resources.
In terms of financial resources mobilization at the CP level, consulted stakeholders admitted that
funding was largely mobilized sector wise, which limited joint programming and monitoring of
interventions. The fact that many donors made funding available primarily through sectoral interventions
had been identified by Developmental Evaluation II as the most significant barriers to change within the
MCO.278 As such, the Pillar approach has not necessarily increased cost-effectiveness of operations, for
example those relative to field visits by the MCO personnel, as joint visits remained limited. Some
interviewees at national level and in districts indicated that the fact that most UNICEF staff operate from
Lilongwe impacts on the cost-effectiveness of their activities. For example, district stakeholders indicated
that UNICEF monitoring missions are conducted only a few times in the life a project, which does not allow
them to dedicate sufficient time to each project and involved local partners. In most cases, they visit a group
of districts at once and spend only a few days with implementing partners after which they return to
Lilongwe. These short missions do not always allow to effectively and timely identify, discuss, and attend
to all implementation challenges.
5.5 Sustainability
5.5.1 Sustainability of results
Finding 27: The likelihood that benefits of the Malawi-UNICEF Programme interventions continue after
the end of the Programme is both variable and moderate. While some results may be sustainable over
time (e.g., system for cold chain in place, knowledge, and capacity), there are many areas that require
ongoing resources to ensure sustainability. In Malawi, sustaining many results remains highly reliant on
international development funding, and given changing donor priorities, their sustainability is
questionable. The successive emergencies in Malawi constrain the sustainability of the results from the
emergency interventions, given the need to rebuild infrastructure, resettle populations.
Sustainability of Development results
The CP strategic choice to use existing government systems and structures and closely work with
government in programme implementation appears to confer potential benefits of ownership and
sustainability of the positive changes created by the CP.
A central element of sustainability of the CP results is also the institutional capacity strengthened at national
and district/community levels. Evidence emerging from this evaluation indicates that some of the systems
and capacities built with the support of UNICEF are functional today and are likely to continue to
do so in the future. Interviewed government stakeholders, donors as well as UNICEF teams believe that,
with the systems that have been developed, the vertical and horizontal expansions of national SCTP, for
example, will continue to be implemented in Malawi with or without UNICEF support.
Equally, the strengthened capacities of government and implementing partners’ staff in multiple technical
areas are likely to be sustained. Although there is a high turnover of staff in government institutions,
particularly at district level, which was identified as a key issue hindering institutional capacity building
efforts and overall institutional memory, and thus sustainability, it can be argued that the knowledge and
278 Child Frontiers (2021). Developmental Evaluation Phase II: Journey Towards Structurally Facilitated Integration Final Report

63
capacity built can be sustained for some time. Health system strengthening encourages sustainability by
developing capacity within government and putting in place systems and infrastructures within government
to support sustainability in the longer term. Examples include systems for cold chain for vaccines, and
capacity building at the district level (such as development of District Implementation Plans (DIPs) – so that
government staff can plan within budget). However, these alone are not sufficient for sustainability, as
capacity building needs to be ongoing given turnover and new skills needed, equipment needs to be
maintained, and plans need to be funded.
Changes such as those affecting legislation (laws and policies) are likely to be sustainable. Government
and NGO interviewees have indicated that children’s rights are more likely to be promoted and protected
in a calculated and sustainable manner, with the enactment of the National Children’s Commission Act and
establishment of the National Children’s Commission, describing it as "this milestone is a huge contribution
that will facilitate the substantive implementation of child laws, policies and strategies". As testament to the
sustainability of this structure, the same interviewees noted that in the last two budget cycles, GoM has
funded processes to ensure that the Commission becomes operational. Through the CP, UNICEF has also
supported the introduction of Degree in Social Work program at University of Malawi, including the building
of the capacity of many District Social Welfare Officers, which is another addition to the changes that will
have lasting national impact as a result of the CP.
Sustainability in other areas (e.g., commodities such as vaccinations) remains a challenge without donor
funding at this point. The same is true with ensuring sustainability of work done via SBC, as behaviour
change takes time and consistent messaging is important. Similarly, for Climate Change and WASH,
several stakeholders consulted expressed concerns that sustainability of the results created by CP
interventions and institutions (who should ensure continuity) remain highly dependent on
international donor funding. For example, in the view of many stakeholders, the implementation of the
Climate and WASH Financing strategy remains a concern, without the continued support of donors. The
sustainability of WASH infrastructure in rural areas is mainly affected by weak community-based
management systems. Usually, the donors do provide for initial WASH investments which are then handed
over to communities for continued management.
The CP interventions focused on areas that address structural issues, thus requiring longer term solutions
and investments, need to be supported beyond the period of the CP. As in many other developing countries,
Government spending in Malawi remains a determining factor for ensuring these investments. For example,
the sustainability of the positive changes and effects of the PF4C interventions at the national level is
contingent on the continued investments, ownership and buy-in by the Government for the ongoing public
financial management reforms at all levels of Government. Yet, the current fiscal conditions and public
finances in Malawi do not allow the government to allocate sufficient budgets for different sectors
of the economy that benefit children directly (e.g., nutrition, WASH, education, and health). This makes the
sustainability of results very unlikely.
Sustainability of Emergency results
This evaluation has identified the short-term nature of UNICEF responses to emergencies as an
important impediment to the sustainability of the results created by emergency interventions. Many
stakeholders, in government, donors, and implementing partners expressed the view that
humanitarian/emergency actions, including those supported by UNICEF in Malawi, are generally short-term
and focused on saving lives and alleviating human suffering in emergency situations. However, the lack of
“after shock” interventions impede the possibility to sustain the results from emergency interventions.
Stakeholders, both internal and external to UNICEF, emphasized that emergencies should be incorporated
in all programming, and integrated into long term development plans that work to address poverty, promote
economic growth, and address social inequities.
The fact that Malawi has faced many successive emergencies over the past years was highlighted by
most consulted stakeholders as an important impediment to sustainability of results created by
emergency interventions. The evaluation team’s visits and consultations with stakeholders in the flood
prone districts such as Chikwawa confirmed that these areas are constantly faced with the need to rebuild
infrastructure, resettle populations, and shift resources back and forth between long-term development
priorities and humanitarian response.
64
As seen previously, some emergency results have transitioned to development successfully,
implying that they are being sustained. For example, oxygen plants and testing platforms scaled up in
COVID-19 continue to be used for other conditions, infection prevention and control capacities can be
applied in other areas, and access to water in health facilities is critical beyond emergencies.279 Another
potential area for sustaining the results from emergencies is mental health interventions developed in
humanitarian context to mitigate impact of COVID-19 and cyclones. According to interviewees, the mental
health area has potential to be mainstreamed in the education system and services. The adoption of the
Malawi National Mental Health Strategy has created an enabling environment for such sustainability.
Additionally, the urban cash transfer interventions that were implemented to cushion the impact of COVID-
19 amongst the urban poor also has potential to be translated into a sustainable intervention for urban
vulnerable children such as families of street connected children.
5.5.2 Implementation strategies and sustainability
Finding 28: While collectively the mixed strategies of the Country Programme have contributed to
addressing capacity gaps at various levels (national and sub-national) and for various duty bearers and
holders of children's rights in Malawi and, as such, helped to ensure sustainability over time,
implementation of interventions through NGO partners is perceived as less likely to foster government
ownership and sustainability of results.
Service Delivery
Since the beginning of the CP, MCO envisioned a shift in the implementation approach from a strong
emphasis on service delivery and commodity supply to increased up-stream work, focused on system
strengthening.280 However, support to service delivery continued, notably through NGOs, which has
contributed considerably to improving and expanding access to basic services, including WASH, child
protection, social protection, and disaster management. According to the CP documents, delivery platforms
to reach households and communities would be coordinated by the District Councils under the Ministry of
Local Government and Rural Development.281 Yet, as perceived by many stakeholders the MCO still relies
too much on NGOs and CBOs, which may delay government ownership and threaten sustainability.
Although stakeholders recognize that implementing interventions through NGOs can help achieve targets
more rapidly, this modality is seen as impeding capacity-building efforts (to which the MCO itself
contributes) and ownership of processes by government partners, thereby jeopardizing the
sustainability of results. Some of the interviewed stakeholders indicated that, in line with the
decentralization policy, the CP would benefit from a progressive hand over of delivery of
responsibilities to decentralized government institutions. Some informants from government, at
national and district levels, felt that there would be greater efficiency and cost effectiveness if MCO opted
to fund the district councils directly and strengthened financial management oversight to prevent abuse.
The current funding of interventions through NGOs is further seen by some government interviewees as
expensive and unjustifiable as it is felt there is technical and financial capacity within government systems
to manage resources and implement interventions. In interviews with donors, UNICEF was also seen by
some as an expensive partner (with high overhead) compared to others.
Systems strengthening and Capacity building
From interviews and consulted documents, an important factor contributing to the sustainability of the
CP results in Malawi is MCO’s focus on interventions that strengthen systems and build the
capacity of duty bearers (at national, sub-national, and community levels) to provide social services. The
support to development of sector planning documents, strategies, and policies opens pathways for the GoM
to address children’s rights issues in a more systematic and sustainable way. The training of professionals
and staff of government institutions and implementing partners opens pathways to sustaining achieved
results in targeted areas of intervention. However, our assessment considers that the replication and scale
up of strengthened structures and skills as well as their sustainability are still fragile. It remains particularly
difficult to know if, and to what extent, the capacity building activities (e.g., training activities) supported by

281 UNICEF Malawi (2018). Pillar III Strategy Note; 2019 – 2023 Country Program.
65
the CP can be expanded beyond the few Ministries, districts, and individuals which were targeted by
interventions. According to many interviewees, this situation is further complicated by the inability of
government institutions to retain trained professionals, which pushes many of them to leave their jobs for
greener pastures, contributing to the deficit of institutional memory, particularly at district level.
Inclusive engagement
According to many UNICEF staff and government stakeholders, the CP was conceived in an inclusive
manner, involving mostly actors at national level. The implementation also involved various
stakeholders, spanning from communities to civil society organisations, government, and private sector.
Accordingly, this approach fostered ownership of intervention processes and therefore enhances prospects
for sustainability of the CP results. By embracing this approach, the MCO worked through existing
government structures282 and systems (e.g., care group and childcare systems) and closely with
government officials, which is seen by all stakeholders as an effective strategy and a key factor of
sustainability over time. Community involvement is particularly seen by all-consulted stakeholders as a key
factor that helps to ensure sustainability of achieved results over time (e.g., early warning systems,
belonging to care groups). Mobilizing and engaging community leaders, as well as building their capacity
are also seen as effective to encourage buy-in and sustainability.283
Finally, the evaluation identified some aspects of the CP interventions that have built-in
sustainability. Notably, the distribution of start-up vegetable seeds and animals on a pass-on arrangement
(e.g., under “Chiyambi Chabwino” nutrition project, implemented under World Relief) makes the system of
beneficiaries self-sustaining if implemented as designed. The CP has also contributed to positive infant and
young child feeding practices among caregivers, which are likely to be sustainable for those that have
adopted the positive behaviours.
5.5.3 Changing donor priorities and sustainability of results
Finding 29: Donor support for Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme has been stable although
fluctuating with emergency appeals, which demonstrates a high level of success. UNICEF Country
Committees have been of increasing importance as have UN Agencies and the Multi-Partner Trust
Fund. Some programming has reduced regular support due to limited availability of donor funds,
changing priorities and investment shifts.
Considering the scale of Malawi’s needs and fiscal space, its key needs are in education, health and food
security as reflected in the corresponding GoM’s spending priorities. Donor contributions flow on annual
commitment basis and/or emergency or humanitarian appeals. While annual commitments are flexible,
humanitarian appeals are typically focused on financing for specific needs. As can be seen in Figure 5.8,
vis-à-vis UNICEF, individual country (bilateral donors) contributions have been declining, with the
Multi-Partner Trust Fund and UNICEF Committees playing a more significant role. The continued high
performance of UNICEF Committees may provide insight into successful fundraising approaches for
UNICEF.
282 For example, this includes working through the Local Government Ministry at the national level and through the District Councils
at sub-national level

The donor investments are in education, health, food security and water, among others. Uniquely, UNICEF
is able to collaborate with multiple partners, jointly and separately – both UN and Bilateral programmes -
on multiple aspects of important programmes which provide society support for children and their families.
Key priorities for donors underpin direct contributions to UNICEF. A complexity of the integrated
programming model is that it does not necessarily align with donor priorities and must be broken down into
thematic projects or programming. The evaluation found that common donor priorities include maternal,
neonatal and child health, gender equality, girls’ education, improved governance systems, sustainable
livelihoods, and social cash transfers for poor households.
A trend has been noted of bilateral donors having to reduce and re-focus priorities as a result of
COVID-19 or as coincidence in timing. WASH programming is an example of work which should be
carefully focused, as donor priorities are typically tuned away unless in the case of disasters. International
Financial Institutions such as the World Bank have played a critical role in this case in mobilizing resources,
while UNICEF can mobilize technical assistance. Secondary Education is another area where donor
priorities have been re-focused; in this case USAID plays a critical role in investing in adolescent education.
Occasionally, gaps in consistency in funding can lead to successful pilot programs not being scaled up and
terminated due to lack of resources (an example is technical skills for out-of-school boys in small
agriculture). These trends in programming commitments and priorities need to be closely studied and
reflected upon for the next CP.
The USA, EU/EC, Germany, Norway, Japan, and Sweden remain committed to collaboration with UNICEF.
Other countries’ commitments and plans need to be closely observed given their importance (such as
FCDO) to determine whether there may be a reduction in the country program support, a change in
priorities, or a shift in the way of doing business (such as through CSOs). Finally, donor contributions are
supplemented by direct humanitarian appeals284 which must be taken into consideration when reflecting on
the scope of the MCO’s operations, which often overtake regular programming. A key collaborator in the
humanitarian response area for UNICEF is the WFP. Combined the two UN agencies receive more than
60% of humanitarian funds and work closely together.

5.6 Orientation Towards Impact
5.6.1 Changes in the lives of rights holders and duty bearers
Finding 30: The Malawi - UNICEF Country Programme has contributed to progress in children’s rights
at the strategic level in terms of strengthening the enabling environment (through a range of national
strategies, systems frameworks, plans and programmes) and in so doing enhanced the capacity of the
Government of Malawi and other duty bearers to realize children rights. There is also evidence of
changes in the living conditions of rights holders at school and in their homes.
Changes in the capacities of duty bearers
An important difference made by the CP interventions has been the progress in children’s rights at
the strategic level in terms of strengthening the enabling environment. According to interviews, the
improved legislation, sector strategies and plans, and budgeting for children have enhanced the capacity
of the Malawi Government and other duty bearers to realize children’s rights. At national as well as sub-
national levels, the boosting of institutional capacity and the strengthening of government systems resulted
in changes in the ways efforts to promote children’s rights are implemented. For example, consulted
stakeholders and documents indicate that the strengthening of the SCTP led to improved targeting of
beneficiaries using the Unified Beneficiary Register and improved payment solutions. This in turn resulted
in increased number of households reached by the programme, as well as improved accountability both
upstream and downstream.285
Changes in the ways decentralized programme coordination and implementation are also
underway. The activities aimed at local capacity-building and community empowerment are contributing to
addressing capacity gaps at subnational levels and to seize opportunities offered by GoM decentralization
process. Interviews with District stakeholders confirmed that local actors have started embracing inclusive
bottom-up participatory planning processes (see the example of the Chikwawa CYFCI development plan,
which was developed through multi-actor and sector processes, involving youth). Similarly, PF4C
interventions have empowered rights holders and duty bearers to engage in participatory approaches
through the strengthening of transparency, public accounts, fiscal accountability, and parliament’s ability to
make the executive accountable.
Further changes in the lives of duty bearers include obtaining university degrees (e.g., District Social
Welfare Officers), acquisition of solid child protection skills, and receiving capacity building at different child
protection levels to improve systems. Central government interviewees acknowledged the CP’s contribution
to build capacity of Social Welfare staff in Malawi and applauded UNICEF’s successful advocacy for the
introduction of a Social Work Degree Program at the University of Malawi (UNIMA, then Chancellor
College).
Interviewed teachers at district levels who are participating in Empowerment Transformation Trainings
(under Ujamaa) noted that, “as teachers, we have changed our attitudes and learnt how to handle learners
better. We now know that some cases of abuse were being encouraged by our unequal treatment of girls
and boys. Since the Ujamaa intervention, we are trying to handle both sexes equally, giving them equal
responsibilities.” They further referred to the improvement of the teachers’ own technical skills – “the life
skills topics that Ujamaa teaches are deeper, and we are marrying them with our own life skills curriculum
so learners can understand the concept of life skills more practically.”
Finally, consulted documents and interviews indicate that the positive parenting messages that parents
have received have led to improvements in provision of positive skills development in parents. This
includes health, nutrition, prevention of violent parenting discipline, play and stimulation, early learning and
safety and security. There has been a small increase in the involvement of fathers in providing care for their
children. 286

Changes in the lives of rights holders
The SCTP provides assistance to children, improving their living conditions at school and in their
homes. Focus group discussions with parents in visited communities and teachers in visited schools
confirmed that children from SCTP beneficiary households have improved health, clothing, and overall
quality of life and childhood. This confirmed the findings of the previous evaluation of SCTP which had
shown that beneficiaries spent the cash transfer on their children’s education expenses, including costs
such as food, school uniforms and other clothing items.287 Transfers enhanced parents’ ability to provide
food provisions for children to eat during the school day, which they believe motivated children to study and
helped them perform better at school. Another most salient SCTP impact on the lives of children is that
beneficiary families improve their homes, with iron sheets for example, as well as constructing new homes
that are more stable and resilient.288 Children from SCTP beneficiary families have therefore improved living
conditions, which impacts positively on their development.289
Improvements of WASH services to households and communities, healthcare facilities and schools
have fostered the development of a happy, healthy child and mother. During interviews with teachers
and head teachers in visited schools, they confirmed that availability of clean water and good toilets reduced
students’ school absenteeism, while increasing students’ regularity in schools. In focus group discussions,
members of school WASH committees indicated that by having water throughout the school day, they could
easily teach their students handwashing and sanitation lessons.
Lives of children have been saved through being treated for acute malnutrition. As discussed in
section 5.2, the numbers of children with acute malnutrition have declined over time. Evidence at the
national level, through surveys, has also shown decline in wasting over time.290 This development was
corroborated by end users of the CP interventions consulted in this evaluation. As stated by some of the
cluster members during FGD in Matelekera, Chikwawa district, “The benefit that we have seen in this area
is that our children are not wasted because we have been taught how to diversify our diet using six food
groups” (participant # 5). “They also gave us some vegetable seed and chickens that have made it possible
for us to diversify our diets according to the six food groups” (participant # 8). Through health system
strengthening programmes at various levels of government, there has been improved quality of care for
MNCH, and increased testing and treatment of HIV, as noted in documents and interviews. For example,
in districts supported by UNICEF as learning districts, neonatal deaths are lower than the national average
(12 per 1,000 compared to 26 per 1,000).291 This has been associated with work on collaboration,
mentoring, supervision, research, and the Baby-AID kit.292
Finally, positive changes of mindsets by girls and boys are also happening because of interventions
such as those implemented by Ujamaa. The leaners themselves, especially girls, have made personal
gains through mentoring interventions. For example, district NGO interviewees mentioned that girls have
become more assertive and gained more self-esteem, which prompts them to confidently ask questions in
class and ultimately influences the improvement of their academic performance. The education sector
interviewees in Mzimba corroborated this impact by noting that, “we had a visit by the Minister of Education,
and girls were the ones that were boldly engaging her. The Minister noticed and pointed out that it’s high
time we also started mentoring boys because they weren’t as assertive as the girls.” Interviewed teachers
in rural primary schools confirmed that the mindsets of both boys and girls have changed for the better,
“previously, teachers would advise the learners against some conduct, but they would rebel. But this has
changed.”.

5.6.2 Likelihood of long-term impacts
Finding 31: While some interventions have already registered positive impacts on the living conditions
of children and women, potential impacts from other initiatives are likely to occur in the medium-to-long
term. Some unintended negative impacts have been registered as well (e.g., tension amongst and
within households as a result of cash transfer top-ups).
Positive Impacts
Evidence generated by UNICEF through evaluations has demonstrated that the social cash transfers are
used positively and have already registered impacts that span a wider range of outcomes, with the
overall impacts of the programmes on poverty, consumption, education, and health. Cash transfer
programmes improve the wellbeing of targeted populations, especially the ultra-poor, notably by improving
household food security – through increased real household consumption levels. The majority of SCTP
beneficiary households participating in these evaluations confirmed that the transfers had improved
education for children and nutrition outcomes.293,294 Previous evaluations have also found that cash transfer
in emergencies has had direct impact on poverty and vulnerable people’s lives, as beneficiaries used the
money to invest in small income generating activities: buying livestock such as chickens, in order to
eventually sell chicks or eggs to help with their children’s education expenses or joining village savings and
loans.295 It is likely that the impacts of these social cash transfers will continue in the medium to long-term
if the funding continues.
WASH interventions have changed people’s behaviours on hygiene, and reduced water-borne
diseases. Using higher quality water from an improved source in schools or communities, or basic
sanitation services generally impacts child growth. Stakeholders consulted at district and community levels,
including teachers, parents, and students, confirmed that improved sources of drinking water and sanitation
facilities in their areas have promoted the health of children and students, reducing cases of malnutrition
and infections. If the WASH systems put in place are properly maintained, it is likely that they will continue
to have a long-term impact.
The main positive impact registered by nutrition interventions is that children’s lives have been saved
after successfully recovering from severe acute malnutrition.296 These interventions improve food
diversity, increase breastfeeding and complementary feeding at 6 months, which has an impact on the rates
of malnourished children. Multiple interventions within health including ensuring vaccinations across a wide
range of diseases, addressing outbreaks including COVID-19, strengthening the health system, ensuring
quality maternal, newborn and child health, continued work in HIV (testing and ARTs), and continued work
to register births have all helped to contribute to the main positive long-term impact of better health for
children and mothers.297 The long-term impact will ultimately be reduced morbidity and mortality. For
ECE, the long-term impact of the CP’s work in Malawi will be to ensure more parents use positive parenting
as they raise their children, potentially resulting in healthier and happier children.
Many other interventions implemented by the CP are likely to register impacts in the medium to long-
term. For example, as described before, many SBC interventions that were implemented, aimed at
addressing norms and challenges at the root cause, rather than merely tending to the symptoms. Since
change in behaviours and attitudes does not happen overnight, these types of interventions will take time
to produce the expected impact, and that largely depends on whether follow-up projects are conceived as
long-term interventions.

Unintended Impacts
On the positive side, it emerged from interviews that PF4C interventions have helped discourse about
governance structures towards the restructuring of decentralized governance system and conceptualizing
a new approach which addresses specificity of districts/localities.
On the negative side, the evaluation of UNICEF's work on cash transfer programmes in emergencies
identified unintended impacts such as forced sharing of assistance, increased tension amongst and within
households as a result of cash transfer top-ups. Other negative outcomes include the fact that non-
beneficiaries in some places become angry because they do not fully comprehend why they were ineligible
for the programme, which may affect community cohesion.298 Some consulted stakeholders believe that
these negative effects call for a 'cash plus care' approach including social behavioural change
communication, grievance and redress mechanisms and a gender module for intra-household dynamics.
In addition, interviews with both central and district interviewees found that girls-only education interventions
breed resentment by vulnerable boys. It is becoming apparent that while maintaining the emphasis on girls,
the mission not to leave anyone behind should entail, given they are dropping out in concerning numbers
too, and that UNICEF should ensure that boys are not left behind. It will be important for these negative
unintended impacts to be mitigated to ensure long-term impact over time.
6 CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS LEARNED AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1 Conclusions
Relevance
The results of this evaluation lead to the conclusion that the CP as a whole and its specific interventions
have been highly relevant to Malawi in terms of promoting children's rights. The CP was designed in the
spirit of maximizing results for children through a shift to a life cycle approach, allowing to tackle children’s
rights challenges in a holistic manner. The CP programming was highly aligned with the GoM’s plans and
policies and is perceived to have remained relevant (over time) with evolving priorities, despite major
changes in the country and global context since 2019. By applying the child rights-based approach in its
programming (e.g., all strategy notes were informed by data and sound analyses that had established the
most important children’s rights issues in Malawi), the CP interventions provided responses to the most
pressing needs of vulnerable children, including adolescents, in Malawi. The evaluation identified a few
alignment gaps, including a misalignment with the priority of the GoM to (a) target parental behaviour
changes throughout the child lifecycle, (b) ensure access to WASH services at community level. In terms
of integrating cross-cutting issues, the design of the CP is strong on human rights and gender components,
but it is ‘mixed’ from an equity and inclusion perspective. Programming to meet substantive needs of
children with albinism, street connected children, vulnerable boys, and children at risk of child marriage has
fallen short.
Coherence
Generally, the CP is coherent internally and has integrated key UNICEF strategies and international
commitments. The ambitious innovations launched during the CP, including the Pillar approach, the Matrix
Management style, and Task Teams stand out as coherently addressing the key bottlenecks to meeting
the needs of children in Malawi. These change strategies have been successfully rolled out and
demonstrated their potential to achieve results; although they remain a work in progress and the change
needs more time to mature, they have contributed to considerable learning, improved cross-sectoral
collaboration, programme relevance and quality of interventions. Externally, this CPE paints a positive
picture of UNICEF strategic positioning in Malawi. UNICEF is perceived to be strategically positioned in
298 UNICEF Malawi (2021). Evaluation of UNICEF’s work on cash transfer programming in emergencies. Evaluation Report.
71
Malawi, given its comparative advantages in terms of upstream and downstream work, especially in the
areas of systems strengthening and capacity development. The work undertaken by the CP has been highly
complementary to projects and programs of the GoM and other partners, including other UN Agencies. The
MCO is seen as a team player within the UN system and among development partners in Malawi. Its
leadership in the education and nutrition sectors, its coordinating role in emergencies and its active
participation in joint UN programming, are particularly appreciated by all CP’s stakeholders.
Notwithstanding, there is a need to continue to maximize efforts in joint programming, delivering as One,
alongside regularized, joint monitoring with other United Nations agencies.
Effectiveness
The evaluation has established that the CP has had a positive performance, as reported through available
MCO results monitoring documents and confirmed by stakeholder consultations in Lilongwe, Mangochi,
Mzimba, Chikwawa and Kasungu. While the CP components have performed differently in achieving the
planned outputs and outcomes, the evaluation found that, overall, the MCO was on track towards achieving
the targets of outcome and output-level indicators. Under the current CP, UNICEF and the GoM worked to
improve access to quality services for children through the Pillar approach. The CP interventions
contributed to improving and expanding these services, as demonstrated by the achieved progress on some
indicators at national level (examples: under-5 birth registration has seen an increase from 2% in 2018 to
over 50% in 2022, the percentage of HIV-exposed infants receiving a virological test for HIV within 2 months
of birth has increased from 61% in 2018 to 85% in 2022). The CP provided humanitarian support, including
ensuring ongoing access to services throughout an emergency. However, there are opportunities for further
work to build on a strong humanitarian-development nexus, including ensuring funding is in place, and
developing the appropriate structures to integrate emergencies in the long-term work. The cross-cutting
dimensions of gender equality, equity, human rights, inclusion, youth empowerment and climate change
are well reflected in the programme results.
The improvements in access to basic services described above were achieved alongside (and benefited
from) achievements in terms of systems strengthening and capacity development, as well as advocacy.
The CP has strengthened the capacity of government institutions and CSOs, notably through the
development of sector planning documents, strategies, and policies opening pathways for system
strengthening. This is evident in the work of all three Pillars.
Nevertheless, the optimal achievement of results at country level, or at least in the UNICEF-supported
districts, has been challenging in other areas of UNICEF work in Malawi due mostly to insufficient funding.
Notably, under Pillar I, access to drinking water services in Malawi has slightly improved over the CP period,
while no progress has been made in provision of basic sanitation services. This is not surprising though, as
the WASH sector is under Pillar III which has received the least allocation among the three Pillars. Indeed,
the evaluation has shown that WASH programming is an area of work where donor priorities are typically
tuned out unless in the case of disasters. Although IFIs, such as the World Bank have started paying
attention to this sector, the WASH sector remains an area that needs to be prioritized, given its implications
on other sectors such as health, nutrition, and education. Despite the significant increase in terms of birth
registration, more work is needed to ensure data is entered in a timely way, and that people obtain birth
certificates in a timely manner.
Education, under Pillar II, is another area which has suffered from insufficient funding due, in part, to the
re-focusing of donor priorities. Inconsistencies in funding for the education sector can lead to successful
pilot programs not being scaled up and terminated due to lack of resources. Evidence further indicates that
the execution of some Pillar II initiatives - such as in school construction - have been affected by changing
priorities of donors. These trends in programming commitments and priorities need to be closely studied
and reflected upon for the next CP. In particular, the declining budget trends demonstrated in this evaluation
suggest that the MCO must make informed choices for UNICEF’s future investments in Malawi, to ensure
that the support is focused on the most essential areas of the work.
The three Pillar approach has somewhat contributed to achieving the CP results. However, to maximize
the effects of this approach on children results, more needs to be done, both within the MCO and externally,
to ensure full integration and programmatic convergence. Evidence from this evaluation also leads to the
conclusion that the lack of robust integrated packages of interventions across the three Pillars appear to
have hindered achievement of the desired results. This is largely associated with donor funding modalities
72
which are still sector-driven, as well as the fact that the MCO works with the GoM, which is still organized
in a sectoral, not child-centred manner. All this has often acted as a deterrent to pillar joint proposal
development, programming and operationalising joint interventions.
All in all, the results of this CPE show that the assumption identified in the CP’s theory of change, namely
that “donors and partners invest in children and work collaboratively and in coordination on integrated
planning”, and the largest risk identified by the theory of change of the “structurally facilitated integration”
(which describes a change journey for the CO) namely that “there are not enough resources put toward
supporting and catalysing the change and the training/knowledge/skill development required (specifically
in results reporting), have at least partially been borne out.
Efficiency
Mobilizing adequate funding resources has been a persistent challenge for the MCO, given the current
context of dwindling international development assistance and unanticipated crises such as COVID-19 and
the Russia-Ukraine war. Nevertheless, the evaluation concludes that mobilized financial resources
were appropriately allocated and used effectively in most interventions given the effective
management approaches implemented. There is also a positive perception that gender interventions
benefited from the strategic allocation of resources due to the comprehensive articulation of gender action
points for each pillar under the Country Gender Equality Strategy. While allocated funds have for the most
part been adequate for delivering the CP planned intermediate results, such as piloting interventions,
revising policy documents, and delivering trainings, resources have remained insufficient to accomplish the
totality of the activities needed to meet the needs of children. Overall, human resources have been
adequate to implement the CP. Despite experiencing staff attrition during the Programme period, the staff
complement of the MCO has been optimal throughout, with required capacities in the relevant fields of the
CP.
Sustainability
The CP created many results that are likely to be sustained in the long run, but the likelihood is both variable
and moderate, depending on the intervention areas. While some results may be sustainable over time,
notably the policy and strategy instruments developed with the technical support of the MCO as well as
capacity developed at individual, organizational and institutional levels in all sectors of UNICEF
interventions, there are many areas that require ongoing donor resources to ensure sustainability. These
include the continued provision of commodities such as vaccinations, ensuring sustainability of work done
via SBC, as behaviour change takes time and consistent messaging is important, or PF4C interventions
which are contingent on institutional changes and reforms at all levels of the government, yet such changes
are generally slow and take time to be fully implemented and show results. Overall, in Malawi, sustaining
many results remains highly reliant on international development funding, and given changing donor
priorities, their sustainability is questionable. The successive emergencies in Malawi constrain the
sustainability of the results from the emergency interventions, given the need to rebuild infrastructure and
resettle affected populations. A trend has been noted of bilateral donors having to reduce and re-focus
priorities as a result of COVID-19. Gaps in consistency in funding can lead to successful pilot programs not
being scaled up and terminated due to lack of resources. These trends in programming commitments and
priorities need to be closely studied and reflected upon for the next CP.
Orientation Towards Impact
Among other important differences made by the CP interventions is the progress in children’s rights at the
strategic level in terms of strengthening the enabling environment, which enhanced the capacity of the GoM
and other duty bearers to realize children’s rights. There is also evidence of changes in living conditions of
children at school and in their homes due to programmes such as the SCTP. Evidence exists that
improvements of WASH services to households and communities, healthcare facilities and schools have
fostered the development of a happy, healthy child and mother, that lives of children have been saved
through being treated by health and nutrition interventions, while positive changes of mindsets by girls and
boys are happening because of interventions such as those implemented by Ujamaa. However, many other
interventions implemented by the CP are only likely to register impacts in the medium-to-long term (e.g.,
SBC interventions addressing norms). Some unintended negative impacts have been registered as well,
such as forced sharing of assistance, increased tension amongst and within households as a results of
73
cash transfer top-ups, or the fact that girls-only education interventions breed resentment in vulnerable
boys.
Cross-cutting issues
This evaluation concludes that the CP was designed with the deliberate purpose of promoting children’s
rights (including adolescents) across all its pillars, including in the areas of operational and program
effectiveness. This has been achieved by a focus on systems strengthening, especially the adoption of laws
and policies to facilitate the implementation of the CRC in Malawi. The CP has solidly contributed towards
promoting gender equality as evidenced by a robust country Gender Equality Strategy that proposed
specific gender actions for each pillar, as well as indicators to be tracked through the main program results
framework. The main strength of the CP in both development and humanitarian contexts has been to
achieve human rights and gender results, though grey areas remain. In this regard, while certainly gender
responsive, most indicators have not focused on qualitatively tracking gender transformative results to
reveal actual changes to norms, attitudes, and practices that the interventions are triggering. Moreover,
gender interventions targeting vulnerable boys as beneficiaries have been limited. When it comes to
inclusion interventions results, these are inconsistently addressed because strategic focus has been on
gender mainstreaming, although consciousness of the issue of disability is starting to increase. But in
respect to equity results, these are generally hard to discern from most of the results. More needs to be
done to systematically capture progress made for specific groups of children in the vulnerability cycle,
entailing that interventions cannot yet claim to be leaving no child behind.
By design, the CP sought to empower youth through strengthening their competencies and skills, as well
as promoting their participation in decision making processes. A central part of the UNICEF approach also
involved supporting the development of youth targeted policies and strategies, notably the National Youth
Policy and Youth Investment Plan. However, these contributions have not necessarily been made based
on a clear definition of the role of UNICEF in promoting the youth development in Malawi. Finally, the CP
has been responsive to climate change issues which have been mainstreamed directly and indirectly
through the Pillars’ work. The CP included climate specific indicators in the results framework, which has
influenced the achievement of results. Some of these results, such as the Climate Resilient WASH financing
strategy, present opportunities for the MCO to continue advancing climate change action in Malawi even
more.
6.2 Lessons Learned
This section captures the key lessons derived from the analysis of the findings presented in Section 5.
Lesson 1:
Implementing a LCA in a Country Programme involves complex processes and requires important
changes (in people’s mindsets and organizational systems, structures, and practices) both within
the implementing organization and external partners. These changes must happen before the LCA
can influence change in results for children. The findings of this evaluation (notably Findings 6, 7) have
shown that the implementation of the Pillar approach during the CP 2019-2023 needed to be accompanied
by many other approaches and structures (e.g., Matrix Management style, Task Teams) and required a
shift in mindsets of staff at all levels. Only then could the CP interventions start registering changes in
results for children. At the same time, the findings show that the influence of the Pillar approach on the CP
results is still limited by the lack of awareness of this approach outside of UNICEF, notably among
government and donor institutions which still work with UNICEF through sectoral approaches (see Finding
12).
Lesson 2:
Close partnerships and coordination are strong success factors for a development cooperation
program. The analysis conducted in this evaluation demonstrates that the UNICEF-Malawi CP 2019-2023
has achieved its results through close coordination with the GoM across all Pillars. Engagement with
government actors at central and district levels ensured ownership of the processes and eased the
establishment of local-level partnerships, including with local authorities, CSOs and traditional leaders,
which ensured efficient, effective, and rapid outreach to communities. The partnerships, which further
74
extended to other development partners – including UN Agencies, civil society organizations and private
sector, not only ensured the use of government structures, which is an important component for the smooth
functioning, buy-in, scale-up and sustainability of the programme results, but also ensured avoidance of
duplication of work. For instance, close collaboration and communication among UNICEF, Ministry of
Education and other implementing partners helped to rapidly achieve significant results in providing safe
school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic at the earliest.
Lesson 3:
Piloting innovative approaches is a necessary condition for identifying good practices in a
particular context, their scaling up is a sufficient condition to bring about lasting changes in the
situation of children at the societal level. This evaluation showed that the CP has piloted several
approaches in the country. However, unless these pilots are brought to scale, they can hardly create the
expected impact on the lives of children in Malawi (related to Finding 15).
Lesson 4:
In a country where communities are repeatedly hit by different shocks, short-term and reactive
emergency responses can save lives, but their longer-term development effects are limited. These
can only occur when emergency and humanitarian actions are included as part of the overall
planning, as these will always be a key part of the Country Programme. Findings from the evaluation
reveal that UNICEF has played a key role in humanitarian work, including ensuring ongoing access to
services throughout emergencies such as COVID-19, tropical storms and cyclones, floods, cholera, and
polio outbreaks. The results also show that, in some cases, emergency responses can be easily
transitioned to development, for example in the case of oxygen plants which can be used to provide oxygen
for other needs beyond COVID-19, including for neonates. However, the CP emergency interventions have
been generally short-term in nature and reactive to the circumstances and did not always consider the
likelihood that some emergencies will endure in the long term and or come back, despite the country's
obvious vulnerability to emergencies (related to Findings 21 and 22).
Lesson 5:
For geographical convergence to produce the results expected, it needs to be mainstreamed within
the Country Office, understood, and adhered to by all stakeholders concerned, internally and
externally. The findings of this evaluation (notably Finding 20) showed that geographic convergence as an
approach has been challenging to implement during the current CP. Although the CP document alludes to
the use of this approach (i.e., focusing the CP sub-national interventions on selected geographical areas),
it appeared that there was no shared understanding of the approach across the Office and among external
partners, how it was to be implemented and what it was expected to achieve. Moreover, the approach did
not actually become the key guiding principle in programming, as there were no other key documents
referring to it, with details of its implementation.
Lesson 6:
Deliberately and consistently implementing gender transformative and socially inclusive
programming at scale, as well as institutionalizing it in workflows, is what will ensure sustainable
and comprehensive programming that ‘leaves no one behind.’ Positively, the findings of the evaluation
(notably Findings 4, 6, 17) have shown that the CP’s approach of institutionalizing gender mainstreaming
in workflows has been an innovative strategy to ensure that gender is accounted for in program results and
that staff members have necessary gender mainstreaming capacity. However, gender responsive
programming as promoted by the country Gender Equality Strategy is only a good entry point, and strides
need to be made to attain gender transformative results that are now being prioritized in the UNICEF GAP
III 2022 – 2026. Furthermore, limited framing of the country strategy (as an exclusively ‘gender’ strategy),
as well as lack of conceptual clarity of what underpins ‘inclusion’ and ‘equity’ under the CP hindered
adequate strategizing around inclusion and equity results. Disability inclusion was inconsistent due to the
lack of indicators for continuously capturing data on children with disabilities.
75
6.3 Recommendations
The recommendations presented in this section have been formulated based on the findings and the
conclusions of this evaluation. The preliminary recommendations were first discussed with a wide range of
MCO staff and mangers as well as external partners in a virtual presentation on the evaluation findings and
recommendations, which was held on 24 October 2022. This process enabled the evaluation team to
receive feedback, which helped to validate and refine the recommendations. The recommendations
presented in Table 6.1 include two categories, strategic and operational. While strategic
recommendations focus on enhancing the strategic positioning of UNICEF, both internally and externally,
ensuring that the next CP creates a greater value for Malawi, operational recommendations are focused
on institutional and implementation mechanisms necessary to achieve strategic recommendations.

This will require:
• Prioritization exercise conducted in close coordination and consultation
with the GoM, stakeholders and donors.
• Analysis of available financing resources, ensuring that the planned
results are achievable, taking into account macro-economic conditions,
donor commitments, and including a partnerships strategy - including UN
- based on UNICEF comparative advantages.
• Focus on interventions that advance cross-pillar, working in carefully
selected geographic areas to maximize programmatic, lifecycle and
geographic convergence gains.
• Base the CP on general equity principles and proper child deprivation

RECOMMENDATIONS RESPONSIBILITY PRIORITY AND KEY
TIMELINE FINDINGS
• Implement findings of the Gender Programmatic Review to provide
strategic direction on transformative programming.
• Prioritize girls’ leadership and agency, including by strengthening ‘gender
and technology’ approaches as an emerging area of global interest to
UNICEF.
• Move from the merely gender responsive approach of GAP II to GAP III’s
focus on expanding gender transformative approaches throughout all
UNICEF programming, as well as in institutional policies, partnerships,
and capacities.
• Redefine the SCTP programming to focus more robustly on gender
transformative cash transfer programming as guided by the UNICEF
global indicator on gender transformative and gender responsive social
protection.299
• Invest much more in gender evidence generation so that in addition to
quantitative data, qualitative data disaggregated by gender and
inclusion/equity variables is produced.
• Establish targets and develop interventions to contribute to transforming
community knowledge, attitudes, and practices, while identifying
community “process champions”.
• Prioritize girls’ leadership and agency and gender transformative cash
transfer.
• Strengthen the next gender equality strategy for UNICEF Malawi by
broadening the scope of this strategy (as well as the ‘gender’
position/portfolio) to visibly cover ‘equity and inclusion’ for more
comprehensive promotion and protection of child rights.
• Beyond collecting sex disaggregated data, strengthen the CP results
framework with indicators on children (including adolescents) with multiple
vulnerabilities (e.g., children with disabilities, street children, ultra-poor)
across all pillars.
• Integrate the principles of Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities in CP strategies and consistently disaggregate disability data
by sex and type of disability, in line with UNICEF DIPAS 2022-2030.
