1. Executive summary
During the year 2022, and at the request of UNICEF Argentina, the Measurement Center of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (measures UC)
He carried out the PLANEA PROGRAM EVALUATION DEVELOPED IN PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE PROVINCE OF TUCUMÁN. Said program
It seeks a transformation of secondary schools, through a new pedagogical model and various strategies whose purpose
last is to guarantee greater inclusion, quality in learning and development of key skills for life, as well as
Level termination for all students. To achieve this, plan contemplates resources, components and actions in the
different levels of the system from the provincial management to the classroom, through the formation of networks and training of directors
of school and teachers.
The evaluation aims to assess the relevance, efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, coherence and impact of the program under the
Equity approaches, human rights with emphasis on gender equality during the 2018-2022 period. Through your findings
and conclusions, it seeks to give recommendations to the agency responsible for its design and financing, such as UNICEF - Argentina,
to the Ministry of Education of Tucumán, as responsible for its implementation and monitoring in the province, in addition to
provide feedback to schools, their managers and teachers, as responsible for the implementation and coordination of
its management and deployment of pedagogical practices in classrooms.
To evaluate the program, a mixed design was chosen combining qualitative information collection and analysis techniques and
quantitative. For the impact evaluation, the 16 schools that began with planned in the province were chosen during 2018
and a group of 16 control schools were selected that had similar characteristics to them2 to whose students of 4th and 5th of
Secondary tests were applied to measure learning results, questionnaires to evaluate a transferable skill and also
To obtain information about your experience in school. Additionally, a sample of teachers and directors for
Answer questions specially designed for this process. To deepen through qualitative strategies, it was defined
A subsample of 6 plan schools where interviews were interviewed with directors and focal groups to students and teachers.
Finally, the above was complemented with an in -depth study that it considered interviewing and observing the classroom practices of 8
teachers and analyze the productions of their students. All of the above involved design information collection instruments
(tests, questionnaires, interview guidelines and focal groups and classroom observation rubrics), to cover the dimensions and
Evaluation questions of this study.
Main findings
The main results of the evaluation process reflect that it plans is attingivate and addresses the problems and needs of the
Secondary Education of the Province and the Country, and that its design was founded on a careful diagnosis of them, seeking to impact
systemically at all levels necessary to generate the changes proposed. Likewise, evaluation findings
indicate that it is a program that has been adapted to the context of the province as long as it had mechanisms to receive
feedback and incorporate important changes from this. Together with this, it was also found that he planned to be anchored in a
Previous policy implemented in the province, new format schools, which clearly favored their relevance for the
context and also reflected his willingness to be consistent and synergy with other programs and policies in the province.
Another positive aspect is the high commitment and high assessment reported by all the actors involved in plan, highlighting
especially your pedagogical proposal. This high level of motivation undoubtedly contributes with a propitious basis for continuity and
Sustainability of the program in the province.
As noted, the program involves a transformation of high school at its multiple levels: from the level
institutional and provincial policy until the practices in the classroom. The complexity of this model where the components are very

concatenated from each other, it meant facing different implementation rhythms for some of them, which impacted others. By
example, the allocation of a greater number of professional hours to the program schools, to facilitate that they could implement
The pedagogical model has been achieved, but more slowly than expected, which in turn affects the rhythm with which it is possible
Deepen the proposed changes at the classroom level.
The pedagogical core of the program (project -based learning and training evaluation) is the most valued component and the
which the actors attribute greater potential, in addition to presenting a good level of implementation (the designed projects are used
In teaching, monitoring of students learning and less frequency of traditional strategies of
learning evaluation). However, this component has not been exempt from some difficulties, since its implementation does not
reaches the levels to which it was aspirated and is dissimilar between classrooms and subjects, since 40% of teachers planned reports
Use this methodology in less than half of its classes3 being greater the implementation figure in language than in mathematics
According to the student report. Those involved also report an important gap between the level of previous learning
that projects as a floor require (for example, in literacy), and the level that an important group of students presents, what
which implies a challenge for teachers and the risk of weakening their relevance as a pedagogical proposal. Finally, the
observations of classroom practices and interviews with teachers suggest that little attention and monitoring of the
individual learning, and that emphasis on training and group work seems to be interpreted as a turn
Exclusive assessment of attitudes (eg collaboration, effort, complete tasks) at the expense of the achievement of learning goals.
Regarding the impact assessment, the results obtained from the learning and mathematical learning tests, as well as the
Analysis of students' trajectories, they did not allow solid evidence regarding the expected impact of the program on
The referred dimensions. Indeed, the exercise faced different limitations that prevent these results as
conclusive The available data restrictions did not allow adequate balance between the treated sample and the control sample
At the student level. In addition, during the evaluation information was obtained that teachers transfer practices
implemented in schools plans the other schools where they work, which questions the tax distinction between schools
‘Treaties’ and ‘Not treated’ (or control) and could help understand the few differences found between both groups in several
of the intermediate results. On the other hand, the general school promotion policies introduced during and after the
Pandemia, had an effect on trajectory indicators, which make the efforts of plans to encourage indistinguishable
more continuous trajectories and reduce the repetition of the general measures adopted from 2020. Finally, the interruption and
program intermittency during 2020 and 2021, they meant that students' exhibition was much less than the
planned and necessary to evaluate their results in the variables that are sought to impact. 4.
In the body of this report, the statistical exercises carried out whose findings must be interpreted attentive to these
Restrictions
In sum, in the opinion of the evaluation team, plans is a well -designed and very complete program, attating to the needs of the

that its potential has been deployed sufficiently to make an assessment of its impact on learning or trajectories
School
Lessons learned
From this evaluation, some learnings arise that can be generalizable to the context of the secondary schools of
Argentina. These are:
• The success of having a systemic model that is implemented collaboratively, where the transformations not only
They are intentionally intentionally, but also at the management level of the school and provincial policy.
• Promote the formation of capacities at all levels of the system, thereby favoring the deepening of the changes.
• Achieve a greater time concentration of teachers, to have more permanence time in schools and,
Facilitate spaces for collaboration and coordination.
• For future program evaluations, methodologically it is recommended to perform complementary analysis from
data raised in national tests, such as learning 2022, which are census and have instruments
comparable between years.
Recommendations
Next, the recommendations that emerge from the evaluation are presented, some of them addressed to UNICEF Argentina,
others for the province of Tucumán and finally for school management teams. These are:
Recommendations for UNICEF Argentina:
• Hold the systemic plan intervention model that covers from provincial management to the classroom, through
The management teams of schools and support provided to students.
• Maintain and strengthen the collaborative work model as a strategy for strengthening capacities in all
program intervention levels.
• In the design of the program incorporate and explain a sequential model of its implementation (stages structured
flexible), including an initial phase of diagnosis of entry conditions in each school (level of learning of the
students, technological equipment and connectivity, time dedication of teachers of the trunk subjects) for
adapt the strategy and favor its relevance to the context and reality of each of them. In a second stage you can
display the program starting with the most viable components according to each school, and then lead to a stage
of greater autonomy that allows efforts and resources to concentrate on schools that are entering
Plan.
• Sustain technical assistance to advance more quickly in the policy of expansion of the hours of permanence of
Teachers and managers in schools. This is extremely relevant as a greater time concentration of the
teachers allows to give greater continuity and depth in the teaching and learning processes, in addition to facilitating
Collaboration and coordination spaces between teachers.
• Maintain support at the disposal of pedagogical resources for the classroom in schools plans prioritized in the program
of cooperation in the province of Tucumán and adapt or develop materials complementary for schools in the
that there are students with important learning lags, particularly in their literacy skills.
• Reorient current tracking devices so that monitoring and accompaniment of pedagogical practices
They deepen the implementation of the pedagogical nucleus at classroom level.
7
• Strengthen the learning evaluation model5 articulating it with the need to certify and rate the level of achievement
individual, and promote through networks, the understanding of this by teachers, especially in the reference
to focus more attention on curricular learning and the expectations of achieving students. For this I know
recommends enriching the materials available for teachers regarding learning evaluation6 and reviewing the
Evaluation orientations presented in the projects.
Recommendations for the province of Tucumán:
• Implement a diagnostic system applicable by the teachers themselves in order to identify gaps at the levels of
learning of students entering secondary schools plan and generate strategies to strengthen
Mathematics and Lecture skills if necessary7.
• Deepen, through pedagogical advisors the monitoring and monitoring system of the classroom implementation,
especially of the pedagogical nucleus, and implement a training model that distinguishes between teachers that just
They enter the program and those who have more years of experience implementing.
• Explicitly articulate the evaluation model it promotes with the existing qualification regime in the
Province.
• Hold and expand efforts to concentrate teachers' schedules in schools.
• Generate more efficient and coordinated management of different activities with teachers, including their training,
so that the time destined for learning is protected.
• Avoid the rotation of the technical and professional teams that carry out the accompaniment of the schools plans, and of this
way to ensure the efficiency in execution and thus protect the investment that the province has made for them and
specializing them.
Recommendations for school management teams:
• Hold driving networks and in the case of schools that have been using them as a space to generate
collectively solutions, for example, to strengthen the follow -up of school trajectories that is one of the
components with the lowest implementation level.
• Integrate an accompaniment and feedback model to teachers.
More details about the recommendations in the last chapter of this report.
5 In training, include well -achieved performance illustrations for students' productions, classified according to levels of
rubrics, explicitly articulate training evaluation and qualification guiding how to qualify individual learning in a work context
group, exemplify feedback practices for project activities, etc.
6 For example, illustrations of the level of performance that is expected of students in their productions through written examples or in material
audiovisual categorized according to rubrics, orientations and examples regarding how to evaluate and qualify individual performance in the
Context of group work.
7 It is advisable that this is complemented with earlier evaluations in third or primary school, in order to prevent the lag.

2. Context and presentation of the evaluation object
2.1 Context of the Plan Program
The right to education is registered in the foundations of National Education Law (Law 26.206) Argentina, as well as in
different international instruments of the global educational agenda. The objectives of education for all (Dakar, 2000), objective
Millennium Nº2 (ODM, United Nations, 2000), and Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015) guide the agenda
from countries towards compliance with the right to education. The ODS 2030 in their development objective for education (SDG4)
emphasizes the need to guarantee an inclusive, equitable and quality education and promote opportunities for
learning throughout life8. This represents a broad framework for the achievement of the inclusion and development of measures to combat
Any type of inequality focus on the most disadvantaged populations. In this context, cooperation of
UNICEF in the education sector in Argentina that considers the United Nations Strategic Framework for the
Development (MECNUD) for 2016-2020, as well as with the United Nations Strategic Cooperation Framework
Sustainable from Argentina 2021-2025 and aligns with the sustainable development objectives established as global goals by the
United Nations. Likewise, it is part of the current national laws according to the fulfillment of the Convention on the
Rights of the child and the right to education.
Under this framework, since 2017 the UNICEF office in Argentina promotes the development of a pedagogical model (plans) of
Regular Secondary Education for adolescents of urban contexts that guarantee greater inclusion, quality in learning and
Termity of the level to all adolescents, mainly those belonging to the most vulnerable sectors.
In recent years, important regulatory advances in Argentina have been verified to promote the effective exercise of the
Right to education of all children and adolescents. In coherence with the different international instruments of the
Global Educational Agenda9, the right to education is registered in the foundations of the National Argentine Education Law
sanctioned in 2006 (Law 26.206) and a series of international agreements and sanctioned laws have been adopted to guarantee the
Right to education. Examples of this are Law 26,061 on Integral Protection of the Rights of Children and Adolescents; he
Convention 169 of the ILO, as well as Law 26,390 for prohibition of child labor and adolescent work (UNICEF-FLACSO,
2020).
The aforementioned Law 26.206 of National Education (LEN) provides the regulatory framework to guarantee quality education and
Promote equity throughout the territory, overcoming the fragmentation and inequality that is evident both in the offer and in the
processes and educational results. This law reestablishs the structure of educational levels (initial, primary, secondary and higher),
some of which had been modified by previous legislation. It also adds three years to compulsory schooling, which
It reaches 14 years. The sanction of the Educational Financing Law (2005) marked a turning point when establishing the threshold of
Minimum investment in the country's education sector. It delimited a progressive increase in resources to achieve investment
of 6% of GDP in education, science and technology in 2010 and, subsequently, the LEN stipulated that, once the goal was reached, the
National State Budget and provincial jurisdictions destined exclusively for education, could not be lower
6% of GDP (excluding science and technology) (Claus & Bucciarelli, 2020). Despite these advances, there are still great challenges, already
that even when schooling rates at the national level are high, problems in supply, trajectories and learning
achieved in compulsory education, they reveal a gap between what laws, policies and programs and the results achieved indicate
(UNICEF-FLACSO, 2020).

At the secondary level, about 4 million adolescents attend school, and assistance rates exceed 80% in both cycles
(basic and oriented). However, 3 out of 10 students travel their schooling and this is due in large part to which
They have repeated previous years or interruptions during their previous school career10.
As declared in the terms of reference of the evaluation plans that is reported in this document, at the time of the
Program implementation, school trajectories at the secondary level have a different dynamic in each cycle. In the cycle
Basic is warned of greater importance in the indicators of repetition with respect to those of abandonment (11.6% vs. 8.4%,
respectively), while in the oriented cycle abandonment is superior to repetition (14.5% vs. 6.4%, respectively)
(Diniee, 2017). On the other hand, the passage through the school does not ensure having achieved the expected skills and knowledge: 7 out of 10
Students of the last year of high school do not reach or exceed the basic knowledge stipulated in national evaluations in
Mathematics and almost half does not do so in language (Meccyt, 2017). These figures that are maintained in 2019 for mathematics and in the case
of language, 4 out of 10 students does not achieve or exceed the satisfactory level11. In addition, according to data from the 2010 census, nearby
of 500,000 boys and girls are out of school and less than half of the adolescents of a cohort that enters high school
manages to complete it (45%) 12. Extracurricular factors such as the low socio -educational level of the home, belonging to an indigenous home and/or
migrant and school factors linked to pedagogical models, the disparity of resources, material conditions and
professionals that schools have in different territorial contexts affect the school trajectories of children and girls
adolescents and impact the exercise of their right to education.
According to UNICEF data in 2012: 14% of adolescents aged 15 to 17 did not complete high school because they had to enter
to the labor market; 8.8%, due to economic difficulties to sustain the course, buy books and pay transport; 10%, for a
pregnancy or child care situation. 29.6% of young people claimed to have abandoned the school for not
Consider it necessary or not like. According to this publication (UNICEF-Flacso, 2020) among the reasons that explain this
situation, are: the organization of subjects by discipline, which raises knowledge in a fragmented way and hinders the
construction of deep learning; the contents that in many cases are decontextualized and the strategies of
teaching that usually focus on the repetition of information without promoting active processing by students.
In the province of Tucumán, the education of adolescents faces great challenges, especially in the most contexts
Vulnerable. The program plans to accompany schools to be in this type of context. The information
Available statistics indicates that although secondary education is mandatory since 2006, according to the annual survey 2011-
2020, the registration of the province of Tucumán has decreased by 20% since 2011 to 2020. In the case of state schools, it is observed
that the registration of the last years of high school is systematically lower than the first years. This same situation is repeated
In schools plans (see Annex 13), showing large barriers to students to complete the level. Although the province
De Tucumán has a lower percentage of dropout than the country's average, the schools of the Tucumán state sector are found
above the average of the province. The results of the learning operations indicate that in the province there are low

satisfactory or advanced in language, while 77.8% of the young people of NSE Alto reach these levels; In the case of the Middle NSE,
56.1% of young people reach these levels14. In mathematics, only 7.9% of the young people of NSE bass achieve performance
satisfactory or advanced, in contrast to 19.7% of the young people of Middle NSE and 46.5% of the young people of NSE Alto15. The young
who have never repeated school in secondary school have a better language and mathematics performance compared to those young people

of the region, women at the secondary level have to have better indicators of trajectories than their peers men, better
Language and worse learning results in mathematics. This is observed at the national and provincial level in the same trend. In
Language, we see that in the state establishments of Tucumán, women usually have slightly higher scores to those of
men. This trend is reversed for schools, where it is men who, for both years, overcome
significantly in performance of women. In mathematics, we see consistently that women have a worse score than
The men. In addition, we usually see a downward trend in time, both for women and men. In the
Schools plans, there is a significant difference according to gender: the women of these schools have improved their score in the period,
while men have decreased it.

schools are inserted in a context of high social vulnerability, with indicators of trajectory and learning below the average
State of the province of Tucumán. State establishments in the province have a higher level of vulnerability
that the average of Tucumán, which has also increased in the 2017-2019 period (both for the urban sector
as for the rural). Within state establishments, the rural sector is significantly more vulnerable.
The establishments plan are also more vulnerable than the average of state establishments, but
They are less vulnerable than rural state. In schools plans, there has also been an increase in the level
of vulnerability in the 2017 and 2019 period. The data presented account for the challenges presented by the
educational systems to ensure compliance with quality education for all adolescents in
2030. Within the framework of the development objective number 4 that establishes development goals in education, UNICEF
It supports national and provincial governments in Argentina to make compromised goals19.

2.2 Object of the evaluation
Given the context described in the previous section, in 2017 UNICEF Argentina designed, together with a group of renowned pedagogues
and specialists from the educational field, the model plans, new school for adolescents, an initiative that promotes assistance
technique and strengthening institutional capacities to accelerate the process of transformation of the secondary level. Plan
seeks to contribute to the development of a pedagogical model of regular secondary education for adolescents that guarantees greater
Inclusion, quality in learning, favor the development of key skills for life and termination of the level of all and
The teenagers. To do this, plan seeks to accompany the provincial educational efforts in the transformation of the school
secondary.

The program plans and the degree to which its objectives have been achieved until 2022 in the province of Tucumán in which its
Implementation, is the object of the evaluation that is synthesized in this report.
Plan
The general program objectives are:
i) guarantee more and better educational opportunities developing innovations in the ways of teaching and learning and
ensuring the well -being of adolescents at school.
i) provide technical assistance to provincial governments to develop an inclusive and quality secondary education that
Train adolescents in critical knowledge and abilities for their life in the SXXI.
Plan seeks that all (as) adolescents develop fundamental knowledge and abilities in the curricular trunk areas
and transferable skills such as learning and metacognition capabilities, active citizenship skills, creativity,
Critical thinking, problem solving, collaborative work and effective communication. To do this, he proposes the
Student participation in the learning process based on activities involving authentic problems
and that require them to make decisions, investigate in various sources, relationship various content, knowledge and languages. In addition,
Promotes digital literacy and programming teaching to prepare students for the digital world. The model
It integrates transversely into its contents, strategies and models of participation, the human rights and gender approach.
Attentive to non -discrimination, promotion of educational inclusion of all and all adolescents. The program promotes a
Attentive look in all its actions to close the gaps of gender inequality and the integral development of adolescents.
This model contemplates the planning and implementation of a set of institutional and management initiatives and activities, which
They contribute to the ultimate goal of the change proposed in schools and teaching and learning practices in the classroom. The SE program
focuses on the first cycle of high school in order to consolidate the development of key knowledge and skills to advance
In the educational trajectory at the level, distinguishing 3 levels of intervention with their respective components:
(i) system and management level:
• Technical and financial support and cooperation with ministerial teams in their management.
• Adaptation of regulations. Promotion of changes in the organization of teaching work, the use of spaces and times
schoolchildren, follow -up to school trajectories and review the evaluation, promotion and accreditation criteria.
(ii) Institution-school level:
• Network work: driving equipment network (directors, supervisors, pedagogical advisors). The management teams
From schools plan they meet monthly to find solutions to common problems linked to the
institutional management and plan implementation in each of the schools.
• Development of documents for reflection and change. The driving network elaborates specific documents that
They serve as a guide for the implementation of change in schools.
• In pairs (teachers). The teachers of each school carry out recreational, cultural or training activities for
Promote teamwork and the sense of belonging to the school community.
• I project (students). The students of each school carry out student participation activities for
provide conditions for collaborative work and institutional belonging at the same time as enhancing the voice of
teenagers
• Pedagogical advice and accompaniment to schools. Technical teams attending schools plan in the
adaptation and adaptation to change.
• Integral Advice in Adolescent Health: It is proposed as a space for listening and consultation for the students of the
school, in charge of local health referents or the institution. Advice takes place during school hours to
through individual or group encounters.
12
iii) level teaching-learning processes:
• Teacher network. Teachers plan have specific materials for each of the disciplinary areas
trunk to implement project -based learning. Periodically they meet to know the material and
train in the pedagogical and formative evaluation approach of the program. In turn, gradually, a group of
Teachers assume project design tasks.
• Project -based learning. Specific projects are designed for the classroom of each of the areas
curricular in which it focuses on plans.
• Student advisor. This figure seeks to provide an individualized form of attention to the student population with
The purpose of ensuring that teenagers who go to high school remain throughout the entire formative journey.
• Learning Workshop: Workshop on Learning Strategies for Students. Students are offered activities
that allow them to consolidate their role as apprentices; collaboratively address school work; and learn to
Search, systematize and interpret information from different sources.
• Technology. Reconversion of the contents of the curriculum of the subject to prioritize digital literacy, teaching
and learning from basic knowledge of the digital world and introduction to knowledge of computer science and
programming. Strengthening of the training of teachers in charge.
• Inter -teaching evaluation council (CEI). A group of school teachers meet at the end of each quarter to
Analyze the integral situation of students, especially those who have low notes20.
The program plans to develop in the province of Tucumán, under the leadership of the secondary level management of the Ministry
of Education of Tucumán. UNICEF, together with other implementing organizations, accompanies the implementation of the program.
UNICEF has participated in the design of the initiative, carrying the proposal called Plannea, New School for Adolescents,
which was contextualized based on the provisions of the province and the background in the province. UNICEF provides assistance
technical to the technical team of the secondary level and financial support for the development of teacher training actions and
managers These components are developed along with three other organizations: Flacso Argentina, who leads the formation of
Formators for accompaniment to the network of driving equipment and teachers, Sadosky Foundation, who accompanies the design
of the curriculum of the technology, and the complementary training of teachers in teaching digital skills and
computing. Solidaria América, the organization that provides assistance and training to teachers for the development of actions of
Welfare and promotion of life transferable skills. As recipients of the proposed interventions you can
Identify three actors: at the management level: the technical team of the secondary level and supervisors, at the level of the
Schools: driving teams (managers, vice -directors and pedagogical advisors) and teachers in specific areas
(Mathematics, Language and Literature, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Technology). Finally, the students of the basic cycle
and the oriented cycle of schools are the last recipients of the changes implemented through the actions of the
managers and teachers in schools (see program change theory).

3. Purpose, objectives and scope of the evaluation
As established in the terms of reference for the planning evaluation (hereinafter, TDR) the central purpose of the
Evaluation is to measure the effects of the program on the appropriation of trunk learning and in the development of transferable skills
In school students, as well as in their school trajectories21.
The specific objectives of the evaluation are the following:
● Determine the perceived contribution level of the different components of the program for the achievement of the objectives of
Plan.
● Identify the impact of the program on school career indicators, learning (language and mathematics) and in the
Development of a transferable ability (learn to learn).
● Assess the UNICEF intervention model in terms of its relevance, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability and
coherence.
21 Evaluate the program considering the criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, coherence and impact under the approaches of
equity, human rights with emphasis on childhood and adolescence and gender equality during the 2018-2022 period.
14
● Collect the perceptions and value judgments on the program by partners, teachers and students.
● Identify the lessons learned and good practices, as well as conditions necessary to expand the scale or replicate
successfully the program in other provinces (underlying factors).
● Formulate actionable recommendations aimed at improving the design, impact and sustainability potential of the program
or its national impact.
In relation to the scope of the evaluation, it should be noted that it plans was implemented in its initial phase in 16 schools in 2018,
becoming implemented in 80 schools in 2022 in which the evaluation was carried out. The evaluation was focused on the 16 schools of the
First cohort of the program (2018) in Tucumán, because this first group of schools had greater exposure to
program that others, making it possible to assess the intervention and its results. In addition, these schools have ended with the
Implementation of plan during the first three years that make up the basic cycle of high school, and -An the difference of
The schools that were subsequently incorporated - were able to implement the model in person during 2018 and 2019.
It should be noted that, in the period evaluated (2018-2022), the two years of Covid-19 Pandemia are included, which implied a
Total interruption of school face -to -face in 2020 and a progressive face -to -face modality in the province of Tucumán
During 2021. In the 2nd semester of 2021 he advanced towards greater face -to -face and, between October and December, towards the
full face -to -face. The above was considered as part of the context in which the program has been implemented, and the
its ability to adapt to this complex scenario. The evaluation contemplated the different components or lines of action
of the program, however, the technology or digital literacy component for reasons was excluded from impact measurement
feasibility. As for transferable skills, only one of them (learning to learn) was included in the evaluation of
Final results (impact).
Finally, in relation to the geographical scope of the evaluation, it concentrated on the province of Tucumán, without considering the
Program versions that have been implemented in other provinces of Argentina22.
The evaluation will inform direct recipients: educational authorities of the Ministry of Education of the Province, in particular to
the Minister of Education, Secretaries of Education and Authorities and Technical Teams of the Directorate of the Secondary Level. In addition,
The results are expected to be presented to intermediate level officials - supervisors and territorial management and
driving equipment and teachers of schools that implement the program. Additionally, this evaluation is expected,
Report on the lessons learned in different technical and academic spaces to the national and provincial authorities that
They advance as Tucumán in high school transformation processes in Argentina.
4. Evaluation criteria and questions
The conceptual framework that guides the design of the program evaluation is structured around six of the evaluation criteria
proposed by the OECD-DAC23, namely: relevance, coherence, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability, and impact. Transversely and
In line with the UNICEF guidelines, human rights are also considered with emphasis on childhood and adolescence,
Equity approaches, and gender equality (UNICEF, 2021).
Next, these criteria are defined in coherence with what is established by UNICEF in the terms of reference of this evaluation,
including some additional details.
22 plans to be implemented since 2020 in the province of Chaco and since 2022 in Córdoba.

• relevance/relevance: the degree to which the objectives and design of plan respond to the needs, policies and
Priorities of the beneficiaries and the Ministry of Education of Tucumán. Also, the degree to which the results and
strategies attend to the educational priorities and needs of students of the secondary level, and keep in mind the
expectations, interests and respect for cultural, social differences and gender perspective, especially those of those
more excluded and marginalized.
• Consistency: Procedure to which the program transversely integrates the rights approach, gender equality and
equity between population groups; As well as the results and intervention strategies are consistent and
complementary to other interventions.
• Effectiveness/efficiency: the degree to which it plans has achieved its intermediate objectives and obtained its results.
• Efficiency: Procedure to which the products and/or results were achieved with the strategies developed through the model
Plan and with the available resources, optimizing and taking into account the integrality and articulation between the levels
linked (institutional, aulic).
• Impact: Measure that intervention has generated significant, positive or negative effects, intentionally or not.
• Sustainability: Procedure to which the program develops capacities and stable practices in the levels in the levels
of classroom, institution and provincial educational policy. Likewise, this criterion includes the scalability of the program,
understood as the extent to which its design allows or favors its expansion and therefore a greater impact.
Next, there is a synthesis of the evaluation matrix, which includes the evaluation questions addressed for each
criterion. The complete matrix approved by the UNICEF - Argentina counterpart, can be consulted in Annex 1.

This matrix was key to guiding the program evaluation process, the elaboration of data collection instruments
and the subsequent analysis of all the information. Also gave light on the different elements that should be integrated at the time
to make the triangulation of the information considered, in order for the evaluation team to systematize the findings for
each criteria evaluated, as well as generate suggestions and recommendations to feedback the implementation and design of
Plan.
It has been indicated at the beginning of this section that will be considered transversely the equity approaches, and gender equality.
It should be noted that plan does not contemplate specific or focused actions for interest groups such as migrants, girls or boys that
They could be disadvantaged by their gender, students with special educational needs or native peoples. For this
reason, this evaluation does not intend to identify the eventual impact of the program for these specific groups, but rather to do
A general description of the results according to some of these variables.
5. Methodology
5.1 General Design
For the evaluation of the program, a mixed design was chosen in which quantitative and qualitative approaches and techniques of
collection and analysis of information, with the purpose of enriching and deepening the interpretation of the results, of validating (or
triangular) the findings at the points where there are different sources of information, and also to incorporate the perspective of the
actors (Bamberger, 2012).
The evaluation was focused on the 16 Tucumán schools in which 201824 began, and in particular, in the cohort of
students who, to the date of the evaluation (2022)
and of students) that had had more exposure time to the program25.
For the impact assessment, he resorted to a quasi -experimental design (Gertler, Martinez, Premand, Rawlings, & Vermeersch, 2016)
for which he selected a comparable sample of 16 schools in the province of Tucumán (hereinafter Grupo Control) that to date
The evaluation has not participated in plan. Results indicators were considered (i) the students' scores
Planning schools and the control group in reading and mathematical tests (learning in trunk areas); (ii) the scores of the
students on a self -report scale for a transferable ability (learn to learn), as well as (iii) indicators of
Trajectory referred to overness, abandonment, repetition and assistance. Data analysis of the impact evaluation of the program on
These final results are eminently quantitative, and are detailed later.
For the intermediate results, the program change theory was used as a framework that guides their measurement26 and was collected
Information through questionnaires for different school actors (students, teachers and directors). These questionnaires
24 This set of schools in the province has been called "Group driving."
25 Those who joined the 2019 have had an extremely limited experience of this, due to
The interruption of the face -to -face classes caused by the Covid 19 pandemic in the 2020s and 2021.
26 See theory of change in Annex 2. The theory of change was elaborated participatively between UNICEF and the province in advance of the
development of this evaluation.

They investigated, for both groups of schools, in dimensions considered intermediate results of the program27 such as the
Teaching methodology used by teachers, learning evaluation practices, relationship climate, motivation
school, the sense of belonging of the students, and the expectations of teachers in relation to their students.
Specifically for the group of schools, these questionnaires also collected the perception that different actors have
of the program and its implementation. This in order to know your perspective regarding the criteria of relevance, efficiency,
Efficacy, coherence, and sustainability.
As part of the qualitative component of this evaluation, a review and systematization of documents and regulations were carried out
associated with the program28 and techniques such as interviews with managers, focal groups with teachers and students were implemented
In a subsample of 6 schools, he plans29 seeking to deepen and know better the experiences that are at the base of the
Implementation processes, thus allowing different voices to take part in the evaluation of program quality.
Additionally, 8 school teachers of the planning group of Plana were interviewed and classroom practices were observed in the cycle
Basic (first high school), in addition to analyzing the work developed by the students of these teachers.
Due to time restrictions, the use of qualitative and quantitative techniques of collection and information analysis were
concurrent, since both the field work for interviews, focal groups, questionnaires and tests was carried out in a way
Simultaneous, as well as the analysis of information and data. On the other hand, classroom observation and individual interviews with
teachers were carried out towards the end of the year, to maximize the familiarity of high -year high school students with the methodology of
work by projects and the chances of having completed the final works. In the following sections it is explained in
greater detail each component of the methodology.
Finally, a human and gender rights approach throughout the entire evaluation process was incorporated, in the definition of the
criteria and evaluation questions, in the methodology (elaboration of learning tests, in questionnaires to
students, in the selection and conformation of focus groups) and in the subsequent analysis of the data and results. Specifically
In the formation of student focal groups, an egalitarian participation of men and women was sought and the
Genus learning gap. As noted before keeping in mind that the program plans does not develop
Focalized or specific strategies in terms of gender approach or different minorities. In this sense the considerations
Regarding these approaches (human rights and gender) are transverse and non -specific objectives of the program in its implementation in the
Schools
5.2 Methodology for impact estimation
Since it was not possible to make comparisons of the pre-post type of the same variables in two times of time, for this
evaluation was carried out a single cross -sectional measurement of dependent and independent variables, that is, a
Quasi experimental methodology, selecting a control sample, of schools not intervened by plans.
A relevant limitation of this evaluation is that there was no individualized students of students in 2017 (year prior to the beginning
of the intervention). Having had individual data, it would have been possible to choose control schools whose composition of
students in 2017 was the most similar to that of the 16 schools plans for that same year, without limiting itself to the comparison of their
Average indicators. Given the above, a control sample selection methodology was used that contemplated two
Stages, each of which required a separate estimate. In the first, 16 control schools were selected (since yes
We can identify today the schools that were similar to 16 schools plans in 2017). In a second stage, after applying in
2022 The measuring instruments to all students of 4th and 5th in the schools chosen in stage 1 (which allowed to have

28 The documents and regulations that were reviewed are detailed in Annex 3.

Next, each of these stages is detailed:
1) Stage 1: Selection of schools for the control group (PSM1)
We worked with the 16 schools that were the first to implement the model plans, and 16 other schools were selected for the
Control Group The decision to consider the 16 schools of the first group that enters plan in 2018 is due to the following
Reasons:
• The 2018 cohort schools are the further exposure time to the program, so a greater effect is expected
of the same (minimum detectable effect).
• If work with different cohorts would be studying the effect of two or more different treatments, considering that
Each cohort has faced specific challenges and has had different exposure times to the program.
The 16 schools of the control group were selected based on the PrpenSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM) technique and using the best
available data. Thus, a propensity score (PS) score was estimated for each of the 16 schools plans and for all schools
Secondary state with complete secondary school of Tucumán that were not part of planned 2018 or in any of the years
later. The propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of a school to be treated (Khandker, Koowal, & Samal,
2009), given the characteristics of it. It is a value between 0 and 1, and for construction, characteristics or variables are used
From school. For this, it was necessary, in the first place, to define these variables, starting with a series of them as a hypothesis,
and then evaluate which model had better adjustment and what were the characteristics that were statistically significant.
The variables available in the annual survey databases (period 2011-2017) and the application of
Learn from 201730 to determine the variables that best defined the propensity score31. To determine the best form
Functional of the Propensity Score function, probit and logit models were analyzed, using the Akaike-Schwartz criteria to choose from
The one with better adjustment. From this iteration of variables, a model of propensity score is finally obtained (in this report, we
We refer to this exercise as "PSM1", to differentiate it from other estimates made in a second stage, in which also
The propensity score matching technique is used). This methodology is the one that best manages to model participation in plan,
using variables that theoretically have greater consistency (I.E. variables associated with abandonment, school performance, etc.) and
Better balance between treated and control group, with the information available.
From this exercise “PSM1”, 16 control schools were obtained as a result, with similar values in the variables chosen to make

the schools of the promoter group). It is important to note that, although this model was the one that achieved the best adjustment against other
Alternatives, the sample size (32 establishments), prevents testing with certainty the quality of pairing in this first
stage, it is unlikely to find statistically significant differences. This imbalance between the groups was evidenced in:
• The distribution of the propensity score in the treated schools is different from that of the control schools: although we find a
Common support area (that is, in the treatment and control groups there are schools with equal or similar values
Of ps (Khandker, Koowal, & Samal, 2009), the shape of this PS is very dissimilar and with a discontinuous distribution.
• The previous point is accentuated when analyzing Rubin's B and R indicators, which show a post -abalance
pairing. These indicators provide an objective measure about how different the distributions are (see more
Detail in Annex 4). However, despite the bad evaluation of this indicator, it was the best possible adjustment with the size of
Sample available.
• Although no statistically significant differences are found for the variables used in the “PSM1” model for
treated schools and control, it should be noted that, as stated above, with a sample of 32 schools, it is likely
Do not find statistical differences, due to the low statistical power of the comparison.
In Annex 4, the procedures carried out for the determination of the group of control schools, as well as the
result of these, that is, the control group found, the replacements made, and finally, the treated schools and controls
Finals on which planned planning for the application of the instruments were focused.
In conclusion, the selection of schools in this first stage was made with a final sample of 32 schools and with a technique of
PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING ("PSM1"). Although a quality pairing was not achieved (evidenced, for example, in the indicators
B and R of Rubin), this exercise continues to result in the best possible alternative with the information that was available. For this reason,
It was expected to achieve a more adequate balance of the samples after the application in the field, using individual data
of the students that would be collected on that occasion.
2) Stage 2: Quasi Experimental Impact Estimation
In the first stage, the PSM1 exercise was designed to choose similar schools (and not students) based on information of the year
2017. However, although selected schools have been similar between both groups, this does not guarantee that students
of these schools are similar to each other. When comparing students' data (collected in 2022) within schools,
They observe important imbalances among the students of students of the treatment and control schools. This fact could only
Corroborate after having the data of those who finally participated in the land in 2022.
For this reason, this second stage was aimed
Balance standards to be able to perform causal inferences when comparing the results of the treatment and control groups
thus estimate the impact of the program. For this, it was decided to use different forms of impact estimation, to verify the
consistency of the results, namely, (a) a second exercise of propensity score matching (which we will call “psm2”) and (b)
Multiple regressions with random effects.
(a) PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM2)
By having individual microdates of students from both groups from the field of 2022, it is possible to make a second
Propensity Score Matching exercise, with the aim of choosing two students of students from the treatment schools and
control that are as similar as possible; or, select all students from both groups of schools, and assign them
greater weight to the most similar to each other, to compare their results.
The selection of the subset of students to compare was made with a “PSM2” model, which selects relevant variables from
a theoretical point of view (variables that literature indicates that they relate to the results in school trajectories and achievements of
learning). These variables were agreed with the UNICEF counterpart of the evaluation, and the detail is presented in Annex 5
(PSM2). The final configuration of the treatment and control groups also depends on the group of matches of the groups
which is used (once propensity scores have been defined for each student). To give robustness to exercise, three methods were used
of different matches: nearest neighbor; Kernel and IPW. Closest neighbor leaves
those students with values of PS far away from the rest (that is, those who could not find one or more
20
"Couples"). Kernel and IPW use all the people in the sample, but they assign less weight in comparison to people with PS
very different from the rest.
PSM methods allow precise control of observable variables. However, it is necessary to consider two
Requirements of these methods, which could be considered limitations. One of them is that only previous control variables should be used
to the implementation of plan (2017 variables). A second is that, since it plans is a program that is implemented at the level
School, the same model should be used, although we want to evaluate different dependent variables.
(b) Multiple regressions with random effects.
The objective of incorporating this method is to be able to make regressions that include variables after 2017, individual variables
(which we only have available from 2022 that is when we finally know the students participate in the
data lifting) and also define different models for different dependent variables. The random effect is added to
control by the intraclase correlation that exists when the treatments occur at the establishment level (each of these
regressions are detailed in Annex 6). With this method, all students in the sample are used, but they can be lost
Observations If controlled by variables that are not available for all students.
Of the methods raised, only those of PSM-Kernel and PSM-IPW use weights, because, as previously indicated, it is assigned
To the observations a relative weight within the sample, depending on how similar the observations of the control group are
to those of the treatment group. In the nearest neighbor methods and in multiple regressions, all observations weigh what
same.
In general, neither of the two methods used managed to completely balance the samples: the quality indicators of the
Method "PSM 2" were not enough, because the averages between both groups - treatment and control were not achieved - they were
The same in key variables, nor did it be possible for the propensity score to have a similar distribution. On the other hand, multiple regressions
They do not allow to establish with certainty that the initial imbalances were eliminated. Thus, no method is satisfactory by itself,
which implies that the results of this evaluation do not allow causality powers.
The detail about the balance of the students of the group of treatment and control schools is presented in Annex 7.
Dependent variables that were used for impact evaluation
According to the outcome expressed in the program change theory32, it is desired to evaluate the fulfillment of trajectories and the
LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT. Thus, dependent variables were operationalized as follows:
• Trajectory
Since we lift information from schools in 2022, we only observe those who did not abandon school. Therefore, in
Terms of trajectory, students who were in 2022 in 4th and 5th high school in a school can belong to 3 groups:
A. They were in the same school when the program began, without having repeated any course, and were in 1st high school in 2018
In the case of students who in 2022 are in 5th, and in 1st high school in 2019 if they are students in 4th in 2022.
B. They were in the same school when the program began, but repeated levels in the period, and were at levels higher than
those established in the previous section. That is, the students who are in 5th today were at levels above 1 in 2018. The
Students who are in 4th today, were at levels greater than 1 in 2019.
C. were not in the same school when the program began (2018).
Under the assumptions of the program change theory, an expected impact of it would be that in the group of schools the
Group A proportion A was greater than the proportion of group B, compared to the schools of the control group.
32 “All adolescents access a secondary school of the 21st century adapted to their needs and environment, which enables school trajectories that guarantee
that all end up the level, formed to learn continuously, to be able to exercise full citizenship, insert themselves into the labor market, define their own
life project and contribute to building a more just society. ”

Qualitative study participants
Interviews and focal groups
The qualitative component of the evaluation sought to investigate more depth in an intentional subsample of six schools
Plan36. In these six schools, focal groups of students of 4th and 5th year of high school were held, of teachers of the
Troncal subjects that are the object of greater intervention by the plan and also conducted interviews with the directors (AS).
In order to obtain information about other background about the plan of plan implementation in the province of
Tucumán, agreed to interview jurisdictional profiles of the province and key actors of UNICEF-Argentina.
In the case of students' focal groups, it was caught that they considered a joint representation of men and women,

Classroom observation and interviews with observed teachers
In a second moment, the qualitative study contemplated the observation of classroom pedagogical practices, the collection of
Artifacts (Learning Evaluation Productions developed by students) and interviews with teachers
observed. The sample of teachers and classrooms participating in this study was intentional, where the cases corresponded to
First year classrooms, whose teachers of the language and mathematics subjects would have implemented the program
Since its inception. Since he plans a special emphasis on the basic high school cycle, the observations focused on classrooms
of said cycle. It was agreed to focus specifically on high school teachers, to maximize their familiarity with
projects, requesting that they had three or four years of experience with the program. 8 teachers distributed in 5 participated in 5
schools (4 math and 4 tongue teachers). To facilitate the logistics of the observations, the study concentrated in schools
urban, combining schools with population of different levels of vulnerability. Of the 5 schools observed, two were part

6. Evaluation limitations
Throughout the evaluation process, a series of limitations were presented that must be taken into account at the time of interpreting
the main findings of this. It is possible to distinguish limitations associated with the design of the evaluation of those associated with the
implementation in the field.
6.1. Limitations associated with evaluation design
• Have only cross -cutting data and not measures of the same subjects at two moments (pre and post treatment)
It prevents control of possible non -observable characteristics that can influence the results. This is one
Limitation to the interpretation of the study results. The absence of longitudinal data also involved excluding
students who have abandoned school. This difficulty was partially faced by incorporating questions in the
questionnaires and evidence that would characterize the trajectory of the participants who abandoned and reintegrated themselves
During the last 4 years.
• Regarding the selection of the control sample: not having individualized data at the student level in 2017 prevented
be able to choose an optimal control group that considers the distribution of students within schools in 2022, and
It required choosing the control group in 2 stages. In particular, the first stage (school selection) had the limitation that
The sample size is very small to reliably corroborate the quality of the schools
of chosen control. This is evidenced in a group with a dissimilar propensity score distribution between the schools of
treatment and control. For the second stage (student selection), there was no information equivalent to
Student level in 2017, so data was used again at the establishment level. This limits
considerably the quality of the match, which is reflected in weak quality indicators. To mitigate this, it is incorporated
Another form of estimate, based on linear regression methods of random effects.
• Regarding the interpretation of the results of the impact estimates: since it was not possible
Treatment and control sample at the level of students that will achieve adequate quality indicators in the match (that is,
It was not finally possible to work with samples at the level of students in relevant variables such as
absence, socioeconomic level, or school motivation, among others42), it is not possible to infer causal effects from
Findings presented with the methodologies used.
• On the tests to evaluate trunk learning: despite the review of a sample of the items by the
counterpart of the province (more familiar with the level of learning achievements of local students), the restriction
of time made it impossible to apply a previous piloting of the tests, preventing the necessary accommodations from improving the
Adjusting its level of difficulty to the evaluated population. The reading and particular test that were mathematics were
empirically of greater difficulty than expected for students43. In the case of mathematics, the above influenced
that the reliability of the scores was less than expected44, which can affect the sensitivity to identify
Differences of low magnitude in estimates, since the reduced variance of scores translates into greater difficulty
so that the differences are groups significant.
6.2 Limitations associated with the implementation of the evaluation
• Teachers surveyed in schools planned to use program methodologies in other schools (no
Plans) in which they work, which questions the categorical distinction between “treated schools” and “not treated” schools by
42 See detail about the balance of treatment and control groups in Annex 7.
43 To reduce the difficulty of the evidence, its construction considered the curriculum of the province of courses prior to 4th and 5th of high school, however, this was not
enough to mitigate the possible effects of the interruption of classes due to pandemic (in 2020 and 2021). Even so, its difficulty was greater than expected for
Students from participating Tucumán schools.
44 Even when the reliability of the mathematical test was lower than expected, this instrument is still useful and feasible to be used for the purpose of this
Evaluation, since the students' scores are compared at the grouped level, and are not made inferences from individual results.
28
The program, which was not expected and could help understand the few differences found between both groups
In several of the intermediate results. In this way, there is a relevant assumption of study design (which is
compare treated schools with others that have not received the treatment).
• The general school promotion policies introduced during and after pandemic, may have had an effect
on school career indicators, which are indistinguishable
Continuous and reduce the repetition of the general measures adopted from 2020.
• The interruption of face -to -face classes for almost two years by the pandemic introduced a very relevant variation in the
"Treatment" of the program. Although both schools of the control group and the plan were subjected to the same
condition and the program sought ways to mitigate the absence of face -to -face classes, its pedagogical model rests very
decisively in the interaction between students, which seriously limits an appreciation of the effectiveness of said
Model to promote learning.
• On the application of the questionnaires in teachers: since the questionnaire applied to teachers was carried out in a way
Online, a disparate participation of these according to school was observed. In other words, there were some schools that had
a significantly lower participation than others, which is why its representation is also disparate in the total
Answers obtained. For this reason, when reporting these results, comparisons between schools are not made.
7. Ethical considerations
The evaluation was aligned with the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards for evaluations, as well as
also with the United Nations Evaluation Ethical Guidelines45. In addition, it had an external and independent character, taking
carried out in an impartial, open and participatory way, based on valid and reliable evidence. In this
sense, it should be noted that no member of the evaluation team has conflict of interest with the contracting body
(UNICEF), the implementing entity, in this case the Ministry of Education of the Province of Tucumán, or with schools
participants in the evaluation.
Considering that data collection was made with students, the orientations taken in the UNICEF guide were considered
As for ethical research with boys and girls. In addition, the design of the evaluation, the instruments and all the protocols of
Informed consent and assent for students were submitted to the review of an external ethics committee. In the annex
12 The different strategies to meet these ethical requirements are detailed. The all -approval letter is also included
The protocols of the study by the Ethics Committee to which UNICEF Argentina requested its review.
Additionally, it should be noted that at all times all actors called to the evaluation were emphasized, of the character
volunteer of his participation, also pointing out aspects related to the confidentiality of the information delivered and the
protection procedures for your privacy. It was also explicit the commitment that non -participation would not imply any
consequence. Finally, the entire Mide UC land team is trained in protocols in the face of the emergence of ethical conflicts,
such as, for example, the eventual emergence of information related to abuse in focus groups.
8. Findings
This chapter presents information and analysis in relation to each of the program evaluation criteria, namely:
Its impact, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability. In each case, the data generated through the
Documentary analysis, interviews and focal groups, questionnaires and classroom observation. In the case of impact analysis,

In addition to context information obtained in the questionnaires. Inside each criterion, the results are realized to
from the questions that guided the evaluation of the program.
8.1 relevance
The relevance criteria is understood as the adaptation of the objectives pursued by its design to the needs of the users of
This and to the context in which it is done. The planning evaluation referred to this criterion is made looking for response to 2 main
Evaluative questions: the degree to which the program responds to the needs and priorities of the secondary level of Tucumán, in addition
of the ability to adapt to the program to the context and reality and characteristics of the schools of the province.
Question 1: To what degree do the objectives and the plan plan respond to the needs,
priorities and educational policies of the secondary level of Tucumán?
According to all the information analyzed, it is possible to point out that the design of the program is due to a finished diagnosis of the
challenges and needs of high school in Argentina, which in turn is concordant with those presented by the province of
Tucumán According to the different documents analyzed and data raised, the main problems, priorities and needs
from the province of Tucumán at the time of starting program implementation, they are related to: the (1) Termity of
studies; (2) abandonment in secondary education; (3) Low learning results; and (4) lack of interest in school by
young46.
The plan plans does not arise in the province of Tucumán, but responds to a broader look about the need for
transform secondary education in the country and born, according to the story of one of the key informants of UNICEF47, of the
Confluence of the systematic work of more than a decade that UNICEF Argentina has done in support of the improvement of schools
Secondary, of dialogues with key educational actors and review of international experiences on innovation in schools
Secondary For this reason, the document “Plan: design and fundamentals of a new school for adolescents” 48 has a
General character, without specifying mostly implementation aspects or referring to particular territories. In said document
and in the others that followed it, it is established that the program plans has three main objectives: (1) guarantee a greater
Inclusion: generate learning for all, without sociocultural differences; (2) Promote the termination of studies: that all
Students finish high school and are formed to learn continuously, and thus exercise full citizenship,
Insert in the labor market, define your own life project and contribute to build a more just society; and (3) promote
Significant learning: that students develop capacities according to the contemporary world, such as
Creativity, problem solving, hypothesis formulation and their inquiry, collaborative work, among others. As I know
You can verify, these are objectives that are relevant to the diagnosis of high school.

In relation to the diagnosis that was made of the schools again, it can be noted that, from the logic of “new model
of high school ”and its main objectives seeks to address, precisely, the problem of educational and low trajectories
Learning results in young people in an integral way. This from:
- Project -based learning (active pedagogies that put the student the center) and collaborative work for
Promote interest and motivation for studies in young people.
- Integral health advice to address the life situations of students who could threaten their
educational trajectories (eg teenage pregnancy)
- Figures such as the student advisor who care about the learning trajectories of the students.
- The greatest accompaniment to schools and teachers through the teaching network and driving network.
In the documents, also, it is presented, describes and details the entire legal body in which the program is anchored and that goes in the line
to promote the completion of secondary education by young people through new educational formats and
Accompaniment to school trajectories51. In the same way, he realizes the resolution that creates the model plans in the
Province of Tucumán (Resolution 0081/2018).
The interviews with key actors from the Ministry of Education of Tucumán and Directors (AS) confirm the above, as well as the groups
Focals with teachers and students. The program is valued quite transversely by its contribution to the problems of the
Student and high school in the province of Tucumán. The problems of dropout and motivation are recognized, and it is counted
with data on this type of situations by the provincial authorities. Thus, having several programs in the province,
recognizes how the only program that works at the classroom level and with teaching practices, and that comes to respond to a need
of public policy that had been brewing in Argentina since the expansion of high school coverage.
From the perspective of the actors, there are two aspects that contribute to this relevance assessment. On the one hand, plan
proposed to give an impulse or "strengthen" a pre -existing policy (new format schools) who lacked resources and
Strengthen processes. On the other hand, the UNICEF form of work that close data and generated instances of dialogue and
Collaboration in the installation of plan, so that diagnoses and shared values appear. Along with this the networks of managers
and teachers, contributed to creating a climate of dialogue and construction.

The relevance was probably increased from the way in which schools were selected to enter the program. In
This case refers to the following selection criteria: (1) being a new format school, and (2) having leading directors and
Committed. In general, the teachers surveyed perceive as a relevant program for them (as)
Teachers and adequate at their level of demand to work with their students. In addition, according to responses to
Questionnaires applied for this evaluation, plan projects are valued as a pedagogical material that presents
motivating and interesting themes for teachers and students52. The aspects that conceive somewhat more critical evaluations refer
to the extension of the projects and their adaptation to the budgeted times (50% consider almost impossible to complete the projects
In the number of suggested weeks), the coverage of the contents of the provincial curriculum that they allow and their relevance to
Work with students who present important gaps in their previous learning.
The teachers about the relevance of the program were also consulted to respond to the problems and needs that
It seeks to solve through its various strategies and the fulfillment of its objectives53. In general, most consider that the
program is appropriate to respond to the needs you seek to meet, as is, avoid school abandonment, and improve the
Learning students of the secondary level. The most positive responses are obtained when referring to planning capacity
to develop transferable skills with more than 77% of the teachers surveyed who consider the program to achieve

Teachers (36%) points

Additionally, and as for teachers, the directors of the program and their response to the
problems that addresses in its design. Similar to what happened with what was declared by teachers, the vast majority of managers (AS)
they value as an adequate program to respond to the needs of the students related to the
school abandonment, and the improvement of learning at the secondary level. The answers are widely favorable in all
Aspects consulted, such as the capacity for planning for the achievement of learning in the trunk subjects (14 directors) and in
transferable skills (13 of 14 directors), as well as to motivate students to attend school and prevent the
School abandonment (13 of 14 directors) 55.
Question 2: To what extent was the program adapted plans to the needs of the province of
Tucumán and the contexts of schools?
This section reports the findings referring to the degree of flexibility shown by the program to introduce adaptations
that allow him to be more pertinent to the context.
Flexibility/stiffness of the program
As noted in the previous evaluation question, the plan of plan was not designed thinking about a province in
particular, so that their "descent" to Tucumán implied a necessary adaptation of each of the elements involved in the
program to the reality of the province.
If the original document is compared “Plan: design and fundamentals for a new school for adolescents” with the document
"Theory for change", can be seen in the second a greater contextualization to the reality of the province and a greater development of
The program components. This is because the second document was developed during the first year of implementation
52 The detailed results of the Teacher Questionnaire can be consulted in Annex 14.
53 These questionnaire questions could also be classified as ‘perceived impact’. They are included in this chapter because they are also an appreciation of the degree
In that the program as it has been designed, responds to the needs of retaining students, promoting their learning and life skills.

In Tucumán and, in the same way, it was built collaboratively together with officials, technical teams and teachers
of the Ministry of Education of Tucumán.
From the view of the Key actors of UNICEF interviewed, the spirit of plan is to be a flexible and adaptable program to
context typical of the provinces, so the idea is, precisely, that the different actors appropriate it and are accommodating it
according to your reality. This same spirit is perceived by the provincial actors:
“[…] I have always felt a lot
There was a sustained and continuous dialogue from the political and from the contextual [...] I have always felt that possibility of adapting and adapting
to the pedagogical political times and to the conditions of the province. ”56
In relation to the above, both at the level of UNICEF Argentina and the province, a series of adaptations is recognized
They made with respect to the initial design. Some of them were: (1) curricular organization and project rhythm; (2) Incorporation
of rural schools; (3) Modifications in the first -year booklets; (4) Incorporation of adaptations to activities from
infrastructure/connectivity conditions; (5) Adaptations to the Interdocente Evaluation Council. Regarding adaptations
indicated above, it is relevant to highlight the change that was made in the first -year booklets, since this arises to
from an inquiry made with the teachers who implemented them; In that line, it was an improvement made from
of the information survey process with the actors themselves. This appears embodied both in the execution report of said
year as in some interviews conducted.
On the other hand, both directors and teachers perceive plan as a flexible program, although they recognize that in a
I started it more rigid.
“[…] The booklet, especially I wanted to fulfill it to Raja Table! And in the week he said and ran and ran against the clock to meet in the week
that he said and did not arrive for the activities because there was a holiday. And he said ‘What am I going to do!’… And then virtual sent the boys
To try to advance to comply with the established and then, when time run, the trainers began to tell us that it was a
Guide and it was flexible, there I calmed down a little more, and I went more with the things that came out. ”57
On the other hand, by the province, permanent dialogue and accompaniment instances by UNICEF are recognized, such as a
Strategy that allows the participation and creation of solutions. For the province the work has been raised as a “going” and
Accompanying both UNICEF to them, as well as to schools. The work is also processed as a “case by case”.
“[…] I think that one of the strengths has been that the development and success of a project depend on accompaniment, depend on the permanence and
Always be thinking that we have not finished and we continue with the implementation. And within the implementation there is not a single line, but
That there are different paths that each school has and the important thing is that they see it and feel comfortable. You have never worked since the imposition, always
It has been the dialogue […] and I believe that this has been a good strategy to boost the change in implementation ”58
Adaptations within the framework of Covid-19 pandemic
Within the framework of the Covid-19 Pandemia, the original planning was altered due to the suspension of the face-to-face classes
In Argentina. In the case of the year 2020, the first year of pandemia, UNICEF-PLANEA supported schools in the reorganization of work,
at the same time that he lifted information about the integral situation of the establishments.
In the case of the second year of Pandemia, in 2021 from UNICEF a document called “Rainway map plan:
Orientations for 2021 ”, which, as its name points out, had“ as its purpose to contribute orientations for the return to school,
that are subject to analysis and discussion in each of the schools plans for planning 202159. ”This document was directed
To driving teams delivering a series of orientations to work the following aspects: (1) the conditions
institutional; (2) The knowledge and capabilities taught; (3) The learning achieved by each student; (3) The proposal of plan

for 2021 and (4) well -being conditions. In this section the focus will be placed on the proposal for 2021 and was in
Consonance with general provincial policies for all schools in pandemic context. An adaptation that was made
In 2020 and also in 2021 it consisted of the elaboration and impression for each booklet student for the projects with the
prioritized activities.60 In the execution report of 2021, it is indicated that the impression of these booklets was a key element
to maintain the continuity of the students, since they wanted them to continue working at home during the days and schedules in
They were not face -to -face. The printing of booklets was something that was positively valued by all actors
Interviewed in the qualitative survey: from the jurisdictional profiles to the students themselves.
Another adaptation that was made within the frame
Driving network and the teaching network. Regarding the driving network, as indicated by the execution report of the
2021, monthly online days were held through the Zoom platform. In the case of the teaching network, the meetings are
They performed in the same way. Regarding this change in the meeting mode, as indicated by the report of
Execution 2021, although the teaching network was well valued by the teacher, there were some participation and assistance problems.
In addition to the documentary information and what was contributed by UNICEF's key actors, this was also addressed in interviews with
directors and jurisdictional profiles of the province. In a broader perspective, it is reported to have "taken advantage"
delivered by plans before the pandemic, as a relevant resource in that period, recognizing the contribution in connectivity and
devices, key issue at that time. The importance of the formed network of managers and teachers is also relieved, which
served as the basis for school support and the search for necessarily novel and contingent solutions, so it appears
as a resource before the adversity that strengthens the province. In that sense, these instances contributed in resilience. In any case,
Managers recognize a reduction in booklets (curriculum prioritization), and lower communication that implied a
Pause in implementation, product of this difficult time.
This theme was consulted in the questionnaires applied to teachers and directors of the schools plans participating in the
evaluation61. In general, most participating teachers (90.34% of a 176 answers) pointed out that projects

Difficulties related to relevance
An important difficulty that was identified and that is closely related to relevance has to do with the “conditions

series of conditions, such as: time availability of teachers (institutional hours), connectivity in schools and a
Detailed diagnosis of the previous knowledge and competences of students. In the case of the province of Tucumán,
These conditions were not assured of a beginning and although very important advances were made during the years of
implementation, the truth is that the lack of these previous conditions affected the development and relevance of relevant dimensions
of the program, such as the pedagogical nucleus. In this way, there is a problem of relevance in regard to
program design and minimal conditions for its operation, which would be more profitable if before starting
With the work with the projects, an initial phase of installation and diagnosis of these base conditions will be contemplated, or
They define different pedagogical actions, which at least ensure the achievement of basic learning levels.
Learning delay
A difficulty reported by the teachers is related to the level of previous knowledge that their
students. There are some teachers who reported having serious difficulties with students who just enter the secondary level,
which lack the necessary knowledge and competences to start working on plan projects. An example of
That is literacy:
“Teacher 7-Mujer: We have many writing problems, I work on a level, […] first, second and third, and until the third year I have
serious reading problems […] We work in parallel with plan, also with projects that are, eh, literacy,
literacy, who works the teacher and works another language teacher, but they are serious problems to take them to read, lead them to deduce to them,
Deducing patterns alone is complicated. With guidance yes, they are tried to guide, of course. Sometimes it is sometimes not. Most of the time not.
Teacher 8-Mujer: They lack the base tool.
5-MANY TEACHER: THE INTERPRETATION. A text needs a lot of interpretation ”62
“[…] I do not agree with the way we are, with the contents that are proposed, that many are not taken into account
times with the learning that the boys come, especially from the primary [...] (the students) come with many shortcomings, [...] say that in
writing we see that in primary children arrive who still do not know how to read or write, and suddenly we present a booklet where
You need a lot of text interpretation and you know, that is super complicated today ”63
In line with this assessment, in the opinion of the students, the texts of the booklets that plan are complex and
long and must stop quite a lot, including support from their teachers and group reading or full course.
“Student-Man 1: These two years, we have the same teacher, who is a bit more different and the topics seem not so interesting
and very difficult texts.
Student-Man 2: Most fails to capture the message of the texts, that is
Student-Man 1: Of course, they had given us a topic that, that is, although the topic could be made interesting, as the project did not succeed,
like that they set them up and the texts like they bored
Student-woman 3: Of course, the texts, which we read thousands of times, but the question he asked you was very different, perhaps had something that
See with the text, but it was like
Student-Man 2: It was too far away ”64
While teachers who report these difficult situations try to manage them, without subtracting from their commitment to learning
Based on projects, they identify this as a greater difficulty before which the program has not established routes or adaptations that
are effective.
Faced with this scenario, a situation that is especially complex is that, in order to work the projects with students
With this type of difficulties, teachers tend to make adjustments in projects that seek to address content of
previous levels, or severely reduce their complexity. This situation was reported both in focal groups with
teachers as in the observations made in the classroom and subsequent interview with the observed teachers:

Boys do not know that in primary, and we realize that the fault is neither in plan, nor in the secondary

Both situations reflect a distance with the learning goals that are sought in the projects and a tension regarding
This aspect of relevance: how to work with learning gaps without this means
learning or lowering expectations for these students, nor ignore that a group of them is not reaching at least
basic learning levels.
Articulation with higher studies
Some teachers and students expressed concern about a possible decoupling between the plan plan and the
continuity towards higher studies. From the look of the teachers, this disagreement is observed in the following aspects:
- Lack of “key” content to follow higher studies: some teachers point out that in the projects there is absence of
Certain content that they consider important that a student knows in case he wants to study higher studies.
- Differences in the form of evaluation: although in general there is an assessment of the plan of planning, there are
teachers who point out that this is very different from standardized tests and exams that are usually used, either
to enter higher education, as in the same higher education.
- Loss of study habit: there are teachers who point out that, with plan, students lose study habits
"Traditional" how to generate a study routine, take notes, among others: "They do not prepare them for that, for that time, or
Be the student he wants, he will fail in a first attempt because he did not get used to studying, reading a book, they say no, I don't read this, but

We work as it has been planned, that is what I have the same concern as her, I am in the third year, but this arrives

Some of these concerns are also shared by the students, who indicated that they perceive that
They find “backward” in the necessary knowledge to continue their studies:
“Student-Man 1: Most of the year we are not working, it plans because, in mathematics, the teacher wants to guide us for the
university
Student-Man 2: Sure, that is, the topics that were giving us on plans in mathematics, that is, it was different from what they teach

process and registration of them) and a level of transformation of pedagogical practices that we have considered as a result
Intermediate (for example, feedback of teachers to improve learning, focus on classroom interactions in the
development of complex cognitive skills). As a source of information for this last level you have not only the report of
students and teachers through the applied questionnaires, but also the in -depth qualitative study referred to in the chapter
of methodology and is detailed in Annex 967.
As a summary, a table is included below that, based on the information obtained through the different

(institutional, school and classroom) together with the perception that teachers and managers have regarding their contribution to the achievement of the
objectives of this, as well as the hinders and facilitators of the implementation perceived by the actors consulted.
It should be noted that the level of implementation attributed here considers what was expected according to the original design and also the
that the interviewee consulted indicated as an implementation expectation.

Question 1: To what extent have all components of the

learning?
This evaluation question was approached from different sources of information. On the one hand, documentary sources: the
documents referring to the design of the program plans and the execution reports of the years 2018 to 2021. On the other hand, this
information was complemented by the interviews with key actors of UNICEF and the province, who contributed more information
about how the implementation was in the context of the province. Information about this question was also collected through
questionnaires applied to all actors in schools (directors, teachers and students), as well as through
interviews and focal groups made in schools plans during 2022. The execution report made by UNICEF for
2022 is not incorporated in this report because due to its temporality this failed to be part of the documentary analysis. The data that this

Components at school level
At school level, the program components are: (1) driving network; (2) between teachers; (3) I project; and (4)
Comprehensive Advice in Adolescent Health71. Of the 4 components, the driving network stands out as it is the one that presents a greater
level of implementation, recognizing themselves by the different actors as a formalized space and that has allowed them to generate networks
of collaboration between management teams and share experiences.
Regarding the "I project" component, it is an instance that directors and actors of the province recognize as such.
However, according to the various sources of information, neither students nor teachers highlight and recognize it clearly, despite
that it should be an activity that involves the entire school community.
For their part, "in teachers" and "Integral Advice in Adolescent Health" present the lower level of implementation.
Regarding the first, he had problems in the allocation of resources during 2019 and, in accordance with what was reported by
Actors, this component did not develop mostly in the following years. On the other hand, in relation to the “integral advice

This component corresponds to one of the nuclear aspects of the program plans therefore, according to the design documents
of the program, through it we seek to embody the “active pedagogies” and put the student in the center of the teaching process-
learning. This implies a change in aulic practice, where students are expected to have an active role, investigate,
put information and knowledge to solve real life problems through collaborative work with
companions, and all in a climate of harmony and enjoy the task75.
Based on the above, he plans a curricular design organized by subjects, where he works from the methodology of
Project -based learning (ABP). Specifically, for the first stage of implementation, the proposal contemplated the
realization of projects for the areas of natural sciences (which articulated the subjects of biology, physics and chemistry) and sciences
Social (which considers the subjects of history and geography) and the individual subjects of language and literature, mathematics and
Computer Science (which corresponds to the conversion of the technology subject).
Implementation level: Has project -based learning been implemented?
Regarding the implementation of this work methodology in the first year of the program (2018), three projects were planned by
Each of the areas and subjects contemplated, as well as three booklets for the learning workshop. In 2019, by
Its part, in addition to the first year projects, projects for second year of high school were designed.
According to the execution reports of 2018 and 2019, in most cases projects 1 and 2 had been completed, and
I was working in the third. Indeed, at the time of preparing the 2018 Execution Report (December, the end of the year
school) in all subjects, projects 1 and 2 had been completed, while project 3 presented various levels of
advance, being greater in language and literature, social sciences and natural sciences (81% progress) than in mathematics (with 63%
forward). Regarding the computer workshop and the learning workshop, both presented a 75% advance of the
Project 3. In 2019, for its part, 21 of the 24 schools incorporated into the program were working on the 3 projects,
while three schools could not implement project 3 due to the lack of teachers.
On the occasion of the pandemic in the year 2020, booklets were printed with prioritized activities for the students76. In
Total, 59,115 first and third year booklets were delivered. Regarding the level of progress that year, in a survey
carried out by UNICEF and the province in September-October 2020, 57% of teachers said they completed the
Project 1, 31% said they completed Project 2 and 27% yet not completing project 377.
74 To review the level of implementation of the other components, see Annex 18.
75 Steinberg, C. et.al (2017). Plan: design and foundations of a new school for adolescents. Buenos Aires: UNICEF.
76 According to Report 2021 and as indicated by the provincial and UNICEF actors.
77 In the presentation of data, the percentage of teachers who completed project 3 to that date is not reported. A possible hypothesis to this is that, to date and with
Reason for the current school period, there were still no cases of teachers who have finished the third and last project.
41
Although in the execution report of the year 2021, the percentage of progress in the projects is not reported, it is indicated that, as in
2020, the books for the students were printed
In 2022, the evaluation that is reported here consulted directors, teachers and students regarding the level of implementation
of work for projects through the questionnaires applied in the months of September-October of that year. In this case I don't know
investigated the progress in planned projects, but for the frequency with which the learning methodology based on
projects in classes. Eleven of the 14 directors consulted said that their teachers implement ABP in most of their classes,
2 reported that they are implemented in less than half of the classes, while one indicated that ABP is implemented very
occasionally and only in some of the subjects. In the case of respondent teachers (n = 176), 59.1% said
ABP in most of its classes, 22.7% work in less than half of its classes, 16.5% indicated that they work very
Occasionally, while 1.7% noted not working with said methodology78.
Finally, the fourth and fifth students (which is the group that participated in this impact study) were consulted, of
Differentiated way, due to the implementation of projects in language and mathematics. Specifically, the 4th year students
He consulted if they worked with the project "How to be chroniclers of our reality?" Language and "How to make better decisions?"
In mathematics on the other hand, the 5th year students were consulted whether they worked with the projects "together or separated?"
in language and "How do things work?" In mathematics. To increase the chances of having worked such
projects, these are the first of each year. The following graph accounts for the results.
Figure 1. Student Answer to Question "Have you done the following activities in your class?"
4th year mathematics (n = 558) 36% 35% 28%
4th year language (n = 553) 58% 21% 21%
5th year mathematics (n = 486) 21% 53% 26%
5th year Language (n = 487) 45% 28% 26%
0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%
Yes, we work it. No, in my class we did other activities. I don't know.
In general, when comparing between levels, it is observed that, in accordance with what was reported by the students, in the fourth year a
greater implementation of the projects than in fifth. On the other hand, if compared between subjects, it can be seen that the subject
of language has a higher percentage of implementation of its projects regarding mathematics, according to the report of the
students. Regarding the latter, the low level of implementation of the 5th year project “how
Things work? ”, Where only 21% of the students reported having worked, while 53% said that
They carried out other activities.
In the classroom observation made towards the end of the year in first high school, it was verified that, in all 8 classrooms observed, the
teachers were working on the projects, which was expected for this observation79.
Implementation quality: How is the pedagogical planning approach implemented?
78 These percentages include both teachers of the oriented cycle and the basic cycle. When checking the data disaggregated per cycle, it is observed that they are cycle teachers
Oriented those who use this methodology less (56.7%). In the case of basic cycle teachers and those who make both basic and oriented cycle, a
Third of the respondents reports using this methodology in less than half of the classes or occasionally or, not to use it. To see answers
detailed, check annex 14.
79 In the qualitative study on teaching practices, classrooms of 1st year of secondary education of schools with plan were observed.
42
As referred to in the methodology section, at the end of the 2022 school year, an in -depth study was carried out in which
He observed classroom practices and 8 first year teachers were interviewed to maximize their experience by implementing projects,
considering that with the first year projects 2018 began (the detail of this study in depth is presented in the
Annex 9).
From the classroom observation process and subsequent interview with the teachers observed, the evaluation team could
verify that there are different levels of understanding, appropriation and performance of teachers regarding the model of
Project -based learning. These findings are consistent with the perceptions that the fourth students have
and fifth year and that they expressed in the focus groups. The following table summarizes some of these findings:
Table 8. Teaching performance aspects raised in the process of classroom observation with 1st year students.
Pedagogical interaction: teacher's role
Regarding their role as a guide, differences in monitoring quality among the different teachers were observed, as well as in the type of
Andamiaje provided. While some teachers exercised deeper monitoring, detecting the individual needs of their
students, in most cases, a work supervision that was more peripheral predominated, whose purpose was to clarify the
instructions or corroborate that students complete the task and were working on what is requested.
It is relevant to note that, in many cases, the attempt of teachers to promote a more autonomous role by students are
tension with the difficulties they presented for the comprehensive reading of the slogans or indications provided in the
booklets The above tends to be more to be seen in the most vulnerable context schools and irregular assistance, being equally
present, although to a lesser extent, in the rest of the schools.
A lot of variability was also observed in the degree to which teachers managed to involve students in dialogues and interactions in which
They will argue their answers, discuss or explain their reasoning, to facilitate the development of thought skills. In the biggest
part of the classes The interventions of the teachers were limited to consult by the understanding of the slogans or to ask questions of
direct or closed response, while in others it was observed how from their interventions, their questions and against questions,
They led to dialogues in which they progressively deepened in understanding or in different perspectives on the content. This variability
It was not necessarily determined by the attachment or distancing of teachers regarding the questions proposed by the projects,
those that are effectively oriented to promote deep understanding and reasoning by students. On some occasions, the
richer interactions were on the subject of variations introduced by teachers, and in others, despite the scaffolding offered by the
Project materials, teachers was missing the instance simply looking for students to give the expected answer.
It should also be noted that according to the account of the students it is positively valued when he/the teacher assumes a guide role
or learning mediator.
“[…] The teacher is verifying that we are working perfect or gives us help, as he said, and is pleasant, because in other schools,
For example, that does not happen, the clear teacher goes to the board says good I give them such a photocopy or loot the photocopy or look for the book, take out
Photos, etc. And "when the task is ready, they present it to me," in this school for example, it is not so, here it is much more comfortable so to speak,
It is much quieter because they say good, "if they need help, they call me", it is not that we have to go, [...] in most of the
Materials is basically calm, make us do things together, teachers are there fixing that we do things well.
Pedagogical interaction: Student involvement
The degree of involvement, participation and prominence demonstrated by the students was very varied between classrooms and inside them. HE
They identified some factors of the interaction and pedagogical management that critically influenced it. The frequency and
Systematicity with which the teacher asked the students to promote that they could solve the challenges themselves
taxes for activities and to invite themselves to involve those who were less active, showed being decisive in the dynamics achieved
establish in the classroom. The good use of class time was another important factor, because in some cases much of it was wasted
In preparatory activities (such as copying instructions), while, in others, the necessary space was given to the activities that propitiate the
Active role of the student in their learning, such as discussing or solving problems together. For this it was central that teachers would use
80 Student Focal Group, School 3.
43
With their students resources such as the booklet, presentations, or guides that were prepared prior to the class. Finally, management and
presence (or absence) of certain standards to facilitate students to focus their attention and get involved in class work, also
It was identified as a relevant factor.
Collaborative work
An obvious feature of the rooms observed was the spatial distribution of the seats, always arranged in a group, and never with stalls looking
in front. During classes in general it was observed that teachers promoted work in groups, urging students to
They shared their opinions, to listen and reach agreements. Probably because it is the first year of high school, in general, the
interventions carried out by teachers only involved verbal slogans about the importance of sharing opinions and taking agreements,
without promoting a reflection on teamwork or modeling on how to exercise certain roles to improve it,
that according to the design documents of the program are central aspects of the methodology.
In general, and except exceptions, in the visits made to the classrooms, an adequate work environment was observed, characterized by the presence of
Relations of respect and trust. Instances were also observed in which the teacher explicitly valued the students' contributions
incorporating them into their explanations or retaking them in the development of dialogue. Except in some cases, it was observed that the rules of
Coexistence were clear for students, they were respected.
Formative evaluation
Level of implementation of the formative evaluation
Plana proposes a continuous and progressive evaluation, which is articulated with the daily teaching and learning process in the classroom,
Through self -assessment, feedback and peer evaluation. It is an evaluation that seeks to identify the
Learning gaps and building alternatives for overcoming. As such, the formative evaluation proposal raises: (1)
Explicit definition of performances through which students are expected to demonstrate that they have reached
the proposed goals; and (2) incorporation of various and varied instances of evaluation throughout the project, as well as a
Final or summative instance in which the students present the product made. This implies that teachers must
Plan multiple moments throughout the project to monitor and feed their students.
Teachers are offered orientations to implement training evaluation through the document “Based learning
in projects on plan ”81. The booklets of the projects, meanwhile, include orientations and rubrics to evaluate the
Student productions.
Execution reports do not provide information regarding the implementation of training evaluation.
In focal groups and interviews, conducted for this evaluation, teachers speak of "progressive evaluations", which
They implement class by class, or at the end of each week. Regarding the way in which these evaluations implement, these are:
- Through the use of rubrics that, according to their report, evaluate aspects such as: attendance, participation,
Oral expression, among others.
- realization of a folder or portfolio per student, where in addition to class A class, students
They must incorporate some aspects referring to their own learning process.
- In one of the schools, it is indicated that self -assessments and peer evaluations are carried out, where students
They must reflect and express what they have learned and what has been more complex to learn.

- Logs or monitoring notebooks: one of the teachers comments that, to apply the final project of evaluation by project,
She built a notebook in which she registered, class by class, the advances and difficulties of each of her students,
way of being able to have a learning trajectory of each.
Together with the above, through the questionnaires applied to teachers and students, they were consulted about the frequency with which
They perform some practices related to the formative evaluation. In general, teachers report very frequently
Feedback practices and, also, explicitly communicate to their students the expected learning results. By
Other part, practices such as self -assessment or peer evaluation also have a high percentage, although less than
previously mentioned 82. Finally, it is striking that only 40% of teachers reported written tests,
frequency that differs considerably from the other practices. Similarly, this result also contrasts with what was reported
by the schools of the control or reference group, where 67% of the teachers surveyed reported to evaluate through
written tests. This result shows a possible change in the decrease in more conventional practices when evaluating
Learnings in schools plans.
On the other hand, the students of the fourth and fifth year were consulted regarding the frequency with which their language teachers
and mathematics perform certain practices linked to formative evaluation. According to the results83, it is observed that they report
a lower frequency than its teachers and also differences entity subjects. According to students, self -assessment is
much less frequent in language (38%) than in mathematics (51%).
Implementation quality: How is formative evaluation implemented?
According to the planning evaluation model, the evaluation would be expected to be at the service of learning, imbringing in
The daily teaching and learning process in the classroom. To do this, teachers are expected to clearly communicate
learning expectations, whether they are able to observe and interpret the responses or productions of your students identifying the
gaps with learning goals, and that provide constant feedback that is informative to improve, in addition to
Promote dynamics in which students feed on the work of their classmates or their own (peer evaluation and
self -assessment). It would also be expected that, in evaluation practices, teachers integrate knowledge or skills
curricular of the subjects and transverse skills that the program also seeks to promote, and that to assess them and
Identify the level of progress of your students, use guidelines or rubrics that contain explicit evaluation criteria. For the
summative evaluation, students would be expected to reveal the learning they achieved through the projects
generating a product or performance task at the end.
Below is an analysis of the evaluation practices of teachers plans from what is analyzed in the observations
of classroom and interviews after this observation.
a) Communicate learning goals and their achievement criteria
The communication of the goals and the work to appropriate them, identifying the achievement criteria, is an absent practice in the
Classroom observations of the study in depth and little reported in the interviews. Indeed, only one teacher on one occasion
Interviewee reports using the rubric for this purpose. In the observations, it was found that the indications of the teachers are
They mostly referred to the slogans and instructions to carry out the activities of the class, without reference to the work on
Descriptions of the learning that is expected to achieve. In the modules observed the teacher, at the beginning of each class, delivered the
instructions to the tasks that were going to be performed in the block, but no interventions were observed where the
Expected performances for each activity.
b) Use of rubrics
82 The detailed results of this question can be consulted in Annex 14.
83 The detailed results of this question can be consulted in Annex 14 and 15.
45
The appropriation in the use of rubrics is diverse among teachers, who report that at the beginning it was a novelty for them.
In some cases, teachers report difficulties to use them and others show greater appropriation. One of the (s
teachers reported using them from the beginning of each project to communicate to students the expectations of performance, in another,
that work together inside the school to share criteria among teachers and also to register performance
of each student, as manifested in the following appointment.
“Something that was new is the issue of rubrics, totally new to all of us, it was something extremely new, it was to start studying,
train us, to look for the training that were always stored on YouTube somewhere that hang them, was to see them again and
See them slowly, pausing, take notes. When I plan at the beginning of the year, I prepare the rubrics, which is what I am going to take into account
At the time of evaluating the final product of each quarter, I prepare the rubrics and socialize with the boys and, well, I will have in
Tell these aspects at the time of evaluating so that they know and it is not a test that one is going to give and they will have six, seven, four, four
three, no and, well, each teacher of course has their criteria in terms of the rubric. ”84
c) Interpret evidence and identify learning gaps.
Within the framework of the interview conducted to the post -observation teachers of the classroom, teachers were requested to collect work from their
students who will illustrate respectively a high level of learning achievement and, at the other end, a lower achievement level
of the expected.
When requesting teachers to explain their selection of the most and less achieved works, it could be verified that they did not establish a
clear relationship between students' production and learning goals that would realize how they judge the distance between the
learning achieved and the intended one. The review of the brands and feedback of the teachers in the materials delivered
Nor does it allow inferring on this analysis. This suggests that, for teachers, it is not evident how to use activities
of the projects to judge the level of learning achieved and their gap with the learning goals, how to use the rubric to
do so, then tending to focus exclusively on other dimensions (teamwork, effort, responsibility and
assistance) when assessing the evidence of your students.
When referring to the focus of the evaluation, there was little reference to the learning of the contents of each project; In general, the answers
Of the teachers were heterogeneous regarding what they evaluate, having in common that very few refer to aspects
curricular or referring to learning objectives.
Consistently, in interviews, the teachers made greater emphasis on effort, assistance, and work done
(independent of the degree to which this learning reflects). For example:
“[In the evaluation] I take into account, first, the fact that they come, there are children who always come, always, even arrive before me, I get to
The 13.20 and at 13.15 they are already here, I value that, they come without lunch because their mother cooks later because she is working and returns
At 12:30 and at that time cooking, for example. So, the boys are 12.30 are already coming to school, they come without lunch and well I value a lot
that. The fact that they come, that there is a continuity and well, all that influences the time of evaluation. ”85
d) Feedback to close gaps
Feedback is the primary and most important practice of formative evaluation. Without it, the whole model loses relevance,
because it is the action that has the greatest impact on the development of learning. Despite the above, the practice of
Feedback is poorly represented in students' performance materials, and in interviews not
greater references appeared to her. In classroom practices, a lot of variability was observed. In some cases teachers
They provided feedback throughout the class, although in the majority opportunities were lost to feed back the
learning.
84 Teacher School 7, Classroom Post Observation Interview.
85 Teacher School 7, Classroom Post Observation Interview.
46
In development of activities, it was identified that the teacher does not implement strategies to reorient students when
They showed some confusion that prevented them from moving forward, or made an error. For example, it was observed that in class 1,
While walking through the room, the teacher sees a student who has not responded in his notebook, and asks: “Don't you think of
Nothing?
media more circular graphics are used; However, he/the teacher does not collect this response to investigate
The understanding of the girl about the use of the different types of graphics or clarifies that the type of graph will depend on the data
that they want to show; In fact he/the teacher raises as a conclusion that the circular graphics are more complete and by
That uses them more. Then, before the request of a student to clarify what he should do in the
Question 3, he/the teacher instead of asking questions that allow the student to guide in the requested analysis (analyze if
indicated in the head of the news is consistent with the information delivered in the graph), ends up giving him the answer that
You must write86.
Regarding the types of feedback that were evidenced, the following table describes some of these:
Table 9. Types of feedback raised in the process of classroom observation and evidence review.
Type of description
Feedback
Written feedback in general, these consisted of brands that indicate approval (excellent or ‘excel’, tickets) or indicate errors (crosses),
without delivering a description of what has been achieved or of the gaps between performances and learning goals
Not a brief explanation of how to improve
Feedback in the wide diversity in the performance of the teachers in the feedback in the classroom. In some
Interaction in classroom cases, absence of feedback or interventions limited to approve or congratulate the answers, indicate
errors or directly deliver the correct answers; In others - more uncommon - they were more informative
about what was achieved or to achieve or sought that the student himself discover how to advance.
Regarding the content or focus of interest of feedback, four types could be appreciated: (1) with focus on
classify the answers given as good or bad; (2) With focus on the instructions or slogans of the activity of
learning; (3) with focus on aspects not achieved and in keys to achieve them (less frequent); (4) With focus on the
Near development zone and the scaffolding necessary for the apprentice (less frequent).
e) The learning evaluation and qualification
The qualification is an unavoidable practice in any educational system and, therefore, it is important to analyze the way in which
Formative evaluation practices coexist and are coupled with summative evaluation practices, and qualifications.
In the interviews with the teachers it was possible to investigate how they solved the individual qualification and integrated it or not with the practices
of evaluation that plans proposes. In some cases, teachers refer to ‘traditional’ evaluations (tests or
exams or those they call as “structured or semi-structured evaluations”) to obtain information about the
Individual performance that is more difficult for them to investigate in group work, to qualify the learning of content
curricular and not to distance themselves in excess of evaluations with which students will face in other circumstances.
“[…] Every project carries its processes and we are evaluating that process, teamwork […] but, perhaps, this one also does not
Remove that semi -structured evaluation, perhaps also do a little job as I did in that class, something like that where they look capable
to be able to do it, and not to get it totally so that we are also in accordance with the evaluations that are year after year
86 Mathematics Class Field Note, School 9.
47
Sending, yes?, and based on what the boy feels “well, to see, they evaluate me in one way and they also evaluate me from another” and feel
capable and not frustrated in the end, I see it very positive and the truth is that I apply it, I apply it a lot. ”87
In these cases, the place that teachers assign to the training evaluations previously carried out in the qualification of the
learning is to use them as a ‘compensation’ that allows the qualification to be raised, since it allows them to recognize
non -curricular aspects. However, to assign a qualification to these ‘non -curricular’ dimensions in general, it is not resorted to
Pre -established criteria or the rubrics that contemplate them.
“Teacher 9: I had a note, what some boys out there were not well in operation, who were not going to arrive with the note, because
They were not going to reach the contents, but they have tried so much to be able to present their magic tricks, which you say, well reached
Do you understand me? So you compensate.
Interviewer: And to evaluate these things that are not content, do you use a guideline or rather as an impression of something he did?
Teacher School 9: It is more than anything impression. Yes, more than anything impression and how they perform, like them ... with what do you want
Things. ”88
Teachers who assign grades from the evaluation tasks proposed by plans refer to a variety of practices.
Sometimes they point out that an average of the partial qualifications carried out during the process is assigned, combining aspects
Curricular with attitudinal, although most of the time it is not clear how they perform the ‘translation’ of these evaluations
partial to a note or number.
From the story of the teachers, different ways of assigning notes were detected, which also imply different ways of
Understand evaluation and qualification. Among the most striking strategies, (i) are avoided
of the quality of the work delivered by the student), (ii) assign the maximum qualification to all and go discounting points
and then average this ‘process’ note with that assigned to the final task, and (iii) transform the categories of the rubric to qualifications.
Depending on the above, it can be seen that there is a heterogeneity with respect to the way in which the
Teachers compatible the evaluation model proposed by PLANEA and the province qualification system. Also, this
Heterogeneity also speaks of the need for common criteria that guide or guide how to perform this process.
Question 2: What are the facilitators or success factors for the implementation of the program?
This question was approached from interviews and focal groups to jurisdictional profiles, managers and teachers. From the look
of directors and teachers, there is an agreement to recognize as a facilitator the fact that the schools in which it was implemented
The first year they have previously been part of the so -called "New format schools":
- From the province, it is recognized that the program plans to “strengthen” the work model of the schools again
Format, contributing with accompaniment.
- In the case of directors, the program plans to reinforce the work and teaching methodologies already existing in
These schools, while opening the possibility of having institutional hours for teachers, which
allowed and facilitated the development of collaborative work between them, useful for the implementation and guidelines of the
program.
- From the view of some teachers, the fact of being a new school facilitated the implementation of the program
Plan to the extent that the school already had a form of work similar to what the program proposes. In addition to it
Previous, from the view of teachers, another facilitator related to new format schools is linked to the
cycle work. This is a characteristic that schools have a new format: the teaching teams of the subjects
basic work with the same group of students for three consecutive school years, in order to accompany them
in their school trajectories. In this way, in addition to allowing teachers to accompany the trajectories of their
87 Teacher School 2, Classroom Post Observation Interview.
88 Teacher School 9, Classroom Post Observation Interview.
48
students, has favored the continuity in the implementation of the projects by subject, in case they have had
Disadvantages the previous year to complete them.
Another facilitator that rises from the perspective of directors and jurisdictional profiles is related to the leadership that
The directors of the schools exercise.
“[…] We did know that what I had just raised, the strength had to be in the management management team. The weakness, we do
There was a decision to leave schools that had no strong directors. ”89
“[…] Here the important thing is that they get involved, to participate, to exercise leadership, to call, verify what happens inside
of their classrooms. ”90
Along these lines, the work of directors and pedagogical advisors seems fundamental in the development of both organizational work and
The new pedagogical orientation of plans in schools.
Directors recognize the sense of belonging to the educational community, students and teachers, and the motivation of the
Young teachers to train as key factors for the success of the implementation:
“[…] The facilitation of the program is the sense of belonging that the boys and teachers had to remain ongoing, they were so
Compenetrated students with teachers, so compensated that it is something out of series, so it is one of the reasons they emphasized
to continue. ”91
“[…] For young teachers, because we can catalog teachers in different stages according to maturity, the young teacher is like
That is, he is the teacher who wants to write down in training, take a course, learn this or learn that and the teacher who already has his
more traditionalist things, if I'm fine with this, I have learned this that gives good result, we can continue just like this, then they are
All teachers according to the evolution they have and as a manager I have to go. ”92
The level of commitment that both management teams and teachers have with the program are also recognized as
An facilitating aspect. While it is pointed out that there are teachers who have some resistance to the program, they are mostly
committed to the execution of this. This develops in greater detail in the sustainability criteria.
On the other hand, the different actors recognize that some components of the plan plan are facilitators for the
implementation. From the province they report that, despite a certain initial resistance by teachers, the majority
begins to adhere to the program to the extent that they were participating in the training of the teaching network, as well as the
The corresponding institutional hours are granted. Both elements, in the opinion of the province, contributed to a greater
Acceptance of plan by the guild:
“[…] The guilds have accompanied, especially since this has meant improving the working conditions of teachers and directors” 93
Finally, from the view of the teachers, another aspect that they recognize as important and that can constitute as a
Facilitator is work in teacher doubles. In the case of the subjects of Natural Sciences and Social Sciences, both are
made of teaching duplications, by a history teacher and another of geography in the case of social sciences; And a teacher of
Biology and another of physique-chemistry in the case of natural sciences. In the opinion of the teachers, the collaborative nature of this
work facilitates that, in these subjects, projects are worked efficiently, being able to finish them in the established deadlines;
In the same way, the complementarity that is generated between teachers, which relieves the workload and, to the same
Time, allows to implement more innovations and activities with students. The following appointment accounts for the above:
89 Interview in charge Province No. 1.
90 Interview with Supervisors Province.
91 Interview with Director, School 4.
92 Interview with Director, School 6.
93 Interview with Jurisdictional Profile No. 2.
49
“With respect to this also that the partner said, to work in a group, well it happens to me that with the teacher of history that gives in third
year we complement each other quite well, and between the two we are going, as [teacher name] said, to go this, she begins the activity, the
I continue, it makes me reinforce here, I take care of this, so we are distributing a little ”94
This form of work, however, does not happen in the case of language and mathematics subjects, where teachers
They recognize that they would like to have more collaborative work to carry out the projects of their respective subjects.
Question 3: What have been the main barriers in the implementation of the program?
This evaluation question is approached from the interviews with directors and actors in the province and the focus groups of
teachers and students. For the purposes of this report, the identified difficulties were organized thematically, presenting themselves to
continuation.
Covid-19 pandemia
Without a doubt, the main difficulty faced by the program in its implementation was the Covid-19 Pandemia, which implied
The confinement for the population and a rearrangement in the priorities.
As for the implementation of plan, the pandemic impacted, at least, the following aspects:
Change in institutional priorities product of the emergency
From the province, it is recognized that, on the occasion of the health emergency, priorities in political matters were restructured and
Budget, focusing on health. This brought with it that aspects such as equipment and connectivity in schools will go to
a background.
“[…] We would have loved to continue with equipment and connectivity, which was a commitment that was initial for the first two years
[…] And we could not fulfill, pandemic through. I say the pandemia again marked a situation [...] of greater weakness
budget and that the priority is not connectivity, of course, because it had to do with a year where the priority of government was
Health centered I say […] but I do believe that the topic connectivity and the theme equipment is a debt that we have to see how to settle ”95
The impossibility of having equipment and connectivity for all schools became a very important barrier to
The implementation, considering the long period of confinement and the fact that the projects plans incorporates digital resources
In its design.
Exacerbation of the lack of resources
Very related to the above, confinement generated an exacerbation of the material difficulties with which they had the
schools to function and the interruption of the distribution by the province. In the same way, he made visible and deepened the
material lacks that the students themselves had. This evidently affected the continuity of the classes.
“[…] In the previous management one of the attractive issues and that it came from the hand of the pedagogical proposal was that UNICEF delivered
To each school a mobile cart with each computer, so that was done during 2018 and 2019, in 2020 the pandemic arrived and was suspended
Everything, that is, 2021 and 2021 schools did not receive [...] that is an issue that until today demands that, that equipment. The proposals
What does UNICEF do is learning based on projects to investigate, to look
responsible and not only say as a mode of play and recreation [...] and this added to the limitations of the school population
that concurs to these schools, it has been difficult for them to have internet in their homes ”96

Components that could not be implemented
From the student's account, the projects themselves, which rest strongly in the collaborative work between students, not
They could be implemented in a good way due to existing technological difficulties.
“Student-woman 1: Yes, there was a time when we didn't understand each other.
Student-Man 2 Man: Or when there were virtual classes.
Interviewer: now. I imagine that should have been super difficult.
Student-Woman: Yes. It was very disappointing because the teacher was also difficult to explain what he meant through the phone.
Interviewer: And when you were in Pandemia, when they were in virtual classes, they worked in the same group?
Mujer 1: In Pandemia? No. It was more individual ”97
In addition to the projects, the actors recognize that there were other components that could not be implemented in Pandemia. Such is
The case of the learning workshops and the role of the student counselor:
"Learn to learn" has depended many times on the tutor, then during the time of pandemic, the tutor was the fundamental link
Among the other teachers and students. So, lead to the proposal to "learn to learn", the student counselor could not
develop. This year we started working again with the role of the tutor, although we had meetings with the tutors, but it was
More maintenance meetings during the pandemic, were sustaining meetings, listening, giving them some strategies,
But not to ask them to develop, but we were presented with the proposal "learn to learn" so that they, from there, take
activities or take ideas and work with your students. On the other hand, there were many hours of tutorials without covering themselves, so that is
Like this year, only this year it has been possible to say that there is an achievement with the proposal ”98
As can be seen, the components most affected by the pandemic correspond, precisely, to the components of the process
of teaching-learning.
Barriers associated with teaching
In interviews and focal groups, they realize a series of situations associated with teachers who are problematic
And, to a large extent, they affect the proper implementation of the program:
The "Professor Taxi" and the obstacles to the allocation of institutional hours
From the province it is recognized that, for there to be an adequate implementation of the program and, specifically, of ABP,
You need greater permanence of teachers in school. However, it is recognized that this collides with the form of
Work that teachers have in the province: the so -called "Professor Taxi".
“[…] You imagine that the particularity in our country […] is that teachers run from one school to another to have a mosaic schedule
From three hours to a school, they spend three hours in others, then saying increase the hours, implies a logistics that you have to
Giving up hours in other schools […] and many teachers, did not want, some resisted, so all these had to be accommodated
Variables because the workplace of teachers if we have taken care of too. ”99
In relation to the previous one, there is a recognition in which the process of assigning institutional hours has not had speed
That would have expected.
Absenteeism of teachers
In three of the 6 schools in which student focal groups were held and they claimed not having certain subjects due
that your school does not have teachers to teach them.

Student-Man 2: They don't have. "
In another school, students reported not also having a math and geography teacher respectively. Of it
Mode, from the province, some actors also recognize that teaching absenteeism is a problem that they are facing100.
Differences from teachers with the pedagogical approach or the subject that promotes plans
According to some directors, there are teachers in their schools that at the beginning resisted the new forms of teaching
which promotes plans, although in most cases it was dissipating as the implementation of the program advanced, which
It could be attributed to training and information delivery.
“[…] At first it was what teachers got used to it, because it was not easy either to come and change structure, a preparation, training
That was different, do you understand me? So I have some older teachers than they felt like it was not something beneficial. ”101
This resistance to change was also reported by teachers, who commented that, although they joined the
Changes proposed by the program plans, have coworkers who have resisted assuming this model.
“Teacher 3-School 2: Over there I take something very important that has highlighted the teacher, I am a teacher in two schools plans different, in
Where situations are opposed, the institution to which I come to represent at the moment, I have a bright parallel, than from
The first start of plan we have been able to articulate, we introduce what you think, we are exchanging ideas, we are growing next to the project,
Next to the boys, in the other institution where you should also be applied, my parallel resists teaching
There they would have to intervene directors, they would have to intervene, pedagogues, the teachers when they are going to sign the books say they do everything, that
They are teaching plans […] then they are two totally opposite situations in my case
Teacher 2-School 5: But your partner is young? Is it big?
Teacher 3-School 2: He is about to retire, of course, he is about to retire for that [...] I rescue the contribution that the teacher made because it is
real, but teachers who have some age and who are very close, are totally denied to implement plans, that there are
Exceptions of young teachers who do not want to implement plans, too.
Teacher 4-School 4: But there are also the exceptions of the big teachers who, if they implement, for example, I am the person I am
replacing in first, second and third year of biology, he had planned, but perfect, that is, and she was very.
Teacher 2-School 5: I think it is a predisposition […] a predisposition of the teacher and also the instructions from the head of

Teacher 1-School 1: I think it is for fear, for fear, because everything new, everything is afraid sometimes ”102
In the first date, the teacher acknowledges that, initially, he resisted a lot to change his teaching form to the model plans
And he acknowledges, in his words, how that also affected the disposition that his students had regarding the program. In the case
From the second and third appointment, the teachers comment on situations of co -workers who resist assuming the model
Plan and try to articulate possible explanations to this resistance. In both conversations it happened that, at first,
The hypothesis that the teacher's age can influence resistance (“teachers who have a certain age and that are
Very close, they are totally denied to implement plans ”), but then in the conversation itself this hypothesis is going
discarding as cases that contradict it are exposed. While teachers do not conclude in any unique explanation,
in general they refer to the idea that this resistance may be due to the fear of facing a completely different model from
that they knew, which they have worked and with which they were trained as teachers.
Variability of performances and ways to understand project -based learning and training evaluation
In relation to project -based learning, in the observation of classroom practices, differences in performance were identified
of teachers regarding the management and application of project work and, in general, the practice of teaching. By way of
Example is the work of teachers to address the differences between students. From what was observed in the classroom,
Virtually no specific actions were evidenced aimed at attending to the differences and individual needs of the students
to allow access to learning. In the different courses observed there were students whose level of literacy was very diverse,
In some cases there are students whose ability to read and write was very initial. In these cases, no actions were evidenced
aimed at giving more support to these students, so many times, they were left behind or without doing the activities carried out
Throughout the class.
The above also emerged in two of the interviews conducted after the classroom observation. In both cases, teachers
They refer to the way, more or less successful, in which they manage the different learning rhythms of their students:
“Some boys get bored as [student name], which he flies the tasks,“ also implement the tutoring, too, also
It understands rapidito everything and does it flying, so he tells me "teacher, correct me", "and student, where I have there the boys who go
Now what do I do? " And I have to be with the girls and the boys who have a hard time and work, where they helped their peers,
Little more, explain two or three, four or ten times and well, the boys who end help when they could, because that is there
Before they get bored, but they can't advance alone, they need someone who problems them, that some did not want them to help him, well,
Explain what follows, they can't advance alone either. So well, it is complicated I think, that when they saw there, they had some rejection some
Because you put in a balance and you say what do I do? I leave these children behind and sometimes the teacher said “Oh the teacher helps me in
I continue with these children who go at a great pace or delay a little mathematics ”well, being a partner who was at
Those delay them a little and continue to take them to these children who side of them, perhaps they responded well104. ”
It costs everything, everything ... all subjects, all103. "
In relation to the previous appointments, where a teacher sees an obstacle, the other sees an opportunity. It probably does not exist
a single variable that explains this difference, but the truth is that it becomes necessary to investigate in this aspect, in order to evaluate
New ways of support and accompaniment to teachers to address these difficulties.
On the other hand, with respect to the formative evaluation, the way in which it is being
Understood. According to what arises from the interviews, it seems to be understood that the formative has to do with aspects

103 Teacher School 7, Post Observation Interview 1st Year.
104 Teacher School 2, Post Observation Interview 1st years.
53
Attitudinal, socio -emotional or relational, at the expense of academic learning. This idea, also, is reinforced from
of the difficulty experienced by teachers to "translate" the training evaluation in the qualifications they must report.
Student contexts and precarious previous learning levels
An aspect reported by some actors has to do with the characteristics and context of school students
Plan. The directors state that the projects, require continuity and sustain a theme for weeks in a job
Group, which is very difficult when there are high levels of school absenteeism.
“[…] Student's absenteeism has been a tremendous obstacle for us to continue with this project, then teachers were done
Difficult to continue, move on, to the point that there were teachers who told me, for example the math professor told me “well, I
I don't know if continuing with the project, keep working because I looked "and what I said," the one who perseveres triumph, "and continued to the letter." 105
On the other hand, some teachers report that their students come from contexts so vulnerable that many times not
They present the minimum competences to be able to work the objectives that arise in the projects.
“Teacher 2-School 3: […] at least we at school, I, at school until the third year, even sometimes I have to copy everything, because
I have students who do not know how to take dictated, I have students who do not know how to read, the first year that happens to me, so, to see, and there I face
also to the fact that a selection of new content.
Teacher 1-School 3: The problem we have with the boys who entered this year. Those who entered this year after 2020 and 2021 are
boys like fifth grade boys [...] look like boys of fifth grade, so you have to do everything back, and start
as the fifth grade boy. […] Then, this whole project and you have to delay it.
Teacher 2-School 3: from zero, and even the issue of the appearance of new themes implies covering holes with different knowledge,
That is, suddenly does not allow us to make a progressive correlation of knowledge so that the boys can reach something. ”106
It should also be noted that this same perception is repeated in the interviews conducted to teachers who were observed in their
classroom practices
Question 4: What is the contribution made by each program component to achieve your
objectives according to the perception of the actors?
To answer this question, they were analyzed in the questionnaires applied to directors and school teachers plans those
Questions referring to the contribution of each component to achieve the planning objectives.
In said questionnaires, both managers and teachers were requested to select 5 components that, in their opinion, are
Essential for the achievement of program objectives globally. The following graph reports the answers given by the
Teachers:

The previous graph is ordered based on its results, of the highest percentage to a lower percentage. In this way, you can see
that teachers pointed to work for projects as one of the priority components to achieve the objectives of the
program. On the other hand, they identified the Interdocent Evaluation Council as the least relevant, with a lower rate of
selection. From the perspective of managers, these same components were repeated as the one that most and less contributes to the achievement of the
program (n = 14).
Both teachers and managers assign high priority to learning workshops, driving network and the teaching network. Without
However, they disagree with the importance they give to the student counselor, which is more valued by directors than by teachers.
In focal groups, teachers pointed out that it is difficult to fulfill the functions established for the counselor
Student, given the little time they have assigned to exercise it and the contingencies of schools, that many times the
They force you to have to address problems outside the teaching-learning process in their "hours of tutoring."
In annex, the assessment of directors and teachers of the contribution of each component for the fulfillment of each
Objective of the program separately. In short, to comply with the objective of improving the trunk learning of the
Students, from the perception of managers and teachers there is a confluence in relieving learning workshops, the
Formative evaluation and work for projects as components that contribute to meet this objective. Also directors
and teachers agree that project work is one of the key components to comply with the objective of
Promote life skills and in which the driving network is a relevant component to promote an improvement in
school trajectories.
The vision of students
As noted above, project work is the component that, in the opinion of directors and teachers, contributes to
Compliance with the planning objectives.
In general, students report that, through work with projects, they have improved in skills such as communication
Oral, collaborative work and reading comprehension The following appointments illustrate that:
“Interviewer: Do you consider that these projects have helped them, for example, to better communicate ideas, to express themselves better?
Several students: Yes
Interviewer: Now, have you noticed a change? Because I understand that through you plan you are fed up, you have to
Expose fed up, right?
Mujer 1: Yes, a lot
55
Interviewer: Have you felt that you have learned better, for example, to communicate your ideas, for example, in your life outside the school,
Talk to friends, with lords to buy things, for?
Student-woman 2: A lot really gave us a change to us in everyday life, outside school, [...] and be more communicative and
explanatory based on everything that basically surrounds us
Interviewer: Now, do you think that working as a team, believe that this learning -based learning or projects is a good way
To learn as a team, in groups? Have you learned to work in groups? Because working in groups is not easy
Mujer 1: More than anything, we all learn the same
Student-Man 3: It gives you the possibility of listening to each other's opinion
Student-woman 1: exactly, understand what, that, there are different opinions in each person, but a point will always come
You have to take the subject of each person, that is, grouping all that and doing a single subject. ”107
In relation to specific aspects of work for projects that value positively, some of them highlight the fact of
place them as protagonists of their own learning process, based on the creativity of the products that must be carried
just:
“Interviewer: Do you think this school is doing things for students to be motivated and maintained?
Student-Man 1: For the types of jobs they give, as my partners said, who are creative, they read books, historiographies, in part
Yes, in that concept yes […]
Interviewer: Do you see your most motivated peers?
Student-Man 2: The fact that I let them be protagonists of their own project, that motivates, is no longer as much as they are all the time
so that this is done and this every year, but they let each student do in their own way, but with the same end [...] the motivation
It would be that everyone can do it as they can
Student-woman 3: in fourth, for example, we are making a story, a letter [...] of immigrants or soldier who goes to war
Mujer 4: created by ourselves ”
Despite the previous visions, it should be noted that in three of the six schools in which focal groups with students were held, the
Young people feel they are not learning with this methodology. The reasons, however, are different and could be associated
to contexts of greater and lesser vulnerability. In the case of one of the schools, students perceive that, comparatively with
students of others, they are "delayed" in regard to curricular content; This, for them, results
especially critical to the extent that they expressed their intention to continue higher studies:
“Interviewer: As you say, not all subjects are plans and not all schools are planning, do you consider this method
Plan is a good method to learn?
Student-Man 1: I at a certain point, that is, there are things that are good. That of final projects, you have to do research, work in
groups, those things are good, but the topics like that you have to improve them
Student-woman 2: that is, you learn, but not enough to continue a professional career
Interviewer: Perfect, then you learn, that is, you consider that you learn, but not enough
Student-Man 1: You learn, you can say that it meets the objectives that the student returns to school, who wants
study, motivate them a bit to continue studying
Mujer 3: It becomes easier to approve
Interviewer: Ah now, it is easier to approve subjects
Student-Man 1: Yes, it is easier to approve subjects, but that does not make us learn a lot
Student-woman 3: as the subject is easier, but now we do not learn, that is, we do not learn much ”108
In two other schools, of more vulnerable contexts than the previous one, students agree that, through the projects, no
They learn mostly, but in this case they attribute it that they do not understand them at all, and report that classes prefer
exhibitions

Question 5: To what extent do you plan better results in schools
intermediates?
This question is approached, exclusively, through indices or scales elaborated from questions contained in the
questionnaires applied to teachers and students, establishing comparisons between what was reported by teachers and students of
Schools with plan and schools of the reference or control group. This section presents the intermediate results that are
They agreed within the framework of this evaluation from the review of the change theory109, which are: (1) sense of belonging
of the students; (2) School motivation; (3) School coexistence; (4) concern of teachers for well -being and
students' trajectory; (5) Teaching expectations about students; (6) Incorporation/Transformation of Practices
Evaluatives in language and mathematics; and (7) Management Management with emphasis on school trajectories.
Since the program seeks to influence these intermediate results explicitly, it was sought to contrast the perception with respect to
They among teachers and students who answered the questionnaires applied in the 16 schools attended by the program and in the
16 schools in which the program is not implemented110.
It should be noted that these results do not allow inferences on the effect of the program, nor are they generalizable, since
They represent the group of teachers and students who effectively responded to the questionnaires applied in schools

Source: Own elaboration.
From the data presented in the table, it can be found that, in most intermediate results, they are not reported
Statistically significant differences between teachers and students plans versus teachers and students of the reference group.
In the only cases where statistically significant differences are reported are: (1) Incorporation of pedagogical practices
related to the model plans in language, according to the perception of students; and (2) incorporation of related pedagogical practices
The model plans in mathematics, also from the perspective of the students. While this difference is not of a magnitude
Relevant, realizes that, indeed, school students planned a greater presence of related practices
By plans in their language and mathematics classes, unlike students of the reference schools. It should be noted, as
Savel, that these results provide information referred to the level of implementation, but not to the quality of this.
Another aspect that is interesting is that, in some results, differences in the perception of teachers were observed
Plan about students plans. In the case of the School Coexistence Scale and incorporation of related practices to plan
In language, statistically significant differences were observed and from medium to large magnitudes in the averages of both
actors. That is, the teachers presented a more positive perception than the students.
In relation to the absence of significant differences between the groups plans and reference (both students and teachers), a
possible hypothesis to explain this is related to the transfer of practices between schools plans and does not plan through
59
The teachers themselves. According to data raised in the questionnaire applied to teachers, 60.5%113 of the respondent teachers
They claimed to work both in a school with the model plans and another without the model. Of that group of teachers, 70% 114 of
They stated that they transfer teaching practices from the school plans to the other school that does not have the project. Of
This form, aspects such as the type of day the teachers ("Professor Taxi") could be contributing to the
transfer of practices, thus blurring pedagogical practices that cease to be exclusive to the model plans.
8.3 Efficiency
The efficiency criteria is related to the extent to which the products and/or results were achieved with the strategies developed
through the model plans and with the available resources, optimizing and taking into account the integrality and articulation between the
linked levels. An important aspect to clarify is that, according to what was agreed with UNICEF Argentina, in this criterion
It is considered an analysis of the plan's costs. It is necessary to specify the scope of this evaluation, which did not focus on
The financial dimension of the program, nor in alternative strategies costs.
Question 1: Have the resources (human, material, and time) be used committed in
The different components of the program, optimally to achieve their results?
In order to answer this question, interviews conducted to provincial actors and school directors were analyzed
Plan. During the first two years of the program, according to what was indicated in the interviews, the role that the province had
to do with administration and commitments related to human resources, while UNICEF had to ensure delivery and
Material resource management. After these years, the province had to manage all the resources autonomously
associated with the program.
According to interviews conducted to the provincial actors, there is recognition that, mainly on the occasion of the
Pandemia, all committed resources have not been managed, in particular in regard to delivering connectivity to
All program schools.
The managers interviewed evaluate the reception and use of resources in a positive way. It alludes to the excellence of
Training, the delivery of support constantly, the quality of the equipment, the timely delivery of work materials
and that the above provides tools to carry out the work of the institution and plan:
“What I can say is that both the province and Plan Tucumán always lived up to the circumstances and always supporting,
They always guided us, listened to us, trained us and that intervention was very positive, I see it, and for each of the points that
You said, I would tell you the same, they took us out of any doubt ”115
Training seems to be the best evaluated in their quality and that of teachers, which implies a good use of the
Investment of resources that implies gathering teachers to attend them. On the other hand, the provision of computers and
Connectivity turned out to be the worst evaluated by impacting the efficiency of the implementation, especially the component of
computer science and also at the beginning of the program in which students would be supposed to access the material through the web.
Although the teachers were not consulted regarding the efficient use of resources, certain practices that carry out were mentioned
Some schools that account for efficient use of material resources, specifically the reuse of booklets by
subject, as students are asked to take care of the booklet that is given to them and that they return them at the end of the year.
113176 of 291 teachers

115 Interview with Director, School 1.

Thus the booklets are reused by the students of the corresponding level the following year, which also allows to cover the
delay with which they usually reach the start of the year. This practice is also aware by the authorities of the province:
“[…] We make a commitment to the booklet to the student in which they must return it once the
elective cycle under the same conditions that has received it because we thus guarantee that the future income of the students
They have already secured their booklet, because we are already knowing that from UNICEF they are very small with the budget, that is
What made us request the booklets, they told us there are no budgets, the budgets have shortened, then let's try
See how we solve that. ”116
On the other hand, both in the interviews with managers and in the teaching focus groups, some situations were identified that
They can be resolved with a more efficient management:
- Training schedules: Regarding training, managers comment that, on several occasions, they run out of
Teaching endowment in schools to cover the courses, due to the dates and schedules of the training. This situation is
corroborated by teachers.
- Theft of computer equipment: directors and teachers of two schools reported that the teams delivered by
UNICEF in the plan of plan were stolen. The protection, maintenance or replacement of equipment could be included in the
plan management analysis.
- Booklet impression: the booklets are needed, and the lack of these generates difficulties when it comes to
Develop actions in the classroom.
Based on the above, taking into account that projects need to available new work resources for students,
Beyond paper and pencil of a traditional classroom, and that they must be well used and available, it seems relevant to generate better
Provision and management mechanisms, providing sufficient materials and taking care of the existing ones.
“Teacher 2-School 5: Well, I wore a TV […] I wore a TV from my home
Teacher 1-School 1: I did countless times
Teacher 2-School 5: I had a day, I took it another day, but no, one day I said enough, it will break and who will pay it to me
Teacher 1-School 1: I wore a 29 inches, loaded it in the car and carried it ”117
Question 2: What strategies have been developed to ensure program efficiency?
From the province, the following strategies deployed to monitor the operation of the program Plan:
- Territorial teams118: According to what was indicated by one of the provincial profiles, the province of Tucumán is divided
Geopolitically in five circuits that, in turn, are composed of different departments. In order to monitor the
operation of the schools of each circuit, a territorial team consists of a coordinator of
circuit and different territorial technical assistants, which are ultimately who visit schools and monitor their
operation. This organization is prior to the implementation of plan and, on the occasion of this program, it was decided that,
Within each circuit, the coordinators designate two territorial technical assistants to exclusively visit the
116 Teacher School 2, Focal Group 3.
117 Teachers Schools 1 and 5, Focal Group 3.
118 An aspect that was confusing to elucidate in this evaluation was the way in which the functions between the territorial equipment and the supervisors are organized and distributed,
since, from the documents, it seems that both perform monitoring and monitoring work in schools. According to the information that was built in the
Interviews with jurisdictional profiles of the province and the field visit, it was established that both teams (team of supervisors and territorial equipment) formed
Part of different structures of the organization chart that currently coexist; According to what is indicated, supervisors occupy a rather of headquarters, being in charge
of one or more circuits. In the case of territorial teams, there is a territorial team for each circuit. Therefore and, ultimately, those who have more direct access
A day -to -day schools are territorial teams.
61
Schools plans that are part of said circuit. In short, these technical assistants are the link between schools and
Province119.
- UNICEF Argentina monitoring and monitoring reports: in the different years of program implementation, from
UNICEF Argentina have made information surveys regarding the operation of the program and its different
Components. As indicated by the province, the information from said reports has been
a lot of use and has also allowed them to attend to particular situations such as the assistance of directors
In the driving network.
The existence of these teams is undoubtedly an advantage to monitor and ensure the efficiency in the implementation of the program.
From UNICEF's gaze, the existence of monitoring meetings is mentioned and, indeed, the data requirement for the
development of monitoring reports; Despite this, it is recognized that it has been difficult to implement it:
“[…] The monitoring system remains the same, with new schools, is the same, costs, costs, but the system is exactly the
That is, the reports, the data requirement, the meetings, we do not have weekly meetings, but we have a meeting per month with
All teams, this, the same goes at the level of the most political authorities, that is, there are periodic meetings, there is as one, like a job
Systematic of a certain, how to say it, it sounds ugly accountability, but of evaluation, say, what happens. ”120
However, it is crucial that its focus is not only in the administrative functioning of schools and the program or in the
implementation of activities, but in its central components (pedagogical):
“[…] What perhaps we have to know a little in the province is (…) if there were really school teachers who have modified
The projects incorporating issues that considered that they were priority and that were not, that is, we should make a list of issues
To know how this is happening in schools ”121
Now, for managers interviewed efficiency does not appear as a subject of concern. In the same way, none of
The schools consulted reports a specific management control system that allows them to ensure the efficient use of
resources (time, human and material resources).
In addition to the above, in the questionnaire applied to directors, their degree of agreement was consulted before two polar statements
referred to management systems. Nine of the 14 directors plans who answered the questionnaire, affirms that in their school
They adopted registration, control or monitoring strategies to ensure the efficient use of the resources delivered pro plan122. In
relationship to this, it is striking that, despite the high percentage according to this statement, at the time of consulting them in a way
Explicit about these strategies in the interviews, the directors of 6 of these 14 schools could not account for what were
and what they consisted of.
On the other hand, those who raised a critical look about the monitoring and control strategies were some teachers,
who stated that there is no control system, especially with regard to the efficient use of devices
technological
“I think there must also be a control, right? With the theme of the boys, we are fine, we give this device
technological, but you have to take care of it, I don't know how
Commitment, here they gave computers at another time and the boys sold it, they did what they wanted ”123

8.4 Sustainability
The sustainability criteria corresponds to the extent to which the program develops capabilities and stable transforms the
Practices in classroom levels, institution and provincial educational policy, thus favoring its permanence in the tempo. In this
criteria was also considered the scalability of the program, understood as the extent to which its design allows or favors a
Expansion and, therefore, a greater impact. For the purposes of this evaluation, depending on the information available
It includes the analysis of the financial sustainability of the program. Next, each of these questions is developed
evaluation from the different sources of information.
Question 1: To what extent is the model incorporated in the policies of the province of
Tucumán aimed at the secondary level and in school practices?
In order to answer this evaluation question, official documentation of the design and execution of the program was reviewed, such as
also interviews with key actors from UNICEF; In addition to the above, interviews conducted to jurisdictional profiles of
the province of Tucumán; and finally, the questionnaires applied to students, teachers and managers were analyzed.
For the purposes of the organization of information, this section is divided into four aspects related to the incorporation of
Planning model: (1) The incorporation of the key practices of the program at the institutional level, (2) the incorporation of practices to
school level; and (3) the incorporation of practices in the teaching-learning process.
The incorporation of the key practices of the program at the institutional (provincial) level
According to the theory of planning plan, to ensure transformations at the high school level, at the institutional level
(Provincial), a series of aspects summarized in the following table should be ensured:
Table 11. Advance level in incorporation of practices and sustainability at the provincial level.
Advances aspect
Collective generation according to the Execution Report of the year 2019, the projects implemented in the first year were
Working documents. reviewed and modified jointly with the Directorate of Secondary Education, based on
Information raised with the same teachers.
Generation of regulations for the province is recognized that the process of assigning institutional hours to teachers has been
Assignment of human resources and slower than expected. However, it is also pointed out that efforts have been made to give more
Work hours speed to the process of assigning teachers per school.
Articulation between different levels in the documents and interviews, articulation experiences between different levels are related. Counting from
of management and installation of 2019, teachers of the province were incorporated as “collaborators” in the construction of the
capacities at the jurisdictional level. projects for the following years by forming work teams by subject, composed of
teachers and a member of the province's curricular team.
On the other hand, during the year 2021, greater autonomy has been delivered to the province for the
Organization and management of the driving network. In relation to this, from UNICEF Argentina they pointed out that
They are in a process of “training to trainers”, through which it seeks to train the
Provincial teams in order that they are who implement the work with the management teams and
driving network actors.
The above is also recognized by provincial actors. In general, they highlight the constitution of
support and accompaniment networks between them with managers and teachers, considering this
Accompaniment as an installed and consolidated practice, formally and informally, with dialogue,
Reflection, and support, among others for problem solving and advances in conjunction with schools.
Review of composition of equipment regarding the formation of teams, from the province it is recognized that a weak point has been the
provincial and organization of equipment readjustment based on changes in management and administration. Regarding that, at the level
work at school. Provincial laments the disarticulation that occurred in the territorial managers and
curricular, which had a process of planning for at least three years: “[…]
They told new management that there are issues that have to be maintained, because just unicef has
63
inverted time to train a team, say time and objectives to train the team of the
Province so that at some point when they retire you can continue the province with a team
trained. And it did not happen, what we are seeing now is to recover that team ”124.
Regarding the work organization at school, from the province it is proposed that an aspect
Important has to do with the leadership role of directors. In relation to this, they pointed out that
an aspect that they implemented at the provincial level and that, initially, was not contemplated in plan,
was to increase and concentrate the hours of the directors: “Many directors of ours have the position of
management and hours in the classroom, and we asscribe them at that time so that the directors can dedicate themselves
to the management, directive management function and, above all, in schools it plans. That was very good
received by the directors, I think that also that one of the issues that pushed
some way to accompany some extra-class processes. ”125
The incorporation of practices at school level
As expressed in the document on change theory, the practices that should be incorporated at school level
They are: (1) generate management teams with pedagogical leadership; (2) Ensure space and time for teamwork and collaborative
Between teachers.
Regarding the first point, from the province it is recognized that the driving network has contributed to generate a kind of
"Community" between the directors, who have learned to work together, to receive accompaniment and share their
work in schools. This same idea is raised by the directors, who value share experiences with other
directors and work collaboratively in solving problems:
“[…] There works with other organizations, you hear them, listen to other organizations and that also allows you to compare you but see you,
Let's say in what your forte
schools, because there are other schools that are entering the program and the fact of working with that school, carrying them, guiding them or
Guiding them also makes education not only resolved in adding knowledge, but also in finding experience, accompanying and
Help other institutions ”126
Regarding what was expressed in the previous appointment, in the questionnaire applied to directors, school managers were consulted
Plan about its degree of agreement with respect to two statements that referred to the incorporation of management tools and
Management of the model plans in your daily practice, as well as the consolidation of your school driving team. In
A scale that was "very disagreeing" to "very agreed", 13 of 14 managers surveyed, said they were from
agreement or very much in accordance with the statement “I have managed to incorporate management and management tools into my daily practice that
They have given me in driving network meetings. ”
Affirmation “Through the plan of plan we have managed to consolidate a good driving team with the pedagogical advisor and the
supervisor".
In addition to the above, directors and teachers agree that it plans has generated changes in the practices and routines of schools and
In its members. Both managers and teachers consider that the implementation of the program has allowed the development of
New teaching-learning strategies and more dynamic and collaborative work actions.
The assessment and incorporation of practices in the teaching-learning process.
In the interviews with the teachers and also from the perspective of UNICEF, the good disposition that students and teachers stands out
They have towards the program, who, according to their perspective, value the change that has occurred in the processes of
Teaching-learning:

“I think there really is something in the implementation of these processes that are new to teachers, work by project such as
We propose in the model that we propose and that this practice, the first practice is not so satisfactory, because they are, obviously, when
One does something work for the first time sure he is uncomfortable, surely that, that he is uncomfortable, that he has to learn, what are there things
That they fail, but when it implements it again, there is more satisfaction on the part of the teachers and a circle begins to be assembled [...]
Positive between student adhesion, the enthusiasm that students put and teachers who are moving things. And for that
We end up seeing that teachers are very much that things changed, in a positive sense, right? That they feel greater satisfaction in
what they lead to the classroom because it has a greater reception. ”127
Teachers highlight the incorporation of project -based learning, as well as the connection between planning guidelines
With those of the new format schools, as elements that favor the continuity of the guidelines.
On the other hand, it is perceived that even when the formative evaluation has been valued, it has failed to articulate properly with the
requirements to ‘put note’ or qualify student learning, which threatens her harmonic integration into the
evaluation practices.
“[…] Still a little in that aspect, for example, we continue, in the case of evaluations, we continue to put numbers, for example,
When we work training and qualification evaluation, to say in a way, it would have to be more conceptual. So yes
We have to put an 8, 9 or 10. Then, the work is double, I do not complain about work, but it would be there, this ... leave that form
on the other that would have to be more, I do not know if it is very good, or achieved, more qualitative. ”128
In the questionnaires applied to teachers and students in schools and the control group, they were consulted regarding the
Frequency with which certain pedagogical practices perform, building an index of classroom practices related to the pedagogical model
of plans in the subjects of language and mathematics129 to compare the results in both groups. In all cases, the index
generated assumes values from 1 to 4, where 4 represents the highest frequency of these practices according to the report of teachers or
students. The hypothesis underlying this comparison is that greater values would be expected for schools plans that for
Reference schools, since this pedagogical model with them has been intended and worked.
The report that teachers make regarding their own language practices is more positive than that of students both in
Schools plans as in the group of reference schools. While no differences are observed between the perception they have
Teachers about their own practices between both groups, there are among students, who report a slight greater
Presence of practices related to the pedagogical plan of plans in these schools than in the schools of the control group. Indeed, al
Compare the results of the questionnaires to teachers in both groups, for the index of practices related to plans in language130, no
Statistically significant differences are identified (the index shows an average result of 3.2 for school teachers
Plans and 3.15 for those of the control group). In the case of students, the group plans obtained a value of 2.53, while the
Control Group The value was 2.49. This difference between students of the control group and the plan is statistically significant,
although very small size. Now, when comparing the average index of teachers plans with students, it is
Note that the former expressed a greater incorporation of pedagogical practices than the latter. This difference between
Teachers and students plan is statistically significant and of a relevant size.
Regarding the subject of mathematics, plan students report a slight more frequency of practices related to the model
pedagogical than those of the control group, since its index 131 average was 2.34, while students of the reference group
They averaged 2.3. It is observed, in this case, a statistically significant difference in favor of schools plans, although

129 In the case of mathematics, only the index of the Student Questionnaire is reported, since that of teachers did not achieve reliability
adequate to be carried with synthetic value.
130 In the case of the scale in teachers, this scale had a 0.79 (Cronbach Alpha) and, in the case of students, in the case of students, in the case of students, in the case of students,
It had an index of 0.95 (Cronbach Alpha). For more details about the items included for both scales, consult Annex 10.
131 The scale obtained a 0.96 reliability. To see the detail of the items included in the construction of the scale, consult Annex 10.
65
very small size132. Of the teachers' responses, it is striking that only 38% of teachers planned
Work on your students "in group projects for several weeks." Since respondents were math teachers who
They teach the subject in basic and/or oriented cycle of schools, it was expected that this result would have been greater. Despite
Of this, this pedagogical practice is the one that reported a greater difference between teachers of mathematics of schools plans versus
Control schools. In the second group, only 4% of the teachers said it "many times", "always or almost
always".
When comparing the responses of natural and social science teachers of schools, and the control group are observed, differences are observed
For the following practices: Teach to critically evaluate the reliability of information (88% of teachers of the group plans
reports to do it frequently, unlike 76% of teachers of the control group); perform group projects for several weeks
(78% of teachers plan
control group) and evaluate learning through written tests (in this case the control group is the one to do it with more
Frequency with 90%, unlike the group plans with 81% of teachers). On the other hand, that practice they report
Perform less frequently at the global level corresponds to the performance of inquiry work outside the school (54% of the group
Plans and 52% of the control group).
In summary, the assessment of the pedagogical model of plan by teachers is a factor that favors the sustainability of the
program. With regard to classroom practices, according to the student's report, the incorporation of practices
expected pedagogical according to the model presents a slight greater frequency in schools plans than in schools in which the
Program is not yet implemented, and varies according to subject. For example, more work frequency is reported by projects in
Language that in mathematics, although in the latter case, an important difference with the schools of the control group is verified
where you hardly work on projects.
Question 2: To what extent do planning components (institutional, management and classroom)
would they be sustainable in schools after the accompaniment of UNICEF?
To answer this question, interviews with the jurisdictional profiles of the province of Tucumán and directors were analyzed
of schools that implement the program, in addition to focal groups with school teachers. The
Answers granted by teachers and managers in their respective questionnaires. For the purposes of presenting results, this
section is divided into two sections: one referred to the commitment of the actors and another on the perception of self -efficacy to continue
With the program autonomously.
Actors commitment to the program
The commitment of those responsible for the program and the authorities of the province with the program is clear and its
continuity over time, there are no doubts regarding their continuity. Supervisors, meanwhile, although they are shown
Very compromised and enthusiastic with planning, they indicate that it would be recommended that the work with this role be done prior to the arrival
of training to schools, and request that they remain more informed than the rest of the actions to be able to perform
a more committed and better quality work. This commitment is perceived by the directors of the schools, since 12 of the 14
Directors surveyed said they agreed or very much in accordance with the statement indicating “the teams in the province
(Supervisors, central technical teams) have a strong commitment to the program plans, giving constant support for
strengthen its different lines of action. ”On the other hand, 85.6% of teachers said they agree or well in accordance with the
Affirmation “Province teams (supervisors, central technical teams) have a strong commitment to the plan plan,
giving constant support to favor the different lines of action.
Managers were also consulted on the level of commitment within their schools. All directors surveyed
(N = 14) They said they agreed or in accordance with the affirmation “The Team of Teachers of this School is located
132 This was already mentioned in the question about intermediate results of the effectiveness criteria.
66
Committed to carrying forward, planning projects in classes. Similarly, 13 of the 14 directors indicated
agree or well in accordance with the statements that referred to the level of own commitment to the model plans and the
continuity of this at school. The same goes for teachers. 91.9% of the teachers133 indicated to agree or
Very much in accordance with the affirmation “The school management team is committed to carrying forward plans leading
and supporting teachers. ”In addition, 87, 9% of teachers said they agre
"Strongly committed" to carry out the plan of plans in your classes. Finally, 78.7% of teachers
He said he agrees or very much in accordance with the idea of continuing the practices. From the items described above,
A commitment scale of teachers with the program134 was built. On a scale of 1 to 4, the average obtained by
Teachers was 3.10, thus being a value that accounts for a high level of commitment.
While teachers and directors express a high commitment to the program, they are also very emphatic in stating that the
Sustainability of this can only be possible if the delivery of resources and support by UNICEF is maintained. Among the directors
continuity tends to be considered, although there are a couple of directors interviewed who consider that, by a
Part, lack of training and equipment, with the consequent risk of returning to a "traditional" form of teaching.
“[...] I say that if it closes for example, they plan, and they leave you with the contents they are, I think that teachers will repeat those booklets
And they will not get out of that, that is, I think it will be repeated […] the traditional model will be repeated, that is, I still repeat and giving formulas
that do not work in this context, something that has no life, so yes or yes we need someone who is monitoring, accompanying, guiding,
guiding135 "
Teachers instead were categorical in considering the continuity of plan without support from UNICEF, which acquires
More strength in schools than teachers describe as vulnerable. In general, teachers indicate that it is necessary,
To implement correctly and give continuity to the pedagogical model of plan, resolve aspects of resources such as:
connectivity that supports the work, technological equipment considering the real enrollment, having printed booklets for all
The projects, including the oriented cycle. All of the above to be able to carry out the projects correctly. In addition to it
Previous, teachers report a situation of lack of training of novel teachers. It is remarkable that however, in these
Cases are the teachers themselves who pointed out that they have been responsible for accompanying and training these
teachers in the model.
Perception of self -efficacy of the actors
As for the qualitative data obtained in the interviews and focus groups, a first aspect that was investigated corresponds to the
Perception of self -efficacy or installation of technical capacities in management teams and teachers. Both managers and
Teachers agree that project -based learning constitutes a methodology that they believe capable of sustaining
time, to the extent that they have gained experience in their implementation. Almost all the directors surveyed
They have a high assessment of the competition that their teachers have to continue applying the plan plan136, which is
consisting of qualitative information collected through interviews. Their appreciation regarding the degree of preparation and
autonomy they feel to move forward with the management model falls a bit137 as well as their assessment of the capacities that
They have managed to develop the teachers of the computer workshops138.
On the other hand, 70% of the teachers who responded to the questionnaires feel confident and comfortable with the methodology of
program projects. This percentage increases before the statement indicating that training has given them the tools
133 N = 174
134 In Annex 10 you can see the reagents that formed the index and other characteristics of this. This scale presented a 0.85 reliability index, so being
A reliable scale to measure this aspect.
135 Interview with Director, School 1.
136 92.9% claimed to be "agree" or "very agree."
137 71.4% claimed to be "agree" or "very agree" that they could continue managing the actions of planning, even without the support of

138 71.4% claimed to be "agree" or "very agree" that their teachers have received enough training to achieve learning
expected in the computer workshop.
67
necessary to be able to implement the projects (75%). Finally, it is also highlighted that 75% of teachers
respondents feel able to design new projects for their discipline139. In global, then it can be said that there is a
High perception of competition to develop the learning model based on planning projects. In addition to the above,
The teachers were consulted about their perception of self -efficacy and incorporation of pedagogical practices of the model.
In relation to this, 88.5%140 pointed to agree or in accordance with the statement that referred to the fact that teachers say
With the capacities and knowledge to continue applying the program. Next to this, the same percentage of teachers
He claimed to agree or agree with the statement “I feel that the work per project (ABP) and the formative evaluation I have
incorporated as part of my usual way of work. ”In addition, 87.3% of the teachers surveyed claimed to be
Agreement or in accordance with feeling able to get your students with more difficulties to learn.
In short, the results of the questionnaires account for a high perception of their own capacities to implement
Autonomous mode project -based learning and training evaluation. However, this confidence in one's abilities
In relation to the pedagogical practices of the model it contrasts with the level of implementation reported, with the level of understanding
on the formative evaluation model and with the quality implementation quality variable that was observed (see efficiency section).
Question 3: To what extent is the program plans scalable to other schools in the province of
Tucumán and/or other provinces?
This evaluation question was addressed from the interviews with jurisdictional profiles, also complementing with the
Interviews with directors and teacher focus groups. First, it is interesting to emphasize that, as reported by these
Actors, there are practices of plan schools that have radiated to other schools. Provincial actors highlight that,
In other schools, teachers and managers have been interested and have been able to use program materials. Additionally,
Directors and teachers stressed that this irradiation also manifests itself in the use that teachers perform from the methodology of
Plan other subjects not previously considered in the program, as well as in the use of the material plans in subjects
not considered in the initial guidelines of the program or other institutions in which teachers who have been trained
They plan teaching. Finally, ties between schools for joint activities have been generated. This phenomenon of
Irradiation is due to unplanned or systematic actions and spontaneous practices that were gestated within the framework of the
Interactions between the schools of the province and among teachers. It should be remembered that, in the province of Tucumán, teachers
And teachers work in more than one school.
“This has to do with this school where I am, but with another school where the director, say, is very interested with this of the
Plan […] the director of us, when this planned began insisted on us at work by project, which costs a lot,
That is, to do it between teachers […] and the truth is that he is very motivated, I have seen that, I work on plans, but also work on another
School where the director intends this of plan […] but we cannot do it because it is a school that belongs to the national level,
Let's say, it is something else, it is not provincial […] they are interested, that they like, that they listen and tell me does such a thing, do such a thing, that I
I work in plan, then if there is, say, that interest, if I can say that I see it from the other side. ”141
This unplanned impact can constitute a facilitator for the scalability of the program, to the extent that it has already been disseminated
and made known to other schools in the province.
To climb the program systematically and planned at the institutional level, the provincial actors indicated a series of
actions necessary to achieve that:
- Keep the provincial team: from the province and from UNICEF Argentina rose as a problem of roles in the
Provincial teams based on management changes or new demands that arise from the province. In this way, according to
They reported, it was very deeply trained to profiles that were subsequently reallocated to other functions inside
139 To see the complete results, consult Annex 14.

68
of the Ministry or the Directorate of Secondary Education. This lack of continuity, certainly, constitutes a threat
important to sustainability and efficiency in program management, to the extent that acquired learning is lost
In the implementation experience.
- Expand the provincial team: along with maintaining the provincial profiles trained for planning, from the province
The need to expand human resources at the provincial level to address the PLANEA program, on
All if it is considered to expand annually the number of schools participating in the program:
“So good and if there is an intention to expand it next year to more schools, a team should have a team like
For already ..., as circuit coordinators of what is plans in itself, it is like huh may not, if it is not strengthened or lost within the group of
projects. ”142
8.5 Coherence
The coherence criteria, in accordance with the terms of reference of this evaluation, is understood as the extent to which the
program integrated in a transverse way the approach to rights, gender equality and equity between population groups; as
Also the extent to which the results and intervention strategies are consistent and complementary with other interventions.
Question 1: To what extent has the program aligned with the commitments assumed with the
Tucumán province?
In order to address this question, official documentation was reviewed by UNICEF regarding the commitments acquired
by the province, as well as documents on the execution of the program. Along with this, interviews were reviewed and analyzed
to key actors from UNICEF, jurisdictional profiles and school managers plan.
Regarding the documentation delivered by UNICEF, there are three documents that stipulate the commitments acquired both
by UNICEF Argentina as for the province of Tucumán, within the framework of the collaboration of both for the execution of the program
Plan. These documents correspond to the commitments for the years 2019, 2020 and 2022. In Annex 16 you can consult
These commitments.
Commitments acquired by UNICEF Argentina
In general terms, the commitments acquired by UNICEF Argentina refer to assuming a role of technical assistance, delivering
everything necessary (from training and strengthening of capacities to pedagogical and technological resources) so that, from the
Province, the proposal can be implemented. This is aligned with what is raised in the different design documents.
Compliance with the commitment to generate a joint coordination of the driving network is registered in the reports of
Execution of 2018, where it is reported that each session of the driving network of these years was in charge of a person of
UNICEF Argentina and another from the Secondary Education Directorate of the Ministry of Education of Tucumán143.
The difficulty of the program plans with regard to change in the teaching-learning model also explains the
Need to implement a support and cooperation strategy. The elaboration of material for the projects in each of the
subjects/areas and training activities through the teaching network are the central ways in which this materialized

Plans and (2) the training, valued by their good organization and quality and by the competences of the curricular team, which as
indicates an in charge "They are a luxury."
From the diagnosis that was made in the province and the process of joint elaboration of the theory of change, support was configured
of UNICEF Argentina to scaffold the project and contribute from the point of view of resources, such as the impression of

Other projects, etc. The actors of the province value the support they have had from UNICEF.
“Let's see, in terms of UNICEF technical assistance to the province I think it has been the driving engine, and the presence in each of the aspects,

In short, the commitments assumed by UNICEF Argentina assumes with the province are related to support for implementation and
They seek to establish a minimum floor for the proper functioning of the program. In the same way, it should be noted that, according to what
reported in the documents and by the actors of both UNICEF and the province, mostly these commitments have been
fulfilled.
Regarding the commitment of Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Education for the Execution and Rendering of the Program Funds, to the
Less from the available documents there is no report that it has been carried out.
Commitments acquired by the Ministry of Education of Tucumán
The commitments assumed by the Ministry of Education of Tucumán consist of forming the necessary human teams to
the operation of the program and ensure conditions in schools for implementation. Regarding these commitments

Question 2: To what extent is the program plans compatible or is complemented with others
interventions developed in the province at the secondary level? To what extent is it
Compatible with other UNICEF interventions in Tucumán? Is it redundant plan or
complementary (eg, regarding the objectives addressed)?
At the provincial level, some programs are currently in force in the Tucumán schools are referred, without detailing mostly
They are also implemented in schools. These are:

Although each of these programs is not addressed in the interviews, the support of programs to schools is valued, it is noted that
Each program is different, so in principle it is not perceived to interfere with each other. Plans is identified as the only one with
Actions referring to teachers in the classroom, so I would not present overlap with others.
“[…] What happens with plan is at the level, […] are changes, on the one hand, changes in management, be it organization, look otherwise resources
They are at school, make other decisions, assume other strategies. And the work of teachers, work per project occurs in the classroom
within each curricular space. On the other hand, the proposal, for example, is that it is comprehensive sexual education by teachers, tutors
or who the school determines its activities in the classroom. That is, they can perfectly coordinate the proposal to plan or can do it the tutor,
the physical education teacher or some figures such as the director who coordinates, but let's say they do not intersect negatively, but that
There are always those options to articulate. For example, there are also other proposals that are, to see, youth parliament or centers of

Students, that is an activity that is done whether or not it is planned, because it does not happen within the classroom or in class. They are in times of
the institution, but not necessarily in each class of class ”149
From the point of view of teachers, however, it is pointed out that the multiplicity of programs that have to execute in the
school, added to other school calendar events, generates an important work overload that ends
affecting the implementation times of the projects plans:
“[…] In addition to adapting the school calendar of the province, which we have a calendar of ESI, the ephemeris, school acts, projects
institutional, then that time of a project, for example, in my particular case, that I am from the beginning of plan, I could never give
The three booklets, I could never apply all the projects in a year, usually the first project, the second project and
I remain in the middle of the third ”150
Despite the above, they recognize that there are programs that favor plan, either because they provide additional resources or because
They promote greater assistance from the students, such as the “School Eaters” program, which provides breakfast, lunch
and snack for students in schools, in order to complement their feeding and improve the conditions of
Participation in the teaching-learning process. The teachers of one of the schools indicated that, where appropriate, the school counts
With this program and this has allowed increasing the assistance of its students.
Another situation in which a synergy or articulation was observed, although partially, is planned and the enia plan. From plans,
There was an attempt to articulate this policy with the program through integral advice in adolescent health. While from the
advice framed in this program are only present in three departments and capital city, in the case of schools
Plan that they do have this plan, synergy has effectively achieved.
Regarding the coordination of the different programs in schools, in the questionnaires applied to managers (n = 14) and teachers
(N = 176) They were consulted regarding their degree of identification to two “polar” statements about this coordination151. In way
General, both teachers and managers consider the normative adaptation to implement plans pertinent and sufficient. By
Another part, there are discrepancies in the vision of both actors in regards to the coordination of plans with other initiatives: in
The case of directors, consider that there is an adequate coordination of the activities of planning with that of other programs;
While teachers have a more critical vision, as the majority (over 55%) of the answers tended towards the pole
which stated that the implementation of plans, together with other initiatives, is carried out in a uncoordinated way, doubleing efforts
and overloading schools. It should be noted that the results in the teaching questionnaire are consistent with qualitative data
previously presented, in which the perception of teachers was precisely that of an overload of the school calendar
for the multiple initiatives that have to be deployed.
Question 3: To what extent are plan interventions consistent with the approach of
gender?
Although the plan plans does not explicitly propose objectives around the promotion of gender equity, in accordance
With the terms of reference of this evaluation, the program is aligned with the sustainable development objective
No. 4 of the 2030 Global Agenda, which states “to guarantee an inclusive, equitable and quality education and promote opportunities for
learning throughout life for all ”. Within the goals contemplated for this objective, it is pointed out that, from present to
2030, “gender disparities in education must be eliminated and equal access at all levels of teaching
and professional training for vulnerable people ”152.

“To guarantee the effective fulfillment of the right to education it is crucial to maintain an approach based on human rights that
include the recognition and respect of the dignity and ability of adolescents; their empowerment, citizenship and
active participation in their own lives; the promotion of healthy health, well -being and development; and a commitment to promotion,
protection and the exercise of their human rights, without discrimination. Likewise, a gender and interculturality approach must be included. ”153
Based on the above, by generally reviewing the materials generated by the PLANEA program, it is observed that these include

Vocabulary that can promote gaps or discrimination. Various activities are encouraged for heterogeneous groups and encourages the

On the other hand, through the questionnaires applied to teachers and students, some questions referred to equity were included
gender. In the case of students, they were consulted regarding their degree of agreement before a series of statements referred to
to the treatment given in school to men and women154. In general terms, students (both of the schools plan
like those of Grupo Control) they claim to agree with those statements that refer to actions that are carried out at school
to promote gender equity, such as detecting and reflecting on gender stereotypes and their impact.
Additionally, the answers to the questionnaires reveal that the students perceive that there is an equal assessment and
achievement expectations for women and men, and teaching practices to promote equitable participation of women and
men. Finally, it should be noted that no differences between schools are observed and the schools of the control group to the
regard.
Students were also consulted regarding the frequency with which their language teachers included authors women in
The readings155. In relation to this, 54% of students plan (of a N of 1,158) said that its language teachers include
authors women "many times" or "always or almost always). This percentage is similar to that of students of Grupo Control, where a

23) said that includes women authors in their classes.
95.5% of the teachers agreed (in the questionnaire) with which he plans to promote that the teachers give a deal

however, as indicated above, given the methodological limitations set forth in Chapter 6 of the present
report, these data were not conclusive nor is it possible to attribute them unequivocally to the program.157 The above must
mainly to the following:
• The structure of the data and the lack of individualized data in 2017 determined that, despite the use of the methodology
PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING, a student control group that was equivalent to the group of
treated students. Additionally, they may exist, un observed or controlled variables, explain that
treatment and control groups differ.
• The insufficient implementation time of the program and the variability of this between schools could influence that there is no
perceptible differences between the treated schools and those of the control group. According to the data collected through the
questionnaire, it was verified that the implementation varies greatly between establishments and is less than expected, than in
Some of its characteristics do not verify differences between schools plans and control according to the student report and
of teachers, and that plans is an intervention that was highly affected by the health crisis, so the extension
of the "exposure" to treatment is heterogeneous and much less than that planned (theoretically there was a
implementation of 4 years or more, of which in practice, two were extremely irregular).
In conclusion, it is considered that it was not possible to measure the impact of the program conclusively, so it is not possible to do
Causal inferences. This should be taken into account when analyzing the results presented below.
Question 1: From the beginning of the implementation of the PLANEA program (2018), what effects

In the sub-optimal trajectory variable, the simple descriptive difference between schools plans with the control group is small:

Question 2: To what extent do schools plan better learning in learning
basic and development of transferable skills in students?
As in question 1, given the limitations of the methodology used and aspects related to the
Program implementation, previously detailed, with the information available, it was not possible to detect
a causal relationship between plans and language and mathematics learning, nor in the skill
Transferable (learn to learn) from students who are subjects of the evaluated program. The results
of the exercises carried out during the evaluation are presented in Annex 6.
Question 3: To what extent have the model plans contributed to the reduction of the gaps of
Inequity linked to trajectories and learning?
In this case, sex is considered as a subgroup of interest, examining the results of women and men separately, to
Determine if there are differences by sex and that, therefore, allow us to draw separate conclusions for men and women. Is
relevant to consider that, as in question 1 and 2 of this section, the limitations of the data in this study and the impossibility

As a history, it is worth noting, gender differences were observed in the results in language and mathematics for jurisdiction in
2017 (Learn test results), indicating which gender is a variable to consider in the impact analysis. Graph 23

Next, the main conclusions are indicated based on the regression and PSM analysis, the

• As for the sub-optimal trajectory, it is systematically perceived that the women of the schools plan

If in question 1 impact it is concluded that for the total students there are no correlations, it is because the
result of women (significant) has been averaged with that of men (not significant).
• Both for repetition and overness, no statistically significant differences are perceived for any kind in
particular. Only for a method of pairing, in the case of men, more repetition is perceived for men of
Schools plans, but these results are not robust, because they are not maintained for the other specifications.
• Regarding assistance, it is found that men systematically have a lower level of assistance in schools
Plan with respect to those of the control group, a situation that is not observed for women.
• In language, we observe that women systematically obtain lower results in schools plans with respect to
Control schools. In the case of men, on the other hand, the results are not robust, because they are not met for all
specs. This suggests that the main results in question 2 of impact would be explained by those of the girls of
Schools plans.
• In mathematics, on the contrary, the results are lower for men in schools plans (and unfinished, in the case
Women's). Thus, it would be concluded that it is the performance of men in plans what would mostly explain the
Results of question 2 impact.
• No systematic and significant differences are found for men or women in transferable ability, or in their
Subscales. Only for men, in some of the specifications, there is a positive difference in favor of those who attend
To schools plans. These results are, however, little robust.
Given the above, it is not possible to conclude with respect to the contribution of plans at the close of gender gaps in the trajectories and the
Learning students who benefit from the program.
On the other hand, it was not possible to analyze the differences for ethnic or immigrants, since the sample of students that meets
These characteristics are very small (26 foreign students and 74 students belonging to ethnicities).
Question 4: Are not expected, positive or negative impacts identify, as a consequence of the
implementation of the model plans in schools?
Unlike what was previously indicated in the impact criteria, the question about the unplanned impacts of the program was
Added, mainly, from what is reported by teachers and managers. In general, by consulting them about “impacts no

Contains these are mentioned:
Collaborative work between subjects
Although collaborative work constitutes a purpose of the program, both teachers and managers related work experiences
collaborative between actors that were not part of the original design, which could be realizing the irradiation of this logic
of work. Some teachers reported that they carried out activities associated with the projects of their subjects with teachers from other
areas or subjects. An example of this was the case of a science teacher who reported how, within the framework of one of the projects
of his subject, he articulated with the language teacher to design an activity in which the students had to create
Children's stories from theories about the origin of life; This activity, according to the teacher, continued and ended with a
Visit to a kindergarten in the sector to narrate the stories to children.
Irradiation to other subjects and schools
In their stories, some teachers stated that the planning way of planning has been taken by teachers from other subjects
They are not part of plans. Similarly, teachers who work in more than one school pointed out that, in the other schools
Where they work, there is a lot of interest in incorporating aspects of the model plans in their pedagogical and management practices. In way
As an example, one of the teachers reports that she works in another school in which the project work model has been incorporated,
78
also incorporating subjects such as Arts and Music. One of the directors mentioned that a remarkable change, that
I was scheduled by the guidelines plan or by the educational establishment, it is the articulation between a primary school
and its secondary school to publicize the work methodologies of plan. This in order to promote the entry of new
students:
“[…] We are putting together the articulation with the primary school and in that articulation they go to students who are first year or second year and
They explain how they are learning, how they are studying, that is important within what the promotion is, what the institution itself is
[…] As I say at the beginning our registration was little and now we do not have registration left ”159
9. CONCLUSIONS AND SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS
The theory for the change of plan proposes that the traditional high school model fails to ensure that all and all
adolescents acquire learning and develop critical skills to exercise full citizenship, access a job
worthy and define a life project. Along these lines, the plan plan seeks to generate comprehensive intervention in the education system
of the province, in order to transform high school. The objectives of the program plan for Tucumán, according to the theory
For change, they are: (1) accompany the provincial educational efforts in the transformation of high school; (2) Promote
a regular secondary education model that forms adolescents in the knowledge, values and capabilities that it requires
the contemporary world; and (3) Promote that all Tucumán students access a secondary school of the 21st century
adapted to their needs and environment and that all finish high school formed to learn continuously.
Having the above as north, this evaluation proposed to measure the effects of the program on learning appropriation
trunks and the development of transferable skills in school students, as well as in their trajectories
School and at the same time, evaluate it in relation to its relevance, efficiency, efficiency, sustainability and coherence. To do this, for 2022
made a very complete information lifting that included documentary analysis and available databases, interviews
in depth, focal groups with teachers and students, questionnaires applied to managers, teachers and students, and observation
of classroom practices, which also meant the construction of special instruments for this purpose. The study concentrated on the 16
pioneer schools of the program in Tucumán (which entered this in 2018) and in an analogous group of 16 un treated or
control. Based on this, the main findings that the present evaluation had, in the criteria indicated, were the following:
Regarding the pertinence of plan and its design, it can be noted that it was evidence
problems and needs of secondary education in the province and the country and that its design was founded on a thorough diagnosis of
they. This results from the documentary analysis and is consistently reported by the teachers and managers of the schools and by the profiles
jurisdictionals interviewed. Likewise, the evaluation of its adaptability to adjust to the context of the province and schools,
It was also valued very positively, since there were mechanisms to receive feedback and incorporate changes
Important from this, in addition to settling on a previous experience in the province: new format schools. With
Relationship to the context of the pandemic, adaptations were implemented, among which the most valued is the impression of booklets
With the projects. Although it is conceived as an adaptable and relevant program for the context, it requires certain
minimum conditions for proper functioning, such as the timely allocation of institutional hours to teachers, a
adequate connectivity and a previous diagnosis of the entry learning levels of the students that make possible and
pertinent work with the designed projects. In this sense, to increase its relevance and also its efficiency, the program
I should have a stages implementation mechanism in which these conditions are installed first and counted
with diversified strategies according to the previous levels of learning of the students (in particular their level of reading skills
writing).

Regarding the efficacy criteria, an adequate implementation of collaborative work between teachers and managers is evident
Translated into the driving network and the teaching network, instances that are highly valued by said actors. In the same way, I know
recognizes a good level of implementation in the institutional level efforts of the program, such as technical assistance
provided by UNICEF to the province, its financial support and in resources. Although without the expected speed, progress has also been
significantly in the adaptation of regulations, in particular in the allocation of institutional hours to teachers to facilitate
Its greatest concentration in schools served by the program, which is key to its implementation. They are also verified
important advances in the implementation of the pedagogical core in classroom (project -based learning and evaluation
Formative), which is the most recognized component and valued by all actors, although the level of implementation varies between
Schools and subjects is and somewhat less than expected. Classroom observation reveals that great variability is given in the performance of
teachers, as well as a heterogeneity in the way of understanding and applying the training evaluation model, which usually
to understand as attention to attitudinal learning at the expense of curricular. Finally, a
Difficulty in the implementation of some components referring to trajectory monitoring (for example, the counselor
Student), which is closely related to the lack of hours of teaching permanence in schools to carry it out.
Regarding the facilitators and hinders of the plan implementation, the fact that schools are recognized as a facilitator
selected were previously format schools, as well as the leadership exerted by the management teams and the
high level of commitment that teachers and managers have with the materialization of changes. Among the hinders,
He highlighted the pandemic, which deeply affected the program both in 2020 and 2021, despite the actions implemented and
The efforts made by the program to overcome the enormous difficulties that this period meant. Collaborative work between
Students is a consubstantial part of the pedagogical model of plan and this was prevented during this stage, connectivity is
interrupted due to the need to cover other economic urgencies in the province, and there were relevant components such as
Learning workshops, which simply could not be executed.
Regarding the intermediate results that the program seeks to promote, the report of students and teachers of
Schools plans and those of the control group regarding the sense of belonging of the students, their motivation, the expectations and
concern of teachers for their well -being and trajectories, the climate of coexistence in schools, and the presence of certain
Pedagogical practices. The hypothesis was that, since these are aspects in which the program deliberately search, it is
They expected higher indicators on planned than in the other schools. Regarding these intermediate results, they were not observed
Statistically significant differences between schools plans and reference schools. It is interesting to note that the presence of
pedagogical practices related to the plan of plan are the exception, for which the students of these schools report levels
slightly higher.
Regarding the efficiency criteria, monitoring and monitoring mechanisms that UNICEF promoted, and that represent a
advance to precautionary the good use of human and material resources, such as territorial teams deployed in the province and
Execution reports prepared by UNICEF every year. It is necessary to point out that reports are concentrated in management and
coverage (for example, assistance to the instances of managers and teachers or number of projects addressed in the year) and in the
assessment that the program elements have, without deepening even in the way in which the
plan components (for example, the quality of classroom pedagogical practices or learning evaluations of
students). On the other hand, in terms of efficient use of resources, some improvement areas are identified, such as: optimizing
Training schedules (so that teachers do not lose school hours), manage a system to protect security
and maintenance of technological resources, avoid the rotation of personnel of the province that supports the implementation of the program and
Formalize the impression of booklets with projects as a permanent practice.
Regarding the sustainability of the program, the high commitment and valuation that all actors report as positive
involved in plan (provincial team, directors and teachers). Adhesion to plan is undoubtedly an element that contributes to the
Continuity of the process of transformation of practices and their sustainability over time. In general, appreciation predominates
that the program can be sustainable over time; However, to consider future scalability in the province, the actors
They raise as a condition the maintenance and expansion of the equipment at all levels, as well as technical support and
UNICEF financial. Since planning is proposed as a new high school model and not as a program
80
Focalized, the universalization of this requires carefully studying the size and feasibility of these requirements,
especially those of time concentration of teachers in all secondary schools. On the other hand, the design of the
Program escalation requires, as indicated for the relevance criteria, considering successive stages of
implementation, starting with an initial phase that includes a diagnosis of each school and the level of learning of its
students, the training of networks and installation of base conditions (institutional hours and connectivity), following with a
stage of familiarization with the projects and implementation of them, to culminate with a monitoring and feedback of the
Classroom implementation quality that is complemented with increasing degrees of autonomy.
With regard to the coherence of the program, the degree of fulfillment of the commitments acquired between UNICEF was analyzed
Argentina and the province. The level of compliance with the initial commitments acquired between the province and UNICEF Argentina was in
appropriate general, despite the difficulties that were given during their execution. For example, although UNICEF fulfilled
with providing schools with computational equipment, and the province adapted their regulations regarding institutional hours,
A proper connectivity of the equipment has not been achieved, theirfts have been reported, and the rhythm of implementation of the
Teachers' time concentration has been less expedited than it was needed.
Coordination with other policies and initiatives from UNICEF and the Province was also reviewed. Upon entering Tucumán, plans
He anchored in a previous policy implemented, the schools of a new format, which clearly favored their relevance for the
context and also reflected his willingness to be consistent and synergy with other programs and policies in the province. From the point
In view of teachers, however, schools and they themselves are compelled to respond to multiple initiatives, programs and
activities of both provincial and national level, which are perceived as uncoordinated and compete for their time and interfere
With teaching. All of the above in the context of teachers who do not work exclusively in a school. This results
especially critical considering that he plans is a program that requires dedication from teachers to train and requires
Continuity in direct work with students to carry out the projects.
In relation to the incorporation of a gender approach to plans, although the program has no specifically designed actions
In this line, it is inserted within a general framework as UNICEF and all its policies and programs are concordance with a
Rights approach with emphasis on inclusion and educational equity. In this context, and based on the reviewed information and
Raised within the framework of the evaluation, it was observed that the program materials are consistent with the promotion of a
Gender approach, where, for example, women authors are systematically incorporated. Additionally, students
(both plans and control group schools) They claim to agree with those statements that refer to actions
that are carried out at school to promote gender equity, such as detecting and reflecting on the stereotypes of
gender and its impact; They point out that their language teachers include women “many times” or “always or almost always” and
They perceive that there is equal assessment and expectations of achievement for women and men, as well as teaching practices to promote
an equitable participation by gender.
Finally, in terms of impact criteria, the results obtained from the learning tests in reading and mathematics, thus
As the analysis of students' trajectories do not allow to conclude with respect to this criterion or make causal powers
About the program. Controlling for various observable factors, school students plan
equivalents of the transferable ability "learn to learn" and lower levels of learning in language and mathematics
compared to the control schools considered. Regarding trajectories in most of the variables evaluated
They find significant differences, except for the level of assistance. Finally, conclusive results are not observed
Regarding the relationship between plan and gender gaps, because different results are found under different
specs. However, it is necessary to point out that the exercises carried out faced various methodological limitations that
They advise caution to interpret them (see detail in Annex 7), in particular because the expected balance between the sample was not achieved
Treaty and the Control Group. These limitations must be considered when interpreting the statistical exercises carried out and when taking
decisions based on these results.
Depending on the objectives of the evaluation and based on what is raised in the theory of change, at the level of final results in
Troncal learning and transferable skills of students, an impact of the program on these cannot be concluded. Yeah
81
It is well recognized an important advance of the program in promoting changes in secondary schools that have the
Program, there are difficulties in the implementation and efficiency of use of resources that have affected their operation. Indeed,
It should be taken into consideration that the exhibition of the schools studied to the program is far from having been the theoretical one (four
or five years), because it is a program that promotes changes at different levels, which have had different rhythms of
implementation. In addition, the pandemic introduced a significant interruption, so exposure to the program even in this group
of precursor schools could be described as initial, since according to the information collected in this study, it is dissimilar between
establishments and has not yet achieved the levels to which it is aspired according to its original design.
Likewise, it should be considered that even a program faithfully implemented according to its design presents challenges during
its early years, especially if it includes a transformation into different levels such as plans, from the
managers, going through teaching practices and ending in students' behavior, it is expected that the results
are verified in more extensive deadlines. Considering such an initial period of implementation, and interrupted during
practically two years, it is also highly likely that the different involved have not yet overcome what has been described
Long as the fall in performance (Fullan, 2005), which usually happens when an innovation is being initiated that
It requires displaying new skills as clearly is the case of planning.
10. Lessons learned
From the global plan of planning in Tucumán some learning arise that can be generalizable to the context of schools
Secondary of Argentina, to generate improvements aimed at having inclusive schools, capable of generating learning
significant to students and concerned about their trajectories, which are the central features to which the
program. Some of these lessons are:
1. Acierto of a systemic model implemented collaboratively. The plan design is an intervention
On a large scale, where the classroom is not only transformed, but also the operation of the school and the way of understanding
Components such as management leadership. Along with this, for its proper implementation, it also required the generation of
Changes at the level of provincial policy in aspects such as the work days of teachers. Regardless
of the speed and difficulties that were reported around these changes, the remarkable thing about the model plans is that it assumes that,
To generate a transformation that can be sustainable over time, it must imply a change in the structure and
operation of different levels.
If what is sought through a program is the transformation of an institution such as Argentine high school,
It is necessary to generate the conditions for all system actors to appropriate the changes that are sought and work
at their respective levels (province, school and classroom) to promote and sustain said transformation. This is only possible through
of the establishment of collaboration networks. In line with the previous lesson, a characteristic that the program plans is
that its implementation, adaptations and development was made in permanent dialogue between UNICEF Argentina and the province of
Tucumán This dialogic and collaboration relationship was what allowed, for example, the implementation of actions at the level of the
Provincial policy as was the allocation of institutional hours to teachers.
2. The emphasis on the formation of capacities at all levels of the system. A strength that the program plans is the
Training and training of teams at different levels: provincial, school-management and teachers, which facilitates the
Progressive deepening of the understanding of the program model and the eventual expansion of it.
3. TEACHER PERMANENCE HOUSES IN SCHOOLS. Achieving a greater time concentration of teachers is a factor
facilitator for greater continuity and depth in the teaching and learning processes, and to facilitate spaces of
collaboration and coordination between them as well as a greater sense of belonging to the school community. In this sense,
A program that includes structural changes in school, and an improvement of learning conditions, must
82
have the hours of permanence of the teachers in them, while analyzing the sufficiency of institutional hours
that are contemplated160.
For future evaluations of the Methodologically, it is recommended to perform complementary analysis using the data
collected in the tests and in questionnaires through the National Tests (Learn) of 2022 that allow to use instruments
Comparable with 2017. It is key, in this case, to have individualized data at student level (with an identifier variable
that allows to follow them over time) and that facilitate the proper selection of samples of control students if you want a design
quasi experimental as the one used in this study. For being learning a census evaluation, this would allow multiple
Sample options comparable with the 16 driving schools and include other entrance cohorts to the program after 2018
If so wanted. It would also be recommended that in the provinces in which the implementation of the program is being initiated,
Lift a baseline to make possible an evaluation in which a longitudinal follow -up of the students is carried out
After years of intervention. Likewise, it is suggested to conserve the richness of the multiple sources of information used in this
Study, which included evaluation of learning results, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, classroom observation,
Documentary analysis and productions of the students, since the combination of them allows to visualize completely and very
deep the processes involved.
11. Recommendations
In order to implement improvements in the design and implementation of the program, a set of
recommendations, which were nourished from the meeting held between the evaluation team, UNICEF Argentina and the province of
Tucumán, in order to validate them and specify them.
Recommendations aimed at UNICEF Argentina
• Sustain the systemic plan of planning intervention that covers from the provincial management to the classroom, through the
Management teams of schools and support provided to students in them.
• Hold and strengthen the collaborative work model as a strategy for strengthening capacities in all
program intervention levels.
• Explicitly incorporate into the design of the program the sequence of its implementation stages in its different
levels and components. The systemic design of the program plans and the way this seeks to generate changes in
The different system components. However, from the analysis of the implementation of the program, the incorporation
of simultaneous changes at all levels is complex. Since plans to contemplate components whose
Implementation depends on the development of others that are not fast or easy to specify, it is recommended that its design
Incorporate a sequential model. This implies, on the one hand, to identify the dependency relationships between the different
components and thus, establish a structure by stages that allow to ensure the necessary conditions for the
Implementation of components that require others and, especially, evaluate the relevance of interventions
Pedagogical designed in the case of schools with students whose levels of previous learning are very precarious. HE
proposes to consider a diagnostic stage by school as a starting point that contemplates the learning of the
Students in order to detect students with low levels of literacy (see recommendation to the province). Along with
The diagnosis, in this initial phase it could be advanced by forming the networks, and installing the basic conditions (for example,
the allocation of institutional hours). In the following stages the program would be deployed in schools with their different
components to complete with a phase of greater autonomy of schools and teachers' networks, for
160 Even in primary education, in Argentina there is a greater proportion of teachers who work in more than one school than in most countries
of the region where this is a very exceptional situation, which reinforces the need to advance in this condition of teaching in the country (UNESCO; 2023).
83
that the province can concentrate greater resources and efforts in the schools that are entering. A sequential model
of this nature also favors the sustainability of the program. This recommendation should consider that development
of a diagnosis must be agreed and developed together with the teams of the province, both in relation to the definition
of indicators that structure the diagnosis as in its elaboration, in addition to linking it with a strategy of
monitoring and monitoring of implementation and results.
• Sustain technical assistance to advance more quickly in the policy of expansion of the hours of permanence of
Teachers and managers in schools. This is extremely relevant as a greater time concentration of the
teachers allows to give greater continuity and depth in the teaching and learning processes, in addition to facilitating
Collaboration and coordination spaces between teachers. Finally, all this impacts on achieving greater sense
of teachers belonging to the school community.
• Maintain support at the disposal of pedagogical resources for the classroom in schools plans prioritized in the program
of cooperation, contemplating the need for adaptation of them (or of generation of material and activities
complementary) to host the diversity of levels of learning within the classrooms and entity, especially for
Schools with students presenting important lags.
• Strengthen in the design of the program the strategies that reinforce the accompaniment to the teachers in the
Implementation of the pedagogical nucleus, in addition to the existing training in the teaching network. The importance
granted by the program to the teaching and learning processes, to their evaluation, and to the design of materials of
quality to support them is one of their strengths and distinctive characteristics of plan, which is generally valued and recognized
For the actors. However, from the observation of first -year classroom classroom, together with the report given by students
and teachers in focal groups, it is found that there is an important variability in the way of understanding work
for projects and training evaluation, as well as in teaching performance when implementing them. Some
possible actions in this line are:
✓ Generate guidelines for the observation and feedback of classroom practices that can perform the
provincial teams, supervisors, managers, or teachers themselves,
✓ Design spaces for the modeling of classroom practices that can be included in training,
✓ Provide illustrations or work models that represent the expected performance of students in the
projects, among others,
✓ In view of plan expansion in the province, a training space linked to the
General continuous teacher training and influence initial training,
✓ Differentiate the contents and strategies used in the training and meetings of teachers according to the
their experience with the program, from an introductory course to stages of greater deepening that
The students' work are analyzed together, classroom practices are rehearsed or model or organized
classroom observation instances.
• Strengthen the learning evaluation model. An aspect that caught attention from qualitative data (both
of conversational devices such as classroom observation and records of learning evaluations carried out
by teachers), it is the way in which the training evaluation is being conceived, since it tends to understand how
A way to reduce demands. The latter contains the risk of promoting low expectations. While it was observed that
is implementing continuous monitoring of the work that students develop and a lower presence of the
traditional tests, evaluation is focused on assessing the completeness of tasks and attitudinal aspects (such as
effort and teamwork), invisible the curricular learning that projects seek to promote in each
student. Teachers express the need to have orientations for the individual qualification of the
Students from this model in which group work prevails. Consequently, it is recommended to strengthen the model
of formative evaluation and its articulation with the individual summative evaluation:
✓ Strengthen the training strategies of teachers and managers linked to training evaluation.
✓ Strengthen the development of student feedback instances.
84
✓ Through the materials for teachers, guidelines related to learning evaluation are completed
curricular clarifying (a) how to connect the formative evaluation and the qualification, (b) the level of
Performance that is expected of students in their productions through examples categorized in accordance
With the rubrics, and (c) it is oriented with respect to how to evaluate and qualify individual performance in the context of the
group work It is also recommended to review the evaluation and rubrics activities of the projects to
ensure their coherence and thus offer better orientations to teachers when evaluating and feedback
learning. Finally, it is also recommended that in the training and meetings of the Teacher Network
Analyze student work using the rubrics, to calibrate the level of teachers' expectations
Regarding the performance of your students.
Recommendations addressed to the province of Tucumán
• Implement a diagnostic system of the learning and identification of gaps in the schools in which it plans
implements161. One of the most outstanding difficulties by teachers and observed in classroom is the distance between the level of
learning that some or most of their students present and the one that is required as the basis to take advantage of
properly the opportunities offered by projects. In many cases important gaps were observed in the
comprehensive reading skills, which is a significant obstacle for minimally autonomous learning, no
only for the planology methodology but for any pedagogical model. It is recommended in this regard:
✓ Implement a system to evaluate this elementary competition, identifying in a timely manner
Students who have developed it insufficiently developed at high school (through an instrument
simple applicable by the teachers themselves), and implement systematic actions that allow to overcome this
important difficulty162. Likewise, this can contribute to the initial diagnosis to be carried out in the schools that enter
By plans (see recommendation to UNICEF) to align the actions to be developed in schools in which it is
necessary reinforce comprehensive reading.
✓ The same is essential in mathematics, especially considering the increase in the proportion of
students below the satisfactory level in the last measurement (2022), which in Tucumán reached 88% in this
Subject in 5th and 6th Secondary163.
• Review the monitoring and monitoring system of the implementation, especially the pedagogical nucleus. One aspect that
It rose in the efficiency criteria is the nature of the data collected from the monitoring system of the
implementation. Although in the execution reports, information regarding coverage and percentage of
Implementation of the components, it is necessary to complement it with an appreciation on the way in which these are
They are executing, especially project -based learning and training evaluation. In that line, it is suggested to generate
A review of the criteria for information lifting, incorporating the monitoring of how it is developing
The pedagogical core in classroom. In that line, according to the organization chart of the province, a possibility is that
Pedagogical advisors are responsible for lifting information referring to classroom practices, while
supervisors are responsible, rather, for the information lifting referring to aspects of infrastructure, resources and
management. This, in order to nurture the system of all the relevant information and to the teachers of timely feedback.
To do this, it is also recommended that the provincial teams that have formed and specialized in Plana and its model
pedagogical are stayed in their functions, so as not to miss their training or have to form new
professionals who replace them.
Likewise, and in coordination with UNICEF, it is recommended to establish a work model in the Teachers and
managers, which consider successive training stages for teachers of schools that are incorporated. A
First stage can summon teachers before their schools are incorporated to plan, to introduce them to the program.
161 Ideally also at the entrance of all high school schools, and early also in primary schools to act in a timely manner.
162 In the same way, since this is a failure that is crawling from primary education, it is recommended that this same diagnosis to identify children that do not
They have acquired the expected level in their reading skills is carried out in 3rd or 4th grade.
163 https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/2023/06/aprender_nivel_secundaria_2022_-_tucuman.pptx_.pdf
85
In a second stage it is possible to work familiar with teachers with the projects and monitoring later
so that they can resolve together the difficulties they have faced in their implementation. Then in a third
stage, it is possible to deepen the quality of the management of pedagogical interactions in classroom through exercises
practical, capsules or videos or sharing practices and criteria for learning evaluation.
• Avoid the rotation of the already trained technical and professional teams that accompany the schools, plan,
and in this way ensure the efficiency in execution and thus protect the investment that the province has made forming them and
specializing them.
• Promote the explicit articulation between the evaluation model that promotes plans with the qualification model
summative. Since the plan plan proposes a formative evaluation model, it is recommended to harmonize the system
of program evaluation with the existing qualification system in the province. This, in order to identify possible
aspects, both of the provincial policy and of the design of the program, that should be modified and, thereby generate
Clear guidelines on evaluation for teachers that allow to certify and account for the learning achieved to
Individual level.
• Sustain and accelerate advances in the policy of time concentration of teachers to ensure greater permanence of
teachers and managers in schools. One of the central aspects of the plan plan is collaborative work and
Sustainment of the educational trajectories of students from a more active and present role of teachers and managers.
Along these lines, it is a program whose components require greater permanence of teachers and managers
In schools, so it is suggested to the province to insist on its strategy to advance the expansion of concentration
Teachers' hour to strengthen their roots and involvement with school.
• Ensure a more efficient management of activities with teachers from schools in the process of transformation and training
that protects the time for students learning. A difficulty reported by teachers saves
Relationship with the saturation of calendar activities and the demands of multiple projects that remain school time
In classroom. Some teachers suggest, for example, to concentrate training in a period in which teachers do not
are doing classes according to calendar, so as not to subtract time in the classroom. It is recommended that the organization of the calendar
school contemplates these activities, they are coordinated, prioritized and filtering, privileging the time that teachers have of
classroom exercise.
• Strengthen the monitoring core of school trajectories ensuring the spaces and schedules for him or the teacher
that fulfills this function can perform it in a good way; This means that the student counselor/ATE can count
With non -teaching hours for your work. It may be advisable to favor work in a pedagogical pair between the preceptor and
The ATE.
Recommendations aimed at school management teams
• Maintain participation in driving networks, and in the case of schools that take longer, use them as a
Space to generate solutions collectively.
• Review and strengthen the educational trajectory monitoring core. Given the important focus that you have to improve
the trajectories of the students, and their participation in the school, the greatest absence observed in schools plans
that in those of the control group and the report of the difficulties in the implementation of the role of the student counselor, it is
It recommends deepening the current way in which schools monitor their students' educational trajectories.
✓ It is recommended to accompany the role of the student counselor to achieve articulation of this figure in the ATE
(Teacher for accompaniment to school trajectories) that exists in schools, to the extent that it is the figure
that he should closely observe the trajectories of his students. This implies, on the one hand, that
institutionally (in the province) it is sought to ensure a greater number of hours available for that teacher
that exerts the role, so that you can address all the functions that the program assigns.
86
✓ It is necessary to implement more general measures that transcend the role of the student counselor. For example,
The absence of students should trigger specific actions, such as establishing immediate contact with
They or their families, and have strategies to adequately return to project dynamics,
that require continuity and teamwork.
• Strengthen the model of accompaniment and feedback to teachers inside the school. In the same line
of the recommendations made to UNICEF Argentina and the province of Tucumán in relation to the deepening of the
Attention to the pedagogical nucleus, it is recommended that the management teams integrate in their schools oriented actions
Monitor, accompany and feed back the classroom work of the teachers. Management rubrics for equipment
driving can be constituted in tools for this purpose, as well as conducting meetings for feedback to
Department Heads and Teachers. In this sense, it is important to have the necessary time space. Promote the
Planning of specific instances that favor the training of learning communities among teachers who can
feed each other with respect to the pedagogical practices implemented in the classroom, or share more
everyday their strategies, or together with their doubts regarding the evaluations, would allow to identify good
practices and also alerts that nourish the system and allow to generate timely actions in order to support teachers
in the implementation of project -based learning.
