Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the propitiation and strengthening of safe and relevant learning environments
Econometrics Consultores - November 2023
Executive summary
Honduras is a country that in the last decade has had an upward trend at its poverty levels, which went from 67.1%
In 2018 to 73.6% in 2021, and a deepening of extreme poverty of 42.9% to 53.7% of the population1, this situation has
been aggravated by climatic factors (tropical storms), Covid-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which
They have resulted in a 9% contraction of the economy2. In this context, an increase in violence has been generated,
migration and forced displacement, which has had repercussions on education and protection of girls, boys and
adolescents (NNA), generating problems in terms of access, permanence, low levels of learning and development
of competences, as well as in high exposure to the risk of violence and abuse, especially in the most vulnerable groups.
According to statistics from the Consular and Migration Observatory of Honduras for 2018-2022 of the total number of people returned
16.5% were NNA, who are in a greater situation of vulnerability associated with school abandonment and violence, with greater
Impact on adolescents of 13-17 years3. School abandonment is also associated with violence factors; According to a
2018 study of the University Observatory of National and International Education - Oudeni4, 23.9% of girls
and 14.0% of children aged 13 to 17 declare having left school due to acts of physical violence, and 21.2% as
consequence of an act of sexual violence.
The closure of educational centers and the low capacity for the delivery of educational services through virtual modalities
For 2020 and 2021 for tropical storms and pandemic, the educational crisis deepened, and reversed years of progress in
The country's coverage and quality, expanding inequality and increasing vulnerability. Lack of access to
Technology and the Internet, as well as the lack of training of teachers in remote methods, contributed to this
Problem5.
Educational efficiency and quality also present problems. The repetition rate in basic education increased by 2020
In all educational cycles, and with regard to educational performance, an average drop of 39% in the
Mathematics performance in several degrees in 2021 compared to the 2017 to 20196.
The educational infrastructure also presents challenges. In 2022 80.9% of the educational centers were in conditions
precarious, needing urgent interventions; In addition, access to drinking water and health services is limited in many of
them7.
In this context, UNICEF made a mid-term review of its 2017-2021 cooperation cycle in 2019 that led to
a reorientation of the inclusive education component towards the promotion of security in the school environment, which is
materialized through Canadian and Korean cooperation in two projects that introduced the work approach to environments
of safe and relevant learning: "Inclusive and safe education for girls in Honduras" financed by the agency of
International Cooperation of Korea (KOICA) and "Protective Learning and Crying Environments" funded by the Government
from Canada and implemented in the northern triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). Both projects, in line with the
UNICEF Country Program, were based on human rights approaches, gender and resilience.
The projects focus on NNA with a particular approach to women and adolescents women (Koica focused on ages
between 6 and 17 years, while planet between the ages of 10 and 19), as well as in teachers, officials and educational committees
as guarantors of rights, through the implementation of flexible learning modalities already contemplated in the
Regulations of the National Education System (SNE), the prevention and mitigation of violence against children in the
schools and communities that surround them, and the preparation for risk management and adaptation to climate change in
educational centers. According to the reports of the planet and Koica projects, it was covered with different
Activities a total of 55,684 NNA; According to data from the Educational Centers Administration System (SACE), agree
To the total registration of the schools intervened in 2022, a total of 126,993 NNA benefited. On the other hand, he got involved
A total of 5,254 teachers and caregivers in the activities of each project and 25 COMDE.
Both projects began in 2019 with a similar execution period (until the end of 2022 that of Koica and until March 2023
and extended at no additional cost until September of the same year), and were implemented in a complementary way

Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the propitiation and strengthening of safe and relevant learning environments
Econometrics Consultores - November 2023
In 39 municipalities with high levels of vulnerability8 in the departments of: Lempira, thank God (covered by Koica),
Atl√°ntida, Cort√©s, Yoro (covered by Plane), Cop√°n, Francisco Moraz√°n, Intibuc√° and Santa Barbara (covered by both
projects). The Koica project had a total budget of USD $ 4,703,847.00 and the USD planet $ 5,883,333.30.
Given the complementarity in its objectives and implementation, for the development of the evaluation a theory of the
Integrated TDC), in which it was identified that: i) If NNA, especially the most vulnerable, are safe and protected
in gender -sensitive environments, free of all forms of violence, abandonment and abuse or their threat; i) if they get
valuable knowledge and skills for decent life and work through flexible learning opportunities,
relevant and quality; and iii) if the educational system is strengthened to improve resilience in a learning environment
ecological, violence for NNA and the risks due to health and hygiene conditions and effects are reduced by effects and for effects
adverse climate change; Then NNA will enter the school in a timely manner, they will remain in it, they will end the
primary and secondary education and will obtain better learning results, which will be appropriate to their potential for
development.
‚Ä¢ Purpose, objective and scope of the evaluation
In 2023 the UNICEF Honduras country (OP) office hired Econometrics S.A. The evaluation of your contribution to
Propiciation of safe and relevant learning environments that have had the ‚Äúinclusive and safe education projects
For girls in Honduras ‚Äù(financed by Koica) and‚Äú Protective learning and parenting environments: bring girls to new
Heights ‚Äù(financed by the Government of Canada -Plane).
The evaluation, which covers an analysis period from 2019 to 2022, corresponding to the years of implementation of the projects,
It is the first of the UNICEF Honduras evaluations plan for the country program (PP) 2022-2026; And, being
a mainly formative evaluation, is the purpose of learning, identification of achievements and mechanisms of
Sustainability, and the documentation of good practices in order to provide the OP of evidence to mobilize new resources
and give continuity to work in the field of safe learning spaces for NNA.
The main hearing of this report is the OP of Honduras as input for accountability to donors, define
Mechanisms for sustainability of achievements, manage resources and contribute to the design of strategies of the PP 2022-2026. Equal
way, the report seeks to be useful for the cooperation of Korea and Canada as a tool for accountability
about the use of its resources in the country. A third audience of the document is the government of Honduras as guarantor of
Rights, who gives relevant information to make decisions and manage resources from the education sector to
Continue and expand strategies aimed at guaranteeing access, permanence, learning and protection at the NNA school,
and in particular of girls and adolescents women.
‚Ä¢ Design and Methodology
The methodology implemented for evaluation, which focused on demonstrating the results in the relevance criteria,
coherence, efficacy, efficiency and sustainability, had an approach to mixed methods in which
primary qualitative information in four municipalities of Honduras (2 of Koica, 1 of Plane and 1 of Koica and
Planet simultaneously) with suitable informants linked to the design and operation of the projects, with adolescents
beneficiaries and with fathers, mothers and caregivers9. Secondary quantitative information related to the
Indicators of the projects and with educational indicators from the country from the SACE, from which they were made
Comparations for means between trends of educational centers intervened and not intervened, in order to have a
Approach to differences in their achievements in terms of registration, dropout and repetition, which is far from an analysis of
impact that would have allowed to determine the attribution of projects to changes in the treated population.
The evaluation strategy for this research involved four major components: i) The starting point was a
Conceptual evaluation through the reconstruction of the integrated TDC, ii) the in -depth understanding of the framework of the
evaluation through the evaluation matrix, iii) the design and implementation of the methodology of mixed methods, and iv) the
Evaluation in the light of the processes and results having as a framework the criteria to be analyzed.
The main limitation faced in the evaluation was the imbalance in quality, quantity and depth of the information
documentary quantitative for both projects, in particular the restrictions of municipal disaggregation and by variables such as
Ethnicity, migration or vulnerability, which led to the need to cover void information with interviews. I also know

In the execution of the evaluation, special observance of equity and gender equality and human rights was kept
In the design, collection and analysis, and the United Nations ethical guidelines contained in the ‚ÄúEthical Guidelines were followed
For evaluation ‚Äù10. The review of compliance with these standards was in charge of an ad hoc ethics committee that is governed
for the Institutional Ethics Committee (CEI) Protocol of Economy of 2017.
The technical monitoring and accompaniment to the evaluation was made by the UNICEF op in Honduras, who was
accompanied by an advisory group (GC) made up of representatives of government institutions and actors of the
Civil society linked to projects.
‚Ä¢ Findings and conclusions of the evaluation
Relevance. Depending on the needs identified in the field of access, quality and permanence in the education of NNA,
Koica and Plane projects designed and implemented several actions in search of minimizing the risks for NNA and
Strengthen educational centers as safe and protective spaces. When working in contexts of poverty and precariousness,
projects contemplated in their design the delivery of school materials and supplies so as not to limit vulnerable NNA media
of accessing education; They focused on training processes to the entire educational community in management aspects
of stress and socio-emotional, which took great relevance in the context of COVID-19 and climatic emergencies, and designed
Actions aimed at empowering girls and adolescents strengthening their image and role in the community, in their families
and at school.
While the design of the projects was specific in the consideration of gender equality needs, they identified themselves
Opportunities for improvement in the ethnic approach since there was no clear evidence that the design was given in the design
to the needs of the indigenous population and Honduran Afro with specific and transversal guidelines to all partners
Implementers
The ability of the projects to adapt to the emergency contexts generated by the COVID-19 and the
tropical storms in the face of the latent need for connectivity to virtuality, guaranteeing the access of subjects of
Right to education in times of pandemic and climate emergency. In addition, in addition to providing devices
electronic to guarantee connectivity and deliver materials (such as learning guides for Spanish leveling,
Certillas for educational bridges, support cards, backpacks with notebooks, pencils, colors), processes of processes were carried out
Training of teachers who focused on providing them with emotional and methodological tools that would allow leveling
in emotional emergency and stress management in time of pandemic or crisis.
The alternative modalities that were designed, adapted or replicated in the projects were very relevant to eliminate
Learning barriers in vulnerable groups, which is derived from the fact that a diagnosis was made for each partner
Implementator in municipalities and educational centers to intervene through independent measurement tests of
Learning (mine) from the first to sixth grade for each student. This facilitated the adaptation of intervention to realities
Of each context, which was complemented with an asset involvement of the educational community and families.
Transversely, the alternative and flexible modalities of the projects addressed gender issues in search of breaking
stereotypes, and it was sought that girls remain in schools and end their education, and participation was strengthened
of girls and adolescents in decision -making spaces, promoting equal participation.
In relation to the relevance criteria, the results allow us to conclude that: i) the design of the projects was adequate and
took into account the application of diagnostic tools that ensured the suitability of methodologies and actions
implemented for each context; ii) Koica and Plane projects had the ability to adapt to needs
of the changing context despite not being emergency projects, minimizing the risks for NNA produced by
the confinement and closure of schools; iii) alternative and flexible modalities have adapted to the particular context of
Each educational center helping the elimination of learning and gender barriers.
Coherence. UNICEF's contribution through projects shows external coherence with the reality of Honduras
and with international and national standards, as well as with other state and civil society initiatives with which
manages to coordinate. The projects show internal coherence in two aspects: i) both seek the same purposes,
regardless of whether the sources of financing are different; and ii) there is a clear link between resilience approaches
and development, stronger in climate change than in violence.
The complementarity between the two projects occurred in aspects such as the targeting of the municipalities and the centers
educational, the use of materials and protocols endorsed by the Ministry of Education, the use of common methodologies and the type
of focused population. While complementarity with other initiatives occurred through work with partners

a successful coordination work of UNICEF with the different actors (of government and civil society) and initiatives in the
approach to the two projects to favor coherence.
The project resilience approach was included in depth in climate change matters, and more generally
In relation to gender violence. While the projects did not modify their development perspective, they achieved, in terms
practical, work resilience through spaces for participation, training and institutional support for SEDUC for its
Incorporation in curricular tools. In gender violence, however, the emotional one was worked to face
crisis situations, but a greater depth intervention associated with capacities development is not revealed
socio -emotional and relational that impact the daily life of the NNA.
In relation to this criterion of coherence, the results allow us to conclude that: i) the contribution of UNICEF through
Koica and Plane projects have coherence with international and national standards and national standards; ii) the
objectives and results of both projects are complementary in themselves, and seek to close the gaps and contribute to the mandates or
approaches to international standards and national regulations; iii) projects take advantage of the experience of
partners and the development of the initiatives found in the country and in the territories; iv) the approaches and actions of
The projects seek the strengthening of capacities to face crisis situations and not only actions that mitigate them,
Therefore, connection between development and humanitarian action is evident.
Effectiveness. The efficacy results were analyzed from two approaches: the first since the analysis of compliance with
the proposed indicators for each project from secondary information and primary qualitative evidence; and the
second, with the results derived from the analysis of the information of the SACE for the registration, dropout and
Repetition of the schools and municipalities where the intervention of UNICEF was carried out through the Koica and
Planet for periods 2018 and 2022. These two approaches have different results in relation to efficacy
of the projects; However, it is important to clarify that the results based on the information of the SACE cannot
attributed to UNICEF to the extent that it does not correspond to an impact assessment.
From the first approximation (analysis of compliance with the indicators and qualitative information) there is evidence of the
Achievement of the results of the projects in the educational institutions where we worked by complying with more of the
80% of activities in terms of expanding NNA access to safe, protective and relevant spaces of
learning. These activities contemplated the adaptation of infrastructure, training to the different actors and the
Strengthening of capacities nationwide. The above was ratified with the evidence found in the field with the
which was evidence
Promote safe spaces and meet the needs of the NNA to avoid VBG, respond to basic needs of
sanitation and hygiene in educational institutions and access flexible learning opportunities.
From the second approach (average difference analysis with SACE data) for the aggregate of the 39 municipalities
where the projects were implemented, it was found that there was a registration drop between 2018 and 2022 given the
Emergency context discussed in the report. However, the intervened educational centers presented a fall in the
registration considerably lower in 13.1 percentage points (P.P.) compared to in the rest of the educational centers
not intervened from the same municipalities. Comparing the repetition rate, this was superior at 0.4 p.p. to the group of
educational centers not intervened in these municipalities, but when examining disaggregation for the size of schools, the rate
of repetition tended to increase less in the educational centers intervened compared to those not intervened when the
Registration by center was of more than 20 students in terms of the drop -out rate, it was reduced both in schools
intervened as not intervened, this reduction being lower in those intervened by 0.2p.p. Now, when doing
The analysis differentiated by the projects, in the educational centers intervened by KOICA there are an increase in the
Average registration, unlike the rest of centers that showed a reduction. However, these results must
contemplate considering that the municipalities and educational centers selected by the projects were the most
vulnerable, and therefore, there is no valid backward group to make comparisons that allow isolating and
Determine the own effect of UNICEF's intervention from Koica and Plane projects. In general in the
country has observed an increase in dropout due to the high insecurity indices, according to data from the Social Forum of the
External debt and development of Honduras (FOSDEH) 7 out of 10 families are found in the poverty line, carrying this
to child labor and large migratory caravans, which have repercussions on dropout, while the increase in the
Repetition may be explained by the attempt to avoid student dropout in a context with many adversities, in
where the prioritization was to retain the NNA in the educational system.

Another element that was considered within the efficiency criteria was the project management and monitoring system, the
which was partially adequate to assess the contribution made by UNICEF. While the system was simple, he centralized
evidence and had clear indicators disaggregated by interest groups, indicators on educational performance and
perception of well -being or safe environments of the beneficiaries, there were some information gaps during implementation
and no personnel with specific monitoring role in the technical teams of the projects were not counted, which made it difficult
The monitoring and decision -making.
In relation to the efficiency criteria, the results allow us to conclude that: i) human and financial resources allowed
move towards the goals for both NNA, and those specific by gender and for some vulnerable groups, and
ii) The management and monitoring system presented weaknesses and indicators with voids of information or discontinuities during
the execution of the projects that hindered the monitoring for decision making and the timely evaluation.
Sustainability. Sustainability could be associated with the development of the capacity of the educational system to redefine your
Regulatory and evidence -based management framework, in this regard, the results show that the regulatory framework was strengthened

materials and other flexible methodologies aimed at improving access and quality of education.
At the municipality level, it was identified that planning tools were developed for the operation of shares,

made with girls and adolescents women to empower them; and having implemented learning and methodologies that
Teachers perceive as useful.
In relation to sustainability, the results allow us to conclude that: i) the improvement of SNE capacities was achieved in
different levels; i) having done a participatory and arranged process with the SEDUC was essential to guarantee the
alignment and commitment of departmental and municipal instances; iii) spaces for participation and learning were given
in different stages of the projects that contributed to the appropriation of the actions by the educational community.
‚Ä¢ Recommendations
The results found allowed the following seven recommendations that were validated and prioritized in

INTRODUCTION
This document presents the draft of the contribution evaluation report that the projects of
"Inclusive and safe education for girls in Honduras", financed by the International Cooperation Agency of
Korea (Koica), and ‚ÄúLearning and Creying Protective Environments‚Äù (Plane), implemented
At the subregional level by El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras and financed by the Government of Canada, of the Education Area
by UNICEF Honduras to the propitiation of safe and relevant learning environments.
The evaluation, which covers an analysis period from 2019 to 2022 corresponding to the years of implementation of the
projects, is the first of the UNICEF Honduras Evaluation Plan for the 2022-
2026; and, being a formative evaluation, the purpose of learning, the identification of achievements and mechanisms of
sustainability and documentation of good practices, in order to provide the country with evidence to mobilize
new resources to continue the work in the field of safe learning spaces for girls, boys and
teenagers.
The report is structured in seven chapters, according to the structure defined in the terms of reference and the
geros standards. In the first chapter, the background of the evaluation object is presented based on the context

BACKGROUND
1.1 Context
Honduras is a nation with young population (24 years on average), in full productive age. The illiteracy rate
It is 12.0% while the average schooling is 7.6 years of study. The workforce reaches 4 million

In the decade between 2010 and 2020 there has been an upward trend in poverty levels in the country, which went from 67.1%
In 2018 to 73.6% in 2021, with a deepening of extreme poverty of 42.9% to 53.7% of the population (EPHPM-
INE, 2018-2022). In addition to internal structural problems, this situation is highly influenced by the

To this context is added the phenomenon of violence that invades the lives of many Honduran families and communities,
with direct effect on migration and forced displacement of people. This affects the educational problem in

In relation to the right to protection in the educational environment, according to a 2018 observatory study
University of National and International Education - Oudeni referenced in the terms of reference (TDR),
23.9% of girls and 14.0% of boys from 13 to 17 years declare having left school due to acts of violence

Implementation of this new orientation was achieved thanks to the Canadian and Korean cooperation, through two
projects that made it possible to fulfill the purposes and the focus of the aforementioned country program of
UNICEF, since they were in tune with those raised by the two cooperators. These projects were:
‚Ä¢ Inclusive and safe education for girls in Honduras. Financed by the International Cooperation Agency of Korea
(Koica).
‚Ä¢ Protective learning and parenting environments: (Planet, by name in English). Financed by the government of

Similarly, within the set of regulations to operationalize the LFE, it stands out as important for

In the case of the Koica project, the municipalities that served at least three of the following were selected
criteria of vulnerability and in which UNICEF had work experience: low levels of human development,
multidimensional poverty (child), violence (homicide rate), ethnicity (% population of indigenous and
Afrohondure√±os) and environmental vulnerability (% of the threatened area) (UNICEF and Koica, 2019). For its part the project
Plane prioritized vulnerable geographical areas with municipalities affected by violence and migration, both rural and

In relation to the subjects of rights with whom they work, there are similarities and differences. The similarity is
on the emphasis on the attention of women and adolescents women; However, in Koica the goal is focused on ages
Between 6 and 17 years for being concentrated in school -age population, while on the planet it is between 10 and 19 years
for their focus on adolescents more vulnerable to violence in communities and at school. On the other hand, both
projects also attend children and adolescents men, although to a lesser extent, and consider the training of
teachers and advice of municipal education, school and parents, as guarantors of rights that must be
strengthened. Each project establishes goals that complement each other, since they act in different municipalities,
which adds to the contribution to change. The specific beneficiaries are shown in the following table:

gender in evaluations. Econometrics hosted such guidelines and therefore, throughout the evaluation process
They included differential indicators of gender, equity and inclusion, and human rights, which allowed identifying

It should be borne in mind that Koica and Plane projects have a gender approach in themselves, materialized
In several lines of work: violence against girls, menstrual health, educational inclusion. This approach permeates
Evaluative questions, and specifically have two direct questions about the TDRs about it: Question 1.2. and the
Question 3.2. Additionally, for 12 of the 19 evaluation questions the consulting team raised and used a scale to the
Trial formation measure as can be seen in Figure 3.1 and in detail in Annex 3 (evaluation matrix).
Now, the information raised or collected was triangulated taking into account the differential sensitivity scale
adapted from WHO (2011) and PMA (2020) (see Figure 3.1 below). The evaluation was also sensitive to
gender and group difference according to the possibilities of forming the sample in the surveys
of qualitative information that took place.

Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the propitiation and strengthening of safe and relevant learning environments
Econometrics Consultores - November 2023
3.3 Methodology
The evaluation strategy for this research involves four major components, as presented in the
following figure. The starting point was a conceptual evaluation or the conception and design of the projects by
medium of the establishment of the joint TDC of the actions of both projects through which UNICEF
It helps to promote or strengthen safe and relevant learning environments.
Figure 3.2 - Component of the General Evaluation Strategy
Source: Econometrics, 2023
The second component of the strategy was the in -depth understanding of the evaluation framework, with a view to
achieve the general objective and specific objectives; The evaluation strategy is based on the evaluation matrix (see
Annex 3). As can be seen, in that matrix, each research question was associated with its evaluation criteria, the
Specific objective to which it supports, the associated indicators and collection methods, relationship with the TDC25, a
relevance marking of the differential analysis by gender or group26, the sources and the collection methods and the
Typology of consulted actors. As part of this stage, and in line with the standards of the evaluation group of the
United Nations (UNEG, 2020) An evaluation analysis (EA) (see Annex 12) was performed in order to identify the
availability and voids of information that could affect or hinder the evaluation of the criteria defined in
The TDR, the adaptations derived from this analysis that was presented in the initial report, are summarized in the following
chart:

TDC since the logical model of the two projects does not have the same level of development, and only plan had an explicit TDC,
It was necessary to make a joint reconstruction of the same in order to have an evaluation framework defined.
Indicators and although there was a framework of results in which there were indicators, it was found that they had incomplete information,
Some systems did not have baseline, with periods of periods or had had changes in the unit of measure, which
monitoring and made it impossible to make a historical analysis of advances. Given this situation, the results achievement of results were chosen
Verification of reported in the latest version of the annual reports.
Results Programmatic visit reports do not provide information that allows standardized monitoring of advances, so
It was necessary in the design of the evaluation to analyze some indicators of the effectiveness criteria from qualitative information,
primary and documentary.
The information of the SACE is not complete for all years of analysis, so it was necessary to omit information from the year 2020
In the analysis since there was no information that allowed to replace this lack. Therefore, the use of records was chosen
ADMINISTRATIVES OF THE SACE, including information from 2019 and 2022; Additionally, the analysis of results was complemented with
Descriptive documentary information of the projects of the projects.
It was not possible to make analysis related to academic achievement since it did not have access to sedu information
related to academic performance, so it was necessary to address this result from the perception of the actors
Interviewees
In the indicators there is no information that allows identifying results by other variables associated with equity such as:
ethnic (indigenous population and honduran Afro), nor for migrant girls and boys, so it was not possible to analyze these
disaggregations in the evaluation and it was necessary to investigate from qualitative information about the closure of gaps to the population
vulnerable

The third component of the evaluation to identify UNICEF's contribution to propitiate or strengthen safe environments
and relevant learning through the projects corresponded to the design and implementation of the methodology of
mixed methods, in which the positivist character of the quantitative with the interpretive dimension of the
qualitative (Robson, 2002). For this evaluation, documentary review techniques, lifting of
qualitative information and secondary quantitative data analysis whose results were subject to triangulation as

It is necessary to mention that this investigation was mainly carried out in person and went to a form
hybrid combining to a lesser extent remote methods27 in cases where agendas and availability of
Informants demanded it. This allowed to make the collection processes more efficient, adjusting to the measure of
The needs or possibilities of each type of informant.
Finally, in the fourth and last component, the evaluation was carried out with the general TDC and applying techniques
of processes and results evaluation (DNP, 2012). As previously mentioned, the TDC was considered to give
Answer to each evaluative question. The way in which it was proposed to be used and effectively used is detailed and
adapted to each evaluation question in the evaluation matrix (Annex 3).
3.3.1 Documentation review
As a source of information for the development of the evaluation, an in -depth documentation review was carried out
which allowed the consulting team to know the details of the projects, their social, legal and administrative context, between
others. This knowledge cemented the basis for the conceptual evaluation that included the update of the TDC and the
Construction of a robust theoretical framework for evaluation, and gave way to the application of more evaluation techniques
precise in order to generate key information for conclusions and recommendations. Within the review

reviewed by the consulting team.
A total of 154 documents organized in 11 folders were received. A first catalog was made in which
They ruled out some documents that were duplicate, as also prioritized the annual reports on
The semiannual and quarterly, since in the annual reports the totality of the information is found. They were eliminated
From the analysis of this evaluation, the geros documents since they do not contain information from the KOICA and
Planet. Subsequently, the documents helped answer some of the questions of
evaluation and some documents were linked to specific evaluation questions and others were appointed as
cross -sectional documents.
3.3.2 Qualitative information lifting
The evaluation collected qualitative information from UNICEF officials, officials of the central and municipal government
and implementing partners; as well as mothers, fathers and caregivers and adolescents subject to rights. For
This, the techniques of: (i) individual semi -structured interview were applied, (ii) group semi -structured group, (III)
Focal Group and (IV) Digital Ethnography with support in social networks. This was done as indicated in the following table

The list of people to interview was prepared and made with UNICEF based on a mapping of main actors (see
Annex 5). The identification and selection of each person for interviewing in these groups was defined from the importance
of its function and experience developed in the projects. Territorial coverage and the
access to certain areas, in order to ensure that various types of actors that could account

It was relevant to contact, therefore, this interview was not conducted, reducing the application number of
individual exercises. Finally, 2 focal groups and 2 group interviews were planned (internal equipment of the
organizations) with the implementing partners, but to schedule a space in which the teams of the different
Implementing partners had availability was complicated, therefore, as a mitigation measure they were made
Interviews with those teams that could not specify a common agenda, increasing the number of interviews and
maintaining the number of focal groups.
‚û¢ Sampling of different collection techniques
7 interviews were conducted, between group and individual, within the UNICEF team with the areas and groups
related that were directly involved in the execution of the projects. This, according to information obtained
in exploratory interviews and the actors map created jointly between the consulting team and UNICEF, in

Intentive sampling for the selection of municipalities for information collection was carried out, in line with
the technical proposal delivered by economic in response to the request for proposals indicated that
They would select 4 municipalities for field work, with the main criteria the geographical location.
Additionally, other criteria were added to make intentional sampling that allowed heterogeneity and diversity
in the data collected; Thus, a municipality was selected where planet intervened only, two municipalities in
which intervened Koica in a differentiated way and included the only municipality in which the two intervened
projects; It was taken into account in the selection that one of these municipalities will have a large presence of the population with
Ethnic membership of the Lenca people, it was also sought to include rural and urban municipalities. Another criterion that was
in account when making the sampling of the municipalities was the number of beneficiary educational centers of the
projects. These selection criteria of the municipalities had the objective of investigating how pertinent, coherent,
Effective, efficient and sustainable was the execution of projects in these contexts, as well as their flexibility capacity
In adverse situations such as natural disasters, especially considering that the evaluation has as

28 It is relevant to mention that the main difference between group interviews and focal groups is the dynamics that occur in the interaction since with the interviews it is
Look for people to talk to the interviewer and answer a series of questions in a timely manner, while in the focal group you want a greater
interaction between people attending activity around a specific topic (Escobar & Bonilla-Jimenez, 2017):

In each of the municipalities that were selected a focal group was held with local actors, including
Representatives of the municipal government, the Secretariats of Education and Health, and other actors part of the COMDE.
Additionally, in the same municipalities, focal groups were carried out with directors and teachers of the municipalities
selected. Also, there was support from educational institutions to contact mothers, fathers and caregivers
that will participate in focal groups; In these exercises, an additional selection criterion was sought
gender, in which the participation of minimum 1 man (father) was achieved in each of the 4 focal groups.
Two digital ethnographies were performed through WhatsApp, one for each of the projects, in order to lift
adolescent information29. The ethnographies were performed using virtual strategies, thanks to which it was achieved
reach a greater number of adolescents and cover a greater number of municipalities; for which he contacted the
Implementing partners requesting contact information from young people who participated in the activities
developed by them in the different municipalities. There was a 70% participation of women and 30% of
men, since, although the projects focused on girls and adolescents women, boys were not excluded and
Men adolescents, as indicated in the design and monitoring documents of the projects.
Regarding the management or permits to access the suitable informants, different mechanisms were worked. For the
Municipal authorities The call and authorization of participation was managed through the COMDE; for
teachers and mothers, fathers and caregivers made the call through the directors of the educational centers, who
They were the suitable links to establish the required links to guarantee their participation. As for the
Adolescents The management was done thanks to the databases sent by the implementing partners.
‚û¢ Information collection instruments
Econometrics designed to the measure of collection from the evaluation matrix and the methodology
described. Such instruments are attached in Annex 6, which contains: (i) Interview with UNICEF officials, (II)
Interview with Central Government officials, (iii) focal group for implementing partners, (IV) Focal Group for
managers and teachers of educational centers, (v) focal group for parents, mothers or caregivers of beneficiaries and (VI)
Instrument for digital ethnographies to adolescents.
Given the ethics guidelines in this evaluation, which are described below, they were also requested
Informed consent for semi -structured interviews and focal groups (see Annex 7), and a
Informed assent in the case of digital ethnographies to adolescents (see Annex 7).
‚û¢ Qualitative analysis process
As indicated above, similar to documentary analysis, qualitative information was addressed from the
Coding, that is, your organization through categories or codes (Packer, 2014). For the analysis of the analysis
of the information collected through interviews, focal groups and digital ethnography was performed in form
Previous coding based on the questions included in each of the instruments, which in turn respond to the
Evaluation questions according to the alignment derived from the evaluation matrix. In it, the
actors and the evaluation questions were linked to the information collection techniques, this being the reference
main for the analysis and coding of qualitative information. Additionally, as shown in the matrix of
evaluation, it was sought to use the secondary information available of quantitative order, in such a way that
When such information contributed to answer evaluative questions it was arranged for analysis. Later

qualitative to determine convergences and divergences between the two methods. To do this, in the evaluation matrix
specified which evaluative questions will be perceived each source (see Annex 43).
‚û¢ Main sources of information
An exploratory analysis of the different administrative records was carried out, as well as available secondary information
Of the different sources of the State, of the sources of information, it was found that the surveys contain information
Until 2019, these mainly departmental or national data being. Since the study determines a
2019 to 2022 reference period, this information was used to contextualize the country indicators until the last year
Survey reference (2019), although it did not allow inferences at the municipal level. On the other hand, the
Administrative records SACE, present information from the years 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022, with levels of
Disaggregation by municipality and sex. This allowed a comparative registration, repetition and dropout analysis
for the municipalities and reference periods of the study. Likewise, the project progress reports allowed
build a database of 57 project indicators (27 for Koica and 30 for Plane); However, in the
EA found that this database has voids of information that can be observed in the following table:

3.3.4 triangulation
Taking into account the execution time, the scope and availability of secondary quantitative information, it was applied
a concurrent triangulation design, in which the quantitative and qualitative method was applied and analyzed
Independent and simultaneous form, and the results were compared to assess their convergences or divergences. This
It allowed to compensate biases, ensure credibility and validity of the findings, as well as verify the quality of the data.
The triangulation had as a fundamental tool the evaluation matrix (see Annex 3), which incorporated each
Evaluation component, linking sources and methods by evaluation questions. Evaluation design
It was based on triangulation, in such a way that it is reflected in the design of the instruments, the sampling of actors
consulted, and the selection and prioritization of secondary information. In this way it was assured that the sources
"They talk" to each other. Then, to the extent that the documentary review was made and the collection continued to verify the
intersection of sources, and in the analysis the different opinions and qualitative perceptions of the various
Sources, with quantitative data generating the greatest possible evidence. A key element here was the methodology
To establish the evaluation trial with which the elements were triangulated.

3.5 Ethical considerations
This evaluation was carried out following the United Nations ethical guidelines contained in the ‚ÄúEthical Guidelines for
Evaluation ‚Äù(UNEG, 2020), in which four principles are defined that must be integrated into evaluations and the
Evidence generation which are aligned with human rights and with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda:
Respect, integrity, accountability and charity. These principles are specified in the UNICEF procedure
to guarantee the inclusion of ethical standards in research, evaluation, information collection and
Analysis (UNICEF, 2021). Additionally, and since information collection was made directly to adolescents,
The guidelines and guidelines defined in the document ‚ÄúEthical Research with
Children ‚Äù(Graham A. P., 2013).
Specifically within the process related to damage and benefits of the standards, and in order to act under the
Principle of action without damage in this evaluation was guaranteed:
1. That participants, informants of organizations and government entities, both nationally and local,
mothers, fathers and caregivers, directors and teachers, and adolescents had knowledge of the objective of the
evaluation and use that would be given to information.
2. That the people selected for the evaluation, which were referred to in the previous numeral, agreed
with participating in it through informed consent and in the case of adolescents, having consent
Parents, mothers or caregivers and assent of adolescents.
3. That the collection instruments will be designed in a way that minimized the stress of the participants.
4. That the ‚Äúprivacy and confidentiality of the participants through anonymized data at the individual level, or through results
summarized to the proper level of disaggregation, particularly in those cases of clear negative impacts such as stigmatization and
retaliation ‚Äù, so the databases and systematization that are delivered to UNICEF do not contain data that

Socioeconomic ‚Ä¢ Lower human development index: 3 out of 5 children live in multidimensional poverty; and 1 out of 4 in severe poverty
RI.1 and RI.3 (UNICEF and KOICA, 2019).
‚Ä¢ Honduras has the highest level of economic inequality in Latin America. Inequalities are more notorious in
Rural areas, where multidimensional poverty affects 73.9 % of children with 39.1 % in urban areas. (UNICEF and
Koica, 2019).
‚Ä¢ Adolescents aged 12 to 17 face higher levels and intensity of poverty (UNICEF and Koica, 2019).
The implementing partners and officials of UNICEF interviewed mention economic gaps, conditions of
vulnerability, child malnutrition, existence of remote areas to which the State or institutions do not reach and lack
Electricity and Internet or cellular signal, especially in rural areas.
Migration ‚Ä¢ High migration indices: 174,000 internal displaced (based on an exercise in producing 2014) (GAC and
RI.2 UNICEF, 2019); Net migration rate (2015-2020) (GAC and UNICEF, 2019).
‚Ä¢ Records collected in the RECEPTION CENTERS OF RETURNED MIGRANTS, In November 2018 an increase was observed
of 41.4 % compared to 2017. of the 67,913 12.6 % were children and adolescents (UNICEF and Koica, 2019).
‚Ä¢ The main causes of irregular migration among children are economic difficulties, family reunification and
violence or insecurity (UNICEF and Koica, 2019).
A few interviewees, partners and officials of UNICEF indicate that migration is produced by economic situations
for violence or by insecurity and this constitutes one of the main reasons for school dropout.
Education ‚Ä¢ The coverage of the education system is low for preschool and secondary. In 2018, it was 33.4%, 48.7% in high school
RI.3 Basic and 29.9% in secondary education (UNICEF and Koica, 2019).
‚Ä¢ High illiteracy rates and secondary school dropout of girls in rural and remote areas and indigenous communities

Koica, 2019).
‚Ä¢ The 27.7 of young people do not have education, employment or training (Ninis) (GAC and UNICEF, 2019)
The interviewees of the partners, of UNICEF and the SEDUC, indicate access and permanence gaps for situations of
Vulnerability, since schools are missing or are in poor condition. Some indicate that this is greater for NNA in
Disability condition, indigenous communities and Afros, and the rural sector. It is also pointed out that in rural areas the
teachers are less trained.
They point out that education is little relevant and quality, that there are learning lags, learning problems

RI.1 and RI.3 ‚Ä¢ THE METHODOLOGY 'healthy and healthy home' developed by the National Autonomous Aqueducts and
Sewers (Sanaa), in collaboration with UNICEF, lacks a chapter dedicated to menstrual hygiene management,
same as the National Plan for Drinking Water and Sanitation (UNICEF and Koica, 2019)
Different interviewees allude to the problem water, sanitation and hygiene affecting girls more. This situation worsened
with pandemic and hurricanes.
Interviewees of the Ministry of Education and UNICEF, say there is a high degree of school dropout caused by the
adult ignorance about the menstrual cycle and the lack of safety of girls in schools when they have the
menstruation. Up to 43% of girls in indigenous areas, and 20% nationwide do not go to school during their
menstruation (interview, UNICEF, 2023).
Violence ‚Ä¢ In recent years, Honduras has been among countries with the highest homicide rates in the world among countries
RI.1 and RI.2 Formally at peace (UNICEF and KOICA, 2019)
‚Ä¢ Gangs in poor urban areas control the territory and in rural areas by drug traffickers (GAC and UNICEF,

Relationship with access to materials and digitality. All this forced the reprogramming of the projects.
Source: Economy elaboration based on project documents and interviews.
Therefore, depending on these needs, the Koica and Plane projects designed and implemented several actions
in search of minimizing risks and strengthening educational centers as safe and protective spaces. For which,
They focused on carrying out training processes to the entire educational community (mothers, fathers, caregivers, teachers and
students), addressing issues such as the prevention of gender violence, denunciation protocols, implementation of
Alternative and flexible methodologies, Wash initiatives and psycho -emotional support tools, among other topics
approached. This allows evidence that designs considered the main needs of the country in order to generate
and strengthen safe and protective spaces to enhance quality learning (indicator of the evaluation matrix).
The capacity that projects to adapt to the emergency contexts generated is highlighted in this result
for the COVID-19 and the hurricanes. In gender, the design was specific in the consideration of the needs of
gender equality, and in terms of vulnerable population the design was general in the consideration of the needs of
equality of vulnerable populations since there is no clear evidence in the design that the needs of
The indigenous population and Honduran Afro with specific and transversal guidelines to all implementing partners.
In the teacher training processes they focused on providing them with emotional and methodological tools that
They will allow the leveling of emotional emergency and the management of stress in time of pandemic or crisis, which is
valued by people consulted as useful and relevant given the context that was being lived by pandemic
by Covid-19. Students and APF were also trained in search of solving the challenges left in education
Pandemia On the other hand, they supported the student governments in search of NNA to participate in the taking of
decisions in their communities.
Some of the designed actions that sought to reduce school dropout and/or absenteeism, were delivery
of materials, not only of the GANE guides (learning guides for the leveling of Spanish), educational bridges and
Support cards, but also backpacks with notebooks, pencils, colors, among others. This, looking to correct the
absence of resources from many families, especially from rural areas, which was increased with confinement
caused by the COVID-19, responding in a pertinent way to the impediment of having the appropriate means
to access a quality education, which constitutes a determining factor in school dropout. It's worth it
highlight the recurrence of the mention in the focal groups carried out in the municipalities on the delivery of materials and
How these were very important for the leveling and reduction of school lag that was presented as a gap

quality.
Additionally, from the perspective of equity and inclusion, when asked about particular inequities of
indigenous and ethnic communities that were addressed in the projects, it was reported that from the design it was a key point and
very important for UNICEF in order to ‚Äú‚Ä¶ see how we can influence so that the native peoples have
A space within our homeland, our territories that are so necessary ‚Äù(Interview, UNICEF, 2023), intentionality that
It is also evidenced in the documentary analysis. However, this contrasts with the information provided by other actors
for whom the ethnic approach was under the will of the implementing partners who could determine if
He approached a certain community in a geographical area following criteria such as non -intervention of others
organizations, which shows that the ethnic approach was not a component that materialized in the execution.
On the other hand, it is evident that the design of the projects was more flexible by seeking NNA leveling that they were affected by their
education due to pandemic, which in some of the cases not only did not advance, but had setbacks and
They forgot what they learned. Therefore, both Koica and Plane, despite not being initially planned
including the response approach to an emergency, they could adapt responding in an ideal and timely manner to
A crisis situation that increased inequality and lag in terms of education:
‚ÄúHere the pandemic practically lasted three years and there were children who had a year of lag two years and even up to three years
complete. So, that was another of the priorities we face and fortunately with pedagogical strategies of different
[Centers] educational, which is inclusive and relevant in this case, which allowed us to identify and link this population again
with your most immediate schools. " (Interview, Implementing Partners, 2023)
Another identified aspect has been the empowerment of women and adolescents women in search of promoting the
self -care, accepting as they are, as evidenced by the following testimony: ‚ÄúNot only the girl has been empowered
to know each other, to be estimated, to value themselves, but also their peers ‚Äù(Focal Group, Municipal Authorities, 2023).
Empowerment was also evidenced in strengthening them in participation in decision -making spaces;
in the propitiation of open spaces to deal with menstrual health and hygiene and providing educational centers
of health modules, generating safe spaces for them. Faced with this last point, trainings were carried out
for the elaboration of artisanal hygienic towels in order to provide options for a dignified menstruation.
Another need that was addressed in the projects was the technological gap that was visible by the pandemic, and in front of the
which acted with two methodologies. First, in cases that will have no equipment that will facilitate the connection
Virtual, teachers and electronic recharges were provided to access the Internet, and in the case they will not count

The TDC for both projects raises the main challenge in terms of the limitations experienced by NNA for
access education and the main barriers that produce this situation: from the demand and the educational supply of

As supported by the results presented below, the alternative modalities of the projects were
Very relevant to eliminate learning barriers in vulnerable groups. This achievement in relevance is derived from the fact
that a diagnosis was made for each implementing partner in the municipalities and educational centers to intervene, the
which offered ‚Äúinformation on social conflict and a mapping of organizations with experience in education and work with adolescents

the purpose of classifying and being able to apply a certain level of the guides, or determine what type of card should be
worked by each girl or boy, as evidenced in the qualitative information collected with the municipal authorities
and what was found in Childfund's progress reports. These diagnoses allowed to adapt the modalities
alternatives and flexible to the needs of each girl or boy.
The adaptations of the alternative and flexible modalities were carried out in different forms. In the case of guides

learning under a non -mandatory format that allows the teachers themselves to be able to put into practice the

adaptations were relevant to eliminate learning barriers, especially in rural areas, but not in a form

Both projects, both Koica and Plane, had to adapt to the challenges raised by the pandemic of

Dissemination of educational contents through television and radio chains in areas that did not have access to the Internet;
In areas that if donations of tablets and balance recharges were made, and supported
on digital platforms such as Meet, Zoom, WhatsApp and Instagram; as well as the adaptation of the contents to the format

Evaluation of UNICEF's contribution to the propitiation and strengthening of safe and relevant learning environments
Econometrics Consultores - November 2023
Some interviewees, mainly UNICEF officials establish a clear relationship between resilience and
development by explaining that the projects were not emergency, although they clarify that ‚Äúin countries like Honduras, interconnection
Between the humanitarian and development component are always present ‚Äù(Interview, UNICEF, 2023). This relationship makes

And that is what I think Koica and Plane did contribute to develop "[... because" an important emphasis was to strengthen the mechanisms
Protection community ‚Äù(Interview, UNICEF, 2023).
However, the people consulted agree that, by the COVID-19 and the Hurricanes ETA and Iota, the projects are
carried out in an emergency context, which forced their flexibility in terms of content, tools
and actions, as analyzed in the relevance section, in order to continue with the process of developing
capacities, but also forced emergency care and psychosocial support with greater emphasis on
original approach, in order to ‚Äúgenerate spaces for the construction of that resilience, of that strength of boys, girls and
Teachers to face situations, to be able to face and be able to continue ‚Äù(Interview, UNICEF, 2023).
In this regard, in the initial approach of the documents this support seems to be centered to refer more to a
mitigation intervention in times of crisis because there is talk of first aid in mental health, management of the
stress and psychosocial recovery for affectation of COVID-19 and derivation to the child protection system. In both
Final reports of the projects The mention of the subject refers to the psychosocial and mental health support aimed at well -being
Integral in Education (GAC and UNICEF, 2023) or training in mental health and psycho -emotional support in new
safe and friendly spaces of educational centers, or derivation to the child protection system, without being very
explicit if they are oriented to the coping of the particular emergency or the development of emotional capacities and
Relationships
It is clear, however, that the projects did not have a mitigation orientation, but that they made adaptations
in the face of emergency, with a clear orientation towards development through education and capacities generation.
An example of this is the intervention of Wash that in case of exclusive humanitarian assistance would have focused on
Supply water and sanitation conditions, but what he did was an educational process of integration of
knowledge, attitudes and practices to guarantee capacities and develop resilience to climate change.
On the other hand, both in interviews and in the different documents, the discourse that predominates over resilience
It is associated with the empowerment or strengthening of people, groups, institutions and communities. This is how
Example, the plane project citing INEE (2010) explains that ‚ÄúLife skills are those skills and
skills for positive behavior that allow people to adapt and effectively face demands and challenges
of everyday life ‚Äù(GAC and UNICEF, 2019, p. 22) and these skills are more required in times of crisis and by
This must be "relevant and applicable to local emergency contexts" (P. 22). For its part, the Koica project expresses that
A preventive approach is more profitable than one of emergency response (UNICEF and Koica, 2019).
Empowerment is mentioned in relation to situations of violence and with climatic crises or disasters
anthropic and natural. In relation to the former, the documents pose the strengthening of the environment to be
protector, training and training with adolescent girls and women and adolescent boys and men in order
to reduce tolerance towards VBG, prevent it and promote life skills. Likewise, training is alluded to
of teachers, educational authorities, NNA and educational advice for the prevention of sexual abuse or any kind
of violence, particularly gender. This empowerment is also associated with participatory processes and
Advisors of different actors, including NNA. A few interviewed by UNICEF and the implementing partners

On the empowerment related to the climate and its affectation to the Honduran population the mentions of the
documents allude to access to Wash services, to the training and preparation for the reduction of the
disaster risk, to the generation and transmission of knowledge and the improvement of attitudes and practices on
Climate change, hygiene and sanitation, and water -resilient water services.
In this regard, the Koica project indicates that it considered ‚Äúan intensive approach to climate change resilience in all activities
especially in Wash, not only in terms of facilitating (building environmental care standards) but also in training
teachers and students to better face environmental challenges ‚Äù(UNICEF and KOICA, 2023, p. 11) In this matter, it is very

UNICEF that mention the development of capacities to know how to face a climatic emergency because they have the

They clearly raised their perspective regarding the relationship between the two concepts.
On the other hand, empowerment is also mentioned in the documents, in relation to the skills for the
life in general (cognitive, personal, relational, communicational). In this sense there is talk of flexible education
for the development of life skills and labor insertion, the promotion of learning and development,
Empowerment of girls and adolescents around economic entrepreneurship, ICT, self -knowledge, leadership and
interpersonal relationships, which establishes a clear link between resilience and development. These skills are mentioned

‚ÄúI made pizzas and burritos and a cake of 3 milk and coconut bread and donuts and pudin and cache cake and engaged. I learned a lot to undertake
My own business ‚Äù(ethnography, adolescents, 2023). These empowerment are not mentioned by family parents,
although they mention the acquisition of self -confidence from their children.
Institutional and community strengthening is mentioned by the documents associated with the capacity of the centers
educational and their internal instances, as well as municipal and national communities and institutions. In the
Educational Centers The 2023 Report of Plane and Koica reveal elements associated with the strengthening of

Now, this evaluative question is addressed from two approaches. In the first the behavior is analyzed
of registration indicators, repetition and dropout between 2018 and 2022 from information of the SACE. In the second
Approach is valued compliance with the results based on project indicators and
qualitative information collected.
For the first approach, a comparison of means between intervened educational centers was made and not
intervened. This was done for the 2018 and 2022 period with four comparison groups: (i) the total of the municipalities
where UNICEF operated, (ii) the municipalities assisted with resources planet, (iii) the municipalities addressed with resources
Koica and (IV) the Central District, where Planet and Koica operated simultaneously (see details and disaggregations in the
Annex 9). It should be clarified that what is not necessarily implies that variations can be attributed to
UNICEF or projects directly as it does not correspond to an impact assessment.
Among the main findings it was detected that (see Table 4-6 and Table 4-7):

for the emergency context widely discussed in the report. However, educational centers

Despite the above, it identifies how some gender stereotypes such as access are maintained
to sports spaces particularly the football that maintains a stereotype gender to be masculine

One of the main challenges and difficulties faced by projects to achieve their results was pandemic
by COVID-19 and its consequent confinement, which generated the impossibility of applying training as they had
planned. However, the projects demonstrated their ability to adapt and managed to meet their objectives through
the provision of electronic devices, support in connectivity, and adaptations of the material format so that
They could be used virtually.
‚ÄúIt was just the issue of pandemia, because we changed the way we were going to start implementing, we had to adapt to reality

In the most vulnerable areas there were evident challenges related to the economic difficulties of families
to provide NNA with the necessary materials to attend school, so the projects had to include within
of their activities the delivery of school kits that would reduce access gaps of the most vulnerable population.

It is also found that the financed activities did have a gender approach, because as mentioned in the

Finance and execute activities for that purpose. In that sense, it is found that in UNICEF interventions, through

To take advantage of resources, strategies such as the following referred to by people were carried out
Consulted: ‚ÄúWhen we arrived in the field, we realized that in order to achieve the quota [goal] we had to grab
the largest educational centers ‚Äù(interview, implementing partners, 2023). This in turn generated more demand for
resources, as the provision of materials for students ended faster, while fulfilling hardly with the
Teacher goal. Then, the students-dochet relationship was not properly considered, which made the
compliance with goals. Another element to be considered that in extraordinary conditions a

It was also found that UNICEF executed actions to strengthen capacities in educational centers

decimated by the rotation of personnel both in educational centers, as in central government institutions and

flexibility, multiculturalism and interculturality, environmental responsibility and education and work (law
Fundamental education, 2012); and (2) the structure of community participation to strengthen public education
and promote the improvement of the quality of education, so the institutional framework includes within its structure
the Municipal Council of Educational Development (COMDE), the District Council for Educational Development (CODDE) and the
Development School Board of the Educational Center (CED) (Public Education Strengthening Law and
Community Participation, 2011).
Similarly, within the set of regulations to operationalize the LFE, they stand out as important for
UNICEF interventions The Education Management Regulations, which contemplates its decentralized character,
effective, participatory, flexible and relevant, and requires the different instances and their fields of competences, being the
Educational Centers The first and main management of the SNE, followed by the district and municipal addresses

a multiplicity of roles that, not being managed in an integral way, compete with their main function of delivering
Relevant and relevant teaching / learning processes to girls, boys and adolescents.
Another important political element is the strategic plan of the 2018-2030 education sector approved by the

Save the Children leadership and it is expected to establish a national policy and strategy for girls to have access
to a quality education that is also inclusive (program document, Save the Children Honduras, 2022).
It should be noted that Honduras already has a gender equity and equality plan for 2010 to 2022 which includes
Guidelines on women's educational rights.
Additionally, and as evidenced in one of the interviews with the Government, UNICEF has provided support for the
formation of a ‚Äútechnical table of support to the Ministry of Education, where the issues under consideration is all that
part of how we manage to have sustainability in the time of all these processes ‚Äù(Interview, Central Government, 2023)
In tutorial learning and in ACOES, both framed in the regulation of flexible modalities, included
Themes of life skills and the world of work through the incorporation of entrepreneurship workshops and
Labor options. SAT was the modality that, according to the interviewees has had a greater normative anchor,
But it has also had difficulties in its implementation (such as payment to tutors that is not resolved with the legal framework,
But it has repercussions on institutional anchor to implement the model), so, as illustrated by the following
Testimony has had to work with SEDUC so that government changes can affect the continuity of
This modality.
‚ÄúFrom before the project a certain legal framework had already been reached, say, for the execution of the SAT in the country. Let's say considerable,
let's say strong, but not strong enough for the program to be in some way like a lock that avoids
that during the changes of government some processes such as the payment and contracting of personnel are affected, then always
There is generally that difficulty and we have to be there socializing the program at all levels, but especially at the central level, because
We know that the education administration is relatively vertical in our country. Then decisions are made more at level
central and those then reach the bases. " (Focal Group, Civil Society, 2023).
This perception against regulatory anchor of SAT contrasts, however, with perception against anchor
institutional, since, although the seduction is the institutional head of its implementation, in practice the participants

The learning passport based its institutional anchoring on the development of materials, which can continue to be
used in educational centers, and in training of facilitating teachers, which guarantee the continuity of the model.
In terms of Wash, the formal action framework that the issues of water, sanitation and hygiene have been reviewed, and from

set of tools (manuals, methodologies and documents) so that educational institutions and teachers
could implement all the learning of programs in their future projects; Similarly, at the level of

In Wash we worked on a plan for use, operation and maintenance with educational institutions for sustainability
of physical infrastructure, and in an annual integration plan of Wash and climate resilience in curricular plans, of
such a way that the sustainability of knowledge, attitudes and practices of the educational community can be guaranteed.
These plans had to be reported to the District Directorate of Education, specifically to coordination
Departmental Environmental and Health Education (CODAS), which favors its institutional anchor to the extent to
that come to be part of the annual education plan of the municipality.
In terms of school plans it is found that there were efforts to incorporate new principles of gender equality
and hygiene in school planning, which encourages the sustainability of the programs. The actions that have taken to
Cabo are planning to integrate girls into science, inclusion of girls in student governments and focus
in menstrual health. However, although new school guidelines were created, they did not occur in the
indigenous languages, which indicates an exclusion of these communities and does not encourage sustainability in some regions
of the country, as already analyzed in the relevance criterion.
However, to achieve institutional anchor, the work that was had from the projects to increase was evidenced
The abilities of the SEDUC, the schools and the communities participating in the programs from the training and
Accompaniment in design and implementation processes of pedagogical tools. Training were made in
gender -based violence, texts and materials were delivered to implement flexible models, such as learning

5.2 guidance question. What have been the key factors and actors that have favored some
alternative and flexible modalities implemented have been successful and with high potential of
staggering?
The key success factors of the projects include the active participation and collaboration of various actors, such as the Secretariat of
Education and municipal authorities, the recognized trajectory of UNICEF in Honduras, the experience of the implementing partners
and its emergency adaptation capacity, as well as the suitability of the personnel and their training. The perceived utility of the
Synthesis of the learning finding was also crucial for the motivation and effective application of knowledge.
As for the key actors, government entities, UNICEF and implementing partners, teachers and directors, stand out,
Fathers and mothers, the community, students and school governments. The active involvement of these actors was essential
To achieve the intermediate results raised in the projects.
The key success factors identified in the evaluation are the following:
‚Ä¢ Participation and articulation of the actors. From the analysis it could be evidenced that it was key in the implementation
of the modalities the articulation, participation and linking of different actors, sectors and territorial levels in
the development and implementation of the projects. In this regard, it is relevant to have linked the SEDUC in a way
very active, which generated an institutional formality that led teachers to assume the
work commitment and respond to him. The linking of institutional authorities from the beginning caused
The process was participatory and SEDUC felt part of the project from the methodological design and development
and curricular. At the territorial level, being able to have the support and commitment of the municipal authorities was a
differential factor between municipalities; The results and work were much better when mayors had
committed that in those where the articulation with government instances was low or void, such as
It was evidenced in the interviews. It is also recognized as a key factor to have involved the actors
Community, such as the APF, the APF and the educational committees of the educational centers, which favored the
awareness and appropriation of the community with the activities that were being carried out. The partners
Implementers relieve the subject of the project flexibility, which allowed to have an approach as key factors
of consultation with teachers and educational institutions, and not tax against methodologies or guides
that should be used; and the way teachers were addressed to generate confidence and give them credibility in the
project, linking them in their development and in the knowledge it generated. Thus, it was sought that
tools were at the service of teachers' needs with a very close accompaniment
of the implementers. Finally, the relationship of private companies through alliances was identified.
‚Ä¢ UNICEF recognition and reputation in Honduras. UNICEF has a extensive work trajectory in
Honduras, which favors its incidence capacity with high -level government actors.
‚Ä¢ Experience of the implementing partners. Experience in the territory of the partners is relieved

speed up processes that had been more complex for educational institutions, for example, on the delivery issue
of materials for the construction of the bathrooms. Similarly, directors recognize as a key factor the
Visits made by the partners, the cooperators and UNICEF to land, which contributed to the generation of trust.
‚Ä¢ Adaptation capacity. While these were development projects, they had to be implemented through
An emergency situation, which forced them to quickly adapt to specific situations and realities
that would allow them to respond to the latent needs of COVID-19 and Hurricanes ETA e Iota keeping the
objective of generating access to education.
‚Ä¢ Investment in Wash. A key Wash factor was that international cooperation decided to invest in the
theme, which, as one of the people interviewed refers, was not a priority in the country and was relegated in front
To other needs. With the investment made in water infrastructure, sanitation and hygiene could work
In behavioral changes, in empowerment of girls and in climatic resilience, demonstrating the great
potential that Wash interventions have to motivate, foster and work other issues related to
protection, resilience and climate change.
‚Ä¢ Suitability of human resource. In relation to the results described in the efficiency criteria, a key factor
It was the suitability of the human resource to implement the projects, but also the support of UNICEF for
address gaps in equipment needs, whether through training or through the hiring of
Specific professionals, for example psychologists who as volunteers or hired came to support the system
of protection of schools. At the territorial level, the different actors of the community were made training

regarding the reference that the participants made to the ‚Äústudent trinomial, teachers and
Parents ‚Äù(Focal Group, Teachers of Educational Centers, 2023).
‚Ä¢ Empowerment of girls and adolescents women. The empowerment given to girls and adolescents
women on the issues on which they were trained and the strengthening in their role of trainers was
Identified as a key success factor and with replication and staggering potential, not only in hygiene issues
menstrual but in other aspects in which they can expand their knowledge and practices, and feel safe
and confident of transmitting these knowledge.
‚Ä¢ Usefulness of learning. Both among the actors consulted in the educational community, and among the
Implementing partners, the argument of the motivation and will of the different actors for
train, learn and implement knowledge, which are perceived as relevant and useful, and
Not as an additional workload. In this regard, some teachers in focal groups even discussed
about the use they continue to give the material as a work tool for the implementation of the models

In relation to key actors, although some were referenced in the identification of key factors, the most
mentioned in qualitative exercises are the following:
‚Ä¢ Government entities. The involvement of government institutions was key to the extent that it guaranteed

‚Ä¢ Fathers and mothers, and the community. It was found that there was a very open reception by the
community to programs and their implemers, this caused mothers and fathers, and the community in
general became key actors for the application of learning and awareness of
protection in the home environment. Schools for parents, which were key to the empowerment of the
community. The involvement of this actor is key to the achievement of the intermediate result 2.
‚Ä¢ Students and school governments. It was evidenced that including them in the training processes had an effect
positive in adapting the tools implemented. In general it was found that there were instances in which
It was noted that NNA, and in particular girls and adolescents women, they looked more empowered and participatory thanks
to the programs, and motivated by the knowledge they were acquiring. The involvement of this actor is key
To achieve the intermediate result 1.
The TDC explicitly establishes the key actors that must be strengthened in their abilities to achieve
Expected changes for the benefit of the NNA, especially in intermediate cases and results 2 and 3 and their results
immediate. In this regard, the projects worked at the different levels of the education system in order to comply with
These results.
Guidance question 5.3 Were spaces for participation and learning in search of sustainability
of the most relevant initiatives implemented in both projects?
Learning spaces promoted by the Planet and Koica programs were created with the aim of replicating acquired knowledge
and promote community participation, which were linked to planning and coordination processes between actors. Was
Synthesis of the finding constant support of partners implementing in the development of these spaces using planning tools with the
educational institutions and teachers. At the level of authorities, the spaces promoted the exchange of experiences in meetings
municipal and departmental; However, officials of officials affected the monitoring of these activities.
The learning spaces that were created were promoted from the design of the programs, and most of them
They were aimed at that people could replicate the acquired learning, so that knowledge
will mobilize in cascade and reach more people; But a relationship of these spaces with processes was also found
planning and coordination between actors, as described below.
In line with the analysis carried out for the relevance criteria, the contextualization that occurred of the programs was
related to the development of collaborative construction and learning spaces, such as individual diagnoses
with each educational institution and individual measurement tests of NNA, in which the
directors and teachers, which facilitated the appropriation of actions. In this regard in one of the focal groups with

At the level of the authorities, these spaces managed to involve different actors, and the exchange of
experiences through municipal and departmental meetings, which were oriented to follow up
to the field of the implementers and the coordination of actions.
At the NNA level, the decoas generated spaces where they and they could be heard and generate proposals to
the authorities, as a conversation with the Minister of Education and a walk with the office coordinator
of climate change. However, as in other aspects associated with sustainability, changes in
Officials derived from the change of government affected the monitoring of these activities. Despite these results,

In digital ethnography exercises with adolescents it was found that for them and they are the possibility of being

motivated. Likewise, it was found that through the tutoring programs the students were trained and then
They shared knowledge with other colleagues, creating a learning chain and strengthening them as
agents in their development.
In line with the activities planned from the TDC in relation to the empowerment44 of the girls it was found that
There was a job to integrate them into school governments and make them more participants in the leadership of their educational centers.
They were trained in life skills and self -protection against violence, and were replicators of this

This, UNICEF in conjunction with the International Plan of Honduras, created 5 regional girls of girls where they develop their
skills and shared on a civic platform (annual report report, 2020). The projects also involved
Men's children and adolescents, who in turn promised as volunteers to replicate the information,
thus creating sustainability not only of information, but of the change in practices and behaviors against women
and girls (Semiannual Plane report, 2021).
The project work model was based on a waterfall learning where trained teachers
were replicators of knowledge (annual report report, 2021); For them, in addition to the specific activities of
training and training gave spaces for exchange of experiences and advances, which became a
opportunity for the integration of new schools. The training they had on SAT is relieved and that has
allowed to identify situations of desertion by migration and know the route of attention to address these cases, and
those in which children return to their communities giving them special management to guarantee their rights and
adaptation, in terms not only academics but also legal.
Learning spaces that involve entire communities were generated, which has achieved impact on terms
of behavior and knowledge, being particularly evident in the actions related to Wash, where
The community was involved in the manufacture of toilet products, in talks about menstrual hygiene and hygiene, and even

Diagnosis, which in some municipalities was made through women's networks and organizations.
Based on the ethnography performed, it is also found that the leverage of students as agents of change
It is an opportunity for the results of these projects to last. The students expressed their gratitude and
Enthusiasm for materials and learning and the possibility of being replicators themselves. By
example, in terms of bullying, a student feels more clarity about the rules of this topic and expresses that knowing more
About him makes students have more empathic best practices and behaviors. In general the
most outstanding tendency in ethnography was that the students themselves noticed change in behavior of the
community and greater enthusiasm and involvement.
5.4 guidance question. What opportunities are identified to maintain the results achieved until
now and replicate the implementation in other municipalities of the country?
The opportunities identified by implementing partners and directors for sustainability are in the
installed capabilities left in teachers, material and cards that were delivered to the
Synthesis of the discovery educational institutions and that directors can continue to use in flexible models.
The lack of resources is identified as a challenge, but it is sought to overcome through the relevance perceived by
SEDUC and the possibility of collaboration with other financiers.
Since the approach of the planet and Koica programs was to build capacities in municipalities, schools
and communities in general, the opportunities identified by implementing partners and directors for the
sustainability are in the installed capabilities that were left in teachers, the material and the cards that were delivered
to educational institutions and that directors can continue to use in the flexible models they work. One of
The directors, in this regard, mentioned that what you need is attitude to continue working on what they were taught,
But also in this group of informants, more than lack of capacity, lack of leadership to appropriate

Although the general disposition of teachers is evident to continue the actions of the programs even when

of official personnel or high rotation in the most vulnerable and dispersed areas.

In the case of SAT, the main opportunity is that it is not a project methodology, but that they entered into

opportunity to be replicated; However, it is evidenced in the results that there is a structural limitation of resources
for the hiring of teachers who implement SAT, which affects the possibility of reaching more communities, and in

Evaluation conclusions
5.1 relevance
1. Koica and Plan's designs considered the main needs of the country in order to
generate and strengthen safe and protective spaces in schools, which was possible due to actions such as
individual diagnoses by educational institution and by NNA so that teachers could identify the
More suitable tools for your group of students, the delivery of school materials to replace deficiencies
of the NNA in the work areas and the delivery of tablets to reduce the technological gap that became
crucial in remote or hybrid education schemes. On the other hand, in gender matters the design was specific
in the consideration of the equality needs of girls and adolescents women, managing to respond to
specific female empowerment needs and their participation in decision -making spaces; without
However, in terms of vulnerable population the design was general in the consideration of the needs of the

2. The projects had the ability to adapt to the needs of the changing context. The projects
Koica and Planet, at the juncture in which they were implemented, could influence minimizing the risks for
the NNA produced by the confinement and closure of schools. It was found how training processes
provided to teachers, children and mothers, fathers and caregivers, together with the delivery of educational materials, the
efforts to implement learning spaces outside the school classrooms, empower girls and
adolescents women and the Wash initiatives were pertinent to get the children to have a greater
Equitable access to learning opportunities. It was also evidenced that the actions were aimed at
vulnerable populations.
3. Alternative and flexible modalities have adapted to the particular context of each educational center helping
to the elimination of learning and gender barriers. By granting tools to the staff of the centers
educational and instances of community participation was strengthened inclusive and relevant educational management in
A safe environment with sanitation and hygiene conditions. However, there are challenges regarding EIB,
because its relevance goes beyond offering cards in ethnic languages.

so that the educational community in general could learn to cope with the emotions caused by the
Moments of emergency both pandemic, ETA and Iota.
5.2 Coherence
5. The UNICEF contribution through the Koica and Plane projects has external and internal coherence.
External coherence with international and national reality and standards, and for coordination with others
state and civil society initiatives; and internal coherence in two aspects: one, because the two projects
They look for the same purposes, thus come from different donors, and two, because there is a clear link between the
Resilience and development approaches. This achievement shows UNICEF's coordinating role with the different
actors and initiatives and in the approach of the two projects, so that they were consistent with each other and with
others.
6. In relation to external coherence, the objectives and results of both projects seek to close the gaps and
Contribute to the mandates or approaches of the standards. The objectives of the projects are oriented to achieve
that the children and, above all, girls and adolescents women, out of vulnerability conditions for
access and remain in safe environments (physical, social, emotionally and healthy) in which they feel
Security, can learn properly and develop life skills. For this, it also seeks

Manage resources and develop flexible strategies.
7. The second element of external coherence is observed in the way Koica and Plane projects
They enter into other initiatives of the State, civil society, community and agencies

partners and the development of the initiatives found in the country and in the territories. In addition, it was observed

Construction of safe environments.
8. In relation to internal coherence, between the two projects of Koica and Plane there was complementarity
in different aspects given the similarity of donors' interests and, therefore, of the objectives proposed in
Both projects. The complementarity is observed in the territories in which each project is executed, in
Some emphasis for work with specific populations and in the particularities of some projects. In

13. The project management and monitoring system was partially appropriate, it has characteristics
desirable as simplicity, clear indicators disaggregated by interest groups and, recently, centralization
of standardized evidence in repository format (photos, videos, reports, etc.). However, the system presented

In learning environments, it made it difficult to have a panorama sufficiently
complete to assess the progress of the projects.
5.5 Sustainability
14. In terms of sustainability there are two types of anchor of interest, one institutional and another regulatory. First, the
Sustainability Goals delineated in the planning of Plane and Koica in relation to institutional anchor
They clearly define achievements in abilities, which in practice were reached to
through permanent involvement from the design stage of institutional actors of different levels
Territorial Additionally, in Acoes Models, Learning Passport, SAT and Wash there was an anchor
more tangible since capacities and material were left in schools and government. Second, in terms of anchor
Normative, for all models it was identified that there was an integration of norms and policies. In terms of
sustainability of the tools and methodologies that were developed in the projects, it was achieved that in the
schools and that in general the education system will be accepted and will implement flexible modalities based
in the regulatory framework provided by the Education Law. Now, the normative and institutional anchor presents
Difficulties regarding gender, although it was planned to support the formulation of gender educational policy,
This did not materialize; Even so, the gender approach to the learning passport was incorporated and achieved
in strengthening the participation of girls and adolescents in school governments.
15. In relation to the key factors and actors for the implementation of the projects, it can be concluded that the
having made a participatory and arranged process with SEDUC was fundamental, not only to achieve a
articulated work and with will by national instances, but to guarantee alignment and
commitment of departmental and municipal instances. Such coordination at different levels was key
for implementation and can become an element of sustainability to the extent that
Methodologies have a place in the Education Law, and there is a knowledge and commitment of officials
to implement the actions. Despite this, a risk in personnel changes is also identified, since
The agreements and lines that were worked on the framework of the projects are lost when a new government arrives
and new officials to charges.
16. spaces for participation and learning were given at different stages of the projects that contributed to the
appropriation of actions by the educational community, which can result in its sustainability in
Time. The community, teachers and NNA were involved in learning spaces, and in line with the
planned scheme, a waterfall learning was implemented where each of these actors was
Information Replicator. With adolescents, an empowerment exercise was made that is
recognized by them and them, and that gave them confidence and empowered them as agents of knowledge and change.
17. The opportunities for the sustainability of the projects are the complementarity of the actions, avoiding the
