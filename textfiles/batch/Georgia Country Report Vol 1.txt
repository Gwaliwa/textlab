Recommendations
In line with the evaluation findings in Georgia, we recommend for UNICEF to:
I. Continue to support the GoG and regional authorities in Georgia to build an inclusive early
childhood education system by developing staff competences and improving the working
(and learning) conditions in preschools.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include:
• Ensuring proper documentation, monitoring and evaluation of the ongoing pilot training for
preschool staff in Adjara to use the collected evidence in advocating for systemic solutions
to the competency gap in the preschool sector, in particular with respect to inclusive
education standards;
• Advocating and providing technical assistance for developing and introducing a
programme for initial and continuing professional development of preschool staff in
Georgia, which would:
i. incorporate the experiences of the pilot training (e.g. on combining the online and
offline modes of training delivery) and be in line with the newly adopted standards for
preschool education;
ii. target wider personnel (including preschool support staff);
iii. include components devoted to inclusive early childhood education and care and
skills for effective communication and interaction with parents;
• Advocating and providing technical assistance for an analysis of the preschool staff’s
working conditions and needs, and based on the analysis - development of measures for
their improvement, e.g. increasing child-free hours and making investments in
infrastructure and equipment, as well as raising staff remuneration.
II. Continue to address the structural issues affecting women’s and children’s access to
quality health care, including through using and implementing the recommendations from
the assessment of the SMAs.
III. Continue to support the GoG to further develop the Child Hotline 111 into a fully functional
one-stop shop mechanism integrating child-related services in Georgia and a monitoring
mechanism providing policy makers with information on those needs and systemic
bottlenecks.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include advocating and providing
technical assistance for:
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 12
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
• developing recommendations on the role of the Child Hotline 111 in the overall system of
services for children and families, proposing clear leadership and accountabilities across
service providers to cooperate wit h the Child Hotline 111;
• developing cooperation mechanisms (e.g. through agreements, memoranda of
understanding, coordination councils or other platforms, regular meetings, working groups,
conferences, etc.) between the Child Hotline 111 and other child-related service providers,
which could foster overall coordin ation and improvements in child-related services in the
country;
• developing and implementing legal measures that oblige state institutions to provide
information about child-oriented services and their changes to the Child Hotline 111;
• creating technical and functional links between the Child Hotline 111 and GoG’s other hotline
1505;
• developing technical solutions (e.g. joint service databases for service providers) to
facilitate integration of and access to knowledge between the Child Hotline 111 and other
child-related services, respecting relevant privacy standards;
• promoting the Child Hotline 111 services among beneficiaries (children, parents and other
caregivers) and potential partners, in particular CSOs providing child-related services.
IV. Support the GoG to strengthen the capacity of the Child Hotline 111 to provide quality
services to children and families.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include advocating and providing
technical assistance for:
• developing service quality standards and a performance monitoring system with relevant
indicators; establishing robust and detailed service guidelines, standard operating
procedures and referral pathways, including in cases of violence against children, and
follow-up procedures;
• ensuring opportunities for Child Hotline 111’s staff to build working relationships with
representatives of different service providers (foster people-to-people contacts) to
facilitate (increase the effectiveness of) cross-service cooperation;
• developing solutions for staff retention, continuous training and supervision to provide an
effective response to the calls.
V. Conduct an assessment of the SMAs to understand: (i) the benefits they carry for
participants; (ii) pregnant women’s needs and more concrete (underlying) reasons for
women’s resignation from participation; and (iii) the added value the SMAs bring to the
existing health care services during and beyond the context of COVID-19.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 13
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
1.0 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a multi-dimensio nal crisis that has profoundly affected the development
and psycho-social well-being of young children and their caregivers. Evidence from around the world
clearly shows that the crisis has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and brought on new immediate
and longer-term challenges to children’s w ell-being. In addition to the pandemic’s primary effects
such as increased poverty, families with young children have faced an unprecedented disruption of
essential health, early learning, and other services.
Across the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has played
a critical role in supporting governments’ responses to COVID-19. Efforts were recalibrated to address
the immediate needs of young children and their families. This included re-purposing and
strengthening available resources and workforce to provide information and services in the
circumstances of home confinement, reduced availability of ECD services, and an on-going public
health threat.
The pandemic has created a set of novel circumstances which demanded specific actions, such as
introducing new interventions or quickly adapting the old ones. Now, evidence is needed on the
appropriateness and efficiency of these new responses and adjustments. The lessons learned can
help to develop longer term recovery plans and budgets for ECD services to strengthen the resilience
of ECD systems across ECA.
For this purpose, UNICEF ECA Regional Office (ECARO) commissioned Ecorys to carry out the Multi-
Country Evaluation of the UNICEF ECD response to COVID-19 in the ECA region. A developmental
evaluation approach was adapted to provide rapid evidence and enable the adjustment of on-going
efforts in real-time. The evaluation entails an in-depth study in four ECA countries: Croatia, Georgia,
Moldova, and Ukraine with a view on the lessons learned from the region. It started in November 2020
and continued until the end of 2021.
This report presents the findings from the evaluation in Georgia. It sets out the context of the
evaluation; a description of the object of the evaluation; its overall purpose, objectives, and scope;
the methodology; key findings; and conclusions and recommendations. It summarizes the evaluation
team’s assessment of the relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability of UNICEF’s ECD response to
COVID-19 in Georgia. The findings and recommendations in this report are intended to primarily serve
UNICEF Georgia Country Office, UNICEF ECARO, and national governmental and non-governmental
stakeholders in Georgia working with young children and families.
The evaluation team would like to express their gratitude to the staff of UNICEF Georgia Country Office
for their continuous support. We also thank all other persons who shared their experiences and views
with us. Finally, we thank staff from the UNICEF ECARO Evaluation and ECD teams for their invaluable
inputs, guidance, and management of the evaluation.

2 .0 Context and purpose of the evaluation
2.1 Evaluation background
2.1.1 Overview of UNICEF’s EC D work in Georgia
The overarching goal of the UNICEF 2016-2020 country programme in Georgia is to accelerate the
universal realization of child rights by fostering greater social inclusion of the most deprived children
and by reducing disparities and inequities affecting children and their families.1 The programme is
aligned with international human rights standards2 and post-2015 sustainable development goals.3
It correspondents to national development priorities and has been implemented in close cooperation
with the government of Georgia (GoG).
Early childhood development (ECD) falls predominantly within the ‘young child survival and
development’ component of the country programme4 which focuses on children up to 5 years of
age and their families, particularly the most vulnerable. ECD-relevant activities are also integrated
as part of the ‘social protection and inclusion’ component.
As outlined in the country programme, UNICEF’s ECD activities under ‘young child survival and
development’ relate to five priority areas: (1) creating a conducive and nurturing environment that
will enable children to survive, thrive and reach their full potential; (2) increasing infant and maternal
survival by strengthening the quality of health services during pregnancy, delivery and post delivery;
(3) enabling the GoG to establish comprehensive, cross-sectoral ECD services for healthy growth; (4)
assisting the GoG in assessing disability, improving national data management system on children
with disabilities and promoting the expansion of early childhood intervention (ECI) services and
family-type alternative care services for children with disabilities; (5) supporting the continued
expansion of quality early childhood education (ECE) and the implementation of the Law on Early
Learning and Preschool Education.
Over the years, UNICEF Georgia has been supporting Georgian authorities in creating a conducive
and nurturing environment for children in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It
collaborated with the Georgian Parliament on developing the Code on the Rights of the Child by
providing technical assistance and organizing consultations with young people. The document,
adopted in September 2019 after a three-year-long process, entered into force on 1 September 2020.5
The code abolishes corporal punishment and establishes the child’s best interest as primary

and its Target 4.2 related to ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and
pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education. Other relevant SDGs are SDG1 (‘End poverty in all its
forms everywhere’), SDG2 (‘End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture’),
SGD3 (‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’) with its Targets 3.1. and 3.2. related to lowering
maternal, neonatal and under-five mortality.

as the rights to equal and inclusive education, healthcare, safe environment, and social protection.6
Some of its provisions relate specifically to e arly learning and preschool education, e.g. to creating a
national professional development system for teachers and special teachers of early and preschool
educational institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF continued its efforts to support the
GoG in developing the right environment fo r children. For example, in April 2021, in cooperation with
the Human Rights and Civil Integration Committee of the Parliament and Democracy Development
Agency, it launched a project to support the implementation of the code by enhancing coordination
between the legislative and executive bra nches, as well as supporting local municipalities and
central agencies to fulfill new functions deriving from this document.7
While Georgia has made significant progress in improving infant and maternal survival, challenges
remain. The country managed to reduce the under-five mortality rate from 47.7 in 1990 to 9.6 in 2019,8
reaching its related Millennium Development Goal target.9 However, under-five mortality remains
high, as compared to the EU average of 3.95 in 2019.10 The maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live
births) decreased from 31 in 200011 to 25 in 2017.12 However, significant fluctuations could be observed
over the years, with the indicator reaching the value of 42 in 2002 and 43 in 2009, suggesting fragile
achievements. Overall, the value of the indicator remains high as compare to the EU average of 6 in
2017.13 According to UNICEF, low-quality ante, perinatal and post-partum services contribute
significantly to the high infant and maternal mortality.14 To address these issues, UNICEF Georgia has
been implementing the Mother and Child Health Programme, encompassing activities of both
systemic and more focused nature.15 In particular, it supported the development and 2016 launch of
the Birth Registry, a government-owned system that helps register pregnancies and monitor their
course.16 Since 2018, UNICEF has also been working with the GoG to develop the “0-6 Child Growth and
Development Surveillance Electronic Module”. The module collects routine, real-time data on children
aged 0-6 years, assesses a child’s development trajectory, and reflects data related to child nutrition,
as well as information on child neglect and abuse.17 It further allows to track maternal health post
delivery. The 0-6 module was piloted in 2019 in Adjara and was supposed to be revised accordingly
in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed its finalization.18 During the COVID-19 pandemic,
UNICEF has continued to work on infant and maternal health, including by conducting assessments
of conditions in maternities and by introducing new services (see more section 2.1.3, 2.3.1 and 2.4.2).
UNICEF identified the primary health care system as the main entry point to support families with
young children (0-3 years of age) through the introduction and systemic implementation of a home

visiting service.19 While the service has not yet been introduced, UNICEF has contributed to creating
the conditions for its introduction.20 The 0-6 module collecting data and tracking child and maternal
health post delivery is thought to strengthen the primary health care system, in particular the baby
check-up component, and support services for families with young children.21 The work on
strengthening the quality of primary healthcare has also been continued in rural areas over the
course of the pandemic (see section 2.4.1).
In line with its programme, UNICEF has also been working to support the GoG in responding to the
need of children with disabilities, for example through its Social Inclusion of Children with Disabilities
Programme.22 Some of the program’s efforts concentrate on helping the GoG to assess disability
based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Another focus is
changing harmful attitudes and beliefs around children with disabilities and fostering social inclusion.
Georgia has made progress in terms of preschool participation in the last decades, increasing net
enrolment rate from 45 % in 2005 to 78 % in 2018.23 UNICEF has supported the GoG and the Parliament
in developing and implementing the Law on Early and Preschool Education and Care (EPEC) which
includes major innovations aimed at improving quality, access, and equity in early childhood
education and care (ECEC) throughout Georgia. Based on the EPEC law, UNICEF supported the GoG
through technical assistance in developing mandatory national ECEC professional pedagogue
standards and education standards, as well as standard-based authorization system for all public
and private preschool institutions.24 The standards aim at ensuring an equitable, inclusive, child-
centered, and high-quality educational process that supports child development and responds to
children’s interests and needs in a safe and child-friendly environment. However, the implementation
of standards remains a challenge, so does ensuring an appropriate level of competence among
preschool teachers (see section 2.3.2). UNICEF partnered with MoESCS to develop training modules
and teaching aids for ECEC pedagogues25 and it cooperates with the Adjara authorities and the
National Center for Teacher Professional Development on the pilot project, which is the object of this
evaluation.
Over the years, UNICEF has been a critical contributor to the country’s social protection systems. It
supported the GoG in the reforms, especially the targeted social assistance (TSA) program, and its
work has also been crucial for developing the social work profession, deinstitutionalization of state
care and the development of alternative forms of care.26
2.1.2 Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for ECD in Georgia
The COVID-19 pandemic has had disastrous effects on populations all over the world. The impact of
the pandemic on children is profound, although the risk for children’s health is lower than for adults.
Around the world, children of all ages face the triple threat of direct consequences of the disease,

suspension of essential services and rising poverty and inequality.27 The situation of children in
Georgia is no exception. The pandemic and restrictions imposed to contain the virus have deeply
affected services crucial for ECD, such as h ealthcare, child security and protection or education.28
COVID-19 has also exacerbated risks for children who were already vulnerable prior to the crisis. These
include children with disabilities, children from ethnic minorities and those from the poorest families.29
COVID-19 has significantly impacted children’s access to ECE services and entrusted family
members, especially mothers, with greater responsibilities for supporting children’s learning. The
GoG declared a state of emergency on 21 Ma rch 2020, which entailed restrictions of movement inside
the country and the closure of all schools, kindergartens and universities.30 The national lockdown
and introduction of remote teaching impacted 1,621 kindergartens providing preschool education for
164,605 children.31 Prior to the pandemic, one in five children aged 2-5 did not attend preschool. This
indicator was even higher in rural areas and equaled 32%.32 The real-time monitoring survey
conducted by UNICEF suggests that in November and December 2020 92% of the children aged 2-4
were engaged in four or more daily activities with adult household members.33 This number is
significantly higher than 77% in 2018,34 which suggests that family members took over the increased
responsibility for children’s early development. Examples of activities involved reading books, telling
stories, playing outside, etc. While this creates opportunities for strengthening interaction between
children and parents, previous research suggests that “Georgian parents’ understanding of playing
with children is not informed by basic principles of effective playtime with their children”.35 For
example, cognitive developmental practices, such as reading, counting, or drawing, are not as
common as social and emotional developmental practices, such a playing, taking outside or singing.
COVID-19 has thus increased the need for educating parents on how to support children’s learning
through play, but also for developing strategies to enable children to catch up once the pandemic is
contained.
Children have also been affected by the increased economic insecurity in families. UNICEF
measured the impact of COVID-19 on the welfare of families and children via a real-time monitoring
survey. It revealed that within 32% of households at least one member lost a job temporarily or for a
long period between March and December 2020. 36 During this time, the average monthly income of
53% of households decreased.37 The child poverty rate is also projected to increase from 28% to

around 33-38% due to the pandemic.38 In Abkhazia, social workers reported an increase in demand
for humanitarian support in 2020, which provides preliminary evidence for increasing poverty rates.39
Financial difficulties have had a negative impact on household spending, with 67% of surveyed
households reporting a reduced spending o n food, which might have had adverse consequences
for children’s optimal nutrition.40 After the closure of preschools, 86% of attending children aged 2-
5 received food support from their preschool educational institutions for at least a month.41 Thus,
COVID-19 has compounded previously existing problems of malnutrition in Georgia. The Global
Nutrition Report 2016 revealed that 11% of ch ildren under five in Georgia had stunted growth or were
malnourished.42 This was further confirmed by the National Nutrition Study in Georgia, which indicated
that children lack specifically protein and iron-rich foods.43 Although food deprivation is less prevalent
in rural areas, communities in these regions are more likely to rely on nutritionally cheap calories in
their diets.44 This is associated with high poverty levels, particularly in geographically isolated areas
with low intensity of arable land use, such as Adjara, Samtskhe-Javakheti and Shida Kartli.
While COVID-19 stretches the capacities of the health system, it is also contributing to a decreased
demand for other health services due to fears of contracting the virus, isolation and diminished
availability.45 Demand was particularly low among displaced communities and people living in
remote mountainous villages.46 The consequences of this low demand include e.g. a significant drop
(≥ 5%) in the national coverage with routine immunizations.47 A dropping demand for antenatal care
(ANC) was a justification for introducing the shared medical appointments for pregnant women, i.e.
one of the projects assessed during this evaluation.
By forcing the GoG to impose restrictions on the delivery of social services, the crisis has highlighted
their crucial role, especially for the well-being of the most vulnerable children.48 Children with
disabilities who require additional support were particularly affected.49 As the research conducted
in 17 low- and middle-income countries shows, children with disabilities are more likely to become
the victims of violence.50 Due to the national lockdown, from March 2020 to May 2020, social services
for children with disabilities were either closed or had transitioned to the remote provision of support.51

So, in addition to dealing with a higher risk of infection among children with disabilities, families with
such children had also to face restricted access to services and an increased burden of meeting their
children’s physical, academic and psycholo gical needs.52
The pandemic also highlighted the risks fo r children in foster care and specialized institutions of
being exposed to violence as well as mental health problems.53 In 2017, there were 80 institutions for
alternative care. In addition, there were 38 unregulated institutions with residential components for
924 children and managed by various non-g overnmental organizations (NGOs), local governments,
as well as faith-based groups.54 These children often could not get the needed support from their
families, friends and outside world and were in isolation.
Another group that was affected by the ongoing pandemic includes the ECD frontline workers,
such as health workers, preschool teachers, early intervention practitioners, social workers, etc.
In Georgia social workers had to work remotely except in emergency cases, while most of the
essential social services remained closed.55 While social workers are now back to face-to-face
service provision, COVID-19 has revealed a need for better guidelines and stronger skills to tackle
emergencies among the social workforce.56 The situation of ECD essential workers in Georgia also
reflects some global trends. COVID-19 has underlined the increased need for personal protective
equipment (PPE), hygiene and medical supplies for healthcare facilities, support to rapid response
teams and infection control.57 Without this equipment, frontline workers are especially vulnerable to
the virus. As women account for around 75% of healthcare employees in Georgia,58 they often faced
the double burden of continuing their services in-person while caring for their children’s learning at
home due to the closure of kindergartens and schools. Globally, frontline workers have experienced
greater levels of stress, fatigue, and exhaustion.59 This may also be indicative of the situation of this
group of workers in Georgia, as the situation in the country reflects some of the main difficulties
induced by the pandemic around the world.
2.1.3 Key features of UNICEF-supported adaptations of ECD
interventions in Georgia
UNICEF Georgia has supported the GoG and cooperated with multiple other partners in responding
to the immediate challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic posed for ECD. The implemented activities
fall within UNICEF’s wider programme areas. As per its situation reports, the mix of response and
preparedness activities has included: (i) facilitating risk communication, learning, play, and positive
parenting communications; (ii) provisioning critical hygiene and medical supplies for healthcare and
education structures; (iii) ensuring children, pregnant, and lactating women are supported with
adequate healthcare, (iv) mitigating secondary effects of the outbreak by facilitating continued

access to education, child protection needs, including prevention of violence against children, and
advocating for continued access to social protection programs. COVID-19 related activities also
focused on awareness-raising, capacity-bu ilding or information and intelligence gathering during
the rapidly evolving situation. Below, we provide a brief overview of UNICEF’s COVID-19 related
activities in the area of ECD.
Since the pandemic’s onset, UNICEF has developed different kinds of educational and awareness-
raising resources or campaigns pertaining to ECD. Many of these materials aim to help parents to
support learning of children at home following the closure of kindergartens. For example, a TV
programme on ECD was launched on the Georgian Public Broadcaster’s Education Channel on
Saturdays and Sundays. 15-minute videos featured expert and preschool educators providing
recommendations and demonstrating activities that can be implemented by parents and their
children at home.60 The programme was supported by a partnership between UNICEF, MoESCS, the
Georgian Coalition for Education for All, the Education Management Information System (EMIS) and
UK Aid.61 UNICEF also produced toolkits on ECD and school readiness, which are accessible for parents
and caregivers through various channels, also in national minority languages.62 Further brochures for
parents on ECD were prepared for three age groups: infants (birth to 1), toddlers (1-3) and
preschoolers (3-6).63
In April 2020, UNICEF implemented two 15-day challenges for parents – the first one with a focus on
care and support for early learning of children and the second – relaxation and mental health tips
for parents with young kids, along with information on positive parenting. The initial challenge, in
cooperation with the Rustavi2 TV broadcaster, reached an estimated 191,296 people and actively
engaged 16,358.64 Online discussions involving child psychologists were also initiated for parents with
children aged 0-6 to provide guidance and advice for parents during the pandemic. As per UNICEF
data, these reached over 30,000 parents.65 On 10 September, UNICEF’s partner Parents for Education
organized the first webinar in another series on communicating with children aged 0-6 during the
pandemic. The webinar generated high interest among parents with 46,000 views and more than
16,600 engagements through social media.66
UNICEF also engaged in the provision of equipment, including PPE, hygienic materials, and other
supplies contributing to strengthening the ECD services. In partnership with USAID, it provided
essential hygiene supplies for 336 kindergartens to support safe preschool reopening in the Kvemo
Kartli, Samtskhe-Javakheti and Adjara regions of Georgia.67 It also delivered toys, stationery, and
other developmental resources to all 11 kindergartens of Pankisi Gorge and 8 pilot preschools in
Adjara, which will enable children to benefit from educational and play materials essential for their
holistic development.68
UNICEF supported the GoG by providing advice, technical assistance and other forms of
information generation and sharing. For example, UNICEF provided technical assistance to estimate

COVID-19 infant isolation and care capacity in the country, develop an ANC protocol during the
COVID-19 response and organize the flow for routine ANC visits.69 Furthermore, in partnership with
national actors,70 UNICEF initiated an assessm ent of COVID-19 prevention and control measures in the
maternity houses across the country. By the end of 2020, all 84 maternity houses in the country were
assessed and received recommendations, as well as on-the-job trainings on strengthening the
infection prevention and control (IPC) me asures to better protect mothers and children.71 To
strengthen IPC and hygiene in preschools and schools, UNICEF in close coordination with the MoESCS
and other key stakeholders, defined the existing gaps and needs in WASH. The response plan has
been prepared to ensure a safer learning environment.72 More general data collection was also
supported, e.g. the real-time monitoring based on the multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS) on the
situation of families and children during the COVID-19 crisis and to appraise government response,73
assessment of the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on children74 or assessment of the social
protection system.75
During the pandemic, various UNICEF interventions have focused on building the capacity of
frontline staff, including those whose work involves ECD in part or exclusively. The need for such
capacity building was also related to converting the modalities of service delivery. The specific types
of activities included preparation of educational materials (e.g. guidelines) and provision of training.
For example, UNICEF supported the development of a teachers’ guide for organizing effective distant
learning that considers the individual needs of children and their families76 and guidelines for remote
case management for social workers for child protection and justice systems.77 In addition to
developing the guidelines, UNICEF’s partner, Initiative for Social Change, has conducted online
supervision meetings for statutory social workers during the pandemic. Training was organized with
UNICEF’s support e.g. for social workers and psychologists,78 staff of maternity houses as described
above as well as rural primary healthcare professionals (see also below).79 Some training efforts that
had been initiated before the pandemic were continued in the remote mode. The evaluated pilot
training for preschool staff in Adjara is one such effort.
UNICEF CO’s COVID-19 response can also be analyzed through the nature of the interventions.
Many constitute an immediate response to ad hoc demand, such as delivery of supplies and
equipment or production of information and awareness-raising materials. There are also temporary
adjustments to previously planned interventions, such as moving the evaluated pilot training for
preschool staff in Adjara online. Importantly, that intervention itself falls into more systemic
programming aimed at decreasing the preschool staff’s competence gap.
Some responses to COVID-19 are, however, more systemic, and comprehensive interventions
(involving e.g. a combination of knowledge generation, infrastructural development, capacity
building), creating foundations for other fundamental improvements in support of ECD in Georgia.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 22
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
UNICEF’s partnership with the Emergency Situations Coordination and Urgent Assistance Centre,
supported e.g. by the USAID and Caritas Czech Republic, is one example. Its purpose was to: establish
a centralized communication platform fo r rural doctors, equip them with relevant COVID-19
information and tools, as well as strengthen the provision of essential health services in their
catchment areas.80 During the project: (i) a centralized directory of all rural doctors was developed;81
(ii) training was provided to 1,300 rural PHC p rofessionals on COVID-19 cases and conducting remote
maternal and child health consultations;82 (iii) internet access was provided to 85% of the 1,000
targeted rural health clinics and more than one access point was set up in approximately 200 clinics
with multiple medical teams;83 (iv) a cent ralized online platform was set up at the Emergency
Situations Coordination and Urgent Assistance Centre.84 As per UNICEF situation reports, the
ambulatories were actively utilizing the centralized communication platform for training of rural
doctors in 6 regions (Adjara, Guria, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi, Kaketi, Mtskheta-Mtiantei) on topics
related to maternal and child health including post-natal care, immunization and infant and young
child feeding as well as management of COVID-19.85
Finally, some of the interventions constitute new services which can help address some pandemic-
related challenges (e.g. the need for curtailing social contacts), but their scope is wider. These
include the UNICEF-supported Child Hotline 111 or the shared medical appointments (SMAs), both the
object of this evaluation (for details on these interventions, see the subsequent section).
In line with its programme, throughout its pandemic-related activities, UNICEF has maintained a
strong focus on the most vulnerable children and their families, such as ethnic minorities, Roma
communities and children with disabilities.86 It developed educational and awareness-raising
materials including in minority languages, and provided equipment, technical assistance, capacity
building and evidence collection. In partnership with the MAC Foundation, it started a joint production
with the national TV broadcaster for a specialized TV programme in support of children with
disabilities and their parents.87 The programme, launched on 25 April 2020, reached 400,000
viewers.88 A specialized Facebook page was also set up to support parents of children with
disabilities.89 UNICEF and its partner provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Health for
teleservice provision and transformation of the services for children with disabilities,90 leading to the
adoption of a related ordinance.91 UNICEF also supported the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons
from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia to develop a framework for
remote service provision for children with disabilities and their families. Together with MAC Georgia,
it provided support to 400 frontline child protection staff to adjust to the distant working modality and
provide services to children with disabilities and their families during the pandemic.92 It also
conducted and presented to various stakeholders a mapping of social protection measures

provided by the central and local governments for children with disabilities with a view of optimizing
these measures for children with disabilities.93
Finally, support activities have also been provided in Abkhazia. Among others, UNICEF (i) supported
local stakeholders in developing rapid preparedness and response plans, covering risk and
awareness communication messages, patient routing, contact tracing, immunization-related
interventions, guidelines on pregnant women, and breastfeeding during the COVID-19 and trained
social workers; (ii) trained social workers w orking with vulnerable families; and produced positive
parenting videos for the region, each reaching around 18,000 people through social media channels.
94 Much emphasis was placed on capacity building e.g. through: (i) advocacy and technical
assistance to pediatricians in the region to restart immunization;95 (ii) IPC training for 38 primary
healthcare nurses and assistants;96 (iii) trainings on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
over 4 separate sessions for 81 healthcare workers from the Gagra, Gali, Sukhumi, Gulripshi and
Ochamchira districts.97
Overall, UNICEF’s response to COVID-19 has been comprehensive, including all programme
components, interventions with different objectives (communication, awareness-raining, capacity-
building, technical assistance, provision of equipment, etc.) and of different nature (ad hoc
responsive actions, temporary adjustments of services, new services, and systemic efforts). Two
special foci have also been maintained throughout the pandemic – on vulnerable children and their
families, such as ethnic minorities, Roma communities and children with disabilities, as well as on
Abkhazia.

This evaluation’s overarching purpose was to provide a critical assessment of the key adaptations
made in UNICEF ECD programming in the ECA region to meet the changing needs of young children
and families. The secondary purposes of this evaluation are to: (i) provide timely feedback and
generate learning to inform further development of the assessed ECD activities adapted or newly
designed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; and to (ii) provide evidence to inform future ECD
efforts in similar emergencies.
The objectives of the evaluation were to:
• assess the extent to which the ECD activities (interventions) are being implemented in the
selected countries, how they are meeting the needs of young children and families, especially
when their needs change as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, and
• assess the effectiveness of the ECD activities in improved programming and systems
strengthening support to governments in the selected countries.

Based on these questions, a list of sub-questions was developed that is presented in Annex A4, Vol. 2
of the Country Report: Georgia.
The evaluation did not foresee the analysis of efficiency with respect to the adaptations, hence it only
includes limited data on their financial aspects or monitoring and evaluation. No cost analysis was
foreseen.
The intended primary users of the evaluation results are: (i) the UNICEF COs selected as the in-depth
study countries; (ii) the UNICEF ECARO; (iii) national governments in the studied countries; and (iv)
other UNICEF partners in the studied countries, such as civil society organizations (CSO), community-
based organizations (CBOs) and donors (e.g. international development agencies of different
countries). The findings will also be useful to those UNICEF COs which are starting their new
programme cycles in 2021 to reflect on the lessons learned that are applicable to their contexts. In
the short term perspective, the evaluation findings can help in further implementation or
mainstreaming of the new services or adaptations introduced in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. In the longer term, they will hopefully inform the ECD programming in the future, in general
and in relation to emergencies such as COVID-19 to ensure the continuity of ECD-related services.
In terms of temporal scope, the evaluation covered interventions implemented from March 2020
when the COVID-19 outbreak started and up to the moment of their evaluation (completed
interventions were evaluated up until their end). The geographic scope covered all Georgia, while the
focus of one intervention was located in Adjara region specifically.
As to substantive scope, specific interventions for evaluation were selected based on a set of criteria
described below, since covering all interventions and adaptations implemented in response to
COVID-19 was impossible for their sheer volume and extent. Thus, the evaluation focused on
interventions which:
• were either introduced directly in response to COVID-19 or in some way adapted to its new
realities; and
• entail capacity building or information support to the frontline workers; and
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 25
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
• were viewed by the UNICEF COs as especially useful to have feedback on for the purpose of
future programming.
In line with the ToR, activities which do not fall under these criteria were not covered by the
evaluation.98 As a result, primary data collection focused on interventions aimed at building frontline
worker capacities or involving frontline staff in general.
In the spirit of developmental evaluation (see section 2.2.3 on methodology), various elements of the
evaluation methodology (e.g. evaluation purpose, objectives and scope, including criteria for
selecting interventions and their final selectio n, etc.) and process (e.g. interim results) were discussed
with UNICEF ECARO and COs during multiple working meetings. Based on these discussions, some of
the initial assumptions, e.g. related to evaluation purposes and objectives, were reformulated as
compared to the Terms of reference (see annexed in Volume 2) to reflect better UNICEF’s needs and
the nature of the evaluated activities.
The next section describes in more detail the specific object of the evaluation in Georgia, which is the
core of this country evaluation report.
2.2.2 Evaluation object in Georgia
In Georgia, three interventions were chosen for the final inclusion in this report. They relate to child
protection (Child Hotline 111), early childhood education (pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara)
and maternal health (shared medical appointments for pregnant women – SMAs). Table 1 below
presents descriptions of these interventions. Additionally, the UNICEF’s overall ECD programme and
wider COVID-19 response were also reviewed to the extent necessary to provide context (as
described in sections 2.1.1.-2.1.3) for the evaluation of the three selected interventions.
The selection of interventions was based on the criteria described in the previous section and the
preferences expressed by the UNICEF CO. During the inception stage, UNICEF CO requested one
intervention – the Child Hotline 111 – to be assessed throughout two assessment cycles. This was a
departure from the approach selected for other countries (i.e. three interventions assessed in three
cycles), but it responded to the capacity of the CO and allowed for registering changes in the
intervention over time. Hence, it was the sole focus of the primary data collection and analysis during
the evaluation until the development of the final report and more evidence was generated about this
intervention.
For the purpose of the country report, UNICEF asked that two more interventions are also evaluated
in the context of broader programming – the SMAs and the pilot training in Adjara. Given their later
addition, the evaluation of these interventions should be treated as a more lightweight assessment
(see also the section 2.2.3 on limitations), focused mainly on their relevance.
As a result of adopting a dynamic developmental approach and incorporating UNICEF’s preferences,
the evaluation included two layers:
1. Layer 1 involved an in-depth assessment of the Child Hotline 111, carried out within two rapid
data collection and assessment cycles (see section 2.2.3 on methodology). Two analytical
briefs and a reflection workshop were devoted specifically to this intervention and contained
98 Excluded interventions: interventions which focus on the provision of COVID-19-related guidelines and recommendations
to government bodies and other actors, provision of learning/health kits to children/mothers, or the provision of training
directly to the caregivers without training or preparing the frontline workers.

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
more intervention-specific findings and recommendations. Where the current report lacks
detail specific to this intervention, the analytical briefs (Annexes A1.1. and A1.2 in Volume 2 of
this report, ) should offer more inform ation.
2. Layer 2 involved assessment of the pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara and the SMAs,
as additional interventions which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the evaluation and were
requested for review at a later stage of the evaluation. The evaluation of these interventions
was based on available primary data provided by UNICEF and desk research (see section 2.2.3
on methodology).

The Child Hotline 111
• Rights holders targeted as final beneficiaries: children, youth, and caregivers
• Geographic scope: Georgia
• Timeframe: 21st April 2020 – until today
• Overall UNICEF contribution to the budget: approx. USD 40,27099
The Child Hotline 111 began working at the end of April 2020. Its launch was based on Resolution No.
701, adopted by the Government of Georgia (GoG) on 21st April 2020 as part of its response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Child Hotline 111 was an initiative of the Human Rights and Civil Integration Committee of the
Parliament of Georgia. It was implemented with UNICEF’s financial and technical support in
partnership with a legal entity of public law – the Agency for State Care and Assistance for the
(Statutory) Victims of Human Trafficking (ASCA). Apart from UNICEF’s own financial resources, the
hotline received funding from the UK Government – DFID (as part of Coronavirus Global Response
– UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children UK Aid).
While UNICEF continues to provide technical assistance (e.g. support of national and international
consultants), the Child Hotline 111 is currently supervised and managed by ASCA whose operations
fall within the mandate of the GoG, specifically the Ministry of the Internally Displaced Persons from
the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social Affairs. The GoG also assumed a full responsibility
for financing the intervention. Other stakeholders that are important for the hotline’s successful
operation include in particular child-related service providers to which the hotline refers its callers,
including in particular municipal authorities with responsibilities in child protection, but also
relevant civil society organizations (CSOs) or community-based organizations (CBOs). Linkages
between the hotline and law enforcement bodies, as well as education and health care providers
are also of significance when thinking about the hotline’s work.
The hotline’s main purposes are to: (i) facilitate access to services (social, health, educational) and
benefits for children and families offered by state and municipal structures; and (ii) provide
psychological support to children and families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Its
secondary purpose is to increase the authorities’ knowledge on children’s and caregivers’ needs
and on the bottlenecks in service provision. The intervention’s basic theory of change constructed
during the evaluation was included in section 3.2.1 devoted to its effectiveness.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 27
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
Importantly, the Child Hotline 111 targets all children, without necessarily focusing on ECD ages.
However, it assists parents or other caregivers of young children (0-7) by providing them with
information about available state and m unicipal services, including benefits for children and
families, or by referring the callers to particular state service providers. In June 2020, the hotline
expanded its operational scope to address the mental health and psycho-social needs of
adolescents and young people during COV ID-19.
The Child Hotline 111 services are free of ch arge. Until May 2021, the services were offered from 10
a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. Since June 2021, in response to the existing needs of the targeted rights
holders, the hotline has provided services 24/7. Its staff consists of 11 persons, including eight hotline
operators, two psychologists, and a coordinator. When required, the hotline’s staff is supported by
additional personnel of the ASCA. Following the hotline’s launch, its operators received online
training on the services and procedures within governmental structures, the rules for hotline
operators, as well as subjects such as effective communication (asking questions in the right
manner, using clarifying questions, determining the problem and response) and psychological
counseling.
Shared medical appointments (SMAs)100
• Rights holders targeted as final beneficiaries: pregnant women
• Geographic scope: Georgia
• Timeframe: May 2020 – October 2020101
• Overall UNICEF contribution to the budget: USD 66,000
The service was introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was implemented
by UNICEF in partnership with governmental actors – the National Center for Disease Control
(NCDC) and the Birth Registry Office – whose employees were responsible for calling all pregnant
women in the country (estimated 26,000 women) to inform them about the appointments,
convince them about the value of participation and arrange their participation.
The SMAs main aims, as per the Terms of reference and further description received by UNICEF,
were to: (i) mitigate the risks associated with COVID-19 by remotely providing qualified medical
consultations on pregnancy-related issues; (ii) inform pregnant women about the COVID-19
prevention measures, pregnancy related issues and further antenatal care (ANC) services, as
needed. The consultations were not meant to replace the government-funded ANC visits. The SMAs
were to equip pregnant women with minimum knowledge enabling them to make informed
decisions, to utilize ANC visits and actively participate and control the processes which directly
affect their lives.
The project involved organization and delivery of online SMAs, each conducted by one of 10
carefully selected medical professionals for around 20-25 pregnant women. The appointments
lasted for two hours and were divided into three parts devoted to: (i) information about the COVID-
19; (ii) Q&A session on pregnancy-related issues; (iii) sharing experience session.
100 Description below based on the briefing received from UNICEF and interview with a UNICEF representative on 6th
September 2021.
101 This is the timeframe when the SMAs were actually conducted, as per the monitoring data provided by UNICEF.

Pilot training “Supporting Implementation of Early and Preschool Education National
Standards in Adjara Region through preschool-based coaching”102
• Rights holders targeted: staff in 8 pilot preschools
• Rights holders targeted as final beneficiaries: children attending preschools
• Geographic scope: Adjara region, Batumi and Khulo municipalities
• Timeframe: June 2020 – February 2021
• Approximate budget: approx. 33,000 USD103
Implemented in 2020, the pilot training aimed at strengthening knowledge and competency of
preschools staff, as well as to develop a training model for scale-up in Georgia. It was not
developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the online training mode was introduced in
response to the crisis.
In partnership with the regional government of Adjara (the Ministry of Education, Culture and
Sports), UNICEF piloted the training in two municipalities – Batumi and Khulo, covering five urban
preschools in the former and three rural preschools in the latter. Eight pilot preschools teams
(educators, assistants, special educators, administrators) participated in online synchronous
training.
As part of the project, six thematic training modules were developed amounting to 132 contact
hours on the following themes: Module 1: Early and Preschool Education Standards – key areas and
methodological issues; Module 2: Child development in early years; Module 3: Child observation;
Module 4: Child-centered environment in preschool; Module 5: Teaching and learning in early years
(methodology); Module 6: Partnership with families. Eight pilot preschools teams (educators,
assistants, special educators, administrators) participated in online synchronous training on all
those modules.
During June-July 2020, the consultant responsible for project implementation held online meetings
with the staff of the pilot kindergartens on: Law on early and preschool education, standards and
regulations; state standards for early and preschool education; child development standard -
areas of development and thematic directions; quality standard; child observation and portfolio;
planning and implementation of educational environment: social environment, physical
environment, schedule; play at an early years; positive discipline; educational process planning
and evaluation, self-evaluation; family engagement strategies.
While planned for as face-to-face, due to COVID-19 the training was conducted online.
Nevertheless, several on-site coaching sessions were also organized. They lasted full day per
preschool and focused on physical environment, team collaboration and professional reflection.
Additionally, 1- to 2-hour online weekly coaching sessions were held with each preschool team with
a focus on issues jointly selected by the preschool team and coach.

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
As part of this pilot project, UNICEF conducted a webinar “Distance Learning in Early Childhood and
Preschool Education” for preschool managers and education specialists of Adjara kindergartens.104
Around 100 participants attended the sessio ns on how to support youngest children’s learning and
development remotely in low and high technology contexts.105
Beyond the pilot training, from June 2021, UNICEF launched a partnership with the Ministry of
Education and Science of Georgia and the Teacher Professional Development Center (TPDC) to
continue supporting pilot preschools throu gh regular practice-based coaching. The project will
last 12 months and will implement the lessons learned during the pilot.106
2.2.3 Evaluation approach, methodology and limitations
2.2.3.1 Evaluation approach
In line with the developmental evaluation approach, the evaluation focused on a.) collecting and
analyzing real-time data to answer the evaluation questions and b.) supporting the use of the
obtained evidence for ongoing programme adaptation.
For this purpose, data on the interventions' relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability was collected
through: (i) continous desk research and analysis of available data throughout the whole process;
(ii) two rapid assessment cycles, involving primary data collection, analysis and feedback, which
resulted in the development of two analytical briefs annexed to this report; (iii) reflection on the
evaluation process and results, which involved multiple working meetings with UNICEF ECARO and the
CO, and a reflection workshop which included other stakeholders (e.g. national authorities).
At the beginning of the first cycle, the evaluators re-constructed a simplified theory of change (ToCs)
for the intervention selected for the first layer of analysis, based on desk review and scoping
interviews with UNICEF Ukraine CO. The ToC was used to: i) provide an overall picture of the analyzed
projects, since none were developed before; ii) develop interview/survey questions; and iii) assess
outputs/outcomes, where possible. As such, the ToC’s purpose was not to carry out a rigorous
evaluation against them (please see the ToC in Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A1.1).
Figure 1 outlines the key steps taken as part of a rapid assessment cycle.

The developmental nature of this evaluation was reflected in the many changes introduced in the
overall approach and methodology throughout the evaluation. These included smaller tweaks such
as adjustment of data collection tools, but also bigger alterations, e.g. a change in the data collection
methods between the first and second rapid assessment cycles. For instance, conducting two rapid
data collection and in-depth analysis cycles in Georgia constituted a departure from the multi-
country approach developed during the inception phase, where three cycles per country were
envisaged. Following the consultations with UNICEF, the first cycle concentrated on the Child Hotline
111 as a service catering to the needs of children and parents delivered through frontline workers, while
the second explored the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of the hotline as a mechanisms
for monitoring and identifying beneficiaries’ needs and gaps in service provision. These different
focuses correspond to the two short-term outcomes identified in the simplified theory of change
(ToC) recreated for this intervention (see Analytical Brief in Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A1). Also, in
agreement with UNICEF, the evaluators resigned from the survey during the second cycle of data
collection and conducted individual in-depth interviews instead, as these were considered more
informative.
In addition to the in-depth analysis, two interventions were selected during the final synthesis phase
for complementary desk research- and interview-based, “light” assessment, and reviewed.107 Hence,
instead of the rapid data collection cycle, the evaluators conducted a series of semi-structured
interviews with UNICEF focal points and Implementing Partners for interventions selected for the
second layer of analysis (please see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A0: Stakeholder mapping). Such an
approach helped to view ECD from a broader perspective and thus provided a wider knowledge-
base for UNICEF’s upcoming programmatic adjustments.
As mentioned earlier, the evaluation entailed an element of a formative inquiry to help shape the
future of ECD programming in the four countries concerned. This Country Report, developed in
accordance with UNICEF quality standards for evaluations, is the primary manifestation of this
approach.
2.2.3.2 Data collection and analysis
The evaluators used a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques to collect the data. These
included:
107 The methodology agreed during the evaluation’s inception phase did not envisage ToCs to be developed for these
interventions.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 31
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
• desk research: including primary and secondary sources concerning ECD in Georgia, UNICEF’s
programme and COVID-19 related activities in the country, as well as the three evaluated
interventions specifically;
• two cycles of data collection and analysis related to the Child Hotline 111:
1. The first cycle – carried out in March 2021 – included a survey with all frontline workers
involved in the hotline. The survey was distributed to all of the frontline workers via e-
mail. We received 7 survey responses out of 8 questionnaires sent.
In this cycle, we also conducted 9 key informant interviews (KIIs) within five categories
of respondents: (i) frontline workers (3 KIIs), (i) implementing partners (1 KII), (iii)
selected governmental officials (2 KIIs), (iv) local leaders of public services (2 KIIs) and
(v) UNICEF CO’s staff (1 KII);
2. The second cycle – carried out in July 2021 – included: 3 KIIs with representatives of
state institutions, 2 with representatives of the NGO sector, 3 with UNICEF CO staff and
5 with frontline workers;
• two additional KIIs with representatives of UNICEF CO devoted to the pilot training in Adjara
and the SMAs.
In the case of Child Hotline 111, which was the subject of rapid assessments, respondents for KIIs were
selected based on a stakeholder mapping carried out jointly by the evaluators and the CO staff
(please see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A0: Stakeholder mapping). Stakeholders were mapped
according to their degree of influence and impact on the intervention and those with the most
influence and impact were selected for individual interviews. In the case of SMAs and the pilot
training, given the timing of the interviews, i.e. after the period foreseen for data collection, we were
only able to hold two additional interviews with UNICEF staff to gain the CO’s, insider persepctive on
their implementation.
The qualitative data from interviews and a survey was subject to thematic analysis carried out using
MAXQDA. The evaluation team used coding to develop themes by identifying items of analytic
interest in the data and tagging these with a coding label. The quantitative data gathered from the
surveys was subject to quantitative data analysis. This included studying the distributions, spreads,
and centers of responses. Cross-tabulation was also used to investigate potential correlations
between variables.
2.2.3.3 Formulation and implementation of solutions
Based on each rapid assessment cycle, the key findings, conclusions, and preliminary
recommendations were drawn up in the form of analytical briefs (see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex 1:
Analytical Briefs). The briefs were reviewed by the UNICEF ECARO and the CO and revised based on
their feedback.
After the first rapid assessment cycle, a reflection workshop was organized with members of the
UNICEF Georgia CO, UNICEF ECARO, and relevant key stakeholders, including national authorities. The
primary purpose of the workshops was to provide space for evaluative reflection, prioritize and refine
the recommendations, and discuss how they could be best implemented. The secondary purpose
was to build capacity for evaluative thinking, increase understanding and ownership of the findings
and, accordingly, the likelihood that they will actually be used. After the workshops, the evaluators
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 32
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
prepared a short note with the key takeaways from the workshop (see Annex 2 to Volume 2 of this
report). After the second rapid assessment, a decision was made with UNICEF to use the regional
workshop as an opportunity for reflection, in stead of organizing a dedicated one only for Georgian
stakeholders. This was due to the temporal constraints at that stage of the evaluation.
On that basis, the UNICEF Georgia CO prepared a document with the key actions to be taken. It is the
evaluators’ understanding that these actions were implemented, fulfilling the objectives of the
developmental evaluation.
2.2.3.4 Limitations
The research faced several limitations related to the methodology, scope and availability of data:
• Developmental evaluations focus on collecting “good enough” evidence to provide rapid
feedback that makes adaptations in real-time possible. More important than methodological
rigor is to provide inputs and advice into ongoing programming. To avoid jeopardizing the
rapid nature of the data collection and analysis cycles, a decision was taken not to conduct
interviews with the rights holders (i.e. children and their families) of the interventions. In effect,
the evaluators had to rely on secondary evidence and the views of frontline workers to
generate findings on the relevance and effectiveness of the interventions for the final
beneficiaries. For similar reasons, reconstruction of detailed ToCs and heavy reliance on ToCs
were not possible and the participation of other duty bearers (government, CSOs) was
relatively limited.
• The validity of the findings was negatively affected by the limited availability of data
concerning interventions assessed or documented as part of analysis second layer of analysis.
Triangulation of desk research and interview data was applied to back the findings. For SMAs
and the pilot training, two additional KIIs with UNICEF were conducted, which was a function of
methodological design, and budgetary and time limitations at that stage in the evaluation.
The evaluators also used the available primary data provided by UNICEF (e.g. monitoring
statistics for the SMAs, and the satisfaction survey and videos for the pilot training108) and
additional desk research. The late inclusion of the SMAs and the pilot training in Adjara in the
evaluation, in turn, made the development of their ToCs impossible within the project.
• While evidence is “good enough” to provide lightweight preliminary observations on the SMAs
and the pilot training, as part of a developmental evaluation, more research would be
necessary to provide strength and depth to our conclusions. The latter vary between all three
interventions, which has been reflected in the findings section. The evidence on the SMAs and
the pilot training in Adjara was also more limited due to the pilot nature of these interventions.
At the same time, the Child Hotline 111 is at a very early stage in terms of its development, which
also presents challenges for making strong conclusions, especially on its relevance and
effectiveness.
• While wider primary data collection was conducted for the evaluation of the Child Hotline 111,
the rapid nature of assessments also put a limit on the extent of this exercise. The survey was
conducted with all hotline workers employed at the time, but the evaluators could not carry
extensive qualitative data collection. Consequently, the interviewee samples could be
108 Satisfaction surveys were available for the SMAs or the Child Hotline 111 interventions.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 33
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
considered as small. Although, in this context, we would underline the qualitative nature of the
exercise, the in-depth character of interviews and the fact that we received similar feedback
from different respondents. Additiona lly, the perspectives of different stakeholders have been
sought based on the stakeholder mapping carried out at the inception phase. Ideally, we
would have like to further explore the perspectives of municipalities and other local leaders of
service providers, as these have been represented to a lesser degree.
• The Child Hotline 111 as a service aims to reach children also beyond the ECD age. This makes
it difficult or even impossible to determine which results relate specifically to children within
that age range. To make sure the focus is maintained, the survey with hotline workers explicitly
asked about vulnerable children under 7 years of age and so was the emphasis in the
interviews.
• The evaluators were not involved in the process of change inspired by the evaluation findings
as different interventions were assessed throughout the three rapid data collection cycles
(instead of repeating the assessment of one). Such an approach was agreed with the UNICEF
ECA RO to collect more data and increase the utility of findings for future programming.
Consequently, it was impossible to describe how the interventions under review adapted
based on the generation of real-time evidence and timely decision-making – not assessed.
• Operational efficiency, and efficiency in general, were not within the scope of this evaluation.
Monitoring and evaluation frameworks were only reviewed from the perspective of their
contribution to achieving outputs and outcomes.
• Upon the request of the UNICEF CO and UNICEF ECARO, the analysis covered a narrow COVID-
19 context only, which means that the interventions were not analyzed from a broad child rights
perspective.
• Gender-disaggregated data and quantitative data disaggregated by vulnerable groups were
limited.
2.2.3.5 Ethics
The evaluation methodology in Georgia did not foresee data collection with child participants or
representatives of other particularly vulnerable groups. However, it did involve respondents through
the survey and interviews. Consequently, the team followed the highest standards of ethics, including
the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis
(2021)109, the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation (2020)110, and the ethical protocol designed for the
purpose of this study (see Country Report Vol. 2, Annex A.5). The evaluation team respected the
following principles111 throughout its engagement with UNICEF: Respect for dignity and diversity; Fair
representation; Compliance with codes for vulnerable groups (e.g., ethics of research involving young
children or vulnerable groups); Redress; Confidentiality; and Avoidance of harm.

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
3.0 Findings
3.1 Relevance
This section explores the relevance of the an alyzed UNICEF interventions in Georgia to the needs of:
(i) young children and their families, including those who are worst off, (ii) frontline workers and (iii)
UNICEF’s broader ECD programme. It considers the interventions’ alignment with both long-standing,
critical needs of these groups and the need s which emerged and evolved over time in the dynamic
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It presents the analyzed interventions in the context of UNICEF’s
wider ECD programming, highlighting synergies and complementarities between the different
actions.
3.1.1 Relevance to the needs of young children and their families
This section focuses on two evaluated interventions, namely the Child Hotline 111 and the SMAs, as
interventions which directly targeted children and their parents, including pregnant women.
3.1.1.1 Relevance of the Child Hotline 111 to the needs of young children and their
families
Evidence collected during the evaluation indicates that the Child Hotline 111 is relevant to the needs
of young children and their families, especially in the context of COVID-19 when access to other
service providers was limited. The available statistical data shows that the caregivers of young
children who phoned the hotline mostly sought information about social and health-related issues.
The interviewed respondents indicated that the pandemic increased demand for social services due
to, among others, halted social and educational service provision, limited access to goods and
restrictions on movement. As one respondent explained:
“municipalities are very slow in responding to queries, they have very different timeframes across
the response times, and online working [during COVID-19] has been difficult for them” so “the hotline
can support them in connecting with vulnerable families, because municipalities are not strong in
outreach”.
The Child Hotline is the first coordinated mechanism for children and their families based on “one call
– full service” concept. As such, it aims to respond to the fullest possible spectrum of children’s needs.
The hotline staff perceived the Child Hotline 111 as relevant in terms of providing callers with
necessary information about different services or referrals to such services. According to their
survey responses, the specific needs for information of vulnerable children under 7 years of age and
their families have been covered fully (4 out of 7 responses) or partially (3 out of 7 responses). All
survey participants agreed that the hotline services fully responded to the needs of vulnerable
children and their families for information related to the social care area. The needs for information
or referral related to protection from abuse and violence, and psychological support were highly
assessed—in both cases 6 out of 7 respondents indicated that the hotline responded “to the full
extent”. The needs for information or referral related to housing and home adaptations, in turn, were
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 35
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
covered to a lesser degree—one survey participant indicated that they have not been covered at all,
while 4 out of 7 pointed to partial coverage.
The key informants interviewed during the first rapid assessment cycle observed that children’s
needs have been changing since the beginning of the intervention, which is important for the
future service development. In their view, they gradually shifted from the predominant focus on
social services (e.g. food provision, cash assistance, health issues) towards an increased demand for
psychological support and education. They also indicated that the cases of violence are still rarely
reported, although violence against children is a serious problem in Georgia.

The initial spike in social issues could be related to the initiation of the hotline itself, which also
coincided with the imposition of restrictions and closure of services. This new situation created a need
for information on accessing services under COVID-19. Between April 2020 and July 2020, there is a
significant drop in the number of calls associated with social issues, which could have been related
to the easing of restrictions. In the following months, the fraction fluctuates, although to a smaller
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 36
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
degree, between 30% and 50%. This clearly illustrates that the hotline is primarily a point of reference
for social issues (e.g. food provision, cash assistance).
In contrast, less often calls were related to health issues, with only about 10% of calls in the first months
of hotline’s activity. The proportion of calls that were related to health issues was steadily rising until
the beginning of 2021, which could be related to the first dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases in
Georgia between September 2020 and January 2021.112
Figure 1 also illustrates the (absolute) number of calls labelled by the hotline as concerning VAC.
There is a visible spike in September 2020, w hich was the month that the number of COVID-19 cases
in Georgia began to significantly rise. Upon closer inspection, as illustrated in Figure 2, such a simple
correlation is not warranted.

The low number of cases in the first months could be attributed to low awareness about the hotline.
Considering the number of VAC cases in relation to the total number of calls received, instead of
absolute numbers, spikes are visible in August 2020, February 2021, and June 2021, followed by drops
of some 10 percentage points. This could be related to lockdown measures introduced in Georgia
during the pandemic, however, an additional in-depth analysis would be needed to verify such a
hypothesis.
Within this study, the interviews held unequivocally suggest that the cases of violence are still rarely
reported, although VAC is identified as an issue of concern in Georgia. In fact, while not yet reflected
in the official statistics, COVID-19 related measures, such as lockdowns, are believed to have
112 Available at: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/georgia
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 37
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
increased the number of VAC cases, which would be compounded by the closure of traditional
services involving reporting mechanisms (e.g. schools, social protection institutions or medical
facilities). In the absence of traditional servic es, the Child Hotline 111 could, therefore, contribute to the
increase in reporting thanks to remote service-delivery, guarantees of confidentiality and a relative
ease of access.
3.1.1.2 Relevance of shared medical appointments (SMAs) to the needs of
pregnant women
Due to the evaluation’s focus on the Child Hotline 111, limited evidence was collected on the relevance
of the SMA service, both as a response to the challenges of the pandemic and systemic needs which
existed before the crisis. Our results suggest that the service was generally relevant for
participants, although also point to the need for more research on pregnant women’s needs and
specific reasons why many declined the opportunity to participate in SMAs.
The service allowed the state to ensure better access to ANC during the pandemic, when such
access was restricted, either due to governmental actions or self-isolation. UNICEF CO’s
representative reported that the uptake in antenatal services at the beginning of the pandemic was
observed to be roughly 5% smaller than in the previous year and the tendency was confirmed in the
following months.113 While we have not been able to identify the specific data on the decreased uptake
of ANC in Georgia, recent research confirms that “reduced maternity healthcare-seeking and
healthcare provision during the COVID-19 pandemic has been global and must be considered as
potentially contributing to worsening of pregnancy outcomes observed during the pandemic.”114
Outcomes that have worsened include maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and
maternal depression; with disparities in outcomes identified between high- and low-resource
settings.115 Research results thus confirm “an urgent need to prioritize safe, accessible, and equitable
maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.”116 In this
context, the SMAs respond to this need and fall within a global trend of increasing virtual and remote
ANC during the COVID-19 crisis.117
At the beneficiary level, there are some indications that the service was relevant to participants’
needs, although the evidence is weak, since the evaluators did not have access to satisfaction
surveys. A UNICEF CO’s representative reported that the overall participant response was positive,
for example that they would request follow-up sessions.118 Attending pregnant women reported that
during their self-isolation, the SMAs had a calming effect by allowing them to spend time with
clinicians and connect with each other.119 So not only can the online but also the shared character of
SMAs be seen as an important COVID-19-related adaptation; the more so given the globally
worsening maternal depression outcomes noted above.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 38
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
Apart from explicit declarations, there are also other indications that antenatal consultations in the
shape of SMAs were of value to participants. As a UNICEF CO’s representative reported, the questions
that pregnant women would ask during SMAs were very simple, which suggests an existing
information gap. While this could be interpreted in the light of limited opportunities in terms of health
education and promotion available to pregnant women in Georgia,120 it could also point to other
phenomena, e.g. that some women are hesit ant to ask basic questions, including e.g. for fear of being
judged. More research could help understand the knowledge needs to be covered in potential
continuations of this service.
While the general pregnancy-related subjects and sharing experiences seemed relevant, the
COVID-19 focus of the SMAs has apparently enjoyed less of beneficiaries’ interest, as reported by a
UNICEF CO’s representative.121 Initially, the service was to consist of three components: (i) a lecture on
COVID-19, lasting about 45 minutes; (ii) Q&A session on pregnancy-related issues, lasting 45 minutes;
and (iii) sharing experience session, lasting about 20-30 minutes. However, the organizers noticed
that interest in the COVID-19-related material was not as high as initially foreseen and shortened the
COVID-19 lecture. The remaining time was devoted to the Q&A session. This shows the organizers’
attention to pregnant women’s needs and flexibility in the approach to accommodate them.
The online mode of service delivery is generally relevant and offers other advantages, beyond
allowing for service provision to continue during the time of lockdowns and self-isolation. Before
the intervention was launched, the organizers called selected pregnant women to assess their
willingness to participate in SMAs. It turned out that for discussions of personal issues, women prefer
to have face-to-face consultations, but more general questions and information sharing were
acceptable in remote and group format.122 As the SMA experience may suggest, participation which
ensures anonymity can foster better information sharing, even though engaging participants was
one of the challenges identified by the interviewed UNICEF CO’s representative. In any event, those
women who are more reluctant to come forward can benefit from the discussions. The SMAs offered
women from all regions of Georgia access to advice and information from the best medical
professionals in the country. The doctors were also available for a substantial amount of time, which
addressed the problem of women receiving insufficient time from their usual doctors. While not
mentioned during the evaluation, one can also hypothesize that another factor supporting online
consultations could be convenience, especially for those women who need to reduce activities such
as moving and traveling during their pregnancy.
However, the online mode was not relevant for all pregnant women invited to participate since 421
of them replied negatively to the invitation due to the lack of Internet availability. The highest number
of refusals on this ground was noted in the Imereti region – 110 women, which constituted almost 12%
of all negative replies in this region.123 Shida Kartli and Samegrelo were some of the other regions with
an above 5% rate of negative replies due to Internet availability. Overall this reason was not frequently
quoted (5% of all negative replies), but it shows that there are still (infra)structural barriers which will
make this type of an adaptation not a universally accessible option.
With all the possible benefits the SMAs could offer, most invited women declined the invitation or
resigned from participation at a later stage (see also section 3.2.2).124 Table 2 below shows a list of

reasons for a negative reply per region. While some (e.g. ‘Pregnancy did not progress’) are objective
circumstances that will always lower uptake, others (e.g. ‘Already consulted a doctor’, ‘Feel well & not
interested’ or ‘Just does not want to’) may indicate limited relevance of the service to pregnant
women. They may also derive from other factors, e.g. low health awareness, lacking knowledge of the
potential benefits, hidden discomfort with the shared character or online mode, etc.

With more knowledge, these reasons could be better addressed by specific measures, such as
awareness-raising, better advertising campaigns or modifications to the service itself to increase its
relevance (e.g. introduction of new subjects, more timeslots in the schedule or shorter SMAs as an
additional choice, etc.).
Our results, therefore, show a need for a better understanding of: (i) the benefits of the SMAs to the
participants, which are only hinted at here due too the lack of data; (ii) the added value that SMAs
present for the existing service offer; and (iii) pregnant women’s needs and reasons for resignation,
including any underlying mechanisms or hidden motivations. Gaining deeper insight into these
issues is paramount for deciding about the service’s mainstreaming and, should such a path be
chosen, could help increase its relevance and effectiveness in the future.
3.1.2 Relevance to the needs of frontline workers
The pilot training organized by UNICEF for selected kindergartens from Adjara is relevant to the
needs of frontline workers. It provided an opportunity to develop competences and mainstream
relevant national standards, whereas both these aspects are lacking in the Georgian preschool
sector. It also aimed to go beyond traditional training, using the whole-school practice-based
competency building approach with initial training followed by regular coaching. In this way, the
training supports the implementation of Georgia’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of
the Child. As noted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, “States parties must ensure that the
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 40
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
institutions, services and facilities responsible for early childhood conform to quality standards […]
and that staff possess the appropriate psychosocial qualities and are suitable, sufficiently numerous
and well-trained.”125
The training addressed a competence gap among preschool staff in Geogia. There is a broad
consensus that education and competences of staff in the ECEC impact the quality of ECEC and,
consequently, children’s outcomes.126 However, the 2018 data from 57 municipalities in Georgia
showed that 44% of caregivers were unqu alified; 50% of directors did not have an ECEC related
education and 13 municipalities did not have a single caregiver with a relevant bachelor’s degree in
ECEC.127 These results show a significant knowledge and competence gap among preschool
professionals. Additionally, based on the Law on Early and Preschool Education and Care, in 2017 the
Government of Georgia developed Professional Standards for Caregiver-Pedagogues and National
Standards for Early and Preschool Education. But, the implementation of those standards remains a
challenge, e.g. due to the low capacity and inadequate competences of both preschool practitioners
and administrators, as well as municipal governments.128 Importantly, the quoted 2018 study revealed
that ECEC staff in high mountainous regions and regions with ethnic minorities are not familiar with
the standards and do not have access to supportive resources.129 At the same time, the mandatory
one-time educator in-service training lasts only 66 hours, which is insufficient for the transformation
of practice in line with the national standards.130 Finally, continuous professional development
opportunities are limited.131 The pilot training incorporated professional standards and early and
preschool education standards, aiming to develop the knowledge and skills of preschool staff in
line with systemic needs. Importantly, it covered both urban and rural preschools, and despite
limitations imposed by COVID-19, it tried to combine theoretical and practical elements, which is
indispensable for acquisition of adequate ECEC competences.132
The results of the survey conducted in June 2020133 shared by UNICEF with
the evaluation team suggest that the training was also relevant from the
participants’ perspective. As many as 35 (76%) of the surveyed
participants (n=46) stated that the coaching was very interesting, while 5
(11%) that it was mostly so. There were no negative answers. The working
methods were also appreciated, with 25 people (54%) stating that they
liked the course of the training, six (13%) noting that they especially liked
the theoretical part and 10 (22%) that they especially liked filling out
questionnaires. Two more respondents indicated that they liked both
elements. The participants were provided with homework, which they also found interesting – 29

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
(63%) stated that it was very interesting; 10 (22%) – mostly and 3 (7%) – partly. The survey responses
were overwhelmingly positive, suggesting high relevance of the intervention.
In terms of relevance, only one more concrete recommendation was made to include more
internal communication between project participants (“I would like to get to know other
kindergarten participants who are listening to the training with us”). This would be in line with
recommendations from the 2018 study, suggesting that professional exchanges between preschool
staff are rare in Georgia, yet positive for cont inuous professional development.134
The fact that the training targeted not only preschool educators but also supporting staff, such as
assistants and inclusion support staff (special educators or psychologists), additionally increases its
relevance. Research shows that staff involved in inclusive education has a particular need for
building their professional competencies.135 As the pilot training report notes, “staff working [in] the
position of special educator, psychologist themselves do not have appropriate education, therefore
they cannot provide the necessary assistance to educators.”136 The project can thus offer a lesson for
future educational initiatives which should target a broader audience. Specific training could also be
conducted for this staff group, as their responsibilities and professional needs are also quite distinct.
The training was accompanied by provision of equipment and adjusting the interiors of
kindergartens to make them truly child-friendly, whenever possible. This aspect of the
intervention addresses an important gap in resource availability in preschools in Georgia.137 As
research shows, spending on resources per child is minimal with data from 56 municipalities
revealing that 62.5% of them spend less than 10 Georgian Lari per child annually on educational
resources (some spend as low as GEL 0.73 and 1.11).138 ECEC services located in high mountainous or
ethnic minority communities in particular do not have access to the resources necessary to meet
children’s needs or to plan respective developmental activities. It would therefore be advisable for
UNICEF and its partners such as NGOs to strengthen advocacy to increase spending for preschool
education, including on educational resources, equipment, and infrastructure.
3.1.3 Relevance to the UNICEF’s broader ECD and COVID-19
programming
UNICEF ECD programming in Georgia includes, among others, creating an enabling environment for
children, improving infant and maternal health, as well as increasing the quality of ECE, in line with
international human rights standards. In this light, all evaluated interventions fit well within UNICEF’s
ECD priorities, as summarized in the contextual section of this report (see 2.1.1). In fact, while they were
introduced in response to COVID-19 and address the specific challenges that it created, it is easy to
imagine that they would have been introduced either way because they generally fit well with the
overall programme.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 42
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
While it addresses some of the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Child Hotline 111
is a service that has existed under different names in countries around the world for many years,
addressing the needs of all children (also ab ove early childhood age range) and youth. Its relevance
for the needs of children and youth has been acknowledged, with thousands of phone calls annually
per country as proof. Since the Child Hotline 111 aims at facilitating access to all services for children,
either through service provision (e.g. counse ling, information and mental health support) or referrals
to other institutions, the hotline has good prospects of contributing to a conducive and nurturing
environment that will enable children to survive, thrive and reach their full potential. Its successful
operation can thus strengthen the imple mentation of children’s rights enshrined in national
instruments, such as the Code on the Rights of the Child, and international human rights agreements
ratified by Georgia, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) or the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities. By integrating different services (social, educational, health), the hotline
can also offer more comprehensive responses to beneficiaries’ problems, thus giving better effect to
the best interest of the child, which is one of the principles of CRC (Article 3) and Georgian Code on
the Rights of the Child (Article 5). If successful in channeling children’s and parents’ issues, the Child
Hotline 111 can also serve as a mechanism for identifying children’s needs and gaps in service
provision.139 It is therefore a complementary element to other interventions within the ‘enabling
environment’ priority of the ‘young child survival and development’ component of UNICEF’s program.
The SMAs also fit well both with the general UNICEF ECD programs – the infant and maternal health
priority within the ‘young child survival and development’ component – and the broader COVID-
19 response. One could imagine such a service being introduced under non-COVID-19
circumstances, e.g. as part of UNICEF’s Mother and Child Health Programme. Although the innovative
nature of the intervention was likely motivated by the COVID-19 more than e.g. the introduction of the
Child Hotline 111, for which various templates had existed earlier.
The SMAs also synergize and cohere with COVID-19-related activities focusing specifically on
infant and maternal health and more broadly on improving primary healthcare. One of such
activities includes the readiness assessments of all maternity houses on infection prevention and
control (IPC), which provided recommendations for all 84 maternity houses, as well as on-the-job
training on strengthening the IPC measures to better protect mothers and children.140 Another
example is UNICEF’s work for strengthening the capacity of rural primary healthcare providers. As
described in section 2.1.3, the project entailed providing infrastructure and access to the Internet to
rural doctors; setting up a digital platform for communication, coordination, and monitoring; as well
as training for medical rural professionals on COVID 19-related issues, but also e.g. remote maternal
and child health consultations. In this way, UNICEF-supported interventions teach women the things
they should know about pregnancy and available services, while also working to increase the quality
and capacity of those services to operate in the context of reduced physical access.
Implementation of the SMAs also aligns with the Georgian government’s obligations under
CEDAW, especially Article 12(1) which obliges State Parties to “ensure to women appropriate services
in connection with pregnancy.” It can contribute to improvements in SGD3 (i.e. ‘Ensure healthy lives
and promote well-being for all at all ages’) with its Targets 3.1. and 3.2., related to lowering maternal,
neonatal and under-five mortality.

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 43
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
The pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara was developed as part of the UNICEF’s programme
before the COVID-19 pandemic to implement the priorities related to early childhood education
(ECE). These priorities include, among othe rs, cooperating with the Georgian government on the
implementation of the Law on Early and Preschool Education and Care, as well as related standards.
The training included a relevant module which can help mainstream these standards among
preschool professionals. The pandemic-indu ced experience of delivering the training online can offer
additional insight on how such training should be delivered in the future, once the intervention is
mainstreamed in Georgia. The activities aimed at capacity-building of frontline workers also go
hand in hand with other COVID-19-related interventions, such as production of educational and
awareness-raising materials both for frontline staff and parents, as well as advocacy and
cooperation with national and local government, e.g. the meeting between the UNICEF
Representative with the Deputy Mayor of Batumi and the Head of Batumi Kindergarten Union to
discuss the implementation of the new national standards for preschool education, including COVID-
19 requirements.141
Implementation of the training aligns with Georgian government’s obligations under CRC to
provide quality and inclusive education to children, including young children. It also aligns with SDG4
(i.e. ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for
all’) and its Target 4.2 related to ensuring that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood
development, care and pre-primary education, so that they are ready for primary education.
Since the interventions are consistent with UNICEF’s programming, their results could feed into the
achievement of UNICEF’s outcomes no. 1 (“By 2020, all young children, especially the most
vulnerable, are supported to survive, thrive and reach their full potential for success in school and
later in life”) and no. 2 (“By 2020, vulnerable children are benefiting from a proactive, child-sensitive
social protection system that promotes social inclusion and the right to supportive and caring family
environment”).142 However, the available data does not allow for an assessment of the exact extent to
which this has been the case.
3.2 Effectiveness
This section presents the effectiveness of the analyzed interventions. It tries to highlight different
dimensions of effectiveness, as well as enabling and hindering factors. It is divided by intervention for
several reasons. Since the evaluators were able to develop a theory of change for the Child Hotline
111, albeit not elaborate, the evaluation of this intervention follows a theory-based approach to the
extent possible. The SMAs and the pilot training in Adjara were added as the evaluation’s object after
the two rapid assessment cycles foreseen during the evaluation, which made development of their
respective theories of change impossible. As a result, the evaluators made reference to their
objectives as stated in the project descriptions received from UNICEF. For the same reasons, the
amount of data collected on the hotline and the remaining two interventions differs (see also section
2.2.3 on limitations). It should be noted that the amount of data on the SMAs and the pilot training in
Adjara allow for a rather lightweight assessment.

3.2.1 Effectiveness of the Child Hotline 111
As the service was only recently put in place, evidence on its effectiveness is still limited. At this point
of the hotline’s development, it is particularly worth: (i) assessing whether the hotline was able to
address the needs of individual callers; (ii) examining what the response processes looked like in
practice; (iii) understanding the factors that affected the hotline’s effectiveness in individual cases
and (iii) understanding the factors that affected the hotline’s effectiveness in terms of demand, i.e.
general interest of children and parents in using this service.
The intervention’s theory of change (ToC) foresees three groups of activities – setting up the Child
Hotline 111 (involving a tripartite agreement, assigning a hotline number and employing operators),
providing a 4-day online training to operators and collecting data. These have been implemented.
The memorandum of understanding between the three parties involved (UNICEF, the Georgian
Parliament and ASCA) and the resolution setting up the hotline were adopted in April 2020. The
training was conducted between 18-21 July 2020. Data collection is an ongoing activity, implemented
continuously alongside service provision.
According to the ToC, the activities should produce two outputs:
t u A fully operational hotline with a trained t u A database with progress recorded
p p
t staff that provides: (i) information and t (incoming calls and concerns) by case
u u
O referral to services (social, health, O workers: follow up the first contact and the
educational) and benefits for children and entire case that is recorded in the unified
families offered by state and municipal database.
structures; (ii) psychological counselling, if
needed.
The evaluation showed that the hotline is operational, i.e. the number functions, the hotline can and
does receive calls, and staff can provide information and referral, as well as psychological
counseling.
However, one may question whether the hotline is indeed fully operational. At the moment, it lacks:
(i) important resources (e.g. a directory of child-related services and a mapping of those services
throughout the country), (ii) documented and sufficiently detailed standard operating procedures
and referral pathways, as well as (iii) certain technical links to other similar services, e.g. the
emergency hotline 112 or the hotline 1505 maintained by the Ministry of the Internally Displaced
Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social Affairs. These gaps were highlighted
in the analytical briefs produced as part of the evaluation (annexed to this report, see Volume 2), as
well as in an earlier report prepared for UNICEF by an international consultant.143 During this evaluation,
UNICEF CO launched and completed tendering procedures to hire a national and an international
consultant to develop the necessary procedures, and the process is ongoing. This is an important
development since these internal factors affect the hotline’s effectiveness in multiple ways, e.g. by
influencing cooperation with other actors and appropriateness of referral, reducing the hotline’s
potential to achieve short and long-term outcomes, as specified in the ToC.

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
Another question can be raised with respect to staff training. While the operators appreciate the
received initial training, they also point to some gaps and further needs e.g. related to the
changing nature of this service. All hotline st aff surveyed (n=7) reported that they received sufficient
information, support, and supervision to carry out their work effectively as hotline operators. They
agreed/strongly agreed that the training helped them consolidate or strengthen their
communication skills and contained useful instruction on determining a problem and appropriate
response. Yet they expressed less certainty about having received sufficient information on
governmental child-related services and addressing the calls that are more unusual, complex or
require identifying underlying problems, as w ell as those dealing with gender-specific prejudices and
discrimination. Limited resources allocated for the hotline staff training were noted as a reason for
these shortcomings, which prompts a recommendation for the ASCA to review the resources
earmarked for this purpose.
The research also revealed that after the initial training, newly hired staff were not trained, nor was
a system for continuous training available. Consequently, new staff had to learn on the job and from
more experienced employees. This is an important shortcoming in the hotline’s operation in view of
staff rotation (see also more below) and service quality. It comes somewhat as a surprise, given that
the need for regular updates of the knowledge and skills of the engaged staff was reported not only
by hotline staff but also by the Implementing Partner during this evaluation.
All surveyed hotline operators pointed to some skills they think
they should improve, with the most needed (6 out of 7
responses) being technical and methodological skills specific to
their role. Other areas where skill enhancements would be
required include communication with people with diverse social,
educational, ethnical backgrounds and abilities, preparedness to
pose adequate questions and the ability to identify the unspoken
needs of hotline users. Regular updates on state provided services
for children and their caregivers have also been mentioned as a
step to ensure that the hotline staff are well-informed to respond to the queries effectively.
The achievement of the second output, i.e. a database with progress recorded, also raises some
questions. The hotline does document data on the number of calls per day – targeted and non-
targeted, as well as ongoing and completed. The general issues that the calls refer to (e.g. social,
health, education, psychological counseling, violence against children) are also included in the
database. The calls are recorded and stored, yet access to recordings has been reported as a
problem during the evaluation. However, it is not clear based on the data available to the evaluators
to what extent the cases are documented beyond such general information. Rather, the interviews
show that the hotline does not collect sufficient data related to its work and does not have a
monitoring and evaluation system to assess the quality of support provided by the hotline staff.
The ToC for the Child Hotline 111 foresees the outputs will contribute to two short-term outcomes:

With respect to short-term outcome one, all surveyed hotline staff agreed that the establishment
of the hotline contributed to an improved access to service provision for young children under the
age of 7 and their families during the pandemic. While there are several hotlines or emergency lines
which are also relevant, there has so far been none devoted purely and comprehensively to children’s
and parents’ needs. Additionally, emergency hotlines such as 112 have been overwhelmed during the
pandemic. Thus, the main direct benefit of the intervention for young children and their families is
the possibility to receive information, referral, or service (e.g. counseling, mental health support)
through one call.
However, it was difficult to assess whether all social groups in Georgia, including the most
marginalized and/or discriminated against, have equal access to the hotline. Most surveyed
hotline staff (5 out of 7) believed that such access was provided, while one hotline operator
disagreed, and one marked the ‘don’t know’ option. According to interviewees, the channels to spread
the information about the hotline were limited, e.g. it was not advertised through other UNICEF
interventions nor promoted among local leaders, e.g. NGOs providing relevant services. As specified
by UNICEF, there was no information campaign targeting the most vulnerable children, e.g. children
working and living in the street, children in alternative care or from ethnic minorities. Call data shared
by UNICEF shows that, between April 2020 and July 2021, 110 calls related to children with disabilities,
while 101 concerned a family with many children. It is hard to assess whether these numbers are high
or low with the data at hand. However, it shows potential for the hotline to be a point of contact for
large families and families with children with disabilities. The number of calls pertaining to children
with disabilities or large families was bigger than the number of calls related to education or legal
issues within the same period – 63 and 96, respectively. Given that the intervention’s ToC highlights
the higher vulnerability of children with disabilities, including in view of emergencies such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF and ASCA may consider closer follow-up and monitoring/evaluation of
the calls which concern children with disabilities in the future.
As highlighted in section 2.2.3 on limitations faced during research, due to time constraints the
evaluation did not foresee a survey with targeted rights holders. No data from post-service
satisfaction surveys was provided by UNICEF either. This means that our assessment of the
intervention’s contribution to the first short-term outcome is indirect, as reliant on the opinions of
frontline staff.
The evaluation also examined the potential of the hotline as a mechanism for monitoring children’s
needs and related systemic gaps in service provision, which would contribute to the second short-
term outcome specified in the ToC. All interviewees during the second assessment cycle
underlined the potential significance of the Child Hotline 111 for gathering evidence that
policymakers could use for strengthening ECD services in the country. However, the hotline’s
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 47
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
success as a vehicle for collecting such intelligence would depend on its effectiveness in addressing
children’s and parents’ needs and channeling as many calls as possible. In addition to tackling the
internal and external factors which influence the hotline’s effectiveness (as described in both above
and below), it would importantly need to strengthen its data collection and analysis system, which is
insufficient now. The collected data – at least in the form received by the evaluators – does not allow
for formulating conclusions on the needs a nd bottlenecks, as it is not detailed enough for law or
policymaking and mostly quantitative. Specific and more detailed reflections on this aspect of the
Child Hotline’s operation was included in the second analytical brief produced during this evaluation
(annexed to this report in Volume 2).
The Child Hotline 111 seeks to contribute to the following long-term outcome that:
"The needs of children and their families/caregivers, particularly in the areas of benefits, health,
finance, social care, freedom from violence, equipment and assistive technology, housing and home
adaptations, are sufficiently addressed.
The hotline will only be able to contribute to this outcome, if it addresses the needs of its callers. The
evaluation revealed that the effectiveness of the hotline in addressing the needs of those who call
appears to depend on which service is sought – whether it is a service internal or external to the
hotline itself. The surveyed hotline operators agreed that, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
and within their remits, they are able to fully respond to the immediate needs of children under the
age of 7 and their families with different types of vulnerabilities.144 But the interviewed operators
confessed that while cases that require social workers’ involvement are usually addressed in a timely
manner, the responses that concern some other services, including those offered by municipalities,
are sometimes delayed or not provided. As one of them said:
“We have many cases when a representative of a certain state and local governmental agency does
not respond to our phone calls trying to avoid the accountability that is put on certain persons and
certain institutions. This causes lots of problems and dissatisfaction.” (KII with a hotline operator).
The challenges to the hotline’s effectiveness in responding to the needs of children and their
families during calls appear to be largely external and systemic in nature. The service provided by
the Child Hotline 111 heavily depends on availability and responsiveness of other child-related services
in the country. Yet, the surveyed hotline operators noted problems with poor quality of relevant
services (5 out of 7 responses) and shortages of services and support programs (5 out of 7
responses) available to vulnerable children (especially with disabilities) and families in Georgia in
general and in their respective location (e.g. municipality, town/village). This is important to
acknowledge, since the lack of specific services or poor service quality will negatively influence
beneficiaries’ perceptions of the hotline, create distrust, and discourage future attempts to contact
the hotline, making it ineffective. On the other hand, the operators’ observations may testify to the
hotline’s potential as a mechanism for monitoring children’s needs and related systemic gaps in
service provision mentioned above. The views of hotline operators on the existing gaps should be
144 Ecorys (2021), Survey with hotline operators conducted for the first rapid assessment cycle.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 48
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
explored further and possibly followed up with more research to see whether improvements can be
made suggested and made.
Communication, cooperation, and coordination with external
actors are also a challenge. The interviewees pointed out the
“inflexibility of regional services due to the operational rules,
neglecting their own responsibilities, and lack of coordination and
subordination policy” being the obstacles fo r higher effectiveness
and efficiency of the hotline. Information sharing on available
services and changes thereto was also mentioned as a problem
during both cycles of data collection devoted to the hotline.
These observations also point to a potential gap in the current
ToC at the level of activities and outputs. It seems that there is a
need for including activities which would foster cooperation between the hotline and other service
providers. These should lead to establishment of formal coordination and cooperation mechanisms
and continuous working relations between the hotline and other important stakeholders, in particular
municipalities but also for example relevant CSOs. Such outputs could feed into the achievement of
both short-term outcomes, since they would facilitate access to services offered by external actors,
but would also allow the hotline to share the knowledge that it generates.
While the external service environment may be key, internal factors also play an important role in the
hotline’s effectiveness vis-à-vis its expected long-term outcome. Some of those, namely appropriate
procedures, technical links to other hotlines and staff training and competences have been
discussed above. Others include staff workload and overall satisfaction, as well as retention. The
introduction of around-the-clock services in June 2021 may have contributed to the outflow of
qualified staff. Out of five operators interviewed during the second assessment cycle, two had already
left due to the disproportion between the workload and renumeration, while two more said that they
would leave if they had better (more balanced) opportunities. The loss of trained and more
experienced operators creates a serious challenge of skills and competence gap, especially since
the newly hired staff do not receive initial training and learn from more experienced colleagues.
The number of received calls may not be the best indicator of the hotline’s effectiveness at the
moment, due to the stage of its development but also a limited information campaign. Due to the
COVID-19 related lockdown, the channels to spread information about the hotline were limited and
excluded a face-to-face information campaign in the ECD institutions, schools, and other public
places. This weakened the campaign’s reach and thus limited the demand for the service. The main
sources of information were the TV social commercials and social media (pages associated with
different state-provided social services), where social media users posted information about the
hotline. The hotline may also be confused with similar services in Georgia, e.g. the emergency hotline
112 or 1505 hotline.145 While campaigns increasing the visibility of the hotline among beneficiaries
should rather wait for its full development,146 the case for building awareness of the hotline among
possible partners, including CSOs, is strong. Mainstreaming the service in all other relevant UNICEF
interventions could also be a way to increase beneficiaries’ interest in using the hotline’s services.

Social Affairs of Georgia. It provides information and assistance on social issues and programmes.

Once the hotline is fully operational, it may be useful to expand the range of activities in the ToC to
include a continuous promotional campaign, which would lead to an increased awareness about
the hotline’s activity among children and ca regivers (measured e.g. in regular surveys), as well as
increased interest among beneficiaries (as reflected e.g. in an increasing number of calls).
3.2.2 Effectiveness of the SM As
The SMAs intervention has been very effective in reaching out to many pregnant women in
Georgia and less so when it comes to en suring universal participation in the appointments,
although it is not clear whether the latter was its objective, as the target was not specified. However,
overall a substantial number of pregnant women participated, avoiding the risks related to the
COVID-19 pandemic and receiving advice from the best clinicians in the country. No data was
made available to the evaluators which would allow us to determine how effective the intervention
has been in increasing the participants’ knowledge and awareness about the COVID-19 prevention
measures, pregnancy-related issues, and further ANC services, which was the SMA’s stated objective
as per the project description provided by UNICEF.147
Out of 23,295 calls made, the data suggests that 16,204 pregnant women were reached effectively.
Out of those women who were effectively reached, as many as 7,321 (45%) provided a positive reply
and 1,244 (8%) eventually fully attended the SMAs. Negative replies were received from 8,883 women
(55%). Table 3 below presents the breakdown of data on outreach and attendance per region.

The success of the outreach resulted from the selected method for contacting pregnant women,
namely individual phone calls from staff of responsible agencies. This method, while successful,
was also very resource-intensive, which would undermine the prospects for sustainability in the long-
term.
At the same time, the overall proposed model of information and knowledge transfer through SMAs
gained recognition, which points to the intervention’s overall effectiveness. Consequently, the NCDC
147 The evaluators received a brief from UNICEF CO on this intervention. A theory of change for this intervention was not
available during the evaluation, as the intervention was only added to the evaluation at its final stages.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 50
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
requested UNICEF to establish a platform for booking appointments, choosing doctors, and
participating in shared antenatal consultations.148 Even though this recruitment channel could be less
effective in reaching out to all pregnant wo men, it can ensure the SMAs’ longer-term sustainability
(see also section 3.3).
While most pregnant women were informed about the SMAs, 55% of those effectively reached
declined the opportunity to participate and more resigned later, even though they provided an
initial positive reply. This happened even though all women were individually approached, the
gynecologists were selected from among the best in the country and a flexible schedule was
proposed. One-quarter of the women who declined to participate (2,264) were not pregnant
anymore at the time of receiving the invitation. This may suggest that the data in the Birth Registry
used as a basis for outreach may at times be outdated. Exclusion of these women as not targeted by
the intervention leaves 6,619 refusals on other grounds, in particular 2,489 replies (28% of all negative
replies; 38% of replies if non-pregnant women are excluded) when a woman just did not want to
participate. This lack of interest could suggest limited relevance of the intervention, but also other
factors, including a need for a more convincing argument for women to participate or awareness-
raising on the importance of ANC. As indicated under the relevance section, a more thorough
investigation of the reasons for non-participation could shed light on the intervention’s true value
and prospects for mainstreaming.
Quite a few women – 1,205 – replied negatively because they already consulted a doctor, which may
– although does not have to – suggest that other services are sufficient. While more consultations
would probably have been desired, this group could be expected to already have a certain level of
knowledge. It would thus not be a priority target, given that the SMAs were not introduced to replace
traditional or individual remote ANC, but rather to mitigate the results of COVID-19 and lack of access
to services. In this context, it may be useful to rethink the target group for this intervention and refine
its objectives, e.g. towards focusing on those women who do not have access to appropriate medical
care.
Negative replies related to the lack of time (1,377) or not speaking a proposed language may point to
the need for introducing further alterations to the intervention, once it is mainstreamed, e.g. providing
more timeslots, shorter SMAs or SMAs in different languages.
A substantial number of resignations from participation after an initially positive reply may also
warrant more examination. It would be interesting to see how the participants’ interest in the SMAs
was sustained in the period between the initial call and the SMA’s date. Given a generally high drop-
out rate for online events, reminders and other engagement activities leading up to the main event
usually play an important role in ensuring a higher turnout. UNICEF CO can consider examining this
aspect further when working on the continuation of this intervention in the future.

The interviewed UNICEF representative speculated that women may have refused to participate
due to the general lack of experience with remote service provision in the country.149 Indeed,
Georgians do not have much experience with online healthcare provision. As reported in the study
on the socio-economic impact of COVID-19, some Georgians feel reluctance towards online service,
believing it to be less valuable and useful, even though they do often complain about the face-to-
face service.150
In addition to implementing a comprehensive outreach and offering flexible scheduling, the SMAs
were also conducted in minority languages (Armenian, Azeri and Russian) which could have a
positive influence on their effectiveness among women from national minorities who also happen to
often represent rural communities.151 However, the evaluation lacks specific data on SMA participants
disaggregated by the language of SMA’s delivery to be able to assess this issue fully.
3.2.3 Effectiveness of the pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara
Due to the evaluation’s focus on Child Hotline 111, as requested by UNICEF, and insufficient secondary
data, very limited evidence was available supporting the training’s effectiveness. The impossibility of
conducting pre- and post-assessment of existing practices and educators’ competences152 during

MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 52
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
the project due to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the reasons why data is missing. Importantly,
though, the intervention has not ended and is being continued in the 2021-2022 academic year under
the leadership of the National Center for Tea cher Professional Development (NCTPD). The NCTPD has
expanded the intervention to two new preschools in an additional municipality (Kobuleti) in Adjara.
As preschools are now open in Georgia, this will enable ECE coaches to work and support the
preschool teams on site and conduct pre- a nd post-assessments.
As the results of an available satisfaction s urvey conducted in June 2020 show, the training was
comprehensible for most participants surveyed, which means that it also had potential to
increase their professional competences. Out of 46 respondents, 37 (80%) stated that everything
was clear, 7 (15%) that the content was mostly understandable. Additional comments suggest that
at least some participants would have liked to know the subject of the next session in advance. While
they did not specify why this was important, one can imagine that could have allowed them to better
prepare, thus potentially enhancing the benefits from the classes themselves. Only one person did
not understand ‘many things’. The respondent indicated that it would be better, if this training was
organized for every kindergarten separately. In this mode, I can't understand anything’.
Three survey participants expressed either a negative attitude towards the remote mode of
service delivery or a preference for face-to-face meetings. The survey did not specifically ask about
the mode of delivery, but 6% of the surveyed group (3 out of 46) considered it important enough to
make an additional comment. Respondents who commented on the remote mode said that ‘it would
be more interesting’ if the trainer came to Batumi, or that they can rate the trainer high ‘despite online
involvement and remote communication’, or simply commented that online training is good, but they
‘prefer live’. Participants’ perceptions as to the mode of delivery could be studied further to optimize
future training, dividing time between online and offline classes, especially if this mode of training
delivery is considered for mainstreaming.
Apart from not always being appreciated, the online mode imposed limitations that likely had an
impact on the training’s effectiveness, by hindering the implementation of the practical training
components. The coach was not able to conduct supervision to assess whether theoretical
knowledge delivered during the training translated into staff practices in the classroom. In this
context, video documentation of conducted on-site sessions was a good decision to give
participants an opportunity to study best practices. During the project, five videos were produced
on: coaching in preschools; learning and development resources in preschools; parent engagement
in preschools; reading books with young children; visual art in ECE.153 As noted in the project’s final
report, some videos will also be useful for advocacy with municipalities.154
The videos contain testimonies of participants which suggest that the trained staff may use or has
already used the knowledge and approaches in practice. These can be treated as indications of
effectiveness. For example, a part of the training concerned using second-hand or open-ended
resources in preschools. The video devoted to educational resources shows that the interviewed
educators now perceive these resources as valuable for play and appreciate their easy availability
and low cost. As one educator stated: “We thought before that whatever toys they would bring to us
in preschool that was what we had to use mainly. Now, we bring second-hand materials which has

been very successful. Children almost feel at home.” Another educator stated: “I have never tried
before, but I will try to use all these materials because they are a lot of fun and exciting.” Educators of
the Batumi 34th preschools recalled: “I brou gh macaroni and they loved painting these macaroni
with a brush”, “anything I come across on the street, I bring to preschool – leaves, pebbles,
pinecones…I use a lot of it.”155
While there was limited opportunity to interact with and alter the kindergartens’ physical
environments to make them more child-f riendly, this was attempted and achieved whenever
possible. The final project report notes that “as a result of coaching, the physical environment of the
groups in the pilot kindergartens is mainly arranged in spaces where children can play in small
groups.”156 It also notices that “three kindergartens (2 kindergartens in Batumi and one kindergarten
in Khulo) have undergone a fundamental change of environment”, which is important for the
kindergarten unions to plan further changes. This suggests that the training was effective in
improving the working environment of pilot preschools for the benefit of both staff and children.
The effectiveness of the pilot training and its continuation in the longer term (which is needed to lead
to a lasting change) will depend on systemic factors, such as the infrastructure and resources
available in kindergartens, staff workload, group size and staff remuneration. Previous research
conducted in Georgia suggests that all these factors can at the moment negatively affect preschool
staff’s capacity to put their newly gained knowledge and skills into practice. Deficiencies in
infrastructure and resources have briefly been discussed in section 3.1.2, but preschool staff also face
excessive workloads and lack child-free hours which would allow for preparation, continuous
professional development, and self-evaluation.157 They also have to deal with overcrowded groups of
more than 35 pupils, which is above the legal limit.158 Additionally, the salaries in the sector are
excessively low, incongruent with the working conditions and reflecting a still low status of this
profession in society. 159 This can affect not only the willingness of staff to participate in the training,
but also increase staff rotation. Such a situation is incompliant with the state’s duties under the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee on the Rights of the Child underlined in its
General Comment no. 7 that “[w]ork with young children should be socially valued and properly paid,
in order to attract a highly qualified workforce, men as well as women.”160 To reap the full benefits of
such training in the future, it is therefore important to shape the conditions in which preschool staff
work, so that they can enable continuous professional development and mainstream new knowledge
and child-friendly approaches in practice.
3.2.4 Management and monitoring
While the surveyed operators of the Child Hotline 111 were satisfied or very satisfied with the overall
coordination of the hotline, there is evidence that the management and especially monitoring
could be improved through the establishment of better procedures and systems. Some data

collected suggests that the role and responsibilities of ASCA were not clearly defined. This could be
attributed to the rapid set up of the intervention caused by the pandemic.
The questions on how to document the hotline’s functioning or what indicators and targets to use
to assess its effectiveness were not addressed either. ASCA’s activity in this area includes
monitoring the logs and reports completed by the hotline workers and calculating beneficiaries’
complaints161. As noted above, the number of calls targeted, non-targeted, completed and ongoing
is collected. The general issues which appe ar in the calls are also registered, with a possibility that
one call covers more than one issue. So the number of issues does not equal the number of calls.
However, based on the data received during the evaluation, we conclude that many potentially
useful types of data may be missing. There is no distinction between calls completed internally and
completed through referrals. There is no information where (to what institution) beneficiaries were
referred. Such information could help prioritize potential cooperation and coordination activities. It is
not clear whether a call always means one case, or whether repeated calls are made in one case. As
a result, one does not know how many actual calls are necessary to complete ‘a call’. There is no data
on how much time it took to complete ‘a call’, which would be useful to measure the average
response time, an indicator helpful in assessing effectiveness and efficiency. We do not know either
whether there was a follow-up after the call with other services and, if so, how many follow-ups. This
could hint at potential challenges in cooperation, but could also enrich data on the challenges and
gaps in service provision. The data collected is not disaggregated by the beneficiary (i.e. whether the
caller was a child or caregiver), which could be useful e.g. from the perspective of promotional
activities, nor by the gender of the child whose case is being brought to the hotline’s attention. Among
the issues that are registered, there are ‘children with disabilities’ or ‘large families’, but there is no
category for ‘young children’ (as per the nomenclature of the UN Committee on the Rights of the
Child) or ‘children at ECD age’, which would help see to what extent the hotline caters to their needs.
In terms of issues, the hotline could also be more detailed: (i) social issues could be distinguished,
e.g. between financial and non-financial support, especially given that they are the most recurring
type; (ii) education could be further divided into education stages – preschool, primary, secondary,
etc.; health could be split between the maternal, young child, reproductive, primary or specialist
healthcare, etc.; violence categories could also be added, e.g. domestic or peer violence.
Importantly for evaluating the service’s quality, primary research showed that, due to rigid legislative
requirements,162 the hotline’s assessment does not entail a review of audio-recorded calls, which
could be an important source of information on service quality. At the same time, the evaluation
team received the Ordinance by the Director of ASCA which assigns specific people to be responsible
for processing (listening, analysis, evaluating) the audio recording(s) of the incoming calls received
via the hotline.163 Either way, the Child Hotline 111 requires a comprehensive monitoring and
evaluation system in order not only to be an effective service for children and their parents, but also
to become a possible vehicle for gathering data on children’s needs and systemic gaps in services.
161 The evaluators did not receive any data on such complaints.
162 Article 61 of General Administrative Code of Georgia, Law of Georgia on personal data protection, requires very diligent
approach to handling the personal data and thus makes it difficult to revisit the recorded case.

More detailed observations and recommendations as to the monitoring of the Child Hotline 111 were
provided in the analytical briefs produced during this evaluation, as well as in an earlier report.164
UNICEF has already launched a tendering process for an international and national consultant who
would support the improvement of hotline’s procedures and systems.165 The consultants will work to
develop a concept, regulations, working instruments, referral protocols, and standard operating
procedures for the hotline, which could lead to transformation of an existing hotline into a helpline.
The monitoring of the Child Hotline 111’s per formance led so far to two adjustments – the hotline’s
working hours were extended and its scope widened to include the issues relevant for adolescents.
Available evidence on the management and monitoring of SMAs suggests that it has been
sufficient to implement changes in the service to respond to beneficiaries’ needs and to draw
some lessons for future interventions. In particular, the COVID-19 related component in the
programme of SMAs was shortened due to the observed limited interest among the beneficiaries.
Additionally, a lesson was drawn about the unsustainable character of the project’s recruitment
process, so future mainstreaming plans for the service involve development of a booking platform.
However, the intervention would merit from more in-depth monitoring and evaluation. Its results
could help to decide on their added value in the system (beyond COVID-19), the ways to integrate
SMAs into the overall package of services and structure their programme, etc. Since if the SMAs are
to be mainstreamed, they should be integrated into the overall support to pregnant women provided
through the health system.
The pilot training for preschool staff in Adjara established a management and monitoring system,
composed of monthly reports reflecting on the results, achievements and lessons learned from the
ongoing coaching process.166 Additionally, the final report was produced which clearly summarizes
the projects and insights gained. While we are not able to comment on the monthly reports, the final
report provides useful insight into the pilot project, but also more systemic problems encountered
during its implementation. UNICEF was able to draw lessons based on those observations to further
tailor the continuation of this intervention to existing needs. The evaluation team also received the
results of a satisfaction survey carried out in the project in June 2020. However, the surveys were short
and did not offer enough data for determining the training’s effectiveness in increasing staff
competences. Due to the online mode of project implementation (which was a COVID-19-induced
adaptation) pre- and post-assessments were not possible, which is a serious disadvantage
considering the pilot character of the project. However, as noted above, the pilot training will be
continued in the original format (as practice-based coaching), so it will be possible to monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention.
While project monitoring in evaluated interventions provides some useful data, it is not sufficient for
proper monitoring for results and potential contribution to outcomes. This is because no indicators
of success are defined for these interventions, and the baselines and target values are not available
either. Thus data collection is conducted without a clear definition of its purpose and conclusions
about interventions’ success are difficult to make.

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
3.2.5 Enabling environment (policy, cooperation with
government)
At a systemic level, UNICEF’s comprehensive COVID-19 response was facilitated by the Georgian
government’s growing recognition of the importance of early childhood services and child rights,
more broadly. The latter was reflected e.g. in the adoption of the Code on the Rights of the Child in
2019. The code forms a comprehensive foundation for child-related policies in the country, including
in all areas of UNICEF’s engagement. The act gives grounding to and stimulates interventions which
can improve the overall environment for ch ildren not only to survive, but most importantly to thrive
and reach their full potential. With respect to ECEC, the legislative foundation for interventions was
also laid out in the 2016 Law on Early and Preschool Education.
The long-standing cooperation between UNICEF and various Georgian national and local
authorities played an enabling role. Most UNICEF’s COVID-19 related activities involved the
government or other state actors in some way. The establishment of the Child Hotline 111 was possible
with the backing and engagement of the Human Rights and Civil Integration Committee of the
Georgian Parliament, while its functioning is supervised by the ASCA under the Ministry of Internally
Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. The SMAs,
in turn, were implemented in cooperation with two state actors – NCDC and Birth Registry which
carried out a massive logistical effort of calling all pregnant women in the country. Finally, the
regional authorities in Adjara were on board when it comes to the pilot training, which also received
support from the kindergarten unions. The National Center for Teacher Professional Development is
implementing the project since 2021.
UNICEF was able to implement an array of diverse interventions in all its programme areas also
thanks to close cooperation with non-state actors, including various specialized CSOs and
religious organizations. While this was not specifically the case for the evaluated activities, such
partnerships formed the backbone of many interventions. For example, the Children of Georgia
provided online psychological support to hundreds of children and caregivers in small group homes
and foster care through group and individual sessions. While Initiatives for Social Change developed
draft guidelines on Remote Child Protection Case Management for statutory social workers and
conducted hundreds of online supervision meetings for social workers. Support for families with
children with disabilities was provided in partnership with the Education for All Coalition, an alliance
of CSOs working on education, and a network of organizations working with children with disabilities
and their families.
The lack of stronger cooperation with the authorities or non-state actors such as specialized CSOs,
e.g. on the implementation of the Child Hotline 111, should therefore be seen as a factor hindering
effectiveness. The lacking communication and cooperation between the hotline and municipalities
was observed as a barrier to its success. While cooperation with CSOs could have helped at three
levels: (i) increasing the hotline’s visibility among potential beneficiaries; (ii) increasing the hotline’s
access to child-related services offered by those CSOs; and (iii) ensuring training opportunities for
staff.
The COVID-19 has also functioned as an enabling factor or accelerator for some interventions,
demonstrating their value to the GoG. For example, this was the case with the “0-6 Child Growth and
Development Surveillance Electronic Module” for tracking child growth and development. As a UNICEF
CO’s representative observed, the GoG was initially skeptical towards the system, as it believed that
the aging medical workforce lacks appropriate digital skills. However, with the COVID-19 measures
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 57
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
cutting people off from access to healthcare and other services, the GoG is determined to introduce
telemedicine and implement the 0-6 module in parallel.167
Availability of financial support from donors made all interventions possible. The existence of
infrastructure (Internet access) and equipment (computers and mobile phones penetration)
made the transition from physical to online services possible, while the lack of those in some areas
and families contributed to deepened inequalities. In the case of the SMAs, the existence of the Birth
Registry enabled the intervention to reach al l pregnant women in the country to offer them additional
ANC service, which shows the potential of this tool beyond registration. At the same time, the lack of
access to the Internet still made the service inaccessible to some women (see relevance section).
The lack of infrastructure and resources, as well as generally poor working conditions, have been
identified as strong hindering factors for the effectiveness of the pilot training in Adjara (see section
3.2.3). Similarly, lack of services or their poor quality created structural barriers to the effectiveness
of the Child Hotline 111. At the same time, the experience of the pilot training suggests that some of
the potentially structural barriers in the preschool sector, e.g. lack of resources or toys, can be
addressed through the changed approach to teaching which makes use of open-ended, easily
available, natural and cheap resources.
The ability of UNICEF to quickly mobilize international and local expertise was also important in
supporting the government with technical assistance and research. The results of those have been
used for adjusting programs for children and families, e.g. targeted social assistance. As mentioned
above, the local and international expertise has also been strongly mobilized to help properly set up
the Child Hotline 111.
Aside from legal, policy, institutional, financial, or infrastructural factors, it is also worth mentioning
attitudinal factors, for example, the attitudes of beneficiaries to the online mode of service delivery,
which was the main type of adaptation introduced. The evaluation showed that these attitudes may
sometimes be negative, as in the case of some pilot training participants. It is also possible that some
pregnant women resigned from participating in the SMAs due to their distrust of the online service
provision. Since positive attitudes can help in the future mainstreaming of online service provision,
building them may be an important component of future actions. The increasing quality of such
services can also in parallel boost the population’s trust towards them.
3.3 Sustainability
In relation to sustainability, the evaluation asked about the extent to which: (i) the adaptations
introduced in response to COVID-19 improve the resilience of services or can contribute to long-term
effectiveness and efficiency in service provision; (ii) adaptations and their results increase the
capacity to address similar situations in the future; (iii) specific circumstances (enabling
circumstances) can positively affect the sustainability of good results; (iv) the most promising
innovations be integrated into on-going programs. Due to the lack of data, the assessment of the
last element was not possible for Georgia.
The Child Hotline 111 can contribute to the resilience of services for children and can also increase
effectiveness and efficiency in service provision. Firstly, the hotline’s operation is premised on
remote contact, a future pandemic or a crisis of similar effect would not influence its accessibility for
167 Interview with a UNICEF representative on 6th September 2021.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 58
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
children and caregivers. Secondly, in terms of effectiveness, the hotline’s services – especially if
diversified to various channels including phone and online modes of delivery – do have potential to
reach more people, including those in rem ote areas who may have difficulty accessing physical
services. Finally, the hotline, by being a one-stop-shop for children (including by enabling referrals),
has the potential to integrate other service providers and consolidate their offer around the hotline,
which would address the problem of miss ing coordination of child-related services in Georgia.
Consequently, it would also have the potential to increase not only the overall effectiveness of the
system, but also its efficiency. The fact that the Child Hotline 111 has the backing of the government
and support of UNICEF, and can draw from ample experiences from other countries gives good
chances for the service to be a sustainable solution. The possible future difficulty may be ensuring
consistent financing. However, the funding requirements have been fully assumed by the GoG, which
limits such a risk.
The evaluation of the preschool staff training has shown that the online mode of training can work
for theoretical parts of training, but cannot replace practical classes.168 Since it would not jeopardize
educational outcomes, organizing theoretical training in the remote mode can contribute to long-
term efficiency of training programs for Georgian preschool staff. With limited resources for their
continuing professional development, this could provide an important opportunity, even though this
mode of delivery may not be preferred by preschool staff. The online mode would not, however, be
appropriate for the more practice-oriented training when learning-by-doing and the opportunity to
benefit from supervision make the greatest difference. The consultant delivering the training noted
as a challenge that they were not able to “observe the teachers' practice and make
recommendations based on it.”169 Consequently, the combination of both online and offline training
can be an optimal solution for ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of the learning outcomes
from future training services, on the one hand, and efficiency in service provision, on the other. This
was also acknowledged by a UNICEF representative.170
There is potential for the long-term sustainability of the service, as the project is being continued,
with UNICEF supporting the MoESCS of Georgia and Adjara in the design and implementation of a
series of capacity development activities for preschool educators and managers for improved
services for young children. These will start with an event for all municipalities of Adjara to share
achievements, challenges, and next steps from the eight pilot preschools in Batumi and Khulo.171 The
fact that a reflection on the pilot experiences has been foreseen can help ensure the success of
subsequent stages. The involvement of the MoESCS is an important factor, which can help
mainstream the service in other regions of the country. The intervention is now led by the TPDC, a
legal entity of public law of the MoESCS. This partnership is a significant achievement, as TPDC is the
focal agency for determining in-service training requirements for preschool educators. These
requirements are currently minimal (66 hours) and, because of the intervention, could be expanded
to include more intensive and practice-based supervision/coaching for all preschool educators in
the future.
Importantly, the results of the pilot training or its future continuations in terms of changing
preschool practices will also depend on factors such as the infrastructure and resources available
in kindergartens, staff workload, group size and staff remuneration. As many problems persist in

COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
these respects (see also section 3.1.2 and 3.2.3), the future training efforts should go hand-in-hand
with investments in those other areas. Regarding equipment investment, the consultant for the pilot
training developed a list of high-quality m aterials created during the project and the exemplary
materials that had been provided in some preschools. These should enable kindergarten
management unions to better select quality resources when purchasing items in the future.172 The
commitment expressed by the Batumi ki ndergarten union to investing in upgrading physical
environment of preschools, including purchasing of educational materials,173 should be used.
Improving staff working conditions, apart from more child-free time etc., should also involve
facilitating the development of contacts with parents or other caregivers, as their involvement is
a crucial part of ECEC.174 Creating conditions for good relations between preschool staff and parents
can help make the ECE system more resilient in case of future shocks, allowing for better continuity
of learning.175 ECE cannot be moved online in the same way as other stages of education, as young
children should not spend time in front of a computer.176 Since the COVID-19 pandemic placed more
burden for supporting child learning on parents or other caregivers in general education,177 one can
expect that this burden has been even higher in case of caregivers of children in the ECD age range.
They become an inevitable mediator between teachers and children, and thus an even more
indispensable partner in addressing the educational needs of their children.
The evaluation revealed that SMAs for pregnant women delivered online could work as a service
for health promotion for subjects that are less personal in nature, offering long-term efficiency.178
Since one appointment can gather as many as 25 women, this can offer savings as compared to
one-on-one appointments. It can also ensure access to the best professional medical staff for a
wider group of women. However, as the experience of this intervention shows, delivery of such a
service in a sustainable way would require good infrastructure and organization.179 Recruitment of
women for SMAs was conducted by staff of the NCDC and Birth Registry who called all pregnant
women in the country to inform them about the service and arrange their participation. Such a
procedure was very time and resource-intensive, and consequently not sustainable. As a result, the
service was discontinued, even though the participants expressed demand for more appointments.
However, since the overall usefulness of the service was acknowledged, at the request of NCDC,
UNICEF is currently working on preparing a platform where pregnant women can book appointments,
choose doctors, and participate in shared antenatal consultations,180 based on its experiences with

setting up a similar platform for immunizations. The NCDC intends to utilize this tested service
m odality for maternal and child health promotion,181 which gives positive prospects for sustained
benefits from this intervention. If accom panied by an ongoing information campaign and
appropriate infrastructure, which would ensure sustainability, SMAs could increase the resilience of
the services for pregnant women in case of future crises. They can also improve effectiveness and
efficiency of the service in the longer term through better use of medical doctors’ time, but also
through the introduction of the experience sharing component. The latter is important in crises which
entail prolonged isolation, as has been the case with COVID-19.
More systemically, there are factors which contribute to the sustainability of the evaluated
interventions in the future. For one, the actions address important systemic gaps and there is
consensus among stakeholders as to their importance. All were introduced and implemented in
cooperation with the government or other relevant national and regional actors. In fact, ownership of
all those interventions is not with UNICEF, but the counterparts, while UNICEF has played a crucial role
at various stages. Piloting specific solutions, as in the case of training for preschool staff in Adjara,
also contributes to achieving greater sustainability of the eventually mainstreamed service, as the
lessons learned during the pilot improve subsequent versions of the service. In a similar vein, building
new actions on previous experiences (e.g. immunization platform for developing the SMA booking
system) creates conditions for their greater sustainability. Finally, the various implemented
interventions (even if they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic) are complementary and can
synergize well, e.g. SMAs are also accompanied by another effort to improve the capacity of rural
primary healthcare providers through the provision of equipment, building a digital platform, and
training providers. Such synergies can translate into the better perception of all those services and
better involvement of beneficiaries.
4.0 Conclusions
UNICEF’s ECD programme in Georgia responds to various identified and continuously monitored
systemic gaps with respect to ECD. It works on creating an enabling environment for children –
including children with disabilities – in the country, improving infant and maternal health, the primary
health care, and alternative care systems, as well as ECE.
The pandemic has destabilized the lives of children and their parents in Georgia practically in all
dimensions of UNICEF’s work and beyond. The organization has responded with an array of activities,
including communication and awareness-raising, equipment provision, education and capacity
building, infrastructure development, technical assistance etc. Interventions have been rolled out,
both ad hoc and systemic in nature. Adaptations have been made to previously developed services,
mostly involving moving services online, as in the case of the pilot training. New services, such as the
Child Hotline 111 or SMAs, have also been introduced.
The evaluated interventions were a relevant response to the challenges of the pandemic. They
allowed for continuation of service provision through remote delivery. Introduction of the remote
mode of delivery in the case of analyzed interventions did not seem to impose an excessive burden
in terms of staff, capacity or technology. But it did impose some limitations both on the services’
accessibility and content. In the case of a medical intervention with an aspiration to reach as many
beneficiaries as possible, such as the SMAs, remote delivery excluded those without appropriate ICT
181 UNICEF, Situation report of 30th October 2020.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 61
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
infrastructure and equipment. Although where Internet and equipment are available or quickly
provided, online delivery can help to overcome other barriers, e.g. reach the most remote locations.
Privacy and intimacy-related concerns lim ited the content of the SMAs to the more general
pregnancy-related topics, which confirms that the shared and online format cannot replace
traditional ANC. In the case of an educational initiative such as the pilot training, online delivery works
for the theoretical components, but makes practical elements difficult or impossible to implement.
As the experience of the pilot training suggests, a well-balanced combination of both modes can
mitigate risks, while also ensuring efficiency.
The evaluated interventions are relevant at a systemic level. They fill out wider gaps, such as the need
for a one-stop-shop mechanisms providing information on and coordination of the dispersed child-
related services; neglected health education and promotion, as well as still high infant and maternal
mortality rates; insufficient knowledge and competences among preschool staff (e.g. in relation to
legal standards, child-friendly play, or inclusive education) and resource deficiencies in preschools.
As such, these interventions fit well with UNICEF ECD programs, being complementary to and
potentially strengthening other interventions in the same areas. However, the evaluation also shows
that more effort needs to be made, including more research conducted, if they are to be lastingly
and usefully embedded in the wider system.
The Child Hotline 111 and the pilot training appear to be relevant to the needs of their target groups.
Although more research would be necessary among the beneficiaries of Child Hotline 111 to fully
understand to what extent this is the case. The data on the SMAs is not sufficient to make this
assessment, and more research would be desired. There are some indications that the SMAs were
relevant for participating pregnant women, but the fact that the majority of the invited women
resigned from participation highlights the need for further evaluation.
Evidence on effectiveness was more limited than on relevance, especially in the case of the SMAs
and pilot training for which more research would be recommended. Assessment of effectiveness
could also benefit from strengthening of the interventions’ M&E systems.
We can conclude that the Child Hotline 111 has the potential to contribute to its short-term and long-
term outcomes. As a mechanism for improving access to services, the hotline is also viewed as a
possible coordinating platform for child-related services. Yet to achieve such an ambition, it needs
to develop better coordination and cooperation mechanisms with other service providers, as well as
strong internal procedures, which are currently lacking.
By contributing to its outcomes, the Child Hotline 111 can help to create a conducive and nurturing
environment that will enable children to survive, thrive, and reach their full potential. The one-stop-
shop character of the service is perceived as its main advantage, both for service provision and
integration, as well as monitoring of needs and bottlenecks. Therefore, the hotline’s links to the wider
child protection system should be strengthened.
At the moment, the Child Hotline 111 can largely address the callers’ needs, in particular when these
can be tackled internally, although further research among beneficiaries would be needed. When
external actors need to be involved, effectiveness can be lowered. The operators perceive the barriers
to the hotline’s effectiveness as mostly external, e.g. poor, or lacking services in Georgia, lack of
cooperation from external service providers, especially municipalities (both on service provision, but
also information sharing). However, internal factors seem to play a significant role as well. These
include technical and procedural shortcomings (e.g. lack of an internal and external monitoring
system, standard operating procedures, referral pathways), staff competence gaps and lack of
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 62
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
training opportunities, lack of systemic links to other hotlines and services, etc. These internal
challenges translate particularly into a still very limited effectiveness of the hotline as a monitoring
mechanism for increasing knowledge on the beneficiaries’ needs and bottlenecks in service
provision. The evaluation clearly shows the need for further development of the hotline and its
integration with other services. This is to be tackled in the work of the international and local
consultants hired by UNICEF.
A significant number of the effectively reac hed pregnant women participated in the SMA, which is
promising for service continuation and mainstreaming. The majority did decline participation,
including because they just did not want to participate. So, while the SMAs display potential to support
ANC provision at times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still much to be learned
about this service, both in terms of relevance and effectiveness. It would, in particular, be useful to
understand the specific benefits the SMAs carry for participants. The current data does not e.g. allow
for authoritative conclusions on how effective the intervention has been in increasing the
participants’ knowledge and awareness. It would also be useful to examine the SMAs’ added value
for the wider service system. In view of the significant resignation rate, more could be known about
pregnant women’s needs and expectations, as well as the more concrete (underlying) reasons for
their resignation from joining SMAs. All these insights would allow for evidence-based decision-
making as to whether the service should be a long-term addition to the ANC offer in Georgia and, if
so, how it should be embedded in the system. With more data, one could also think of such a service
being introduced for other groups of potential beneficiaries, especially those with a normally higher
need for specialized medical and professional care, and exposed to isolation. In this context, parents
of children with disabilities come to mind, as they often experience isolation regardless of emergency
contexts and are particularly severely affected by service discontinuation.
As with the SMAs, the data on the pilot training does not allow for authoritative conclusions on how
effective the intervention has been in increasing the participants’ knowledge and awareness.
However, it is enough to see the potential of this intervention to change attitudes, introduce new
concepts and elevate the competences of preschool staff. So far, the practical hands-on
components of this training, which are the most conducive to achieving the above-mentioned
changes, were limited by the pandemic. So, it would be advisable to continue the implementation of
the pilot in its originally-intended format to document and evaluate its full results. This can help to
make informed decisions on the pilot’s mainstreaming in the country, including potential changes of
the mode of delivery.
At the same time, the project does offer quick wins by introducing open-ended materials to
preschools and changing the environments in pilot kindergartens. These are small and inexpensive,
yet visible steps towards addressing systemic shortcomings. The project also brings together
national and regional actors, governmental and non-governmental, which gives better prospects for
sustainability and spillover effects. Importantly, its effectiveness is challenged by serious systemic
deficiencies in the preschool sector, related to infrastructure and resources, staff workload, group
size, and staff remuneration. If the staff are to be motivated and change practices towards more
child-friendly, there is a need for advocating for systemic changes, especially more resource
allocation into the sector.

sustainability of implemented interventions, while lack of these elements constitutes a challenge.
The key nature of a stakeholder may result from a number of attributes, such as their legal mandate,
specific expertise or resources. For example , in the SMAs, the cooperation with the NCDC and Birth
Registry provided access to all pregnant women in the country. By contrast, the challenging
cooperation with municipalities – a key stakeholder mandated to deliver child protection services –
continues to affect the effectiveness of the Child Hotline 111 negatively. For the pilot training in Adjara,
the involvement of the TPDC, a focal agency for determining in-service training requirements for
preschool educators, opens the door to mainstreaming the results of the project.
Lesson learned # 2
In emergency contexts, in which there is a need for rapid feedback coupled with limited time for
producing new evidence, a good monitoring system is indispensable, if timely conclusions are to
be generated and lessons drawn. It is therefore advisable to resist the pressure to skip this step or –
if this has been the case – quickly mobilize resources to develop such a system, including a minimum
necessary indicators and data collection.
Lesson learned # 3
Online mode of training delivery for preschool staff is not fit for practical components, as it does
not allow for observation of in-class dynamics and staff supervision. Delivering capacity-building
activities entirely online should therefore be opted for only when face-to-face contact is not possible,
and hybrid mode should be preferred otherwise, with theory provided via online classes.
6.0 Recommendations
During the evaluation, recommendations were prepared after each rapid assessment cycle. Those
recommendations were included in the analytical briefs annexed to this report (see Volume 2 of
Country Report). The recommendations in the first analytical brief benefited from multi-stakeholder
consultations conducted through a reflection workshop. The recommendations in the analytical
briefs were divided into systemic and service-level.
The recommendations included below have been developed based on the final analysis of all the
collected research material and further reflection between the evaluators and the UNICEF ECARO and
UNICEF Georgia CO. As a result of these reflections, the recommendations were prioritized and only
those with the highest priority were included in the list. In response to an explicit request, the
recommendations were directed solely at UNICEF and tried, to the extent possible considering the
evaluation’s limitations, to present higher-level actions (i.e. related to wider ECD system). While the
recommendations are for UNICEF, the achievement of their underlying objectives will necessitate the
involvement and cooperation of other actors, in particular, the GoG and its agencies.
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 64
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
In line with the evaluation findings in Georgia, we recommend for UNICEF to:
I. Continue to support the GoG and regional authorities in Georgia to build an inclusive early
childhood education system by developing staff competences and improving the working
(and learning) conditions in preschools.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include:
• Ensuring proper documentation, monitoring and evaluation of the ongoing pilot training for
preschool staff in Adjara to use the collected evidence in advocating for systemic solutions to
the competency gap in the preschool sector, in particular with respect to inclusive education
standards;
• Advocating and providing technical assistance for developing and introducing a programme
for initial and continuing professional development of preschool staff in Georgia, which would:
i. incorporate the experiences of the pilot training (e.g. on combining the online and
offline modes of training delivery) and be in line with the newly adopted standards for
preschool education;
ii. target wider personnel (including preschool support staff);
iii. include components devoted to inclusive early childhood education and care and
skills for effective communication and interaction with parents;
• Advocating and providing technical assistance for an analysis of the preschool staff’s working
conditions and needs, and based on the analysis - development of measures for their
improvement, e.g. increasing child-free hours and making investments in infrastructure and
equipment, as well as raising staff remuneration.
II. Continue to address the structural issues affecting women’s and children’s access to quality
health care, including through using and implementing the recommendations from the
assessment of the SMAs.
III. Continue to support the GoG to further develop the Child Hotline 111 into a fully functional one-
stop-shop mechanism integrating child-related services in Georgia and a monitoring
mechanism providing policymakers with information on those needs and systemic bottlenecks.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include advocating and providing
technical assistance for:
• developing recommendations on the role of the Child Hotline 111 in the overall system of services
for children and families, proposing clear leadership and accountabilities across service
providers to cooperate with the Child Hotline 111;
• developing cooperation mechanisms (e.g. through agreements, memoranda of
understanding, coordination councils or other platforms, regular meetings, working groups,
conferences, etc.) between the Child Hotline 111 and other child-related service providers, which
could foster overall coordination and improvements in child-related services in the country;
• developing and implementing legal measures that oblige state institutions to provide
information about child-oriented services and their changes to the Child Hotline 111;
• creating technical and functional links between the Child Hotline 111 and GoG’s other hotline
1505;
MULTI-COUNTRY EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF ECD RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE ECA REGION / 65
COUNTRY REPORT: GEORGIA
• developing technical solutions (e.g. joint service databases for service providers) to facilitate
integration of and access to knowledge between the Child Hotline 111 and other child-related
services, respecting relevant privacy s tandards;
• promoting the Child Hotline 111 services among beneficiaries (children, parents and other
caregivers) and potential partners, in particular CSOs providing child-related services.
IV. Support the GoG to strengthen the capacity of the Child Hotline 111 to provide quality services
to children and families.
Suggestions to operationalize this recommendation include advocating and providing
technical assistance for:
• developing service quality standards and a performance monitoring system with relevant
indicators; establishing robust and detailed service guidelines, standard operating procedures
and referral pathways, including in cases of violence against children, and follow-up
procedures;
• ensuring opportunities for Child Hotline 111’s staff to build working relationships with
representatives of different service providers (foster people-to-people contacts) to facilitate
(increase effectiveness of) cross-service cooperation;
• developing solutions for staff retention, continuous training and supervision to provide an
effective response to the calls.
V. Conduct an assessment of the SMAs to understand: (i) the benefits they carry for participants;
(ii) pregnant women’s needs and more concrete (underlying) reasons for women’s resignation
from participation; and (iii) the added value the SMAs bring to the existing health care services
during and beyond the context of COVID-19.
