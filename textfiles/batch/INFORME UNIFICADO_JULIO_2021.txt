Executive summary
This report accounts for the evaluation of the School and Gardens Network Project
Inclusive Mandela (Red Mandela), promoted by UNICEF and carried out by the INEED,
between the months of August 2019 and March 2020.
This formative evaluation was aimed at accounting for the design,
Implementation and results of the Mandela network. Tried to relieve the valuations that
The fundamental participants of the process are carried out: directors and directors, inspectors and
Inspectors, teachers and teachers, technicians and techniques and families. From the perspective of these
actors and quantitative information of the educational centers, it was sought to analyze the
compliance with the objectives set by the program, as well as the result generated in
the educational practices of teachers and in the inclusion of children with disabilities.
The general objective was to document, describe and analyze the design, the process of
Implementation and the results obtained by the Mandela network. The evaluation carried out
will allow a balance on the results achieved by the project after five
years of implementation, as well as having information to know if this strategy has
been relevant, providing inputs to identify what aspects require improvements and which
They need adjustments and/or improvements.
On March 1, 2020, the transition of government occurred and, within that framework, the assumption of
The current educational authorities. In this context, the new anep budget
By 2020-2024 includes strategic objectives related to inclusive education,
establishing it as one of the ten transversal policies of the ANEP. Throughout 2020
The UNICEF cooperation program for 2021-2025 was also developed, which was
agreed with the government and prepared with contributions from civil society and the private sector. He
Program establishes assistance for the elaboration of a national education plan
Inclusive that guarantees access, educational continuity, participation and achievements of
The most vulnerable children, in particular, of those with disabilities.
In this way, the evaluation will allow supplies to the educational authorities to
contribute to establish an inclusive national policy that guarantees the right to a
Quality education for all children.
to. Evaluation audiences
The evaluation has been adjusted to UNICEF ethical standards in research,
evaluations, collection and data analysis. In September 2019, the

Data, confidentiality of the information and data of the actors involved. In October of
2019 The guarantee was received by UNICEF, thus starting the field work.
b. Methodology
The methodological design developed was structured based on the three components of the
Evaluation: 1) Design, 2) Implementation and 3) Results.
8
To account for the design of the program, a qualitative strategy was carried out, together with the
Program documentation analysis. Exploratory interviews were conducted
(Coordinators and Coordinators of the Network, educational authorities and experts in the subject)
which contributed to make methodological decisions for survey.
For the implementation of the program, a combined strategy was carried out. The
quantitative strategy investigated the different sources of information available from the
program. The qualitative strategy investigated how the project is effectively implemented.
A sample of territorial units of the program was developed, defined by this
Evaluation as “Nodes of the Network” (Common School and Special School/Resource Center).
There the opinions of the main actors were relieved: directors and directors, teachers and
Teachers, teachers and teachers of itinerant support, the inspectors and
Inspectors, as well as families of students with disabilities.
To account for the results of the program, a combined strategy was carried out.
The qualitative dimension was focused on analyzing inclusion teaching practices
educational, as well as the assessments of the actors of the network. The quantitative component
He concentrated on evaluating the inclusion of children with disabilities, in gardens and
Common schools of the network.
c. Conclusions
9.1 - The theory of change implicit in the program is relevant to the policy problem
public, the set of components and activities is consistent and is aligned to
International Inclusive Education standards.
9.2 - The program does not explicitly incorporate the gender perspective.
9.3 - The program was designed to be applied jointly by actors that do not have
A hierarchical link to each other, but does not create a formal scope that promotes and institutionalizes
Coordination, hindering its operation.
9.4 - The schools invited to participate in the network already had, in general, experiences of
Inclusion, despite which the degree of implementation was heterogeneous.
9.5 - The special school reconfiguration process to the resource center was not
complete.
9.6 - The pedagogical component allowed the incorporation of the inclusion paradigm and gave
a partial response to the need for teacher training.
9.7 - The social environmental component was implemented incompletely and heterogeneously.
9.8 - The accessibility component was not systematically implemented and
homogeneous
9.9 - The monitoring and evaluation component was not implemented.
9
d. Lessons learned
10.1 - While the theory of change can be relevant and coherent, by implementing a
program on an existing structure (as in this case, special education and
common education) the limitations that this structure must be analyzed in depth
impose and how to overcome these barriers. In particular, the roles and functions must be detailed
of each of the intervening actors.
10.2 - When designing a program it is necessary to have mechanisms that ensure the
consideration of transversal themes (such as gender issues) that can
have a significant interaction with the problem that the program seeks to solve.
10.3 - The previous experience that the inclusion centers possessed did not assure
a complete implementation of the program. Common work agreements and dialogue
Among the different actors they seem to be priority when it comes to contributing to decreasing this
disparity.
10.4 - The transformation of special schools to resource centers requires
deeper changes than those that can be obtained from the commitment of
leaders of the centers.
10.5 - There is a clear unsatisfied demand from teachers to receive training
In inclusive education. The component implemented by the program was useful but partial;
It is necessary to design a broader and more sustainable solution over time.
10.6 - The social environmental component was well valued by the network actors in
those cases in which they could access and contributes to the community that integrates the
School value inclusion if worked properly.
10.7 - The accessibility component should have been planned more homogeneously
For the entire network instead of trusting existing mechanisms, but did not ensure their
implementation.
10.8 - The evaluation and monitoring component must be integrated from the beginning of the
program and designed specifically for it. The preexistence of records
administrative (who were present in this case) may not be enough for
The results of the program can be rebuilt once it started.
and. Recommendations
11.1. Define and disseminate the roles/functions of the different actors that make up the network and
Establish objectives for the short, medium and long term.
11.2. Strengthen the process of transformation of special schools to centers of
resources.
10
11.3. Strengthen training in inclusive education and dissemination of the inclusion paradigm
as support and accompaniment to the teaching role.
11.4. Strengthen the teaching exchange with different actors from the educational community and
local actors.
11.5. Generate a monitoring and evaluation system.
11.6. Generate and establish the accessibility component.
11.7. Incorporate gender perspective in all program components.
11.8. Deepen the knowledge of local realities that allow the development of
strategies adjusted to territorial needs and the coupling of these to the structure
General of the program.
11.9. Generate roles to enhance family accompaniment.
11.10. Establish actions that allow better planning and implementation of
Workshops with students and families.

1. Background and context
This section presents a brief description of the educational policy, as well as the
Paradigm of educational inclusion on which the program is based, making special emphasis
In the national regulatory panorama that gives context to the network of schools and gardens
Inclusive mandela. This allows you to introduce the reader in the problem that will be addressed
by the program evaluated and the educational situation and needs of children with
Uruguay disability. The information presented in this section is expanded in the
Sector 8.2.1. There it deepens and complements the story of the actors consulted.
1.1 Education approaches for children with disabilities
Disability has had huge conceptual modifications throughout history,
From the anthropological, biological, economic and political point of view (Brogna, 2009). In the
Middle Ages, those who presented some deficiency, whether evident or not
perceived, they were considered magical products, religious punishments; This type of
explanations about the existence of a deviation from the norm caused reactions and
violent solutions such as throwing newborn children or sending them out
of the city without any help causing, inexorably, death. Are
attitudes correspond to the dispensing model.
In the mid -twentieth century, after both world wars, the countries that had
Sent soldiers to fight, they found that those sent,
productive and with "intact" capabilities, they returned with motor difficulties and disorders
of mental health. It is here that a new concept of disability begins, linked to
rehabilitate those capabilities or functions losses so that the production of these
people return. The objective of this model, called a medical-rehabilitator, differs
from the previous one as long as people with some deficiency can return to
Incorporate functions, as well as the children born with some deficiency. This
approach prioritizes that the person is rehabilitated as much as possible to contribute and produce in the
society; In the event that this does not happen, attitudes linked to segregation
They are the strategies chosen by the policies of the states and the attitudes of the
societies.
In the 60s of the twentieth century, within the framework of social movements worldwide
for human rights, organizations of people with disabilities and their
Family members began a new disability approach called social model. It is here
When the environment begins to be hierarchized when the existence of
disability; The environment is the one that produces disability as long as it does not guarantee
necessary conditions for the participation and carrying of activities of the daily life of
Some of its members.
12
The development of the special education field has accompanied this revision path
about disability through a series of stages in which educational systems
different means have explored to guarantee the right to children's education
with disabilities. In the case of education there are also three approaches that are
They associate the detailed models above. First, the segregation approach
classifies boys and girls based on their functional limitation and separates them into a
education that differentiated between the "common" and the "special." Secondly, a
Integrative education in which children with disabilities are integrated into the system
regular educational in special classes or in a common classroom with adjustments or supports
non -existent or inappropriate. Finally, the inclusive education approach recognizes the
need to adapt cultures, policies and practices in school to comply with
The different needs of each student, as well as the obligation to eliminate barriers
that prevent inclusion (UNICEF 2014).
This paradigm of inclusive education, based on the social model of disability,
part of the idea that all children must learn together, beyond their
differences and particularities (UNESCO, 2005). Thus, inclusion is an aspiration that
It covers the diversity of students, but putting particular emphasis on those who
may be at risk of marginalization, exclusion or school failure associated with factors
Social or economic (Simon and Echeita, 2013).
Next, a brief description of the Uruguayan experience is made regarding
Education for people with disabilities.
1.2 Educational policy and inclusion in primary education: Uruguay
Paradigm changes regarding the education of people with disabilities have
generated modifications in the educational policies of various countries. In the case
individual from Uruguay, with the creation of special schools for people with
Disability, arises over the early twentieth century in the field of the Education Council
Primary, special education. In 1985 an integrationist restructuring is carried out, for the
which is created the figure of the itinerant support teacher, and the integration of the children is sought
and girls with disabilities within the common school1.
Special education in Uruguay was evolving and is currently part of the
Educational Inclusion Policy and is defined by the Initial and Primary Education Council
(CEIP) as:
“(…) A network of schools, classrooms, projects, equipment, teachers, devices, strategies, resources and modalities
of the educational system, to favor the learning of children and adolescents with disabilities,
difficulties in learning and high capacities, developed from a rights perspective, within the framework of
an inclusive education and a school with everyone, for each and every one. ”2
Among the modalities of special education are: classrooms in common schools
In inclusion in common education groups, support teachers in school

2 http://www.ceip.edu.uy/educacion-especial-es/der-including-special
13
Common, Shared in Common and Special School, Special School Support,
among others. Additionally, there are a number of inclusion support programs
Educational as are the network of schools and gardens of infants Mandela3, the program
A.pr.en.D.E.R4, the Community Teachers Program5 and that of enjoyable schools6.
In this context, special schools are maintained for those students
for which this school constitutes “the only place of educational insertion, whose
disability requires significant adaptation of school format, strategies,
resources and support and whose income decision is taken under the “higher interest of the
Child ”7
Despite the transformations of the last two decades in the international regulatory framework
and national that promote the adoption of inclusive education, a trend is observed
constant in the number of special schools since the 90s, as well as in the
Relationship between the enrollment of students in special schools regarding the total registration
in common education8. According to the available data, in 2019 there were 1971 public schools
In Uruguay that have a registration of 330,000 students, while there were 81
Public Schools of Special Education, with a enrollment of 5670 students. Of those
schools, 74 are for boys and girls with intellectual disabilities9, 4 for boys and girls with
Auditory disability and 2 for boys and girls with visual disabilities. In turn, of the total
Special Schools 26 are located in Montevideo and 54 in the interior of the country10.

Both educational policy definitions and the regulatory framework have evolved
towards the promotion of the inclusion of children and young people in the classrooms of the centers
common educational, establishing that the necessary adjustments must be made to
Eliminate or minimize learning barriers. However, "educational inclusion is not
exhausts in the enrollment of children with disabilities in common schools,
It implies the existence of a public policy that guarantees the availability of
Human resources with adequate training, curricular flexibility, accessibility
Physics and communication ”(Da Rosa and Mas, 2013: 22). Therefore, so that inclusion
educational is made, it must be accompanied by changes in key issues such as the
training, roles and purposes of teachers and other professionals who work
in the educational system, and with greater endowment of resources and tools for whom
they must carry out these processes of inclusion and adaptation (Echeita Sarrionandia, G. and
Ainscow, M., 2011).
The training of teachers in this area has shown some advances; Both the
current teaching program such as Teachers include in their fourth year a
"Learning and Inclusion" Seminar lasting. Also, in 2013 it was signed
16
an agreement between ANEP and the Faculty of Psychology of the University of the Republic for
develop the specialization in social and educational inclusion that aimed to form
specialists to give institutional response to the problems that our society
It currently presents social exclusion, discrimination and accessibility failures.

2. Evaluation object
The promotion of inclusive education is one of the priority policy lines that
The Initial and Primary Education Council of the National Administration has been promoting
of Public Education of Uruguay (hereinafter, CEIP). In this context, the office of
UNICEF in Uruguay provides support to the CEIP since 2014 to promote approaches to
inclusive education that guarantee the exercise of the right to children's education,
most vulnerable girls and adolescents and those with disabilities.
Based on this background, UNICEF Uruguay and the Inter -American Institute on
Disability and inclusive development (hereinafter, Iiddi) developed in 2012 a first
diagnosis on the situation of children and adolescents with disabilities in the
Country (UNICEF 2013) 11.
2.1 The Mandela12 network
Based on the challenges identified, the recommendations and proposals, the CEIP and UNICEF
An agreement to implement a pilot project signs at the beginning of 2014
called "Network of Schools and Gardens Mandela", with the support
IIDI technician. This project was initially proposed that the centers incorporated the
Paradigm of inclusive education in relation to children with disabilities,
sharing experiences and systematizing practices and lessons learned, so that
They also serve as inspiration for the rest of the initial and primary education centers
public of the country.
Along these lines, the main purposes of the network are:
● Promote the development of schools and kindergartens that implement
Inclusive education projects throughout the country.
● Improve support available so that schools can implement,
hold and evaluate their inclusive education practices.
● Promote empowerment and collaboration processes between key actors
For educational inclusion: teachers, students, families, school staff and
community.
● Stimulate processes of exchange, shared learning, visibility and
Dissemination of good inclusion practices between resource centers
(Special Schools), Schools and Gardens of Common Infants.

12 as detailed in sections 3 (purpose of the evaluation), 4 (evaluation objectives) and
5 (Evaluation Framework), one of the committees of the evaluation has to do with the conformation
of the design of the program theory. Based on this objective, the information of the Mandela network
which is presented below, referring to the components, committed and expected changes and
Coverage, has been rebuilt from this evaluation.
18
● Generate evidence and systematize education implementation models
inclusive in Uruguay through documentation and evaluation of
experiences.
To carry out these purposes, and in line with the new conception of the
disability and international recommendations, the program was structured in four
Components:
● Pedagogical component
● Social environmental component
● Monitoring and evaluation component
● Accessibility component13
The information presented below is the result of a survey of
secondary information, documentary review and interviews, which has allowed the
systematization of the components and activities of the program that so far does not
They were documented in one place. Next, each of the
Program components according to the information available.
2.1.1 The pedagogical component.
The pedagogical component is developed through the following activities:
● Postgraduate course in inclusive education
● Teaching rooms
● Network work with the Espejo school
The postgraduate degree in inclusive education was developed by Flacso in agreement with CEIP and
UNICEF. At the time of doing the field work, they had been carried out in three editions
Since 2016 and more than 750 teachers and school teachers had participated in
Common and special education.
The course aims:
● Promote the production, systematization and exchange of practices of
inclusive education in public schools throughout the country, through a
theoretical-practical training, based on the new paradigms of the
Inclusive education.
● Promote group production meetings where each participant works with
Conceptualizations on inclusive education articulating them with their practices
everyday and can rethink their role in the institution to which it belongs.14

distributed in 6 face -to -face matches of 8 hours each (total 48 hours) with experts
international, 5 months of virtual platform work that includes design and
Implementation of Institutional or Classroom Inclusive Education (212 hours) and a
Certificate delivery event (do not compute during the course hours, being optional).
The course has 7 Flacso tutors that are doing the academic monitoring of
The students. In addition, participants have 24 facilitators (inspectors or teacher
support that the course in previous editions have approved) that they accompany
pedagogical for the implementation of inclusive education proposals in the classroom or
Institutional projects.
To approve the course, the participant only has a lack of instances
face -to -face, you must comply with the hours of platform and do a final job
which consists of an inclusive practice proposal to work in classroom or the development of
Institutional Inclusive Education Project.
The teaching rooms consist of a space for discussion and analysis of teachers of the
Common school where reflection on educational practices and
Exchange on concrete inclusion experiences. The teachers participate in them,
Teachers and management teams of common schools and directors and directors of
Special schools, sometimes accompanied by itinerant or support teachers.
2.1.2 The social environmental component
The social environmental component has as its purpose “to favor the processes of
Empowerment and collaboration between key actors for educational inclusion:
teachers, students, families, school staff and community ”15. To achieve this purpose,
They developed awareness workshops with students and families. These workshops
They are developed by young people from the Meta Group, a network of young Latin American
composed of young people with and without disabilities who work with different topics for
Rights of people with disabilities. The workshops aimed at
theme of disability and generate empathy between families and students who attend
The school that participates in the network, towards people with disabilities.
The workshops cover different areas such as science, photography, art, music, narratives to
through which issues such as inclusion, disability, diversity, equality,
Rights, learn together, respect, etc. The workshops begin with a playful activity, a
video, an exchange with students from which the topic to work is presented that
It promotes the development of activities and reflections. These workshops serve as a first
Awareness to the subject with the aim of eliminating attitudinal barriers - prejudices -
Regarding the issue of disability. They are a fundamental tool considering the
15 http://www.cep.edu.uy/name,-components-y-prop%C3%B3sitos
20
need to generate social inclusion of students with disabilities in the
Schools This is: generation of positive and friendship bonds with their classmates
class and guarantee a participation in such a way that it is not only to be in the classroom but be
part of it (from Boer 2012). It was planned to carry out 3 workshops per school16 oriented to
students and 3 workshops more families for each year.
2.1.3 Component of monitoring and evaluation and accessibility component
Depending on the information relieved by the evaluation, it should be noted that both the
Accessibility component such as monitoring are not described or explained in a way
systematic in the documents produced by the Network. In this regard, they are named
isolated way, either on the web17 of the network, as in some of the interviews
made to the central actors of the program. Therefore, it can be noted that both
components were not designed or specified in relation to their tasks and
Objectives pursued.
Monitoring and evaluation component: although there were different attempts to develop
Registration and evaluation forms, these were isolated and did not have the expected success. To the
same time, there are records in Gurí (CEIP web system that allows management
unified records and information), but do not allow to extract information for the purpose of
evaluation and monitoring, since it is not systematic, standardized and
homogeneous.
Accessibility component: In all cases relieved, it was isolated actions
and dependent on the will of each educational center, mainly through the
PODES PROJECTS (EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT18) OR LINK
with the CEIP infrastructure department.
In both cases these are components that do not have a direct responsible for their
implementation and development by the network, so any action in these
aspects is the product of decisions and needs of each center or region and not of
centralized or promoted actions from the coordination of the program.
2.2 Committed and expected changes
From the program documents and based on the story prepared by the technicians
that formed the mandela network, the tasted tasks and the form of
carry them forward. It is important to note that the program does not have a design
explained in documents, where it is detailed among other things: what is the problem to
attend? How do you intend to address this problem? What are the hypotheses that
Do they relate the problem to the program components, their results?
16 Planning 2017. Although in some cases it has varied according to the specificities of schools.

21
Consequently, the evaluation team rebuilt the theory of change depending on the
Released information, according to the program component.
● Expected change: equal educational opportunities, that is, make
effective the right of access of children with disabilities to the
Education in common schools as well as their pairs without disabilities.
 Long -term hypothesis: children with disabilities can learn
in the same way as children without disabilities in common schools.
● Change in the medium term:
 Special schools change their role to resource centers, providing
Technical assistance to common schools in their inclusion practices.
 Common schools receive support and facilitators from resource centers
to serve boys and girls with disabilities.
 ANEP increases the positions of itinerant support and support teachers and
Classroom teachers decrease depending on educational inclusion in
Common schools.
 Common school teachers develop inclusive classroom practices.
 The educational community (schools and families) knows the rights of children
and girls in relation to access and permanence to education, has
formed human resources and accessible infrastructure.
● Changes in the short term:
 Infant Schools and Gardens Implement inclusive education projects
throughout the country.
 ANEP increases the support available so that schools can
Implement, sustain and evaluate their inclusive education practices.
 Empowerment and collaboration processes between the actors are developed
KEYS FOR EDUCATIONAL INCLUSION: Trained teachers, students and families
Informed regarding the demand for rights, school staff
maintains articulation actions with specialized actors as psychologists,
doctors and civil society organizations that work on issues of
disability,
 Common resource centers and schools have exchange meetings,
shared learning, visibility and dissemination of good practices of
Educational inclusion.

The main network work strategy has been to integrate special schools and
common schools to work the inclusion of children with disabilities in schools
common. Red work seeks to develop strategies, devices and support that
enable the learning of students with disabilities, fundamentally
providing teachers tools to build, from a perspective of
rights, inclusive education, specifically through its permanent training and
of the generation of teaching exchange spaces.
For the implementation of the project, a technical commission composed of officials is created
of the Initial and Primary Education Council of the National Education Administration
Public (CEIP-AEP), UNICEF and the Inter-American Institute on Disability and
Inclusive Development (IIDI).
2.3 Cover of the Mandela Network
The Mandela network began in March 2014 after a call to centers
Interested and covered 17 centers (9 schools and gardens of common education and
8 special schools operating as "resource centers"). The project was increasing
23
progressively its coverage, from 16 centers in 2015 to 41 in 2016, 43 in 2017,
67 in 2018 and finally 80 in 2019. In that last year the coverage reached almost 13,000
students and their families, of which 798 children with disabilities are
Integrated in common schools and kindergartens, approximately 2000 children and
Girls with disabilities are enrolled in Special Schools of the Network and 10,115
Students without disabilities attend common schools and gardens. In the following table

3. Purpose of the evaluation
On March 1, 2020 he assumed a new government in Uruguay, including new
educational authorities. Throughout 2020 the cooperation program was also developed
of UNICEF for 2021-2025, which was agreed with the Government and prepared with contributions from
civil society and the private sector. In the cooperation program document
states that:
“With the purpose of guaranteeing access, educational continuity, participation and achievements of the most
Vulnerable, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, UNICEF will promote universal design
of learning in all educational centers and that the transition from special education to the
Inclusive UNICEF will improve the monitoring and evaluation of education in order to achieve the inclusion of
Children and adolescents with disabilities, offer assistance in the elaboration of a national education plan
Inclusive and promote the training of teachers in this type of education in grades and postgraduates.
It will also support accessibility in educational centers and the elaboration of school materials
Inclusive. ”(UNICEF 2021).
Additionally, ANEP presented the new budget for 2020-2024, which includes two
Strategic objectives related to inclusive education: “Reduce access difficulties
and improve the timely coverage of children with disabilities at ages of 6 - 11 years
improving your learning and educational continuity "and" facilitate access to education
Basic mean (Emb) of students with disabilities ”(“ Basic secondary education ”is
It refers to the first three years of secondary education, that is, from 7th to 9th grade).
It also establishes inclusive education as one of the ten transverse policies of
ANEP.
In this context, the realization of an evaluation of the Garden and Schools Network Project
Inclusive mandela will allow you to have key supplies for the elaboration of a policy
national by educational authorities and with the technical assistance of UNICEF, which
establish the way for inclusive education for children and adolescents during
This period of government.

4. Evaluation objectives
This evaluation was aimed at accounting for the design, implementation and
Results obtained by the Network of Schools and Inclusive Gardens Mandela
carried out by the CEIP and UNICEF. Tried to relieve the valuations they made
The fundamental participants of the process: directors, facilitators, teachers and families.
From the perspective of these actors and quantitative information of the educational centers,
intended to analyze compliance with the objectives set by the program, as well as the
result generated in the educational practices of teachers and in the inclusion of children
and girls with disabilities.
4.1 GENERAL OBJECTIVE
The general objective is to document, describe and analyze the design, the process of
Implementation and the results obtained by the School and Gardens Network Project
Inclusive mandela.
4.2 Specific objectives
a) Systematize project information to contribute to provide clarity
Conceptual to the design of the program, the theory of change, in order to reflect
About the tasks you intend to achieve, the activities proposed
To do this and adapt with national and international frameworks regarding
Inclusive education.
b) Describe the scope, coverage, development and expansion of the program in the

5. Evaluation scope
Next, the main axes of the evaluation developed are described. In annexes
This information is expanded and deepened (Annex 10_Empliation of information
developed in the report). A formative evaluation20 focused on the
Design and program implementation. This evaluation was made up of three
Components that are aligned in three criteria and guiding questions. The
components were the following:
● Design evaluation
● Implementation evaluation
● Evaluation of results
The following table summarizes the objectives, criteria and questions that guided the evaluation.

20 According to the definition of Ballart (1992) in Iválua (2009a): the formative evaluation responds to the
purpose of obtaining information on the progress of a program, progressively during its
development, with the purpose of making it known to those responsible so that they can
introduce modifications that are estimated appropriate.

6. METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
The methodological design developed was combined, qualitative and quantitative, and
structured based on the three components of the evaluation: 1) design, 2) implementation and
3) Results. Next, the main characteristics of the methodology are presented
employee. In annexes this information is extended and deepened (Annex 10_Empliation of
information developed in the report).
For the qualitative dimension, two techniques were used: semi-scrupted interviews and
Program documentation analysis. After the review of the regulations and the
Inclusive Education Internal Education Standards, the evaluation team conducted interviews
Primary to Coordinators and Coordinators of the Network, educational authorities and experts in the
theme. These interviews officiated as an initial diagnosis of demands, impressions, thus
as a fundamental input for the creation of survey instruments (guidelines of
interviews, survey form), and of the territorial units to which to go.
To account for the objectives set, a sample of 6 territorial units was developed
("Nodes of the Network", made up of the pair composed between the common school and school
special/resource center) of the program in the departments of Montevideo, Canelones,
Paysandú, Soriano, Rivera and thirty -three. There the opinions of the main
Actors: Directors and directors, teachers, teachers and support teachers and
itinerant support21, inspectors and inspectors, as well as to the families of students
with disabilities. These interviews sought to relieve how the network was implemented, the
face -to -territory instances, the construction of inclusion projects, practices
of classroom between teachers, support teachers and itinerant, the strengths and weaknesses that these
Actors found in the implementation of the program, among others.

The quantitative dimension was carried out based on administrative data review
generated by the program, analysis of the existing secondary information and the generation of
Primary information. For the latter, a survey record was prepared that sought
nationally dimensioning the number of children with disabilities who attended the
network schools during 2019, as well as obtaining a first diagnosis in what
Regarding the information registration process.
Limitations
Since its inception, the evaluation explained some limitations, which were expected to reduce
depending on the different mitigation alternatives.
Deficiencies of information records in the schools of the network: the non -existence of
systematic and standardized records of children with disabilities in the centers
educational, as well as the availability and access to these data, becomes one of the
possible obstacles of evaluation. The viability of one of the objectives of
the evaluation of results, specifically that referred to the estimation of children with
disability that attend the schools of the Network. As a mitigation strategy, it is that
proposed the realization of the children's survey tab included in the schools of
The network. Through this, it was expected to have a first record of boys and girls with
disability that attend the schools of the network, as well as obtain supplies that offer
recommendations that contribute to the improvement of the registration and monitoring system of the
program. These limitations initially foreseen were found once the
assessment. In section 8 ("findings") he deepens about it.
Actors to interview: another of the limitations of the evaluation was based on access to
educational centers and the availability of the actors called to participate in the interviews:
Directors, teachers, families. Since it is voluntary, participation was
subject to the goodwill of the interviewees to participate. To do this, the team of
evaluation actively worked with all the actors in the network to coordinate the arrival at the
schools and make the call in an articulated manner and according to the actors
Territorial with greater closeness and link in each of the selected centers. In addition,
Through the confidentiality framework of information and informed consent, it was expected
Also provide guarantees to the actors to interview. In this way, doubts were clear,
questions, clearly and precisely communicating the objectives of the interviews, thus
as the analysis of the information relieved. Interviews passed without any
inconvenient. For this reason, the planned limitations did not happen.

6.4 Methodological design and evaluation matrix
Next, the three components of the Evaluation of the School and Gardens Network are summarized: 1) Design, 2)
Implementation and 3) Results. For each of them, the guiding criteria that guided the evaluation are detailed, the

7. Evaluation standards and ethical considerations
Each of the three components that structured the evaluation proposal are found
framed with the reserve and confidentiality obligations of the information, according to what
establish the Law on Access to Public Information (No. 18,381), the Law on the Protection of
Personal data and habeas data action (No. 18,331) and its regulatory decrees 484/009
and 232/010.
Compliance with these laws forces the institute to ensure confidentiality and protection of
the personal data that it collects - by means of its desidentification - and to use them for their
Studies and evaluations always protecting the anonymous nature of the information.
The evaluation is aligned with the regulations and evaluation standards of the group of
United Nations Evaluation (http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1914) E
incorporates human rights approaches and gender equality at all stages of
evaluation (from the composition of the equipment for evaluation design, the construction of
Data collection instruments, dissemination of results, etc.). In this sense, the
Evaluation team consulted and applied the standards and standards of the evaluation group of
United Nations on “Integration of Human Rights and Gender Equality in the
EVALUATIONS ”(http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1616).
Additionally, the evaluation respects and applies ethical norms and codes for evaluations
of the United Nations System (available in English):
---- UNEG ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR AN EVALUATIONS:
(http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/102)
---- code of behavior for evaluations in the a system:
(http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/100)
The evaluation team in its technical and methodological orientations was guided by respect for the
dignity and diversity of people who are interviewed, respecting their differences in
Culture, customs, practices and religious beliefs, gender roles, disability, age and
ethnicity, and foresees the potential implications of these. The confidentiality of the
information and data of those involved respecting the right to provide information in a form
confidential. At this point the informed consent was fundamental at the time of
Collect the information. The evaluation understood necessary to minimize the risks associated with
have negative effects and maximize the benefits of the main actors providing
unnecessary damages or damage that can be derived from the findings of an evaluation
negative or critical without compromising the integrity of the evaluation.
36
Likewise, the evaluation team has been governed under UNICEF's ethical standards in
Research, evaluations, collection and data analysis22
All evidence generation activities (including evaluations) that imply
Human subjects present their research protocol to an external ethical review committee.
This ethical review committee reviewed the methodological proposal of the evaluation and evaluated the
Information collection methods and tools, as well as the proposal for analysis of
data. This was how it happened with this evaluation.
Dissemination of the results:
INEED understands relevant, always in agreement with the school and garden network team
Mandela, disseminate the results to contribute to the improvement of the objectives pursued
by the network, in the terms and conditions established by the network itself.

It is carried out based on the relevance, alignment and coherence of components and activities
of the program regarding the basic assumptions that define the public problem. To the same
time, the project alignment criteria, in its design and implementation, are incorporated,
with international standards on inclusive education of children with
disability. It also seeks to establish to what extent the program has been implemented
In schools according to their design (effectiveness), to finally analyze to what extent
The intervention achieved its objectives, as well as the changes it produced (efficiency).
8.1 relevance and coherence
Summary: While the theory of program change, the set of
proposed components and activities are consistent with the assumptions that define the
public problem, as well as with the hypothesis of expected changes and the results in the
short term. To obtain results in the medium and long term they will need to develop
other changes that are not contemplated so far or include components that have not
been implemented as monitoring and evaluation. The activities and components of the
program are relevant to the needs of the target population and are based on
Diagnostics
8.1.1 How is the public problem to be defined?
In this line, it can be established that the problem that the network intends to modify (see Figure 2)
It is defined as the existence of barriers in the environment for the educational inclusion of children and
Girls with disabilities. In line with the processes of change in integration paradigm to
Educational inclusion, actors who design policy understand that problems to
inclusion are in the environment23 and not in the student's difficulties. The definition of
problem does not incorporate a gender perspective so there are differences between girls and
Children with disabilities are not being considered.
23 Environment is understood as set of activities, curricula, spaces, environments that are with which and
in which and in which people interact and make learning more or less accessible
knowledge.

Intervention of the Network of Inclusive Schools and Gardens Mandela

8.1.2 What are the hypotheses that relate the public problem with the
program?
As can be seen in the previous figure, the barriers to inclusion translate into the following
Sub problems, which in turn present hypothesis regarding their possible causes:
1. Yes, the teaching career does not incorporate specific subjects that address the
development of inclusive education practices within classrooms, and teaching and
learning are designed for the average group and not for diversity, then
Common school teachers will not have adequate training to develop
Teaching and learning strategies for children with disabilities.
2. Yes, special schools are the only ones in which children with disabilities
They have the possibility to learn, while common schools are in charge
of literacy of the rest of the students, then the special schools and the
common schools will have little work together and will be unlikely to develop
collaborative learning regarding educational practices.
3. If the educational inclusion processes and the existing regulations in this regard are recent; and
also if mothers and fathers of children with disabilities feel fear of
that their daughters and sons attend a common school, compared to a school
specially with personalized attention, where you will be emotionally contained and where
Bullying situations are found, then the families of girls and boys with
39
disability will be little empowered regarding the possibilities of educational offer to
Those who have access, as well as information for decision making.
4. If the professional training of teachers does not incorporate educational inclusion
As mandatory matter of the curriculum, it is very likely that teachers do not develop
educational inclusion practices, no educational inclusion projects from which
Generate learning with students with disabilities.
5. If there are no spaces and times for the exchange between common schools and schools
Specials regarding good inclusion practices, schools will be unlikely
Develop good educational inclusion practices.
6. If the inclusion processes are recent and the families of students without disabilities do not
They have information and knowledge on the subject and have fears and social prejudices,
Then schools and community will have a low awareness regarding the
disability and the ways of addressing it.
7. If there is difficulty when identifying and registering the number of boys and girls with
disability attending schools, justified in which this decision could generate
Discrimination in these children, then little information about children is generated
and girls with disabilities included in common schools, making it difficult to take
decisions regarding the necessary resources for your best attention.
Some studies have identified differences between girls and boys with disabilities (Meresman
2013). However, the program design does not include shares with a gender approach.
8.1.3 What are the hypotheses that maintain that the program will achieve its
goals?
Following the logic of the theory of change, each of the components should
Propose an activity, resource or intervention that responded to subproblems
identified In some cases, it may happen that there are no components that
respond to the problems identified or even that the actions carried out with
after design are not explicit in components. Next, the
Hypothesis for the social pedagogical and environmental components.
1. If the teachers and teachers of common schools and support teachers are formed in
Inclusive education will then have more tools to develop strategies
of inclusive teaching.
2. If the teachers and teachers of common schools and support teachers are prepared
To develop these inclusive education strategies then they will be more willing
to have students with disabilities in their classrooms.
3. If the teachers and teachers of common schools and support teachers are trained in
inclusive education will then modify their classroom practices towards practices of
inclusive education and will develop inclusive educational projects, academics and
institutional
40
4. If the teachers and teachers modify their practices then the boys and girls with
disability can learn in the same way as children without disabilities in
Common schools.
5. If teachers and teachers of special schools are formed in inclusive education
They will be able to modify their perspective regarding the role of the special school as the center of
resources more than as educational centers for children with disabilities.
6. If special schools change their role towards resource centers can then
Support common schools in the education of boys and girls with disabilities.
7. If teachers and teachers of special schools and common schools are formed in
Inclusive education, both will be able to develop a greater link and dialogue that allows them
Develop the necessary support for the education of children with disabilities
In common schools.
Figure 3. Hypothesis regarding the pedagogical component
Source: Own elaboration
With the information obtained at the time of closing this report, it can be noted that
The course would seem more oriented to common education teachers, teachers
support, itinerant support teachers and directors and directors; Not so to teachers and
Special Education Classroom Teachers. This makes sense in the logic of inclusion
Educational in common schools. However, we must consider that the program accompanies
The change of paradigm towards educational inclusion and for the same
special schools would be interested in participating in a course they had no access
41
In your professional training. Moreover, hypotheses 5, 6 and 7 above are based on
in the possibility that training also occurs in special education teachers.
In this line and regarding the possibility that the change hypotheses are fulfilled based on
Of the assumptions, activities and resources proposed, there are some short risks,
medium and long term.
Next, the short -term risks of the pedagogical component are detailed:
1. Special Education teachers and teachers fail to access the courses of
Inclusive education training, which cannot be developed
Inclusive in its schools, with the community and with other schools.
2. The links between special schools and common schools are weak because
Teaching rooms only develop in common schools.
3. Special schools do not know the implications of change to resource center by
which does not generate changes in their practices.
4. Special schools also work as a resource center, but without resources
additional for this, which generates that the link with common schools is weak.
5. The links between resource centers and common schools are mediated by closeness
geographical which generates that resource centers attend differentiated to
common schools according to the proximity to these.
6. Special education teachers see inclusive education as a risk
to his profession and not as a favorable change towards inclusion
7. The teacher's guild opposes the common schools to register children with
disability claiming that the necessary conditions are not to be able to meet these
boys and girls
Medium-long risks Term:
8. The training policy of teachers in inclusive education is parallel to the
Magisterium formation, instead of incorporating it as one more subject of the program of
Magisterium In this way, inclusion will always depend on the availability of
teachers and teachers already trained.
9. The rotation of teachers implicit in the selection of teaching positions can
generate that a teacher trained in a mandela school changes their workplace to
following year. While this teacher could develop educational inclusion practices in the
New school, the network of the network loses an already trained teacher.
The social environmental component aims to favor the processes of
Empowerment and collaboration between the key actors for educational inclusion: teachers,
Students, families, school staff and community. To achieve this purpose
They develop awareness workshops with students and their families.
42
From these workshops, the following change hypotheses can be generated regarding
Social Environmental Component:
1. If workshops are developed with all children, children without disabilities are
will sensitize with the theme and will be able to empathize with their classmates and
Companions with disabilities.
2. If workshops are developed with all boys and girls, boys and girls with disabilities
They will feel more accompanied by their companions, less alone and can
Participate socially in school, on equal terms with others.
3. If children without disabilities empathize with their classmates and children
With disabilities socially participate in the school, then the boys and girls with
Disability will be socially included in school.
4. If workshops are developed with families of children with and without disabilities, families
of children without disabilities will be more open than their sons and daughters
Share the classroom with children with disabilities.
5. If workshops are developed with families of children with disabilities and without
Disability, families of children with disabilities will have more information
regarding the rights of their sons and daughters and more possibilities of demanding those rights
as parents of students.
6. If the families of students with disabilities have information and know the
rights of their sons and daughters in relation to education, then they may consider,
and then demand that their sons and daughters attend common schools in the same way
than their pairs without disabilities.
43
Figure 4. Hypothesis regarding the social environmental component
Source: Own elaboration
In the same sense that it was carried out for pedagogical component, then they are presented
short, medium and long term risks for social environmental component.
Risks of the Social Environmental Component:
1. All change hypotheses of this component are based on the development of
Workshops in charge of specialist technicians in the subject of disability. Therefore, the
achievement of hypotheses depends on technicians and techniques being available to
This task, as well as that there are enough technicians to serve all schools
that join the network. The workshops depend on a group of volunteers
that can generate that these are not systematic or that technicians are not the
enough to serve all schools.
2. The realization of the workshops also depends on the fact that the families attend the workshop, a factor
that you have to take into account when making the call, since the workshops
Only families of children with disabilities could be attending only.
3. The workshops are developed only in common schools, so it would be interesting
ask if these workshops would not also be necessary in special schools or
Resource centers in such a way to problematize the idea of educational inclusion
Also in these schools.
44
As mentioned above, both the monitoring and evaluation component and the
Accessibility were not designed or implemented. In particular, network schools
They executed the accessibility component through the Schools24 projects
Learn, which required that the school detect the need autonomously and that
Create a project.
The following figure presents and summarizes a scheme of the theory of change in the case of the
Mandela Schools and Gardens Network.

8.1.4 Does the program incorporate actions or components that work in its design
With gender approach?
As can be seen in the previous figure and the analysis that has been developing
Until the moment of the network, the gender approach is not present in the theory of
Change of the program. No explicit references or existing documents were identified
nor in the speeches of the actors relieved. From the definition of the problem to be addressed and
of the sub-problems and assumptions behind, the program does not contemplate or explain in
24 PODES: EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. In the framework of the learning program, it is invited to
Each school to elaborate a curricular educational project, focused on the improvement of everyone's learning
Children in the understanding that it is a responsibility of the “guarantee access, permanence and
Sustainment of school and quality trajectories… ”With the aim of guaranteeing equal opportunities
In the right to education.
45
its design specific components regarding the incorporation of the gender perspective.
Nor could it be evidenced that this perspective is transversalized in the
pedagogical or social environmental components.
8.1.5 What were the initial criteria for the selection of schools?
In the beginning, the network defined to start implementing its design in eight specific schools
where special education had an accumulated work in inclusive education. The criteria
taken into account were the following: The experience in inclusive education developed in
These schools, the existence of territorial leaderships and confidence ties
established with inspectors, inspectors, directors, directors, teachers and teachers, the
territorial closeness between common schools and special schools / resource centers, thus
as the availability of human resources. From these criteria, it was made available
Of each of the identified schools, voluntary participation in the program.
46
8.2 Alignment
Summary: Based on the review of international and national literature, as well as
existing regulations and the account of the actors consulted, it can be noted that the
Conceptualization, articulation and theoretical development of the network is homogeneous, articulated and
adapts to international regulations.
8.2.1 To what extent does the program incorporate the standards in its design
Internationals on inclusive education of children with disabilities?
Educational Policy and Inclusion: International Panorama
The World Health Organization (WHO) in its World Disability Report
(2011), warns that within the most significant obstacles for the improvement of the quality of
life of people with disabilities is the insufficient scope of the programs,
policies and norms that promote and protect educational inclusion.
Children with disabilities are less likely than their counterparts without
Enter the school, stay in it and overcome successive courses. The school failure
It is observed in all age groups and both in high and low -income countries,
but with a more accused pattern in the poorest countries. The difference between the percentage
of boys and girls with disabilities and the percentage of non -disabled children who
They attend primary school from 10% in India to 60% in Indonesia (...)
Even in countries with high percentages of registration in primary school, such as
Eastern Europe, many boys and girls with disabilities do not attend school (WHO, 2011).
According to UNICEF (2014), disability is often a more educational exclusion factor
significant that gender or geographical location, and live in poverty and have a father or
A mother with disabilities also increases the probability that a boy or a girl is
Out of school. UNICEF defines inclusive education as “the process that allows us to have
duly account the diversity of needs of all children, youth and adults to
through greater participation in learning, cultural and community activities,
as well as reducing the exclusion of the teaching sphere and within it. It entails changes and
Content modifications, approaches structures and strategies based on a common vision
that covers all school -age children and the conviction that corresponds to the system
Ordinary Educational Educate all boys and girls ”(UNESCO 2005). The position of
UNICEF is in favor of inclusive education in regular classrooms since inclusive education
produces better learning results for all, all boys and girls in environments
Inclusive education can benefit socially and inclusive education is
economically profitable. The work developed by UNICEF in the field of disability
It is based on an inclusive rights and development approach. In this sense, he strives to
achieve the participation of people with disabilities as rights holders,
including children, adolescents and women under the motto "Nothing of us without us."
47
Internationally, the countries of the European Union have marked a clear tendency to
Inclusion of boys and girls with disabilities within the regular framework of the educational system,
aware of the demand for human and material resources that this implies (Dettori, 2011).
According to Dettori (2011) the educational systems of Italy and Spain share, among others
characteristics, have been advanced in its time. In 1977 Italy decides that all
Disabilities students must attend common schools, accompanied by the figure of
A support teacher. For its part, in 1985 Spain establishes that special education is
part of the common education system; It places, in turn, to the special educational center as a center
reference within the framework of a multiprofesional team that evaluates psychosocial and
doctors
“Thus, the dynamics in the conception of students with special educational needs
which is very similar in both states, where there is a change from the medical approach and
Clinic focused on the deficit presented by the student, towards a pedagogical and interactive approach
referred to the influence of the environment, considered this, as well as a goal of social integration,
how much as an element that conditions of autonomous and social development itself ”(Dettori, 2011)
In both systems the intention of assessing the functional profile of children not only
seeks to identify those limitations that require adjustments to compensate for those difficulties
but also to describe the potential that exist and how to develop them. In addition to
This specific information, use two principles to make decisions based on
schooling of students with disabilities: “Ensure that services and support are
resolved in the least restrictive environment possible ”and“ that schooling is carried out in the
Ordinary center of your surroundings ”(Dettori, 2011).
"The two countries are part of the category called" model to a band ", which is
characterized by a majority commitment to schooling in the ordinary regime. In fact,
We can say that they are inclusive systems, because they meet the condition of schooling in
Specific centers a less than 1% of students with educational needs
specials, while in the European Union it is 2,187% of the total students. ” (Dettori, 2011)
Of the theoretical advances that have impacted the concrete actions that both systems
educational implement, it is with respect to the concept of diversity which is no longer associated
to students with Nee but to the whole group.
From criticism of these systems are: to improve the dialogue between families and
schools, generate interdisciplinary work instead of many disciplines coordinating,
Coordination between the educational and socio -health system (Detori, 2011).
Following the steps of Spain and Italy, Portugal has a low percentage of students
In special school, only 2%, this being one of the objectives of the education system
Portuguese. They have an individualized educational plan through which the
Specific support. (Martínez-Figueira, Páramo-oglesias, by Matos Claudino Necho, 2015).
"The Declaration of Lisbon (2007)" Young Voices: Meeting on Diversity and Education "(...)
The young people expressed their opinions about inclusive education and pointed out that there were many
Benefits in inclusion, «we acquire more social skills, we live greater experiences,
48
We learn to handle ourselves in real life and we can interact with all friends with or without
disability, "and made it clear that inclusive education" is mutually beneficial to
us and others. " (Ferreira, Prado, and Cadavieco, 2015)
With the attempt to identify advantages and risks of the different systems implemented
By countries, three categories that group the different realities were generated.
1. countries whose system aims to include the population with
Disability in common education
2. countries that offer services between the two systems, common and special
3. countries that have segregated education spaces, those that have
Nee attend special devices and do not share the common curriculum
(Dettori, 2011).
In this document, in line with the current disability approach, the factors
hierarchical to guarantee the right to education are related to the environment of the
boy or girl and not only with their health condition. While the latter is fundamental, no
Only what is linked to physical but emotional aspects (motivation to attend, desire for
Participate), actors and actresses who charge relevance for these strategies to function
They are those who design educational policy, institutional references (management, inspection) and
As an executing arm, teachers and referents in the classroom. In this way, adding to the
contextual factors, the reference family, other families, colleagues and
classmates and the closest community are fundamental variables for success
of this policy. (Campa Alvarez, Contreras Cazarez, 2018).
In order to think about aspects that do not allow to guarantee the right to education to
people with limitations that hinder the incorporation of knowledge and skills,
Jiménez Rodríguez and Ortega Valencia (2018) describe three dimensions of accessibility,
that, by step, in turn, configure the levels of awareness and appropriation of a
Community with the theme of disability. Thus, the authors identify 1- inclusion
Physics, share places and spaces; 2- Functional inclusion: in addition to sharing places and
spaces are shared social activities; 3- Societal integration: it's about sharing and
interact in all the activities of both cultural-recreational and
learning.
Barriers that may arise within the framework of an educational inclusion process may be
linked to the attitudinal, the building, the communicational and the technological; And they can impact
access, permanence or discharge. For example, part of the system operation
educational that arise as well -defined barriers are bureaucratic processes
institutional (presentation of technical reports), the criteria of approval and reprobation (and
the way to implement them) and the lack of resources and professionals to carry out the
Strategy (Lelia Schewe, 2017).
Florian's position (2014) reflects, widely, the average distance in which different
countries are going through inclusive education. The abandonment of education
49
Classical special towards more just devices that consider the specific - not "the special" -
as a support resource; This, in the author's words, is a cultural change.
Ainscow (2012) makes six suggestions to promote inclusive educational systems and their
Continuous improvement: a) Define what includes inclusive education, b) Train in a way
The available human resources continue in order to overcome barriers to participation and
Learning, c) Dispose of evidence to work as an effective engine to encourage
Teachers to develop more inclusive practices, d) Plan the additional pedagogical support
at the service of students, the proper training of those who are
committed to this work, e) highlight the possibility that inclusive schools have
various forms, but what they all have in common is the existence of a culture
organizational that contemplates the diversity of students in a positive way, f) foster paper
main of the school leaders who are based on working together with their colleagues to
Promote inclusive culture in its schools.
Regulatory Framework: International Panorama
In 1989, the children's rights convention establishes social rights,
Political, economic, cultural, civil and protection of boys and girls. This
Convention emphasizes the right to education with equal opportunities for all
boys and girls. Moreover, article 2 forces governments to ensure compliance with
rights of children without discrimination and specifically incorporates the reference to the
Discrimination for disability reasons. Article 23 indicates the right of children and
Girls with disabilities to access education to promote their social integration (CDN
1989)
In 1994, with the Salamanca statement of principles, politics and practice for the NEE,
advances in this regard, establishing that each child has characteristics, capacities and
learning needs that are their own and educational systems must be designed
taking into account these differences, thus helping to build a society that
Achieve an education for all (D. Salamanca, 1994).
In 2006, with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
consolidates the notion of inclusive education, establishing in article 24:
“States parties recognize the right of people with disabilities to education. With
You look at this right without discrimination and on the basis of the equality of
Opportunities, the States Parties will ensure an inclusive education system to all
levels, as well as teaching throughout life "
In normative terms, countries have good and wide legislative frameworks,
Action protocols and state institutions that frame education policies
Inclusive, the problem is in the effective execution of these policies and programs (see in annex
10_Empliation of information developed in the report, the system of systematization of the
regulatory frameworks of Latin America countries, according to the adopted disability model).
50
To end this section, it is considered important to highlight that, as well as Uruguay has
ratified the CDPD (UN, 2006) and its definitions around the education of people with
Disability, takes as an international reference what is raised by WHO:
“Incorporating children with disabilities in the education system requires changes in their own
system and schools. The success of inclusive educational systems depends largely
of the country's commitment to adopt appropriate legislation, provide guidance
clear regulations, prepare a national action plan, establish infrastructure and create capacity
execution and ensure long -term financing. Get children with disabilities
They can have the same educational level as their non -disabled counterparts often requires
An increase in financing. Creating an inclusive learning environment will help all
Children to learn and perform their potential. Educational systems have to adopt
more focused approaches, with changes in curricula, methods and
Teaching materials and evaluation and exam systems. " (WHO, 2001)
Regulatory Framework: National Panorama
Uruguay did not remain alien to this process, and in recent decades he has advanced towards the
concretion of a regulatory framework that promotes inclusion in the educational field. In such
sense, with the approval of the General Education Law of 2008 (Law No. 18,437), the State
Uruguayo recognizes education as the right of all the people who live in the
national territory, ensuring compliance with this right for minority groups
or in conditions of vulnerability. With the purpose of guaranteeing equality in the exercise of
Right to education, the law establishes that formal education will contemplate
contextual or personal particularities, through different educational modalities. In
This sense, article 8 postulates that:
“The State will ensure the rights of those minority groups or especially
vulnerability, in order to ensure equal opportunities in the full exercise of law
to education and its effective social inclusion. For effective fulfillment of the right to
education, educational proposals will respect different abilities and characteristics
individual of students, in order to achieve full development of their potentialities. ”
(Art. 8 Law No. 18,437, 2008)
Likewise, in 2010 the country takes another step towards establishing a system of
integral protection of people with disabilities by approval of the law of
Integral protection of people with disabilities, which incorporates the established principles
in the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities of 2008. in their
Article 39 The law establishes that:
“The Ministry of Education and Culture in coordination with the National Education Administration
Public must facilitate and supply the person with disabilities, permanently and without
age limits, in educational, physical, recreational, cultural and social matters, the elements or media
scientific, technical or pedagogical necessary to develop their faculties to the fullest
intellectual, artistic, sports and social. ”
Moreover, it is established that inclusion in common classrooms is based on the
diversity as an educational factor, redoubled efforts to ensure the adaptation of
curricular contents, the evaluation mechanisms and the infrastructure of the centers
educational:
51
“The equalization of opportunities for people with disabilities, from initial education
From now on, it determines that its integration into the common classrooms is organized on the basis of the
recognition of diversity as an educational factor, so that it points to the objective of a
Education for all, enabling and deepening the process of full inclusion in the
community. Access to education will be guaranteed at all levels of the education system
national with the necessary support. To guarantee this inclusion, flexibility will be ensured
curriculum, of the evaluation mechanisms and physical and communicational accessibility ”(Article 40,
Law 18,651).
It is worth highlighting the distinction between the terms integration and inclusion used in the law of
Integral protection of people with disabilities. Integration refers to the efforts that
does a person to adapt to a certain structure, while inclusion refers to
The structure, in this case the educational field, which must be defined according to the
particularities of the student in such a way that it can be receptive to the diversity of the
people. In this sense, in the inclusion prevails the transformation of the structure, of the environment,
of society; While in integration it is the person who must make the movements
To find your place. In the idea of inclusion, a perspective of transformation of the
Environment (Míguez, 2016: 3).
More recently, in 2017, an action protocol for the inclusion of
people with disabilities in educational centers, with reach to all centers
educational that make up the National Education System (public and private), the centers of
private childhood education and non -formal education centers enabled by management
National Education of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
The protocol seeks to guide institutions in relation to the inclusion of people with
disability, establishing academic support strategies, action indicators and
good pedagogical practices, building accessibility and materials and actions of
Awareness, information and training. The protocol is defined from the perspective of the
Inclusive education, where actions are aimed at providing support
necessary within the classroom, attending to the diversity of people's needs.
Although legislation on special educational needs focuses
fundamentally in people with disabilities, in recent years it has begun to
discuss the importance of regulations that consider the situation of children with
High skills. Thus, following the principles of an inclusive education for all,
In 2018, a bill that establishes lines of action began to be discussed for
that boys and girls with high skills or giftedness receive adequate education and
relevant.
Considering the foregoing below, a picture is presented with the
international standards relieved and distinction regarding the incorporation of these
standards by the program evaluated.

8.2.2 What is the educational inclusion paradigm you pursue? How do they define
inclusive education practices?
As mentioned above there are three models to conceive disability: 1)
Charitable: that conceives of disability as a punishment or a tragedy and considers the
Individual a needy being; the 2) Integrative doctor or approach: which considers the
disability as a disease that needs to be treated and cured with the help of
Health professionals and; 3) social or inclusion approach: which argues that the
Disability is the result of the interactions between the person who presents a deficiency
Physics, intellectual, sensory or mental and the social environment and culture in which he lives. In
consequence, understand disability as a socio -political construct in which
attitudinal, environmental and institutional barriers that are inherent to society exclude
and systematically discriminate against people with disabilities.
Depending on the definition of disability, certain public policies are developed. In this
meaning, while the medical model is the person who must adapt to the environment, in the
Social Model is the environment that must adapt to the person.
.
53
With regard to program design and conceptualization that articulates all
Network actions, it can be said that the program plays very detailed emphasis on
that inclusion is the common framework that supports all interventions. At this point
There is a generalized agreement between the actors. Anyway, there seems to be a
difficulty from the origin, when implementing said conceptualization, since the
specific operation is led by the special education inspection, without a
Accompaniment of the same magnitude at the institutional level by common education. Is
say that this general and comprehensive concept of all situations that is the paradigm of
Educational inclusion is subject to the special school, and, therefore,
limited to the specific characteristics of these schools.
At this point two levels are distinguished. On the one hand, which refers to the global level,
They find weaknesses in coordination both at the central and regional level that affect the
Program implementation. On the other, at the micro level, the common schools that participate in
The network shows great predisposition and commitment to join the network, since it offers
certain activities that respond to their demands.
While special schools have a good disposition to be part of the program,
They point out, however, a multiplication of functions that is not accompanied by a
Strengthening of resources in the same magnitude.
54
8.3 Effectiveness
Summary: The degree of development of the program is heterogeneous at the level of schools and
components, which is why its implementation has not been fully effective. It is evident that
The program components have been incorporating activities as it has gone
implementing, such as teaching rooms, congresses and the training course that
began in 2016. In the same way, the transformation of special schools to centers
of resources has been gradual and heterogeneous, where territorial closeness, leaderships and
awareness that they have, fundamentally the inspectors and directors of education
Special, they play a fundamental role. Also, workshops with students and families
They present heterogeneity at their frequencies according to the availability of the workshops. To his
time, they do not have a standardization in their implementation, or with a record of
participants and themes. The network uses the existing institutional structure for its
Implementation, which can hinder the achievement of the objectives pursued.
8.3.1 To what extent has the program been implemented according to its design and

Initial Objectives of the Mandela Network
The origin of the Mandela network is due to the joint articulation between public actors and
Private (CEIP, UNICEF, FLACSO, IFS, IDII), as well as the work accumulated by groups
of relatives of boys and girls with disabilities. This inter -institutional articulation has its
impulse in a contest promoted by the Supreme Court of Justice, which worked and promoted
Inclusion as the first point on an agenda of rights in relation to the system
educational. In parallel to this situation and in the last 30 years new positions were generated
teachers, in particular the positions of support teacher and itinerant support teacher
Accompanied by new education paradigms, all made that propitiate an area
Proclive for the creation of the Mandela network in 2014.
In the Primary Council a very prolific work climate was maintained with UNICEF, whose
Representative for Uruguay was extremely interested in activating a line of
work that promoted experiences that will show and carry out different forms of
inclusion. Thus, with the participation of UNICEF, the idea of thinking about the theme of the
inclusion in terms of a project that basically had a reference to Mandela, for its
position in relation to minorities and the right to find a substantive equality between
55
All people. This context was motivating and opened doors to expand and perform
proposals.
We got together with UNICEF and what we had in mind was what the report of
UNICEF the global report gave as good practice the recommendations that and those of UNESCO
of 2006 also that they are good practices, the report the inclusive education document says the
most of the support that are needed are already in schools, they are teachers who support
Other teachers, children support other children and families support other families. We
We base that and with that a design was armed that was precisely the pedagogical for ANEP. The
pedagogical function, (…) teaching and teacher training in the hands of ANEP and the
social component in the hands of IIDI, as much as possible in relation to NGOs of disability of the
territory. (IIDI technician)
In this network formation of the network, the actions are highlighted and recognized previously
developed and that are identified as a history. That is, it is recognized that it does not act
From scratch, but there is an accumulated of actions and interventions that propitiate and
they frame those developed by the Network. The formation of the network is thus framed in a
Trajectory at the country and institutional level, a process that recounts different aspects that travel
Since the creation of new positions, paradigms and practices that provide background. In it
Regarding the new positions, the creation of new roles is indicated: the support teacher
and the itinerant support teacher.
Leaving the dictatorship in 1986 a new function of the teaching position in education was created
special that was the itinerant support teacher. We already had support teachers in the
common schools to work learning difficulties, what was created was the teacher of
Itinerant support to integrate children with disabilities at that time. (…) Above all,
Itinerant support teachers implied that the itinerant teacher had to work, not in an area
of resources to try to normalize and integrate the boy into the common field, but rather the
itinerant support teacher who worked in common school and was created for that, to support
The common school to children with disabilities that were integrated in principle and now included
but work with the teachers of the common schools in the classroom. The work with him was not excluded
Not so far a work is excluded in a resource classroom to address the singularities of that
Chico, but what was done was to change that perspective. So we started having
More children included. (1_ National Institute of Special Education)
In addition to this, the movement of groups and family associations stands out in turn
of boys and girls with disabilities, who, with their work and accumulated in the field, joined
contributing experiences and practices around the social inclusion of students with
disability. The interviewees mention that these groups understood that the
Sole education cannot generate social inclusion if it is not accompanied by others
professionals who make their contributions from their perspectives. For this reason schools
common and special schools began to have a greater exchange between them, thus
as with institutions, civil, polyclinic associations. These exchanges between schools
common, special schools and the community aim to improve the performance of
Boys and girls with disabilities. In the same way, the specific exchange between schools
common and special questions the current school formats and proposes formats from
of universal learning design.
56
Formation of the Mandela Network
The formation of the network accompanied a process of paradigm change in favor of the
educational inclusion of children with disabilities in common schools that are visualized
In normative changes and on the agenda of environmental barriers to inclusion
Educational Among the environmental barriers were identified the infrastructure, the formats of
teaching, lack of teaching professionalization and educational materials, the practices of
Classroom aimed at an average group without incorporating the universal learning design. The
program designers considered that the system itself should maximize and articulate the
existing resources. In that sense, one of the tasks the initial tasks of the network
It was visible the inclusive practices that were scattered in some schools and
Try that common schools integrate support devices from schools
nearby specials.
We did not want to implement, we wanted to show what there is. We wanted to do the procedure backwards.
Show that there are practices that are inclusive, that there are support systems that are scattered
By institutions and are not taken and is not systematized, on that we wanted to make the way. So
There is already a tension, there is a tension in the territory especially in common education. Like the
inclusion is played in common education, the main tension is there ... they have devices, but not
They visualize them there is an art teacher, this does not visualize them as important actors for
that can facilitate from a systematization the inclusion of these students. That is the
Great tension that I visualize because if we do not visualize the tensions we will not be able to advance.
(5_ National Institute of Special Education)
The network is part of the assumption that the noun lies in working on the
conceptions about disability, as well as training and sensitization in the
Paradigm of educational inclusion with teachers, family and community.
We come from the educational integration experience that was the restructuring of education
Special Departure The dictatorship had as its axis the issue of replacing that special school that had
managed to segregate almost 10,000 chiquilines, to a special school that dialogue with schools
common in terms of integration. In that Commission for the review of Special Education and the
Integration Commission that the presidency of the National Inspector of the moment (...) we found that
The greatest difficulty was not within the school, which in reality the difficulty were the others
Parents, who did not want a chiquilín, especially typologically, realized the
Disability, it was a difficult issue ... I would say that work with families and the social environment
It seemed an evidence, because when we wanted to do it in 85 86 87 and every year
following… I would tell you that in 2014, 2015 we had 30 years of hitting us against the
resistance that implies integration, inclusion, then it seems to me that the social component for
My evidence was always important to carry it forward. I think the iidi has how
particularity that their teams are also teams where there are technicians with disabilities,
So well, it is not a matter of generating handle, among the theorists they testify to that and
He is very aligned with Mandela's vision. We have spent many years, let's advance a
Little more in concrete things. (6_ Ceip Central Actor)
Based on this finding that the greatest difficulty was around the
Awareness and training in the educational inclusion paradigm is that the idea is promoted
to work to generate inclusive communities and, above all, promote participation. So
is that it is established to work with families around the issue of awareness of the
disability.
57
For me after this, we put together and write the design. The design was that there were 3
Components. A pedagogical component that was to recognize ANEP, but above all to
special education that obviously had an authority on the subject and what we had to
To realize was how we managed to migrate for another paradigm. A pedagogical component,
a social component that was a bit what we took as Iidi, which was to say good,
Actually beyond what can be done at the pedagogical level, they have to accompany the
families and have to accompany the community, there must be something that at the social level
Change your gaze and change the idea that you have disability you go to the special school. AND
a network component, a coordination component that is now videoconferences,
activities that try that what some schools even at that time already made
it was not to close the doors to the gurises with disabilities were not isolated made, but rather
They were entangling that they communicated that they left with 3 components that was the design.
(4_ IIDI technician)
Focalization in work with children and families is part of this conception, such as
way to generate an inclusive community. To do this, it was proposed to combine pedagogical work,
that due to its mission and roles it occurs in school, with a community perspective that
was anchored at work with families from the construction of citizenship and
rights. So UNICEF and CEIP convened a civil society organization (IIDI),
that he had in his teams with technicians with disabilities and social inclusion. From your
technical look, and together with teachers, IIDI technicians could contribute to
Identify human and material resources in the community and see how to establish a
bridge between those resources and the school and, thus, improve this link between family and
school. In turn promoted the participation of family references that would be strengthened
In this task of summoning families for workshops that promoted social inclusion. Is
In this line that one of the initial concerns of the technicians who formed the network
It was to generate a project that was absorbable by the system and, therefore, could
assemble in the institutional logic of primary.
The CEIP referents raised it in a very clear way and we agreed and it was that
Nor create anything that was not absorbable by the system itself, we do not enter with the idea
to create something immense or very frequent and that when we left there is nothing left (...)
That has to generate the system itself, it does not have to do an NGO and education
Special has many resources for that and enjoyable schools also have them and community
It also has them, that is, we bet that these resources are looking at the
Disability and the work of children and families on these issues also as part of their work.
(4_ IIDI technician)
The Mandela network set out to work to strengthen the link between special schools and
common, as a central axis in the experience of educational inclusion. From the origin of the network
It was intended to generate actions and tend to solve the tension that could exist between said
schools, with the task that interact and that inclusion occurs in schools
common. For this, it was proposed to sensitize and work with common support, through networks
of schools
The organization of the program
As mentioned above, the program's designers intended to combine the
existing resources and policies efforts in the schools of the Network. In other
Words, the program uses the existing institutional structure, to which it incorporates the
58
Functions necessary for conformation. Likewise, they set out to add support that the
System had already implemented as the program Schools A.pr.en.D.E.R., and the program
Enjoyable schools.
At the general level, a coordination table composed of CEIP, UNICEF and the
Inter -American Institute for Disability and Inclusive Development, which was in charge of
boost the different actions for the formation of the network, as well as for the
Implementation of the different activities. In this coordination space he participated by
CEIP a representative of the Council and the National Inspection of Special Education. Also
Other primary actors participated, although occasionally and sporadic (inspection
technique, artistic, etc.). Both UNICEF and IIDI support CEIP in various aspects,
but fundamentally in the environmental-social component (the organization of congresses,
work with families and monitoring of program activities).

The special education inspection has a key role not only at a general level (in design and
development of lines of action) but also at the territorial level for the formation and put in
Network march. Its regional representatives were responsible for taking the program to
schools and coordinate all resources and actions for the fulfillment of the objectives. Is
So the interviewees consider that in many cases the leadership they have in the
different territories makes implementation success (together with the teams of
address and teachers).
In places where there have been good inspections and good leaderships, it has been charging as
More strength. (4_ IIDI technician).
Inspectors and directors are the key figures in the processes. (2_ IIDI technician).
While because of their experience they seem to be the ones who possess natural leadership in the subject,
Some interviewed and interviewed consider that commitment and
work of special education inspectors, if this is not accompanied by their peers of
common education
There is a level of work that is essential that it is with the inspectors (...). That is the work more
arduous and the work that must be done in the first moment because there must be a
59
departmental decision (…). The agreement here relieved the figure of the departmental inspector as
fundamental in this process and then that interwoven that has to occur with the inspectors (...)
Because this is a cause that not only involves some people, but all and that in
Reality is a collective issue and that it is of no use to join but does the rest.
(20_ National EDUCATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION)
For this reason, from coordination it has sought to articulate work with all
CEIP inspections, so that it becomes a joint project and permeates
All areas of primary education.
We work in the Inspectors and I would say in triad, because if the school has an initial
We work with the initial inspector, the Common Inspector and the special inspector.
We have to together, from supervision, work with our directors and make those
mechanisms are more fluid. (…) I think what underlies that. (5_ National inspecting

The activities carried out within the framework of the network
The participation of students, as well as families, is one of the mechanisms
that, from the institutions that develop the network, it is observed as the main axis in the
61
Promotion of inclusive education communities. The interviewees and interviewees
They argue that it has been a central tool in the implementation of the network, both in the
Teacher work, as in work with families, boys and girls, so
Activities have been thought, developed and implemented considering this aspect.
The network has three devices, one is the participation, which for us seems to us
fundamental, another, in that participation is work with families, work with teachers,
participation of children, others are pedagogical-didactic-clarricular devices that those do
They are energized by us that this is the main responsibility. How do we access the
Curriculum for each student, we use the necessary digital or material resources. (…) can
generate inclusive communities, inclusive practices within institutions and above all,
generate participation, which at the moment that we are in crisis of participation at the level
General, we consider that participation is essential for a student to be included. Yeah
It does not show its existence as a learner within the classroom, within an institution, it is inside
But it is not included. (5_ National Institute of Special Education)
(…) One of the activities we can do ... There is a job among teachers with families
And that forever seeks to improve coexistence, really inclusion. There are still some
issues in the inkwell, but it seems to me that little by little and with actors who want to approach or that
We invite you, you can go doing activities. (51_Maestra de Aula Common School)
Being part of the network has involved the development of a set of activities of various kinds:
videoconferences, coordination tables, teaching rooms, children's assemblies and
families, workshops dictated by IIDI, courses and update workshops and congresses. Although the
objectives of these activities are diverse, some common points can be observed that
They have to do with the sensitization and approach of the theme and organization and
implementation of inclusion activities, as well as the promotion of the participation of
the different actors that are part of the network. In this sense, each of these
Activities is linked to two of the program components: Pedagogical and Social Environmental.
It has been sought that the actors feel part of a collective process, from which it can
generate a sense of community in which their opinions and looks are represented.
In this line, the activities involved in the program have different characteristics, but
They have as common axis the participation of the different actors.
(…) Transform into actors to empower and be able to make decisions, but decisions not
Unilateral, shared decisions because it is more feasible not to be wrong, it is more feasible
that can take several variables and handle the situation, not the case, the situation is previously
He handled the case (20_ National Institute of Special Education)
At this point it is relevant to emphasize that those who participate mostly are women. Yes
Look at both schools and in references are women: teachers
of classroom, support teachers, itinerant support teachers, directors, inspectors, mothers,
aunts, grandmothers. The majority of people interviewed are women and this is related to
The role that these people play in the link between school-family-community. This role is
based fundamentally on the care of girls and boys with disabilities, and it is a role
which in families is fundamentally assumed by women. The previous appointment refers to
empowerment of families to be able to make decisions with schools regarding what
It is the best for your sons and daughters. In this sense, women referents of children
with disabilities are those who either do not have the information to decide on
How to accompany the educational process of their son and daughter, or present fears regarding
62
Learning possibilities of children in common schools. However, the
Gender perspective does not seem to be incorporated in participation activities.
Videoconferences
Videoconferences develop with a monthly frequency, teachers participate and
Masters members of the Network. It is a space for coordination of guidelines of
work, where teachers share experiences, work topics with different specialists,
and coordinate specific activities such as the Congress of Children. According to
collected in the interviews, it is an instance led and planned by CEIP, UNICEF and
IIDI, in which the different actors of the program participate.
We have videoconferences. We meet through videoconferences and there are shared
experiences. It is like the kitchen of the network and we can see colleagues from other departments and
Other experiences. (29_ Common School Director)
Although they are mainly oriented to exchange with teaching teams, in some
instances participate boys and girls, as well as their families, depending on the subject that is
intends to address.
And it depends on the theme, truth. Sometimes, only for teachers, sometimes for families and
times for children, family and teachers. (49_ Common School Director)
Teachers
They consist of a space of teachers of the common school where different are analyzed
aspects of daily practice, specifically in terms of issues
pedagogical-didactic. It seeks to enhance the discussion and analysis spaces of the
teaching groups, encouraging reflection on educational practices and exchange
about concrete experiences of inclusion. The teachers and teams participate in them
Management of common schools and directors and directors of special schools,
Sometimes accompanied by itinerant or support teachers.
(…) We take advantage of them a lot, in the sense of sharing biography or work strategies,
Monitoring children. Because we are not talking about the child included, with a diagnosis. We are
Speaking of the child who has difficulties for many things, which are sometimes visible from what
intellectual, but the problems come on the other hand. They can have spelling problems, they can
have diction problems. We are looking for different tools, different strategies to
Work, we do that in the rooms. And generally, we have the contribution either by the inspector
of special education, be it of the support teachers and itinerant support, of the Resource Center,
of the director. We watch some video of some experience, on the other hand, or share
planning And in turn, we organize, as every year, we have now, we are already at 27
November, we have the Mandela closure, which we do with the whole community. (29_Director

IIDI workshops
63
These are awareness workshops with students, students and families. They are developed
By young people from the Meta Group, a network of Latin American youth composed of boys and girls
With and without disabilities that work with different issues for people's rights
with disabilities. The workshops aim to sensitize in the theme of inclusion,
generating empathy among families, students and students, towards people with
disability.
(…) Interact from an equal place you only achieve it if there is an empowerment work
Previous because if not, the person with disabilities costs him a lot to get out of the place I am going to be
Help say at best (4_ IIDI technician)
In principle the social component has had two types of activities: some with children, were workshops
With children to talk about rights, to talk about diversity, to talk about coexistence, to
talk about differences; And another with families, who were workshops with the family for a little too
Sensitize, create that idea of saying, the common schools that the door would not be closed to
the gurises, that also promote that integration went beyond school or that
A classic that child with disabilities does not go to children's birthdays without disabilities, no
They make out for a walk or the walks the families do not but the child with disabilities as
They know they are afraid to put the leg if they invite it or generate a lot of demand. Then treat
of helping a little to begin to happen and that is the social component. (4_ IIDI technician)
The workshops with students are carried out by workshop in different areas from
which work proposals with students are made. Some of the
proposals are as follows:

very powerful, since it allows to extract information from how

scenes of everyday life whose protagonists had some kind of
Disability: auditory, visual, motor or intellectual. From this
Communication
Video, the children reflected and commented on situations,
Thinking in groups what actions would take to include a
partner with one of those disabilities
Source: Mandela network bulletins
In addition, workshops were developed in the areas of information technology, music,
Genetics, among others. Some of the questions presented in the work proposals
are the following:
● What does it mean to include?
64
● Who or who have to adapt?
● How and when to help so that we are in the same conditions?
● What is an inclusive school?
● How can each of us contribute so that the school is every time
more inclusive?
The workshops with the families had the same objective of awareness with respect to the subject, but,
In addition, explain, "put on the table", expectations, fears, experiences with respect
To disability. According to the Family Workshops Coordinator:
“In all workshops the possibility of being, generating listening that many
We need and share the information and experience that many families have accumulated and others
They can take into account. The richest of these spaces is the encounter between children's families
that have disabilities and those that do not. Because? For the opportunity to practice
Put yourself in the place of the other, get next to the way. What is always clear in these
conversations is that children with disabilities have the right to educate themselves in them
schools that his friends and brothers without disabilities. In terms of human rights all
Rights have the same value ”25.
“Some of the lessons learned in these meetings with families of children with and without
disability are: 1) All their children have rights, 2) their children do not "suffer" a "syndrome" or
"disorder". What they suffer are the situations of discrimination that sometimes generates its condition.
3) Families do not have a medical look at the condition of their child, but a look
Affective, from the social, therefore, they look for that affective, empathic and supportive look of the rest of the
society ”26.
Teachers positively value both workshops with students and
Workshops with families and consider that it is very important that families are aware
of the network and its purposes and that collaborate with generating a more inclusive school. In that
sense, the teachers interviewed raised the need to have the planning of
The workshops in advance to inform families. The existence could not be verified
of a planning and monitoring framework of the workshops with objectives and deadlines of
compliance.
Regarding the content of the workshops, it is identified that they are designed from the perspective of
Human Rights, in understanding that people with disabilities have the same
Rights that people without disabilities. However, the gender approach would seem
be absent in this component, aspect that could be incorporated, since inequalities
They reinforce each other generating more barriers. To the human rights approach should
join the workshop planning the gender approach in such a way that the
Disability is not a barrier and gender either. Population census data in
Uruguay (INE 2011) show that in children up to 10 years there are more
boys than girls with disabilities. The 47,799 children and adolescents with disabilities
They represent 9.2 % of the total population with disabilities (UNICEF 2014) and 5.6 % of
age range from 0 to 17 years, percentage similar to 5.4 % estimated by WHO for the
World Children's Population. Faced with this situation, UNICEF and IIDI's report (2013) stands out
that

“The needs of girls and adolescents with disabilities are different from those of boys with
similar disabilities. For their status as women, these girls and adolescents face challenges and
social disadvantages dyed by discrimination related to gender aspects ”(UNICEF,
2013).
These data reflect the need to incorporate the theme in the workshops, in order to
contribute to fighting discrimination of girls with disabilities and thus promoting the
Gender equality in pursuit of the promotion of children's rights.
FLACSO COURSE
In 2019 the course already had three cohorts, forming in each to 250 teachers and
Teachers. The selection of the teachers who are going to take the course is carried out by the CEIP,
granting quotas per school of the network, so not all teachers and teachers of the
Network schools have been able to access the course. In the first cohort they were teachers of
Support and from the second, teachers of common schools, directors of the
Schools and Teachers of Secondary Education, both of the Secondary Education Council (CES)
as of the Professional Technical Education Council (CETP).
Participants very positively evaluate the opportunity offered by the network to
Be able to train in inclusive education. They emphasize that they have allowed them to make contact with a
theme of which they had not knowledge or sufficient experience. Some consider that
quotas are insufficient and do not accompany the demand for training the teachers possess, what
which implies that many teachers have not had the opportunity to train.
So that course served me to realize that children can, obvious that they can
be and have to be included in common schools, as long as it depends on the level of
disability they have. He gave me a lot of knowledge about special education, about what
which is disability and how to treat it, strategies, but more than anything the opening towards the
Inclusion (14_ itinerant teacher common school)
I liked it a lot. Above all, that suddenly, one expects recipes to work in class, but
I do not know, it was rather a mental openness of being able to think of the person in an integral way and see everything
What can be worked on, which sometimes we lose creativity for being subject to a program.
So, listen to other people who come from other places, with other experiences, such as
that also opens our heads to teachers, if more creative say, well, sometimes,
We have to put aside or modify totally objectives, methodology and curriculum, to be able to
get to that person. (58_Maestra itinerant Special School)
When investigating the contents of the course it is that one of the modules has
Objective “Build a conceptual framework of reference that integrates economic dimensions,
Racial ethnic, age, gender and sexuality and body that interact in logics and
Inclusion-Exclusion processes from the intersectional perspective ”27. At this point, the course
It would seem to incorporate the gender perspective. Moreover, education in diversity should
Incorporate the gender variable in the construction of this diversity. However, in the
speeches of the teachers participating in the course there is no evidence of the incorporation of the
Gender perspective.

Children's Family and Assemblies Commissions
In order to provide participation to families, the creation of commissions is promoted
of work composed of relatives of the students of the schools. It's about
Support commissions to educational centers that develop different activities (days
of awareness, fundraising, etc.) depending on the needs that are
identify in educational centers.
On the other hand, spaces for participation of boys and girls are developed, whose objectives are
"Give voice" and work issues related to inclusive education in the school environment.
Family commissions have little participation and in most cases
They identify the same groups, generally relatives of children with disabilities, almost
without participation of other families in the center. It should be noted that, among these families,
Most women find: mothers, grandmothers, aunts, among others.
Children's assemblies develop at school hours and are led by
center teachers. Various issues of interest to schools are worked, generally
associated with inclusion projects and, in addition, they officiate as a preparation of Congress.
That is why daily and worked with the assemblies, it is a way of encouraging already from
All ages, because garden too, everyone makes an assembly to foster that work, that
Creation say, development of participation and from the initial levels thinking of a
future and to improve the issue of participation (21_ Common School Director)
Work with classes on what is mandela, sensitize children, see what the subject of
barriers, basically with some kind, more than anything the big ones, so that later the children
Tell the little ones what Mandela is. Sometimes tasks are done with them and then or
stories and go and work with the children of the other classes about a story (33_Director
common school)
Assemblies with children as an opportunity for recognition of the other. That network has been
a network that has mobilized and has served so that in the community you can talk about
Those of schools as a mandela as an opportunity, a meeting space and to do
School from another place, which was not the traditional model that we were used to.
(46_ National Institute of Special Education)
Boys and Girls Congress
The activities carried out in pursuit of the Congresses (Children's Assemblies,
girls, family commissions, videoconferences with teachers) as much as
Congresses themselves are described as the most important of the Network in regard to the
stake. It is an instance where the different actors, especially boys and girls, have
The opportunity to tell their experiences and exchange with other experiences of children and
Girls in the country, as well as between families and teachers.
For them it was very important to know other children, see children who communicated by the language of
Signs, see other realities. Sometimes one inside the school sees some cases and knows how
communicate with them, how to get to them, now, they know other realities, there
They were observing, seeing what work was like. (13_ Classroom School Common School)

Congress was held annually since October 2017. Children participate throughout the
Country, families, teachers, directors, inspectors and representatives of IIDI and UNICEF. It's about
An instance of meeting for the exchange of experiences and the work of various topics
related to inclusive education (communication, awareness, participation, organization,
etc.).
Congresses are spaces where the work that was done during the year with children is turned,
With families. Start verbalizing and expressing yourself in relation to the equality of
opportunities, the good of living and learning the differences together as something positive, the
disability as something not necessarily or not as a health problem but
as another way of talking about writing or moving. Then the empowerment, what
We seek those gurises to take the congresses, a voice, a word of their own with respect to those
topics. (4_ IIDI technician)
The previous appointment reflects the common issue that the human rights perspective and the
Gender perspective: equal opportunities. In this sense, the congresses held
They do not seem to incorporate the gender perspective. However, the objective of the equality of
opportunities seems to be a starting point in common for the network to incorporate the
Gender perspective in their activities, even more so if activities are carried out for purposes
of empowerment of actors.
Educational inclusion projects
To integrate the network, the only formal requirement seems to be the elaboration of a project of
educational inclusion work by the common school and the commitment to develop it
during the school year. For this they receive funds for an approximate amount of between sixty and
seventy thousand pesos and according to what arises from interviews, it can be used for
purchase of materials, hiring specialists or aspects related to the accessibility of
The infrastructure of the school. It also follows that the projects contemplate so much
pedagogical and social aspects.
They almost always leave or always start from a problem in the school that has the
need to intervene to work inclusion. (…) The project was worked during the year
of inclusive games, that is, games that include everyone, that attend to diversity and
also involve the community. Parents came to paint games on the floor, they came to play with
The children worked very well with the Physical Education professor who also proposed games
Integrators for all, games were bought with the resources that came from Mandela by
Example that had board games to work in corners and an organization of the
recess that at first it was giving problems (...) the ramp was achieved based on the project of
All year where we work the inclusion and with the material that also gave us the network
Mandela (14_ Itinerant teacher common school)
(…) We call that Mandela, where we receive money. Our School received
60000 pesos, we can use 30000 pesos in talks with technicians that we decide which
and the other 30000 pesos for the exclusive use of the school generally trying to buy
books. We have a library with 300 and peak of good quality books because the school is
frame in a language project and we had a radio that reaches the entire school in reality
Then we work a lot with the radio and part of that money we will implement it precisely
What sound is better to buy another microphone. (8_ Common School Director)
68
The projects have the addresses and teams to choose the theme to work the
inclusion. I have seen that, in recent years, they have focused on the work it has to do, since
The construction of person, through, of emotions. As it was necessary to address, the part
of the emotions of children, how they manifest, of links, relationships with
Others, respect, solidarity, respect for diversity. (44_ National inspecting
special education)
The role of teachers
The Mandela network has among one of its components the training of teachers in practices of
classrooms that promote educational inclusion. But also, as an educational program, places
The teachers in the foreground. In this sense, I was interested in identifying the different roles and
functions that teachers perform and observe if changes are presented depending on the
Program implementation. The CEIP has education classroom teachers
Common, teachers of special education classrooms, support teachers and teachers of
itinerant support. Among the relevant questions for the evaluation, I was interested in answering the
following. What is the difference between a support teacher and a support teacher
itinerant? Do they work differently? Do they work in the same way? How is the work
With classroom teachers with support teachers? Has there been a change in the role of
teachers since the start of the program?
Role of classroom teachers: special and common
The teachers and teachers of Common Education and Special Education classrooms who
They share a greater number of hours with students, who know their
educational trajectory and its situations and advances. In this regard a teacher mentions:
And the classroom teacher, obviously you have another commitment to the chiquilines, you work with
The family, you work with the student, you are 6 hours with the student, you know from how it comes,
When it comes, if you are medicated or if not, if it comes good, if it comes badly, how was your weekend, if
You are happy, if you are sad, you have a look, you have them all the time, that is, you have to create a
Affective bond, you have more with large chiquilines, you have to know what their
weaknesses (12_ Classroom Special School)
The previous appointment accounts for the differences between common education and special education.
While in common education 4 -hour classes are taught with groups of 25 students
At different levels, in special education classes are 6 hours with groups of 10-15
Students, where teacher care is much more personalized. This is key when
It aims to address diversity since the teacher must know each of his students,
understand their situations and have tools that allow not only containment but
skills development.
In this sense, teachers' speech realizes that attention to diversity and
Inclusion in common schools becomes a complex challenge. This challenge implies solving
a tension between achieving certain expected performances and skills for the average
group and at the same time address the diversity of situations and difficulties that make
Some students do not reach the expected performance.
69
The role of the support teacher and the itinerant support teacher
The support figures and itinerant support teacher are prior to the program, so
That schools that do not belong to the network also have these resources. Are
figures are extremely relevant in terms of changes in the teaching paradigm and
learning, in the incorporation of inclusive education practices that generate
transformations both in the form and teachers teach, as well as in the
way in which students learn.
The speech of the interviewees allows us to observe that although the support teacher and the teacher
Itinerant support are two different figures in terms of the number of schools to which
They attend, their roles and functions are quite similar. On the one hand, the support teacher is a
position based in a common school and that in its origin had pedagogical support functions
and work with learning difficulties. On the other hand, the itinerant support teacher is a
position based in a special school and that travels 2 or more common schools during the
week, supporting teachers in planning classes with an inclusion approach
Educational, as well as working with the families of students with disabilities. In this
sense, the functions of these figures were different at their origin but currently
They develop quite similar activities, tasks and functions. The following table shows
tasks, activities and functions that both the support teacher and the teacher perform
Itinerant support.
Table 15. Actors with whom they work and activities that do teachers and teachers of
Itinerant support and support

- Interview to perform referrals
Source: Own elaboration
If the previous table is analyzed, it can be seen that the support and support teachers
Itinerants work not only with the classroom teacher but with children and also with the
families. In addition to attending boys and girls in their learning, they have a relevant role in the
I work with families, in generation and search for support networks, exchanges with other
institutions external to the educational field, working on trajectory monitoring
educational, interviewing families to carry out derivations or orient them in process.
In this sense, itinerant support and support teachers have a social role that is
associated with the educational role, since social conditions are not always adequate and
The educational opportunities of the students permeate. Traditionally the system
Educational has a highly feminized structure, with activities associated with tasks
of care In other words, they are roles that are associated with the female stereotype in which the
woman takes care of reproduction, care and education, while the male stereotype
It is characterized by roles associated with public life and economic production.
In relation to work with classroom teachers and students, both
The support teacher as the itinerant support teacher have two work modalities:
● Work within the classroom with the teacher and the whole group
● Work outside the classroom attending the specificity of situations
The work outside the classroom or in support classroom, aims to address the specificity of the
disability. In this regard, the program proposes a change in this modality, giving greater
Emphasis to work within the classroom with the teacher and with the whole group, so not
generate differences between students due to learning difficulties and
attending the various ways of learning that children have. In this sense, a
Teacher mentions that this orientation is not so clear among classroom teachers
common schools, since in some cases they expect support and support teachers
itinerant working in small groups and outside the classroom to attend difficulties
Specific.
Well, we from the inclusion paradigm, we are no longer working as
Center like, when I started working I was very young and I went to my support classroom, I
I took the children who did not learn or learn differently and had the time with them, it is rather
From the closed intervention. With this, with this change in educational inclusion, we
We are in the classrooms working through universal design, proposing to the teacher to
encourage to practice activities where they include everyone, thinking about the way of learning from each
child. Well, that has been like a process that is not so easy, from the theory it is very nice, but
It has cost a little more, because there is still the idea that, take it because I need this
Child ... capable that in a mandela network, that already have it assumed and it is known that no. But not
71
It is a matter that everyone is clear, that is, costs, costs and sometimes they arrive and
They want the child to be with the support teacher, because you are the specialist in this
(27_Maestra itinerant common school)
The orientation of educational inclusion policy is that these figures support the teachers of
classroom in class planning, in providing teaching strategies that contemplate the
different ways in which students access learning, making proposals that
Allow these various approaches to the content that is proposed to work. In this way, I know
seeks that inclusion occur not only within common schools but also within
The classrooms. In this regard, an itinerant support teacher mentions:
No, there are partners who do, there are partners who work. I directly what I can do
And what I do and I have done is to model the class. For example, we coordinate a topic with the
teacher and always asking if she agrees that you see another way of addressing a topic
Any she gives me, how can you do some other things, that she doesn't
I was being able to do. So, she can see, that can be done from another place and that
More than anything, but always working with the entire group. We do not work with children in form
independent, no hand in hand (...) not because, in addition, just, that is the issue of
Educational policies, of the Special School as a resource center, not as a special school. EITHER
Be it, there is a paradigm shift, where we are precise, we are key, in how
We give and how we work. It is not the hand in hand, it is not the child taken from the
Context, it is not a special situation for the child. But that the environment must adapt to
Needs of the child and for that, we have to work inside the classroom and with the entire group. TO
Sometimes, there are specific situations, but where it requires something, but with the family included, no.
I this year, at no time, work with children independently, this, nowhere,
taken from your classroom (41_Maestra itinerant common school)
In this sense, a tension between the personalized attention of the difficulties of
learning and concern for the participation and social inclusion of children with
disability.
... I also work with adults and that they always claim that their
Voice, for example, working with deaf people there are times that they say: we prefer
be in, to teach us through sign language in a classroom to us and not be
Integrated because it is another way of accessing, because we need that didactic transposition.
I also say, I think you have to see this way that they are included in the common schools me
It seems fantastic, provided there are resources to sustain that and for them too
achieve learning. (31_ SUPPORT SUPPORT SCHOOL)
This tension is mediated by the coexistence of the integration and inclusion paradigms, which
They manifest through two hypotheses. On the one hand, that children with disabilities
They have greater difficulties in learning and that is why they need personalized attention. By
on the other hand, that common education teachers do not find
sufficiently formed to teach in diversity. This situation leads to the paper
of the support teachers and itinerant support teachers acquire a formative character. In
First, due to the specificity of knowledge regarding the areas of disability. The
Itinerant support teachers, in some cases they conduct specialization courses
In visual, motor, intellectual, developmental disorders, behavioral disorders.
Second, for their knowledge regarding the ways in which the teachers and
Teachers teach and students learn.
72
8.3.2 Does the intervention develop specific activities or components with a
gender approach?
From the analysis of the implementation of the different components, it can be seen
that the gender approach is not present when making the implementation and
The development of network activities. either in the activities carried out by the network to
through the workshops, as in the contents taught in these, the congresses of girls and
Children made by the network, educational inclusion projects, as well as in roles to
play by classroom teachers, itinerant or support, the
Gender perspective. At this point, it should be noted that one of the modules of the course of
Flacso training works and incorporates gender perspective. Anyway, in the
Speeches of the teachers participating in the course, this variable does not appear as relevant.
So it would seem that, in the discourse on educational practice, the gender perspective
It was not incorporated. In this way, it is understood that the incorporation of the perspective
gender in the activities carried out by the network is a substantive aspect that should
get ahead. Above all, in order to contribute to generating equal opportunities and
Empowerment of all the participating actors of the program: teachers, directors,
relatives, in order to contribute to better educational and learning conditions
In children with disabilities with whom the program works.
8.3.3 Is intervention homogeneous according to the type of school, territory?
The intervention has been heterogeneous in general terms and this owes to several aspects: the
role playing leaderships in the territory, voluntary participation of schools
common, territorial closeness between common schools and resource centers, availability
of human resources.
In general terms, the participation of common schools is voluntary and seems
Depend on the contact and information that the educational center possesses, both with the theme in
General, as with the particular program. In this sense, the previous experience they have
Inclusion centers seems to be central when receiving invitation to form
part, which could be considered a substantive aspect to offer the program to the school.
The first year that there were eight schools, I think there were eight schools, where it was coming
doing an already previous job, where there were good practices for the inclusion of gurises with
Disability and we wanted that to enter and become visible to everyone. And always
That was the main criterion. There are schools that had already been doing things or were not at least
not closing the door in the face of the Gurises and then associated because they served them
To amplify and add and access training, access support and a fee of
motivation about something that already had been doing, the criterion has always been that with
Some exception. (4_ IIDI technician)
The director brought us the project, shared it with us, read it and well, they informed us,
I think the inspectors, because, in addition, we worked a lot with the special school and
We had contact with the special and well inspectors, they told us a little and well, in this
that I tell you, that as we were part of a work similar to what Mandela raises.
(55_Maestra Classroom Common School)
The information comes mainly through special education inspectors,
73
generally motivated by the experience of inclusion of schools that decide to participate,
as well as the exchange with actors of schools that are part of the network.
The school chooses to be part of the network itself, for me that is the most wonderful, not saying a network
that extends to the extent that what is persuading, convincing, raising awareness
People, other teachers, and those teachers choose to be part of the network. At no time
Technical inspection says: You and you have to be part of the network, on the contrary, it is school,
Because it is that teaching group that is this that proposes, it self -calls to be part of the
Red, what we do from the technical inspection. (34_ technical inspection)
A director who already had a long history of inclusion at his school, but with Red Mandela
As he also grabbed a very important impulse and achieved, it was one of the first schools that
He managed to do activities in the community and transversalize the theme. (2_ IIDI technician)
In relation to the above, the leadership of the inspectors and inspectors of special education,
as well as the directors of schools are key when participating and incorporation
From schools to the network and especially, in work with children with disabilities.
With a national inspector, a local inspector of special education also very strengthened very
In favor of everything that is the proposal of inclusive education and had some support teachers
Also very powerful that accompanied and were referents of all the way inside Mandela.
(4_ IIDI technician)
Directors always, such as inspectors and directors are the key figures in which
The processes (4_ IIDI technician)
Then we think: “His own common education colleagues, through evidence,
practices, they will be the ones who make greater advances and we work together with them. ”
(1_ National Institute of Special Education)
While the incorporation into the program in this way can be perceived as a solution that
facilitates the work of inclusion of common schools (based on experience and
Trust links), generates a bias in incorporation. This could represent a good
strategy at the beginning, but to the extent that it is intended to extend the network and climb the
Program, it is an aspect that must be reconsidered.
So it is the special invitation makes the schools that they feel like they are more
accustomed to work, to the common schools with which they are accustomed to work,
which are the trust of the people of special, but they are them, the directors, well the
inspectors and special inspector, those who have always had the invitation card and have
delivered to those who understand ... we have tried to make the invitations
open and everything but that ... once happened at the beginning, it happened ... we were very upset with
that and then like you are getting tired and the system is returning a little to its point of
comfort right? (4_ IIDI technician)
That is, under this situation, it may happen that the responsibility for inclusion could
Finish falling on these schools. The challenge that could be presented at this point would be:
How to motivate more schools to approach the network, regardless of their
Experience in work with children with disabilities?
At the same time, territorial closeness between special and common schools is perceived
as an facilitating aspect for joint work, since it optimizes resources and facilitates the
Exchange between schools, as well as the possibilities of coordination and attention. This
74
could deepen bias in participation and omit the needs of those schools
common who do not have a nearby special school. An example of this are schools
of the rural environment or the non -capital cities of the interior.
We want the schools that are integrated have a special school, because
It is a resource center, so that the school goes more to collaborate and have
Several support devices. In some we have support teachers within the school and a
Close Special School, in others we had no support teachers, but we have a school
Very powerful very close special education that can get several resources. (5_Inspect
National Special Education)
We try to make mandela schools apply for a simple reason that
We had to be attentive to the devices and support systems that we could
provide in territory, then they were including schools whenever they had a device of
Support, a special school nearby to prevent this tension from being deepened. (5_Inspect
National Special Education)
For all the above, the implementation is heterogeneous according to school, according to
territory, according to territorial closeness between the school and the resource center and also
heterogeneous by components. In addition, heterogeneity is also caused by virtue of
that the program has been modified based on the implementation itself. Hence
Perhaps, some schools that participated at the beginning have had or received a program
different from what they can be receiving now.
Teachers
According to what arises from the interviews conducted, the implementation of these spaces
It has not occurred homogeneously either at the territorial level or in the different years of
Program implementation. In some cases the teachers report that they are carried out in six
occasions during the school year, while, in others, they say that one or two of
These instances in the year, being more frequent during the first years of the program than
currently.
They give us a couple of rooms a year and there we select the issues we want to work and discuss
A lot of things is sometimes to plan activities to evaluate others to see where
We want to continue sharing experiences. (25_ Classroom Special School)
And look, this year, for example, it became only one, because it enables her primary. There were previous years
That became more. (30_ Classroom School Common School)
We have six rooms a year (29_ Common School Director)
On the other hand, difficulties are identified for teachers' participation in the rooms, already
either because of the hunting of schedules or the difficulties in attending because they are against turn.
Likewise, one of the identified deficiencies is that they are not payable in the case of
Teachers of special schools, which hinders their participation, which is considered
fundamental for the rest of the teachers.
75
We end at 3 and they end at 5. We have to wait two hours to be able to
Start the room. There is a rather complicated schedule lag, which we are
It complicates a lot. (23_Maestra itinerant common school)
No, we are not doing. For the issues of the institution, the issue is that they never paid. (52_Maestra
of Common School Support)
This year we had difficulty in the rooms. Here Salas were made, but we don't
We participated, the special school, although we knew about the rooms and threw issues to do it, no
There were coincidences, although it seems a lie, I think only one was made. There was no coincidence
In the times, because when they could, we couldn't and well, I know it's a whole
Year, but sometimes, it happens. (41_Maestra itinerant common school)
We should be 100%, but it is never achieved because, or very rarely it is achieved, by the fact
that there are people who work at the schedules. (29_ Common School Director)
IIDI workshops
The workshops began to develop in schools in 2017. The amount of
Schools by workshop varies according to the departments to which they are assigned.
The incorporation of the target group in the network facilitated the realization of them,
since before they were in charge of two IIDI techniques for the whole country.
Well, look, first, part of the work with families Iidi did. Then, when expanding
This amount of schools, such as they could not be in so many departments at the same time. So,
From last year, the enjoyable school program is requested, through its
Social workers and psychologists who participate in work with families. In Soriano, it could
Give in a very fluid way and device 1 was placed, which is with families, in the network school.
That does not happen in all departments, nor is it with that fluidity. Because, for example, I have
Also in charge of the Río Negro region and are 2, to attend an emerging, the different
team devices cannot be only working with families, because there are other things that
They are more powerful and need to attend. (44_ National Education
special)
The frequency planned for the realization of these workshops was monthly for both families
As for students, however, it was not possible to implement said frequency
Due to the amount of workshops available and that from the design of the program the
strategy was to propose components or activities that could be absorbed by the system.
He raised it in a very clear way and we agreed and it was that neither created anything that did not
It was absorbable by the system itself, that is, we do not enter with the idea of creating something immense mega
or very frequent and that when we left there is nothing left. (4_ IIDI technician)
In this sense, there were components that could be absorbed such as
transformation towards resource centers, but there were other components that could not be
absorbed by the system. This may be due to different reasons, such as
establishment of other priorities by the teams that would absorb the task, or the
Absorption of new tasks was performed within the framework of the same number of hours they were
budgeted. This implies that new resources would not be generated for these new
Activities, but worked with existing resources in the system.
We still believe that this has to generate the system itself does not have to do a
NGOs and special education has many resources for that and enjoyable schools also
It has and community also has them, that is, we bet that these resources will go
looking at the disability and work of children and families on these issues also as part
of his work. (4_ IIDI technician)
76
The idea of not generating a program parallel to the structure, but the activities and
Program components were absorbed by the same structure, it has its logic: and it is that
In this way the actions of the program would be sustained beyond political definitions,
as long as the structure absorbed it. The problem is generated when the resources of the
structure or are not enough to absorb more actions, or the
Information regarding the need to prioritize some activities on others.
In the case of workshops with families, they developed with one or two workshop for all
schools. At the beginning of the network were 16 schools, but as the program advanced
And the schools were added the strategy was to have a reference of the families in each
One of the schools that will make the calls, and incorporate school teams
enjoyable to take the workshops when the workshop in charge could not
meet the demand. The objective again was that the component was absorbed by the
system or territory, but this generates differences in territories according to the possibility of
generate strong territorial networks that can take this component and develop the
activities.
Children's Family and Assemblies Commissions
In both cases, the development of these participation tools has been given in a form
heterogeneous, being more common in places where the network takes more working time
(Rivera, Mercedes, thirty -three).
Selection of participating schools
Throughout the evaluation and based on the analysis of the discourse of the actors interviewed,
It can be seen that in the selection of the participating schools there has been a bias of
selection. In practice this means that those schools have been chosen that
They previously have some experience in educational inclusion. While at the origin this can
having been a practice that has facilitated implementation, does not seem to be something that
It should continue to happen. Since it could be generating an unwanted effect, which
It would be characterized by supporting those schools that have greater sensitivity
Towards educational inclusion, at the expense of those who do not. Also, this situation could
Generate difficulties when expanding and climbing the program. Well, those schools to
that the network has not arrived and may want to arrive, be the ones that have the most difficulties in
Terms of awareness of inclusion, or being those that do not have a center of
Geographically close resources.
Therefore, heterogeneity has been displayed in the implementation of the network that is
is supported by territorial closeness. This means that while the links in the
resource centers and common schools that are in an inclusive complex or that
They locate in the same neighborhood are extremely strong; the links between the resource centers and
Common schools that have a larger distance (different neighborhoods in the same city)
77
Be weaker. That is, the development of the network is dependent on reality
local, of the leadership of inspectors, directors, teachers and specific resources with
Those who count schools.
In turn, it should be noted that the participation of schools in the network is visualized as
a possibility that provides an endowment of economic and human resources: either
materials, hiring professionals (psychologists, psychomotoring, etc.), and, therefore, it is
understood as something extremely positive for common schools participating in the network.
It also emphasizes that human resources and activities available are
insufficient (the workshops, congress -1 time a year-, videoconferences, courses, teachers
itinerant and support).
8.3.4 What type of information is relieved about disability of children
of program schools?
From the analysis carried out, it can be indicated that there are no systematic information records and
standardized children with disabilities in the educational centers of the Network. Although
There may be centers that detail this information through the Guri platform, or, with
basis in some systematization of its own, a generalized survey could not be identified and
homogeneous, which prevents an estimate of the number of boys and girls with
Disability included in the network schools.
The evaluation proposed a mitigation strategy for this situation, through a record of
survey of boys and girls included in the network schools that the evaluation team
sent to the schools of the Network. It should be noted that the survey did not have the expected success,
Since only 21 of the 44 common schools completed the file. This situation puts
manifest one of the previously planned difficulties and verified once the
evaluation, while highlighting the obstacle to complying with the component
of monitoring and evaluation that program had planned since its inception.
The absence of systematic registration of information becomes one of the most
Weak of the network, and that, therefore, it is understood relevant and necessary must be improved, already
either through training, formations and dissemination about the importance and benefit
that the situation does not matter if it is done in a homogeneous and global way. Several are the
alternatives and actions that could be adopted for strengthening this aspect. Whether it's
in the survey of the perceptions and resistances that the different actors possess the
regarding the identification of needs, as well as in the elaboration of a registration
standardized that is useful for all, to provide practical answers to your
needs and that, at the same time, facilitate the daily management of the centers.
8.3.5 How many teachers participate in the program?
As indicated in the previous section, there has been no access to this information,
reason why you cannot answer this question.

8.4 Efficacy
Summary: In general terms, satisfaction is perceived by families in their
Experience in network schools. depending on that there are no systematized records
Information, there is difficulty to know and report the number of children with
disability included in common schools. Regarding improving support for
Sustainment of inclusive educational practices, it is found that the Mandela Network has
began a sensitization process of teachers, directors, students and families in
around inclusion. From the discursive, incorporation by the teachers of the
inclusion paradigm, distinguishing between inclusive practice and a non -inclusive practice,
although this research has not been able to delve into the appropriation of this type of practices in
The daily life of classrooms. On the other hand, special schools begin to
Transform into a resource center, although some resistance and difficulties are identified.
Some of them linked to the definition of roles, the need for technicians and orientations
for the fulfillment of the objectives.
8.4.1 To what extent have the project managed to develop practices according to
needs of children with disabilities? Do teachers achieve
Incorporate inclusive education practices?
Against the need for teacher training that allows to rethink educational practices and
generate proposals that meet diversity, the special education inspection in
set with UNICEF and FLACSO implemented the course “Inclusive education: a path to
tour. ”One of the course modules proposed the introduction of methodologies of
teaching and learning that will consider the diversity of students, more specifically the
Universal Learning Design (DUA). This approach tries to explain why many
students do not reach the expected performances, focusing on the curricula,
which are designed to attend to the average of the students under the hypothesis of
that students learn all in the same way. This approach states that "the
Barriers for learning are not, in fact, inherent to the capacities of the
students, but arise from their interaction with inflexible methods and materials ”(Rose &
Meyer 2002). In this way, the DUA relies on the inclusion paradigm according to which it is
the system that generates barriers to learning, which must be demolished so that all
students can access knowledge.
Based on the premise that people are unique, in their way of being, to see the world, in
its personal characteristics, and also in its way of learning, the DUA criticizes the formats
schoolchildren in which all students are expected to develop certain
Skills at the same time, in the same way and under the same proposal. According to him
DUA approach, students have different ways of knowing, recognizing, they have
diverse learning skills and strategies, as well as different interests and priorities.
80
From the analysis of neural networks, the DUA develops three principles that guide the
design of educational practices.
● Provide multiple ways to present the content that is intended to learn:
Because students have different facilities to access.
● Provide multiple ways of acting and expressing: since students have
diverse strategies and skills to interact with knowledge.
● Provide multiple ways to get involved with knowledge: refers to the various
interests that students have in such a way that they feel motivated and
committed to learning.
From these three principles teachers can generate broader proposals with
various materials, approaches and that attends to the diversity of students. Depending on a
of the strategic lines of educational policy orientations for five years
2016-2020: “Adapt the educational centers in their organization and their practices, attending to
the diversity of its child population ”; the CEIP presented the“ guidance document for the
Protection of trajectories and for the elaboration of the Personal Work Project (PTP) "
(2018). This project is prepared by the teacher or teacher in accordance with the
Supervisor team, family and adults referring in such a way to enhance the trajectory
Student personnel who require it because it is an extraordinary promotion of the resort
of degree or other reasons (ANEP-CEIP 2018).
As mentioned above, the pedagogical component of the program implies the
Teacher training in inclusive education, which includes training in the design of
educational proposals through universal learning design, considering the project
of personal work of the students. In this sense, one of the questions that guided this
study involved knowing what are the inclusive education practices developed and how
They differ from non -inclusive practices. Based on the analysis of teachers' speeches and
teachers were developed the following table, which shows the differences between the practices of
Educational and practical inclusion of non -inclusion in terms of proposals, planning,
Students, materials and approaches.

As can be seen in the previous table, mainly from the training course,
Teachers visualize changes in the way of planning, in materials to
Use, in the diversity of approaches, proposals, ways to evaluate, etc. While in the
82
traditional practices a single proposal is made, with an expected route, a material
specific and expected activity, inclusive practices are characterized by presenting a
broad proposal that adapts to the different capacities and forms of approach to the
students and students. They are proposals in which the same content is treated, but through
Differentiated activities according to the level of learning of students. It's about
Not demanding everyone, but focuses on the processes of each of the students
and students so that they can advance in their learning. Unlike practices
traditional in which a unique and unique journey and result is expected to which
All must arrive, in inclusive practices there are a variety of possible answers, all
Students participate in learning based on times and activities
different. While traditional practices expect all students
They reach a certain level, in inclusive practices it is about addressing diversity and
that each can advance according to their starting point that is often not the same
For everyone. On the one hand, in non -inclusive practices everyone is expected to reach certain
basic performances, for which there may be diversity. Do not contemplate the
diversity can generate that they only reach that level (the expected) those who have the
conditions (social, economic, physical and intellectual) to get there, leaving everything behind
He who does not have them. On the other hand, in inclusive practices it is expected that all
students can advance something, considering conditions and starting points
diverse, but without establishing averages that everyone must arrive. The tension
Among expected performances and attention to diversity is one of the main challenges to
Those who face educational inclusion policies.
While the speeches of teachers allow differentiating between a practice
Inclusive and a non -inclusive practice, this research has not been able to delve into appropriation
of this type of practices in the daily life of the classrooms. In this way, it would be interesting
Deepen the daily application of inclusive practices in the teaching exercise. For the
that, although the course implied a sensitization of teachers with respect to
subject and greater knowledge regarding how to make open proposals that attend the
diversity, it cannot be affirmed what is the degree of appropriation of classroom teachers in
Relationship to these practices. In addition, the course in his first cohort was oriented to teachers
and itinerant teachers, teachers and support teachers, so that access to the course by
Common education classroom teachers and teachers seem to be more recent. Moreover, the
course was extremely demanded by what the training of teachers in
Inclusive education is a line to work.
8.4.2 To what extent has the project managed to expand the number of schools
participants?
The program began in 2014 with the participation of 17 schools, 10 common and 7 special,
In the departments of Montevideo (4), Canelones (3), Durazno (3), Lavalleja (3), Flores (2) and
Soriano (2). Although during 2015 he maintained the number of participating schools, from
2016 There was a significant increase in the participation of schools and in their
territorial distribution, reaching 18 of the 19 departments of the country in 2019 and 80

participating schools (Florida has no participating schools). It is also important
Highlight that only six schools retired from the program between 2015 and 2019.

8.4.3 How many girls and boys are found in schools
common network participants? Are differences according to sex?
As detailed in section 8.3.4, there are no systematic information records and
standardized of children with disabilities in the educational centers of the Network.
This, by way of being able to account for the number of children included in the schools of the
Red, together with the coordination of the program, a survey form was developed in the
that the characteristics that, in directors and teachers, have the children and
girls included in the common schools of the network.
Specifically, the form tried to identify gender, age, the year from which they attend
to school, of those boys and girls who present indications of finding disabilities
sensory, physical, intellectual, as well as some kind of difficulties in the
communication/understanding, learning/concentration and that may require support from another
person. Likewise, the file investigated whether they have a diagnosis, together with a
General assessment about the conditions that these schools possess and provide so that
The boys and girls who are in this situation can learn in equal
conditions than your classmates.
Only 21 of the 42 common schools completed the survey form. Despite having
Information only for half of the schools, due to the lack of other data, it is understood that
The information is relevant despite not being exhaustive. The data provided by these schools
correspond to 378 children with disabilities that are included in schools

8.4.4 To what extent has the program achieved the results
planned?
In relation to program achievements based on their purposes, it is found that the
program had been proposed:
● Promote the development of schools and kindergartens that implement
Inclusive education projects throughout the country.
● Improve support available so that schools can implement,
hold and evaluate their inclusive education practices.
● Promote empowerment and collaboration processes between key actors
For educational inclusion: teachers, students, families, school staff and
community.
28 Question asked to directors and teachers: Do you consider that this child could learn in equality
of conditions that your classmates if they were a school that is not part of the Mandela network? (%).
91
● Stimulate processes of exchange, shared learning, visibility and
Dissemination of good inclusion practices between resource centers
(Special Schools), Schools and Gardens of Common Infants.
● Generate evidence and systematize education implementation models
Inclusive in Uruguay through the documentation and evaluation of experiences.
With respect to improving support for the support of inclusive educational practices,
finds that the Mandela network has begun a process of awareness of teachers,
directors, students and families around inclusion, which can be verified in speeches
around the subject. This process is based on the educational inclusion paradigm, the
Modification of special schools to resource centers and in the development of practices
Inclusive educational.
The information relieved in the evaluation does not allow to account for the appropriation of the
Inclusive education practices by teachers in classrooms. However, the
training is a central component of the program and, it is a central aspect when it comes to
extend it, especially when the training of teachers in educational inclusion practices is
identified as a necessity by the teachers themselves. The training provided by
FLACSO is extremely valued by those who have participated, since it comes to support and
Provide tools that, if not having said course, the task is subject to the
personal trajectory of the teacher, the impetus, commitment that it possesses, and the existing resources and
available in the territory. Anyway, although the formation of Flacso is valued, the
Teachers highlight that there are few places available for the demand for participation
existing.
Regarding the strengthening of empowerment and collaboration processes between schools
and families, the interviews show that although the program developed workshops of
Awareness with parents, mothers, students and teachers, these workshops were not supported by
the same way in all schools or throughout the history of the program.
With respect to exchange processes and good educational inclusion practices between
Resource centers and gardens and common schools, the evaluation team found
that teachers valued these exchanges and fundamentally the accompaniment of the
Support and itinerant support teachers in common schools. However, teachers
interviewees indicate that in some cases the teaching rooms were not carried out by
Time problems, or, due to difficulties with the payment of these. They also highlight the
need to have more support teachers present at school all week and not
both itinerant teachers who can only attend school once or twice
week. In that sense, teachers point out the imperative need to train and have
Human and technical resources (support teachers, psychologists, social workers, etc.)
present at school or with the possibility of greater access and availability than
They help solve situations or improve practices.
In relation to the change of special schools to resource centers, it has been found that if
well teachers identify changes regarding the activities of the resource center that
Before they were not developed by the special school, these functions are concentrated in
92
the directors of the centers or in the itinerant support teachers that serve as a link between the
common schools and resource centers.
Finally, in relation to generating evidence and systematizing models of implementation of the
Inclusive education in Uruguay is that it is a purpose in which progress has been made
bit. There are some publications such as “10 educational keys in the 21st century:
Inclusion ”(CEIP 2019), and with“ Inclusive Education: a path to tour ”by Mauri & García
(2019), which details some of the inclusion projects selected from the course of
Inclusive education developed by FLACSO, UNICEF and CEIP. In relation to monitoring,
The quantitative methodological strategy investigated the different sources of information
available and generated by the program, in order to analyze the viability of responding
questions raised. The evaluation proposed the reconstruction of a baseline of
teachers through administrative data, including relevant variables for analysis
(Rotation, antiquity, etc.), to observe the maintenance of teachers in schools
of the network. However, this was not possible due to lack of information.
8.4.5 What were the changes produced by the intervention evaluated?
From the social and social pedagogical and environmental components, the program has opted to generate
The following changes:
1. of the integration paradigm to the inclusion paradigm.
2nd of special schools to resource centers
As detailed in the literature review, the successive laws and conventions that went
signing and ratifying by the countries, within which Uruguay is,
They involved a paradigm shift (Míguez, 2016; Unesco, 2005; Simon and Echeita, 2013):
from the paradigm of integration to the paradigm of inclusion. It goes from a paradigm in
that the student had to adapt to the system, their ways of linking and accessing
to knowledge, to another paradigm in which it is the system that must adapt in its
forms of teaching, in its structures and functions. The actors responsible for the design of the
program are positioned from the inclusion paradigm, differentiating it from the approach of the
Special educational needs:
Change of perspective and at the world academy level the perspective is changed or
Start talking before children special educational needs had worked with
different capabilities that term in the communities of people with disabilities
They rejected because we all really have different abilities (...) then in that framework
It was done as this the perspective changed or a social conception of the
disability that hosted by the Rights Convention and all legislation and academia and that
new paradigm that implied that disability not only had the subject but also the
around. (1_ National Inspection of Special Education)
From the point of view of those who designed the program, the distancing of the approach of
special educational needs is related to paradigm shift, since,
While the special educational needs approach places disability in the
subject, the inclusion paradigm defines that students are subjects of law and
93
that there are barriers to learning in the environment. In other words, it is the environment that
It generates disability. Paradigm shift then implies a change of focus respect
Where is the problem and what are the solution alternatives.
In this regard, most of the teachers interviewed visualize, through the
Training course in inclusive education, greater openness and sensitivity to understand
This problem and to rethink educational practices.
First of all, it is another way of seeing reality. He opened our heads a lot about him
That is inclusion. We thought we were working inclusion and in reality
The unique we did was share time with the chiquilines. The chiquilines were in the
school, were contained, but we didn't always have a specific proposal for each
of them and speaking of children included from disability or children included from a high
We also started seeing that panorama was what was most opened that no
Only the child is in school, but the child lives the school that the school is part of its
life. (13_ Classroom School Common School)
The paradigm shift is observed through the speeches of the teachers in the
Conceptual difference between "being" and "being part" or "participating" in school. While "being" in
The school implied that the student simply attends and has some containment,
"Participating" in school implies establishing friendship ties, raising your hand, and power
Participate in the class as long as the proposal designed by the teacher allowed it. The
Difference between "being" and "participating" is understood both in the teaching dimension-
learning as in the affective dimension between students with disabilities and the rest of the
students, as well as with teachers. The program sought to make the leap towards "participation"
through the training of teachers and through the workshops with the students and the families.
"Participate" in terms of educational inclusion practices implies taking into account the student and
student in her situation and make proposals that contemplate this situation and allow you
An approach to knowledge that was not considered before. In other words, the change in the
paradigm also implies modifications in teaching proposals in such a way that
The student can access knowledge.
Resource centers and their links with common schools
This change of approach generates modifications in the solution alternatives, which to its
once they have an impact on the practices of common schools and the roles and functions of the
Special Schools. With respect to common schools, paradigm shift generates
movements related to the forms of teaching and learning against a diversity of
students and the way in which schools work. In this regard, the program comes
to respond to an existing demand, and that is that many schools, whether they belong to the
Network or not, they have boys and girls with disabilities included in their tuitions and do not have
the resources and teaching strategies necessary to generate educational achievements in
All students considering diversity. While common schools must adapt their
educational practices, while receiving support from special schools, they must
reconfigure their roles towards resource centers without disregarding registration or its functions
traditional This change implies:
“A) The opening to the regular educational community, b) the professional increase and strengthening of
Support teachers and itinerant support teachers, c) the expansion of the modalities of
94
intervention, and d) the fact of enabling the return of students who have traveled by the
Special school device to the common institution of origin ”(ANEP-CEIP 2019).
When teachers, teachers, directors and directors are consultation about what it implies being
a resource center, what is the difference between being a resource center and not being, how
These are the links between resource centers and common schools, interviewees
Some differences between belonging or not to the Mandela school network, as well as
positive aspects and negative aspects regarding the program. The following table summarizes
These aspects.

Among the positive aspects regarding a special school to being a center of
resources, teachers identify teaching rooms, videoconferences,
Congress preparation, support and guidance of trailers and teachers to
common schools, information provision, coordination with social services and
Health services, exchanges and activities together between resource centers
95
And common schools, a greater opening of schools common to schools
special and vice versa, among others.
However, special education teachers find that all
resources and support are oriented to common schools, and that in some cases the
links between resource centers and common schools are rare or are
only mediated by the teacher/a itinerant. The idea that resources and support are
only oriented to common schools makes sense, since the program is oriented to
The inclusion of children with disabilities in common schools. However, they are the
Resource centers that have to have the resources available to be able to meet the
needs and demands of common schools. So, it would be relevant to strengthen the
Resource centers so that more thoroughly can be worked on the possibilities of
Trajectories from special education to common education.
Related to this idea that the support and resources of the program are concentrated in
Common schools, special education classroom teachers do not visualize
greater differences in the daily work of the resource centers regarding the work than
they had been developing before belonging to the Network. In other words, being a center of
resources implies new activities for special schools, which mostly
They are concentrated in the figures of the director and the itinerant teacher.
... the school as a resource center, which I agree with what she told you, actually the school
Special does not receive anything and say ... if you go, you will realize that they have no materials, they do not have,
But from the human there is an important exchange. ”(35_ Common School Director)
From the speeches of teachers, teachers and directors it is extracted that there is a demand for
Human and technical resources in all schools, not only Mandela schools, due to the
Number of boys and girls with disabilities and that common schools include.
The transformation of special school to resource center seemed to be based on an addition
of tasks and functions for the special school, having in parallel a coexistence with the
Traditional functions. This implies a division within the special school: on the one hand,
classroom teachers of the special school who work almost in isolation in
their schools, and, on the other, the itinerant teachers who are linked to schools
common. The targeting of the resources that the network implements and gives
This second group. So this idea of the transformation of the special school to a
Resource center is limited to work with common schools, not perceiving
Substantive modifications in the traditional functions of the Special School.
Additionally, the change of special schools to resource centers seems to be associated
to the presence of common schools that participate in the network in the territory. In other words,
When common schools do not join the program, special schools do not go to
Be a resource center. This goes in line with the idea that the greatest impacts of the program
They are visualized in common schools. However, greater work would be relevant regarding
paradigm change in special schools, as well as regarding the implications of moving on to
be a resource center.

8.4.6 What degree of knowledge do actors who have participated in the
project (teachers and families) about the inclusive education approach?
In relation to the process of change in the approach to inclusive education, he investigated about
of the conceptions of educational inclusion of teachers, teachers and families
Network participants. both among teachers and among families are
heterogeneous conceptions and perceptions about educational inclusion, which depend
of the degree of approach to the program. The following table shows some of the
perceptions surveyed by teachers regarding educational inclusion, from the
paradigm, in the classroom, from training and in trajectories to common education.

He opened our heads. There is a lot of opening of schools and teachers.

While teachers understand that inclusion is achieved by sharing classrooms in schools
common, they also consider that there are boys and girls with severe disabilities who must be
attended by special schools. Identify differences in what the school was seen
special years ago and how is seen now, in this sense, they found that before the
Discrimination towards the special school was more present. They find aspects in favor of
educational inclusion in common schools such as the socialization processes of
Boys and girls with their peers, but express doubts regarding learning processes.
In this sense, they point out the need for resources for learning, as well as the
flexibility of teaching and learning formats.
Among others, teachers perceive some difficulties towards inclusion in which
number of boys and girls per classroom, which hinders the design of proposals and approaches to the
Diversity of situations that arise in the classroom. While they have support teachers
Or itinerant teachers, there are differences in preferences by forms of work.
While some teachers do not agree that they work inside the classroom, others
They are beneficial to develop proposals that attend diversity in such a way that
No accusations are observed. On the other hand, some teachers do not feel prepared
To teach in a diversity of students and situations, or they manifest not to possess the
pedagogical tools and technical knowledge to teach and manage situations.
All these aspects are challenges verified and indicated by the teachers when
Implement teaching/learning strategies under the inclusion paradigm
Educational
Regarding families is a diversity of perceptions and conceptions about
inclusion that are influenced by fears, expectations and experiences of these
families with the different institutions. More specifically, you can find differences
Among the families that lead their children to common schools and those who take them to schools
special. The following table summarizes the conceptions, perceptions, expectations and fears,
as well as the identification of resources necessary for educational inclusion

Source: Own elaboration
Regarding inclusion conceptions are families that consider that a
Inclusive school is a school where all children are treated in the same way
regardless of their disability, a school where boys and girls feel the same and
where they can share games and learning without fear of discrimination.
In relation to inclusion processes, some families maintain conceptions in which
It is boys and girls who must adapt to the school system. In this regard a family
mentions:
... she started with an internship because she had a learning delay or if she returned to time
Normal from school, we are going to say returned to the common school, but so far it has not been achieved,
Then continue with the internship that at any time if she manages to be in line with the
Common school times there she would come back. I think not because he has one more year left and already
ends. (11_Madre Special School)
The expectations and fears of families towards their children seem to be limiting the
development possibilities by not finding the necessary support to promote this
autonomy. In this sense, some families are in vulnerability situations
social and economic and do not perceive that the school has enough support for
99
Generate autonomy in children with disabilities. Families have many fears
Regarding what your sons and daughters can achieve, what they cannot achieve and to what they can
succeed for issues related to discrimination. In this regard a family mentions:
I always say until the day I am, the girl is going to be with me always say. But that
It sounds very selfish on me too because although she has her disability and everything has
The right to make a life, of course you saw because one also at times is put and says no, but
With such such a thing does not happen ... but how many things are lost, the limits (...) that fear of
Anyone looks that I have another girl and I also say when I go to the Lyceum such a thing
thing we are always with that fear and I say that in these cases they are so good
innocent (11_Madre Special School)
The previous appointment shows not only the fears of families but also the
vulnerability situations in which they are, that exemplify the need for
Empowerment that the program seeks to generate in families. In relation to
Learning, families expect their sons and daughters to have teachers who are
comprehensive and that they can advance in the learning process based on each
one.
That it is a person who has patience that can teach at the rate of them go
Learning are many things that sometimes sound half simple things that seem like a
nonsense but that for them at the time of learning is very important. (11_madre school
special)
8.4.7 To what degree do the actors involved in the project (in particular the
families) express satisfaction with their implementation and with the results
achieved?
In relation to the actors involved in the project and their satisfaction, the families of the
Boys and girls with disabilities attending the schools of the Mandela network point to a
Trajectory marked by a journey of rejections and discrimination. They emphasize having traveled
by a long pilgrimage through different educational centers. In this way, the acceptance of
Network Educational Center and the entry of the child or girls at school is at the same time, the end
of that long period of uncertainty and the beginning of new meetings and possibilities for
These boys and girls. Families report it and thank. They arrive through different
Transitated paths: from the school common to the specials, directly to the
specials, generally through a medical diagnosis, recommendations from other
mothers or by a derivation of the director or classroom teacher. From there, a
new path that can be a shared schooling, internship regime, etc.
When he entered the director and the teacher made me know that he was a child to
Special School. After a year ... the school advised me that he should be in the
Special School. (57_Madre Special School)
My son attends this school, School of Inclusion, since 2016 ... and began in second
degree. Before he was in another school ... I arrived through another person, from another mother, who brought
His son to this school ... in the previous school, to which he was going, he received a lot of discrimination from
of teachers, director, that is, of the institution itself ... and of the parents of other children, too.
(54_Madre Common School)

When the idea that the school was going to integrate here for my barbarian at that time did not
Because a lifetime fighting to accept your child, just as he is and that I don't have
School complaints in that sense because it was very well received since it went to the garden and then
Here all those years was integrated from first to sixth, this perfect. (19_Madre School
special)
The relatives of the children with disabilities consulted indicate in the
common schools belonging to the network and, especially in the teachers who perform there
their tasks, a greater predisposition for work with their children, as well as a
greater training in teachers who work in these schools. This aspect is
emphasizes above all when establishing a comparison with previous educational institutions,
where this was not perceived that way, but rather identified as educational spaces in the
which perceived lack of preparation in teachers to face and accompany the
needs of your sons and daughters. It is because of this situation that the family members stand out
that, under these conditions, boys and girls, in addition to feeling comfortable in an environment that
They are more friendly and favorable, they have greater opportunities to learn, because
They interact with people who are formed and who also have patience
To teach to the rhythm that each child needs. Thus, family referents report
a context according to the specific needs, greater disposition of the teaching group and
a more up -to -date training.
In many cases, families highlight that their child's participation in the common school,
interaction maintained with other colleagues has been and officiated of motivation and enhancer of
The abilities of their children. For this reason, it is seen as extremely important and
rewarding to them. Anyway, a group of parents persists that the school
Special officiates as a containment space that best suits the characteristics of the child.
They relate to there are smaller classrooms, less numerous groups and with characteristics
similar, that is, more personalized attention. And for these reasons, provide peace of mind to
Family members.
But fundamentally it is support, the bond of trust generated with teachers and
teachers, the most emphasized by the mothers consulted. This aspect is fundamental in the
relative story, since on numerous occasions this contact and support it offers
The school institution is seen as an accompaniment that, based on trust
allows to build in families a feeling of being able to make that attachment almost
exclusive between mother/father and child. This is reported as of the utmost importance, since
establishes a very strong bond between the family and the boy or girl with disabilities, on
Everything, sustained from family care, which generally falls almost exclusively to
Mothers and/or grandmothers. This poor autonomy derives that families have to perform
Multiple family arrangements, being mothers and grandmothers people dedicated to this task.
Trust, support, containment and relief is what many of the parents feel offers the
school that belongs to the network.
I absorbed my mother completely. My mom had left her fabrics,
Because she always wove by hand. She had dedicated herself, completely. She appeared equal to
8 in the morning in my house, knowing that I entered at 1 or 12, because my schedules
They were different. I was all day with her, all day with her, like this all day, like this.
101
Then, I said no, it ended. She has to go to a place, where mom can do her
activities. Because my dad had died and I say, she came for a while taking care of my dad.
(28_madre Common School)
Undoubtedly, this situation is lived in different ways according to the trajectory, the
context in which the family lives, the resources with which he has the capacities and the process
that he has established in relation to the disability of his child. Anyway, with
Independence of each family, from the story of the mothers is the need to have had
to make large movements to the family intern, that is, an adaptation of arrangements
that travel from the need for economic resources to meet the requirements of
boys and girls, reduction of the working day or output of the labor market, as well as the
Need to have specific resources that attend and provide support to the child:
Phonoaudiologists, neuropediatricians, psychomotorists, psychologists, etc. Those families that are
They find in a better economic situation they have hired the service of attendees
Personal for the care task, actor indicated as of great help and contribution to the
careful. That is why relatives highlight the need for technicians who
Orient, attend and provide monitoring and support to each of the situations of
disability with which families are.
It is through the story of the families that the work is found by the teachers of
The schools that participate in the network, often contribute to boys and girls
They can generate and have their own spaces, independent of what they share with
your relatives. This aspect is extremely valued by relatives, since the program
thus provides greater autonomy for both the child and for the family member in charge and reference of
Your care. In addition, it connects with one of the most felt needs by relatives: the
concern for educational continuity and the need to be able to instill and transmit
Tools so that tomorrow, when they are not as a support of their children,
These can perform autonomously. Educational continuity is widely
reported by family members, especially associated with the shortage of institutions with which
They count in their places of residence. Thus, at the end of school, it opens for them
Another period of uncertainty, as institutions are scarce.
I would like to be taught to do something so that they can defend themselves in the future.
Is that the fear of one too? because she is the only daughter as I told you and then I always
I think tomorrow that we are not, to see, how to relate ... defend oneself
No? It is the fear of every mother seems to me. Because you know that no matter how much you have others
Children always have that fear, because what happens, the other child can't always load
With the other person. And beyond us and all for more than one educa that it is
Companion, there comes a time that the other child also has to make his life has to take off.
That is, if you want to go to study elsewhere and always as you will be tied. I always say
Until the day I is, she will always be with me, but that sounds very selfish from me
Also because although she has her disability and everything, she has the right to make a life
In fullness ... if not, you limit it. For a little thing that suddenly does not happen only to us
To us by the head ... and they go out to live and live the rather and nothing happens to them. That
fear of anyone. And I say that in these cases they are so good and they are so innocent that
You don't know what partners you can have. That is why for me it would be the basic yes she learned
to write and read for tomorrow that can be handled and after learning a trade
You saw. (11_Madre Special School)
102
For this same reason, many of the relatives identify modifications in the
children's behaviors, many of them attributed to the inclusion process
educational by which their children are going through, mediated by the work exercised by the network.
Accompaniment based on the link established between school, teacher, reference
Family and child, feel the basis to articulate and provide knowledge that otherwise -
They understand family referents- they would not have incorporated.
I noticed it from the last year that she did sixth wears, that I told them that she did sixth 2 times.
From the last year she made sixth I noticed the change in integration to inclusion. AND
The school still had not come here. But she didn't go to school special, but
There you fell, because her teacher's teacher told her, if you are boring you can go to the
Special teacher class. So there, when she left she told me, I played with Juancito
who does not know how to write, then you saw, she identified with the child. So for me, from
There, of the internship that she made of one class for the other, which was not yet included
He found there, he said, this is my place. I think I should feel like that in all places, not in
some future, without any differences, but it was from there, of that internship of classes that
I noticed the change in integration for inclusion. She was barely integrated into the class and
Then, the following year that she started to come in the full schedule and at school, well,
There, without a doubt she is happier. I can say much more because it goes and tells you: Did you see that my
hair does not grow? But in my class they do not laugh, that kind of thing to give you an example ... today I will go
I am going to paint my lips today because it will be guideline and it will raise my self -esteem ...
She is a happier girl has much more self -esteem and you were not 100% better than
When she was barely integrated that she was a very dependent girl even the teacher
as long as the teacher was integrated and she moved because since she I don't know if

The teachers do not have the preparation, or the patience, which they have in an inclusion school. EITHER

Relatives in charge of children with disabilities indicate the difficulty that with the
who faced themselves when they found out about the disability that his son is going through. This story
maximizes and enhances the work provided by the network schools in this regard, in what
It refers to providing attention to these needs, guiding parents about the next steps
To give, contain them, etc., is extremely valued and recognized by the parents. For what would be
necessary the program could work in this regard, providing greater emphasis on this type of
actions that result in relatives feel more accompanied, receive
orientations regarding how to proceed with their sons and daughters in relation to their disability, of
way to make the process more bearable. From the story of the family consulted it follows
that the first great impact is that of the notification of the disability through which its
son/a. In this regard, in acceptance, in the knowledge work of the characteristics
of situations, of ways of proceeding and being with them, the program could
establish actions in this regard.

Look ... with telling you that I do not know that we also talk about that in Congress I is very

For today it is normal like any of my other 5 children, but at the time I do not

To accept and ... it was not that I did not accept my daughter, I did not accept her disability. I went to

None with anyone, she looks in the mirror and she loves her and well, I undoubtedly changed. I
I accept as it is and I think that with all this she and all this of inclusion has made me a better
person in that sense. (19_Madre Special School)
In this way, the familiar consulted indicate great satisfaction with what was received in the
schools that participate in the network, but, at the same time, the
need to continue working, above all, in the awareness of the educational community,
in the relative of relatives and not only held in the school environment but also in the others

Next, a synthesis of the most relevant information analyzed within the framework is performed

Orienting criteria: relevance and coherence, alignment, effectiveness and efficiency. In addition,
For each of the conclusions, which components of the apply evaluation were identified:

reconstruction is a set of proposed components and activities that are
consistent with the assumptions that define the public problem, as well as with the hypotheses of
expected changes and the results in the short term. The activities and components of the
program are relevant to the needs of the target population and are based on
Diagnostics Additionally, the program is aligned, both in its design and in

9.4 - The previous experience that the centers in inclusion possess was central at the time
of receiving invitation to be part of the network. This aspect leads to the convene
schools that already have a modality of work in inclusion in their career
Educational This can generate a selection bias and be a factor that generates difficulty
time to universalize the program.
However, the participation of schools in the network is voluntary and has been found
dependent on reality and local leadership, of the specific resources with which
Tell schools and the previous history of inclusion. This situation determines that the network
show different degrees of implementation in each territory and according to the component.
Additionally, heterogeneities are added in the implementation of the program as
Each component of the network has been incorporated different activities and has been transformed
(Salas, congresses, assemblies, videoconferences, training course, workshops).

9.5 - Special schools began to become a resource center, but
heterogeneous and incomplete form. Special education classroom teachers and not
visualize greater differences in the daily work of the resource centers regarding
work they had been developing before belonging to the Network. In other words, being a

in the director or director and the itinerant teachers. While special schools have a
Great opening, indicate a multiplication of functions that is not accompanied by a
Strengthening of resources in the same magnitude.
On the other hand, the common schools that participate in the network show great predisposition and
commitment to join the network, since it offers certain activities that respond to their
Demands (training and technical support received: the itinerant teachers and teachers and
specialized, the workshops implemented; as well as the economic resources provided by the
program through projects).
The territorial closeness, the leadership and the sensitization of inspectors and
Inspectors and directors and directors of special education play a fundamental role. The

Individual that teachers possess. The Mandela network began a process of
awareness of teachers, directors, students and families around inclusion, which are
evidence in the speeches of the interviewees. Teachers have incorporated the
Inclusion paradigm, distinguishing between an inclusive practice and a non -inclusive practice.
The pedagogical component is a central aspect of the program, because it is where teachers
They begin to incorporate the paradigm of inclusive education. In fact, training is
identified as an imperative need by the teachers themselves and is one of the
aspects most valued by the different actors participating in the program. However,
This training has not reached all teachers, who have expressed so much the need
of training as the shortage of quotas. It is essential to strengthen and deepen the
Incorporation of inclusive education as a transverse aspect in the basic training of
Teachers.

systematic that contributes to accounting for the planned objectives, of the
results obtained, of the activities carried out, as well as the number and characteristics
of the different actors participating in them. This aspect is substantive, especially in
referring to generating information that can establish if schools effectively favor
the development and implementation of inclusive education projects, as well as for

10. Lessons learned
10.1 - While the theory of change can be relevant and coherent, by implementing a
program on an existing structure (as in this case, special education and
common education) the limitations that this structure imposes should be analyzed in depth
And how to overcome these barriers. In particular, the roles and functions of each
One of the intervening actors.
10.2 - When designing a program it is necessary to have mechanisms that ensure the
consideration of transversal themes (such as gender issues) that may have
a significant interaction with the problem that the program seeks to solve.
10.3 - The previous experience that the inclusion centers possessed did not ensure a
Complete implementation of the program. Common work agreements and dialogue between
Different actors seem to be priority when it comes to reducing this disparity.
10.4 - The transformation of special schools to resource centers requires changes
deeper than those that can be obtained from the commitment of the addresses of
The centers. For this, a public policy decision is necessary at the level of the system of
Transform special schools into resource centers.
10.5 - There is a clear unsatisfied demand from teachers to receive training in
Inclusive education. The component implemented by the program was useful but partial; is
necessary to design a broader and more sustainable solution over time.
10.6 - The social environmental component was well valued by the network actors in those
cases in which they could access and contribute to the community that integrates the school
Inclusion is properly worked.
10.7 - The accessibility component should have been planned more homogeneously
For the entire network instead of trusting existing mechanisms, but did not ensure their
implementation.
10.8 - The evaluation and monitoring component must be integrated from the beginning of the program and

11. Recommendations
From the evaluation carried out, a series of recommendations arise that can contribute
To maximize the tasks that the network has drawn. For the description the same is used
Logic that conclusions. Each of the 10 recommendations presented is described
as directed and related to the design, implementation or results of the
Red, as well as the conclusion and lesson learned from which they emerge.
While the focus of the recommendations is aimed at the Mandela Network, also
They can be thought of as supplies to contribute to establish an inclusive national policy
that guarantees the right to quality education for all children.
11.1 Define and disseminate the roles/functions of the different actors that make up the network
and establish objectives for the short, medium and long term.
Based on conclusions 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 and lessons learned 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3
In the short term, the Mandela Network Coordinating Board is recommended to define objectives
in the short, medium and long term, in order to establish the necessary activities for its
compliance. In this sense, other changes that are not
contemplated so far or include components that have not been implemented such as those of
Accessibility, monitoring and evaluation or gender perspective.
In the short term, it is substantive that the National Technical Inspection and National Inspection
of special education clearly define what are the roles and responsibilities that, in the
frame frame, correspond to special education and which to common education, as well as
Homogeneize the work of both actors in their participation of the Network. In this necessary
Definition of roles and functions, the development of common strategies becomes indispensable
that, in turn, are adjusted to territorial needs. This seems priority,
Above all, in regard to consolidating the transformation of special schools to centers
of resources. In this way, these responsibilities would be contributed between
Special Education and Common Education, together with optimizing network work.
Likewise, it is understood pertinent to expand the support devices with which the
schools (eg technical).
In the short term and referring to enhancing the dissemination and clarity of communication, as well as
tend to the homogenization of objectives and activities to achieve them, it is important that
both UNICEF, as the Coordinating Table of the Mandela Network and the Education Council
Initial and primary generate a reference document and consultation of the program. It is recommended
that this document collects all design elements and that thus officiates as
Consultation material for all actors and is an input for work on aspects
of inclusive education in schools. The network coordinating table is recommended to the Coordinating Table
Mandela that this reference and consultation document is accompanied by a
systematization and dissemination of good practices. As a way of tending to coordinate and
111
equate the different degrees of implementation offered by the network, as well as contribute to the
knowledge of the expected objectives, it would be advisable to generate a systematization and
Dissemination of good practices in all program components: social-environmental,
pedagogical and accessibility. This could be done in several ways, one of them could
be through the evaluation component, as well as other mechanisms that already uses the
Network (newsletters, rooms, videoconferences, sizes, etc.). To do this, it is also necessary,
deepen coordination work between special education and common education, in a way
of strengthening participation and commitment to inclusive education.
In this clarification of roles and functions, in the short term the inspection is recommended
National Technical and National Inspection of Special Education work on the modalities of
Call The previous experience that the centers in inclusion possess seems to be
central when receiving invitation to be part of the network. That is why it is believed
pertinent work on the modalities of call, attending to possible biases
that can arise in the selection, so as not to generate exclusions in places where
The presence of the network is necessary. This could be done through a call and
Entry to the most exhaustive network, which takes into account the trajectory of schools in matters
of educational inclusion, in order to have more elements when establishing the
Access from a school to the program. In this way, from the beginning, said
Information to establish concrete actions. Thus, actions could be established
specific call for those schools that do not have a trajectory of inclusion and
that have not expressed interest in participating in the network.
11.2 Strengthen the process of transformation of special schools to centers of
resources
Based on conclusion 9.5 and lesson learned 10.4
Inequities have been identified in the support provided by the program for work with children
and girls with disabilities. The support and resources of the program are concentrated in schools
common and, for this reason, special education classroom teachers do not
visualize greater differences in the daily work of the resource centers regarding
work they had been developing before belonging to the Network. For this, it is recommended to the
Coordinating table of the Mandela Network, strengthen in the short term the resource centers,
so that, in this way, you can work more thoroughly in the possibilities of trajectories
from special education to common education. Specific workshops can be held in
Special schools, concrete formations, exchange days, in way of
Contribute to provide response and accompaniment to this need for the Special School.
Since a broad proportion of efforts and responsibilities fall on education
Special, in the short term it is recommended to the National Technical Inspection and Inspection
Special to carry out actions to balance these responsibilities in order to
Optimize network work. For example, provide support to the existing structure that allow
incorporate activities and grant support to the institutional structure through
112
Specific accompaniments, as well as expand support devices (eg technical)
with those who count the special schools. In this deepening of the work of
coordination between special and common education, in the short term, it is recommended
Local coordination meetings between department schools. Would tend to
Strengthen participation and commitment to inclusive education.
In this task of strengthening special schools in the center of
resources and, to the extent that inspectors are a key actor in implementation,
It understands pertinent to continue deepening the work in inspector agreement, as well as the
exchange to expand the work of the network. In this sense, it is recommended in the short
TECHNICAL TECHNICAL INSPECTION AND SPECIAL INSPECTION, GENERATE AND ALL
determined of meetings in the year, in which the specific theme to be treated is that of the
Grid.
11.3 Strengthen training in inclusive education and disseminate the inclusion paradigm
as support and accompaniment to the teaching role
Based on conclusion 9.6 and lesson learned 10.5
Meanwhile, the role of teachers is key in the inclusion process that seeks to generate the network,
In the short term, the Institute for Training in Service, Potential and
Deepen the process of training, updating and awareness of educational practices
inclusive of teachers.
Meanwhile, teacher training is essential to achieve the tasks pursued by
Red, without neglecting the importance of training with Flacso, would be appropriate
Incorporate inclusive education as a transversal issue in the basic training of
Teachers For this, in the medium and long term, the normal institutes of
Magisterium_ CFE, as well as the generation of alliances with CFE, as well as with others
teacher training institutions of the country, in order to incorporate the theme of
gradual way in teaching plans, either through seminars, courses, etc.
In this task of promoting the central role of training in the incorporation of the
teachers of the inclusion paradigm, it is recommended to generate actions aimed at
the dissemination of the educational inclusion paradigm among all the actors in the Network. either to
through the coordination of the workshops, optimization of planning, themes,
frequencies, implementation and availability of workshops in territory, dissemination and information
prior to the topics that will be worked, etc. The dissemination of the inclusion paradigm
educational can be carried out through the development of new and different activities of
training, the creation of commissions of families, congresses, assemblies of children, etc.,
or others not yet implemented and specific depending on the local reality. These activities
would allow to improve participation, in order to incorporate and reach more actors, as well as
establish more formed, sensitized actors, central aspects to provide better
Attention to the disability situations that schools face.
113
11.4 Strengthen the teaching exchange with different actors from the educational community and
local actors
Based on conclusions 9.5, 9.7 and lessons learned 10.4 and 10.6
It is recommended to generate more teacher exchanges spaces, for example, through a
Expansion of joint work rooms or instances, between education teachers
Special and common education. In order to contribute to this exchange of capacities and
experiences, it would be desirable for these links to be made regardless of the
teachers are in charge of boys and girls with disabilities.
In the medium term, it is recommended to the coordinating table of the Mandela Network, to think about the
Generation and articulation of alliances with other key actors that do not participate today. HE
recommends improving participation and try to reach more actors, enhanced the work of the
Network through exchange and relationships with different actors of society both
national level as at the local level, for example, calling: health teams, intendances,
Other institutions that work in disability at the local level, enjoyable schools,
Pronadis, snic, etc.
11.5 Generate a monitoring and evaluation system
Based on conclusion 9.9 and lesson learned 10.8
Monitoring and evaluation activities are central to provide clarity in all
stages of the network. To follow up on the objectives set by the network, carry out the
registration of activities, as well as to make adjustments according to the needs arisen
In the implementation, as well as to assess and know if the expected results have been met
or not. To do this, the General CEIP is recommended in the short term, actions aimed at
constitute an area or people who are in charge of this task. Either to raise awareness
in the schools and actors of the network about the importance of registration, as well as
of the generation of instruments according to the needs, objectives and activities of the network.
The incorporation of monitoring and evaluation activities would allow, among other aspects,
Know clearly the number of children with disabilities included in schools
common, its characteristics and needs. Therefore, it is a key aspect for futures
Network developments, as well as for the possibility of expansion and effective distribution of
The necessary resources.
11.6 Generate and establish the accessibility component
Based on conclusion 9.8 and lesson learned 10.7
Meanwhile this component has not been systematically developed or developed and
homogeneous, in the short term it is recommended to the ANEP Infrastructure Department,
Define and establish stages of implementation of the accessibility component, as well as the
114
Creation of a direct responsible for its implementation and development. This is fundamental,
because at present this depends on the will of the schools to incorporate
Changes in infrastructure from the cans you can.
11.7 Incorporate gender perspective in all program components
Based on conclusion 9.2 and lesson learned 10.2
In the short term it is recommended to the Directorate of Human Rights of the Board of Directors
Central, Anep gender network, the incorporation of gender perspective in all
Components and stages of the program. This would determine if there are differences in the
Situation of boys and girls and in case of existing, being able to address them. You could get a better
understanding of the family situations of children with disabilities, as well as
Provide better attention within the framework of the objectives that the program seeks to achieve. By
On the other hand, it would allow families to accompany the most equitable distribution of care to
that do not fall on women.
11.8 Deepen the knowledge of local realities that allow development
of strategies adjusted to territorial needs and the coupling of these to the
General program structure
Based on conclusion 9.9 and lesson learned 10.8
In the short term, it is recommended to the coordinating table of the Mandela Network, to incorporate into the
program a specific look that diagnoses, attends and deepens the knowledge of
local realities (eg geographical distribution) that can work for barriers to the
implementation (eg the filing of actors in territory and the difficulty for transfers in
said departments). This is a priority to address territorial differences and
heterogeneous attention that occurs according to the town in which the network is
Find. Therefore, the development of strategies that allow the definition of roles and
responsibilities, the development of strategies adjusted to territorial needs, the
training and demand attention is a priority. Include local specificities in the
network frame, while being able to incorporate them into a common framework that structures them and
coordinate, it is fundamental, since they have been identified as one of the main
differentiating aspects in implementation.
11.9 Generate roles to enhance family accompaniment
Based on conclusion 9.7 and lesson learned 10.6
As a way to enhance satisfaction by families in their experience with the network,
It is recommended to continue and deepen the supported support. At this point, in the medium
term, it is recommended either with the local referents of the Mandela Network, as well as with the
Enjoyable school teams, the creation of specific figures and roles for the
family accompaniment could be an alternative to value in the framework of providing
115
To this need. In order to have actors that can guide and accompany them in the
educational process and decision -making.
11.10 Establish actions that allow better planning and implementation of
Workshops with students and families
Based on conclusion 9.7 and lesson learned 10.6
In the medium term, the network coordinating table and IIDI are recommended to improve in the
Aspects related to the planning, frequencies and availability of workshops in territory. This
It involves generating articulation and alliances with other key actors that do not participate today, perform
actions aimed at increasing families in workshops (dissemination,
Information of themes that will be worked, etc.), as well as enhance the dissemination and
awareness through the different activities of the program (workshops, commissions of
Parents, congresses, children's assemblies, etc.). It is necessary to deepen the work
foster the participation of families who do not have children with disabilities, etc.) as well
like other activities that promote the participation and collaboration of the community with the
School (for example, in aspects such as accessibility, building adaptation, etc.).
