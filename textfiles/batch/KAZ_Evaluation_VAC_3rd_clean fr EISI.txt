system for prevention and response to violence against children
Executive summary
Objective, object, and process of the evaluation
The overall purpose of the evaluation is to assess to what extent the undertaken reforms in
Kazakhstan from 2011 to 2020 have contributed to strengthening the system for the
prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of children, as well as to examine
enabling conditions and bottlenecks that will require further improvement.
The object of the evaluation is the Kazakh system for the prevention and response to
violence, abuse, and neglect of children. The evaluation used the definition of violence
against children (VAC) as in Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of which
Kazakhstan is a State Party: violence against children (VAC) includes physical, emotional,
sexual violence as well as negligent treatment. According to UNICEF, the goal of a system for
the prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of children is that all children,
both girls and boys, grow up with greater freedom from all forms of violence and those who
do experience violence benefit from greater access to care, support and other services
needed to ensure physical, mental, and social well-being. Preventing and responding to VAC
is one of the goals of a national child protection system (CPS). A CPS comprises formal and
informal structures, functions, and capacities, that cut across ministerial competencies and
include both public and societal actors. Thus, a key feature of a CPS is its multisectoral nature
that gathers its impact by integrating the competencies and actions of different duty-
bearers. The strength of a CPS derives from fostering the interaction of its components,
namely (1.) laws and policies, (2.) governance structure, (3.) a continuum of services from
primary and secondary prevention to response, (4.) data collection, monitoring and
oversight, (5.) human and financial and infrastructure resources, (6.) social participation and
norms.
The evaluation is conceived as a formative evaluation. It is meant to inform the future
government strategy concerning preventing and responding to VAC, as derived from the
obligation of the CRC and to SDG target 16.2 of the Agenda 2030. Specifically, is it meant to
identify priorities for short-term and mid-term action by the whole of government as led by
the President of the Republic and coordinated by the Prime Minister and by the respective
ministries, namely, MoES, MoIA, MoJ, MoLSP, MoPH as well as the Judiciary. It is also meant
to inform implementation at subnational level, by oblast administration and municipal
governments. Furthermore, the evaluation shall guide the future action of UNICEF in
Kazakhstan. Finally, nongovernmental organizations shall benefit from the evidence.
The evaluation’s timeframe covers the period from 2011 to 2020. In 2011, the Child Protection
System did not exist as such and was based on a pre-1991 Soviet model, relying heavily on
institutionalisation and with an under-developed children’s services sector. Child Protection
was used as a generic term to cover any support and welfare services provided to children as
well as the administrative process associated with the arranging, monitoring, funding, and
delivering of those services. The main legal basis in 2011 was constituted by the Law on
Special Social Services adopted in 2008, which, however, lacked secondary regulation for its
implementation. In 2011, the governance structure of child protection was fragmented and

there was limited availability of child protection services, while those available were not
meeting international standards.
Methodology. The study is based both on an extensive review of secondary sources, a
legislative and policy review, as well as primary research tools. A methodological choice was
taken to base the primary investigation in this evaluation principally on qualitative tools, such
as interviews, focus discussion groups and case studies. A refined set of research questions
were defined in an evaluation matrix that is composed of 20 research questions, including
indicators and sources for verification. As a key structuring principle, the CPS components
have been chosen rather than the standard evaluation criteria (relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, coherence, sustainability, and impact). The report is structured against these 20
research questions.
The research was commissioned by the Kazakh Human Rights Commissioner and UNICEF.
These organizations managed the relation to the Evaluation Reference Group (ERG). The ERG
is composed of a cross-section of line ministries, representatives from public institutions as
well as child rights activists and non-governmental service providers. The ERG had been
involved in three strategic moments of the research, namely in the Inception phase when
defining the focus and methodology (January 2021), in the definition of the theory of change
after presenting the interim findings (June 2021), and the validation of the final report
(September 2021).
Children were not interviewed for the research. A comprehensive ethics review was
conducted, and approval was obtained by UNICEF´s ethical review board. The evaluation
team ensured full protection of the participants in the evaluation and has applied the ethical
standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis. No disclosure of ongoing
violence or abuse happened during the evaluation. The evaluators declare to have no conflict
of interest.
Key findings
The CPS in Kazakhstan has made remarkable progress in the last 10 years. These are
noticeable in the high number of national laws, policies, protocols, and standard operating
procedures that have been adopted and/or are under discussion at the time of writing.
It is equally evident that these reforms haven’t been driven by a common vision and plan to
adequately address violence against children. They have the initiative of individual sectors
(health, education, and law enforcement in particular) but without enough cross-sectoral
consultation, coordination and learning.
The CPS as a concept was not there in 2011 and 2021 is still little or differently understood by
policymakers, officials, and professionals. Secondly, it is still too fragmented to be able to
provide to children at risk or victims of violence the multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary
support that they need to avoid or repair the experience of violence.
The evaluation found evidence of delays, bottlenecks, and opportunities for further
strengthening each of the six components of the CPS (see individual sections below). But it
also confirmed the findings from the inception phase according to which two components
require priority investment and attention by the President and the Government: these are (1)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
9
system for prevention and response to violence against children
the component of prevention and response services and (2) the component on governance
at central and sub-national level.
Strengthening and establishing new services is urgently needed as the ones that exist do
provide some bits and pieces of prevention, support and rehabilitation. But they result in a
piecemeal approach that does not guarantee full coverage of needs, across age groups,
gender, situation of vulnerabilities and access across all territory. Specialised and integrated
services for child victims of violence, including sexual violence, do not exist.
Strengthening the governance of the CPS is equally urgent, both at central and sub-national
levels. The responsibility for developing, implementing, evaluating policies, programmes,
and services on violence against children still sit within each line-ministries and this has not
provided for strong enough accountability and execution of policies.
The CPS in Kazakhstan is still too fragmented and built on sectors in a siloed way. Several
components of it have been strengthened during the last decade that demonstrates that
Kazakhstan is on the right track to bring those pieces under a clearer and unified framework
and vision.
Laws and policies
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in introducing legislation prohibiting
violence in schools, childcare and penal institutions.
In terms of prohibition, the Kazakh legislation is quite comprehensive in protecting children
from physical and sexual violence. Nevertheless, it presents two main gaps: (1) it still lacks
definitions of child abuse, mental violence, abuse, insult, bullying and self-harm; and (2)
Corporal punishment is still lawful at home, in pre-school day care centres for older children.
In terms of the legal basis for prevention and response services, besides the development of
several sectoral laws that have established services for children, there are still some gaps: (1)
the experience of violence, abuse and neglect does not trigger direct eligibility for special
social services but only if violence leads to social deprivation and social maladjustment; (2)
specialised services for child victims of violence de facto do not exist under the law.
Fighting violence against children has become a national policy priority in the last five years.
The second half of the decade has seen the adoption of several sectoral policies (on social
development, on public health, on education) that set the agenda to further develop and
modernise the country until 2025. Nevertheless, policies have followed sectoral siloes and
have left the system fragmented. Fighting domestic violence has received the most attention
and a cross-sectoral one; nevertheless, it de-facto focuses on women and not really on
women and children. As of 2021, Kazakhstan does not have a centralised and unifying policy
on child protection/violence against children.
Governance
In Kazakhstan, the governance of the CPS has not evolved much from 2011. Although multiple
laws and policies were adopted in the last decade, these have been the initiatives by
individual sectors in a siloed way. As in 2021, there is no single central government body
responsible for setting state policies on child protection /violence against children. This has
continued to result in a segmented approach with fragmented sectoral initiatives: multiple
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
10
system for prevention and response to violence against children
agencies develop and implement programmes without sufficient collaboration and
coordination resulting in gaps.
Unlike Child Protection, gender issues and violence against women have been better
coordinated at the central level. The Commission on Gender, Family and Demographic
Policies has contributed to the adoption of the Concept of Family and Gender Policy till 2030.
Many stakeholders used the Commission on Gender as a good example of effective multi-
sectoral coordination, while also recognising its limitation in resources and capacities.
The lack of coordination at the national level is transposed at the sub-national level. Although
the evaluation found some anecdotal evidence of increased cooperation between health,
education, social protection, law enforcement agencies and NGOs, this cooperation is
voluntary, depending on the goodwill of professionals and not based on cross-sectoral
protocols or memorandum of understanding.
At the local level, the delivery of child protection services is carried out in a fragmented way
and follows sectoral lines. There are several bodies responsible for delivering the services to
children and their families but none of them has a coordinating function. The only official
body with a mandated function for coordination is the multi-sectoral Commissions on Minor’s
Affairs. Nevertheless, its role is limited to assessing the need for the alternative care of
children and out-of-home placement.
Two informants stressed that coordination works a little better at the local level as all
sectoral departments work under the executive bodies of Akimats and Oblast administration
and therefore the accountability is stronger. This is something that would need further
research.
Prevention and Response Services
The Law on Special Social Services (2008) created the legal basis for the development of
social services for children and families. Several specialised social services were created in
the last decade and across services, but very few of them with the prevention or response to
VAC as the central objective.
In the prevention of violence against children, the notable exceptions are the universal
patronage nurses introduced in 2017 and the piloting of the whole-school violence prevention
programmes in 2014 (which was discontinued because of lack of funding). This has resulted
in a piecemeal approach that presents overlaps (for example between youth health centres
and youth resource centres, of between school psychologists and school pedagogues) and
overlooked areas such as parenting programmes. At the same time school programmes
directed at prevention offer resources to school administration and psychologists to
incorporate violence prevention lessons into the existing school curriculum, but their
capacity seems to be limited by an approach that is perceived to be stigmatising and punitive
and sheading bad reputation on schools. Targeted social assistance has been introduced and
strengthened, nevertheless, it is not accompanied by any violence prevention in family or
parent support.
When it comes to response services, specialised services for child victims of violence are very
rare in Kazakhstan, both in terms of availability and coverage. Support services for child
victims of violence (treatment, psycho-social and mental health, recovery, and reintegration)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
11
system for prevention and response to violence against children
are mainly residential, are provided both by NGOs and the State. They only provide support
to children who are eligible for them but not to their parents or siblings if they would need
it. There is a small number of crisis centres – both state and private – available for women
victims of violence, that potentially offer service for girls, but they de-facto are primarily
targeted at women.
Oversight and monitoring, quality of services
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has taken considerable steps to develop its national surveillance
system on violence against children. With the support from UN agencies, it carried out
several nationally representative surveys (amongst them MICS, VAW, and HBSC).
Surveillance using criminal and administrative data has nevertheless lagged, and little
progress has been made since 2011. As of 2020, Kazakhstan, besides the collection of criminal
data, still lacks national standards and indicators for collecting data on VAC and no inter-
agency protocols to facilitate the sharing of administrative data across sectors and ministries,
agencies, and services providers.
Human Rights Institutions established in Kazakhstan has played a significant role in
monitoring and exposing the status of violence against children in Kazakhstan. Although not
fully compliant with the Paris Principle, the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights has
been championing the issue of violence against children in state-run institutions, in schools
and lately in the family. Under the same office, the National Prevention Mechanism to
prevent torture is mandated to visit children’s institutions. Finally, a Children’s
ombudsperson was appointed in 2016, but without the necessary resources to fully exercise
its functions.
As of 2015, different line ministries have adopted quality standards and sectoral practices to
deal with the identification, referral, and support of child victims of violence. All the
standards were developed based on the Law on Special Social Services of 2008 (last
amended in 2019). Only a few of them (the most noticeable exception is the SOP on VAC for
medical staff) require the services to carry out multi-disciplinary needs assessment, develop
an individualised plan and assign a case manager to monitor it and follow it up. None of them
requests the services to consult children in the assessment of their needs and in the
identification of services that are made available to him/her.
Human and financial resources
Since the adoption of the Law on Specialised Social Services in 2008, Kazakhstan has invested
enormously in the planning, development and support of the social service workforce. It has
established the necessary legal and regulatory framework, the classifications of cadres and
other professionals, certification requirements and practice. Nevertheless, every sector has
taken its path without coordinating with other sectors or learning from similar processes.
This is particularly problematic for an area of work, such as preventing and responding to
violence against children, where the collaboration across sectors and disciplines brings
better outcomes for children than what each sector can achieve alone. Kazakhstan has the
ambition to strengthen the social sector, by building on what exists and unifying and
consolidating standards and regulatory frameworks across ministerial silos.

12
system for prevention and response to violence against children
There is emerging training on VAC by the initiative of different universities, training centres,
UN agencies and NGOs, but these are not certified and are not equally provided across all the
disciplines and grades.
The number of social workers and their case load is difficult to assess across the sectors,
given the different classifications and functions. There is nevertheless anecdotal evidence
that half of the social workers are lacking.
Finally, the social workforce across the sectors has low salaries and low status. Incentives,
performance management and supervision are unequal across the sectors.
Given the current unclear institutionalization of cross-departmental child protection services
and the lack of definition of a single minimum service package for CP, the allocation of
financial resources to the CPS cannot yet be measured rigorously. However, the government
has made substantive steps in determining the necessary budgets for each new legislative
action. In some sectors, namely education and health, Government is capable of determining
the level of investment needed. Furthermore, the new State Programme on education (2019)
commits to having a consolidated child budget. These are important steps that can be
considered as necessary preconditions to track expenditures in a defined, cross-sectorial
service package for CP, once established.
Social Participation
After the 2007-2011 Programme “Children of Kazakhstan”, there hasn’t been any national
framework or vision on children and youth participation in Kazakhstan. Although there have
been initiatives to consult children and youth at the local level, these have still to be
institutionalised and given a formal framework and importance.
In 2011 there was no evidence of the recognition that in Kazakhstan children experienced
violence at home, in schools, in state institutions and the community. However, since the
mid-2010s thanks to the efforts of UNICEF and the National Human Rights Centre, there is an
emerging discussion about the importance of social norms affecting VAC. Knowledge,
attitudes, and practices on violence against children in families have been assessed twice
(2016 and 2020) and although there are some persisting patterns in support of violence to
discipline and control children, there have also been some positive changes in the reduction
of the use of physical violence by parents. Nevertheless, in 2020, there is still 33% of child
protection professionals who support the use of corporal punishment to discipline and
control children.
Recommendations
The evaluation highlighted that there are two components of the CPS that need substantive
and urgent strengthening: these are the component on prevention and response services
(component 3) and the component on governance (component 2). These are the
components that are lagging behind, relatively to the others, and that would require major
reform and investment of capacities and resources to ensure better protection of children
from all forms of violence. These are also the components that require strong political will
and major incentives to make the CPS truly cross-sectoral and child-centred.

13
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The other 4 components (Laws and policies; monitoring and oversight; human and financial
resources; participation and norms) also present weaknesses and bottlenecks that need to
be addressed. Many of the required changes are nevertheless supportive, pre-requisites or
consequences of the reforms needed in services and governance. This is consistent with a
systems approach, in which the collective strength of various system components is
important for the functioning of the system as a whole.
The recommendations are organised per CPS components, starting with those on services
and governance and following with the others. Each recommendation is accompanied by
medium and short-term actions that are detailed at the end of the report.

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

system for prevention and response to violence against children
Introduction:
This evaluation report responds to the assignment commissioned to Fresno to conduct a
formative evaluation of the system for prevention and response to violence against children
in Kazakhstan.1 The overall purpose of the evaluation is to assess to what extent the
undertaken reforms in Kazakhstan have contributed to strengthening the system for the
prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of children, as well as to examine
enabling conditions and bottlenecks that will require further improvement.2This chapter lays
out the object of the evaluation and its purpose.
As per the TORs, the specific evaluation objectives of the evaluation are the following:
• To examine relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability
of the state interventions aimed at prevention and response to VAC; state
interventions include laws, policies, regulatory frameworks and programmes
implementing them; all together they constitute the child protection system.
• To assess the changes and advancements in the national child protection system for
prevention and response to violence against children compared to the situation
mapped in the 2011 study (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011): such as regulatory framework,
infrastructure, governance and coordination, procedures, services, workforce, gaps,
weaknesses, accomplishments;
• To assess the sustainability of the strategies applied and interventions conducted to
strengthen the national CPS for prevention and response to violence against
children.
• To draw lessons learnt and inform policy formulation to create a foundation for an
integrated national CPS in support of family and child well-being, response to
violence and harmful practices against children.
• To assess the extent to which the relevant interventions were implemented with
equity and gender lenses.
It is expected that the evaluation establishes a new baseline against which the Government
can assess the progress towards the prevention of and response to all forms of violence
against children in a regular way and through a better inter-connected system that has a
common vision but shared responsibilities across multiple sectors and agencies.
In particular, the evaluation will inform the implementation of the relevant national policies
related to violence against children, including the 2030 National Concept of Social
Development, the 2030 Family and Gender Policy Concept, the implementation of the SDGs
and especially those under SGD 16 as well as the next State Report of the Government of
Kazakhstan to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. The evaluation will also inform
the new UNICEF and Government of Kazakhstan country programme 2021-2025.

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
16
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Background of the evaluation
This chapter describes the background of the evaluation, including the object and scope of
the evaluation, the baseline, and the evaluation governance structure with the evaluation
reference group (ERG).
The object of the evaluation
The object of the evaluation is the Kazakh system for the prevention and response to
violence, abuse, and neglect of children. The evaluation’s timeframe covers the period from
2011 to 2020.
The evaluation used the definition of violence against children as in Article 19 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child of which Kazakhstan is a State Party: violence against
children includes physical, emotional, sexual violence as well as negligent treatment (UN
CRC, 1989, 2011).3
The goal of a system for the prevention and response to violence, abuse, and neglect of
children is that
“All girls and boys, including adolescents and those living in situations of vulnerability,
grow up with greater freedom from all forms of violence; and those who do experience
violence benefit from greater access to care, support and other services needed to
ensure physical, mental and social well-being”. (UNICEF, 2017a, p. 20)
As definition of the child protection system (CPS), the evaluation used the widely shared
UNICEF’s definition.
“Certain formal and informal structures functions and capacities that have been
assembled to prevent and respond to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of
children. A child protection system is generally agreed to be comprised of the following
components: human resources, finance, laws and policies, governance, monitoring and
data collection as well as protection and response services and care management. It also
includes different actors – children, families, communities – those working at sub-
national or national level and those working internationally. Most important are the
relationships and interactions between and amongst these components and these
actors within the system. It is the outcomes of these interactions that comprise the
system” (UNICEF, 2018b)
Hence, within the field of violence prevention and response, there is rarely a narrow, vertical
chain of results linking a single strategy to a single output, outcome and impact/goal. This
3 Examples of physical violence include homicide of children, assault against children and corporal
punishment of children. Examples of emotional violence include humiliating and rejecting a child,
psychological or emotional neglect, psychological bullying, witnessing domestic violence or being
exposed to violent experiences. Examples of sexual violence include sexual abuse of a child (including
rape, sexual touching of a child and non-physical sexual acts against a child) and sexual exploitation of
a child (for prostitution, for child sexual abuse material, sexual grooming). Examples of neglect include
physical neglect (failure to provide food, shelter, clothing), neglect of a child physical and mental
health, educational neglect and abandonment (UN CRC, 2011).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
17
system for prevention and response to violence against children
approach recognises the importance of strengthening child protection as a system,
supported by multi-sectoral coordination and broader social change (UNICEF, 2017a).
A CPS has two specific foci: one on prevention and one on response.
The child protection system is understood to be made up of six components.
Table 1: Components of a Child Protection System
CPS Component Dimensions
1. Laws and policies the legal and regulatory framework, as well as
specific policies related to child protection
2. Governance structure effective governance structures, including
coordination across government departments,
between levels of decentralization and between
formal and informal actors
3. A continuum of services spanning prevention and response

Budgeting, investment, financial reporting
6. Social participation and norms Including respect for children’s views, and an aware
and supportive public
Baseline in 2011
In order to reconstruct a baseline, the 2011 UNICEF report has been analysed as suggested in
the TORs. The review of the report according to the six components of the Child Protection
System, as defined by UNICEF and included in the TORs, reveals the following:
Concept of Child Protection: In 2011, the Child Protection System was still based on a pre-1991
Soviet model, relying heavily on institutionalisation and with an under-developed children’s
services sector. Child Protection was used as a generic term to cover any support and welfare
services provided to children as well as the administrative process associated with the
arranging, monitoring, funding and delivering of those services. This was assessed as not
being in line with article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNICEF Kazakhstan,
2011).
Legislation and policy: In terms of legislation, the main legal basis in 2011 was constituted by
the Law on Special Social Services adopted in 2008. The law nevertheless had not been fully
implemented, it needed secondary legislation to go beyond the two pilot projects (Carolyn
Hamilton;Awaz Raoof, 2014; Commissioner for Human Rights RoK et al., 2013) that were put
in place and a proper coordination framework to overcome the fragmentation of services at
the local level. When it comes to national level policies, the report also points to the lack of a
central policy on child protection setting the basis for child protection services targeted at
children at risk of abuse. (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
Governance and intersectoral coordination: In 2011, the governance structure of child
protection was fragmented and fragile, both at the national and local levels. At the national
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
18
system for prevention and response to violence against children
level, the responsibility for child protection was diffused across several ministries without a
single central government body responsible for setting policies of child protection, standards
for the delivery of child protection services or for monitoring or inspecting them. This
fragmentation was also reflected at the local level with mandates of various bodies
overlapping and lacking clarity. This was particularly the case for the Guardianship Authority
within the Akimat and the Oblast level Department of Child Protection Reporting to the
central Government Committee for Child Protection (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
Child protection services: In 2011, there was limited availability of child protection services
and those available were not meeting international standards. The main form of services to
provide child protection were institutions (baby homes, children’s homes and internats).
Foster care in the communities had only recently started and there were very few family-
support services. There was a lack of any referral system in most local areas across the
existing services. (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
Oversight and Monitoring: Very little data on the scale and nature of violence against
children was collected and available in 2011 and there was no central database in 2011 (UNICEF
Kazakhstan, 2011).
Human resources: Finally, the report also mentioned insufficient numbers of staff across the
various child protection bodies who were trained social workers. In 2011, there was an over-
reliance on the Police Department of Minors as well as no viable social work course across
the different universities assessed (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
Key stakeholders and evaluation uptake
The evaluation is conceived as a formative evaluation of Kazakhstan’s CPS and its response
to and the prevention of violence against children (VAC). The formative character was
ensured by a participatory mechanism – the evaluation reference group (ERG) – that involved
a range of stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental. The members of the
ERG were identified by the commissioning parties of the evaluation, namely the Human
Rights Commissioner and UNICEF, based on the set of competencies ascribed to them, in the
case of government, and according to their track record in action on child protection in the
case of NGOs.4
The ERG was involved at three strategic points of the evaluation, namely
(1) Discussion of the framing of concept and the device of methodology by reviewing
the Inception report: The Inception Report underwent a three-phased process of
feedback by UNICEF, both country and regional office, the ERG and the ethical review
facility of UNICEF. A presentation of the methodology and the conceptual framework
was given to the ERG on the 2nd of February 2021. The presentation and the list of
participants are annexed.
(2) A participatory formulation of a forward-looking ‘theory of change’: After closing
the field research and a preliminary analysis of data, the evaluation team conducted
a participatory workshop in online mode over the days of the 22nd and 23rd of June.
The workshop schedule, presentations and outcomes are documented in the Annex.
4 A comprehensive listo f the members of the ERG is reproduced in the Annex.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
19
system for prevention and response to violence against children
(3) Revision and validation of the Draft Evaluation Report (DER) – the evaluation report
underwent a four-phased process of quality assurance and participatory review,
composed of an internal revision by UNICEF, both country and regional office (2nd
Draft), a revision and validation by the ERG which is supported by a presentation on
02/09/2021 (3rd Draft), and a final quality assurance by the UNICEF QA facility.
The evaluation is particularly timely as it took stock of the multiple legal and policy reforms
that the Government of Kazakhstan has undertaken in the last 10 years, identifies how the
Government can further strengthen and integrate the CPS, in all its components and
administrative levels, through the identification of priority areas for further reform and
action for 2021-2030.
The evaluation is meant to inform the future government strategy to preventing and
responding to VAC, as derived from the obligation of the CRC and to SDG target 16.2 of the
Agenda 2030. The CRC enacts specific rights for children, both girls and boys, amongst which
article 19 defines the obligations of states to protect children from violence (UN CRC, 2011).
States assume obligations and duties under international law to respect, to protect and to
fulfil these child rights. The need for protection is particularly relevant for vulnerable children,
amongst which are girls, children with disabilities, children from ethnic minorities and
refugee children, as well as children in difficult socio-economic conditions such as social
exclusion and poverty. Therefore, the state as a duty bearer needs to pay specific attention
to these vulnerable groups.
Thus, the evaluation is meant to guide the duty bearers of child rights and specifically identify
priorities for short-term and mid-term action by the whole of government as led by the
President of the Republic and coordinated by the Prime Minister and by the respective
ministries, namely, MoES, MoIA, MoJ, MoLSP, MoPH as well as the Judiciary. It is also meant
to inform implementation at subnational level, by oblast administration and municipal
governments. This relation is depicted in Figure 1.

Furthermore, the evaluation shall guide the future action of UNICEF in Kazakhstan to
advocate for child rights and systematically build capacities of government and civil society
to foster and protect child rights, and childhood and adolescence free of violence in
particular. Finally, nongovernmental organizations shall benefit from the evidence exposed
in the evaluation to better conduct their roles as child rights advocates, the implementor of
services and social innovators.
The evaluation is entirely financed from funds managed by UNICEF.

Methodology
This chapter discusses the methodological design, the scope and limitations of the evaluation
and presents the redefined research questions. It also addresses ethical concerns. All
methodological choices, research tools and ethical provisions, including approval from the
Ethics Review Board (ERB) are given in more detail in the Annexes.
Methodological design
As mentioned in the background chapter, the object of the evaluation is the CPS. A
methodological choice was taken to design the evaluation approach principally based on
literature review, qualitative research with duty-bearers and case studies on services and
biographical reconstructions of victims of child abuse. The methodological design is
discussed at length in Annex A: Methodology.
As required by the TOR, the baseline for the evaluation is defined by the report “Modelling
for Integrated CPS in Kazakhstan” produced by UNICEF in 2011 (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
This report does not represent a government policy and plan. Likewise, it does not define
what a national CPS is, how it is structured, which components it entails, and how they relate
to each other. Furthermore, the report does not provide any prevalence data on VAC, nor
does it formulate an intervention logic, a results framework, and the goals set and targets
that would link public action with better protection impact. Nevertheless, it takes stock on
the status of the development of those elements in 2011 that were considered relevant to
develop a model of a CPS at the delivery level, at that time. In a scoping review during the
inception phase, the evaluation team was unable to identify in the existing governmental
policy documents a conclusive definition of the CPS in Kazakhstan as a system and a clear
vision and pathways to strengthen it to better prevent and respond to violence against
children. Such a vision would have provided for the theoretical framework upon which the
evaluation could build. Given the lack of a systematic definition of the object of the evaluation
in legislation and policy – the Kazakhstan CPS in its dealing with violence against children –
the evaluation team had proposed to use as a definition of the object of the evaluation the
global definition as provided for in the ‘Theory of Change to Prevent and Respond to Violence
against Children’, as developed by UNICEF in 2017 (UNICEF, 2017a). This had been accepted
in the inception phase by UNICEF and the ERG.
A methodological choice was taken to base the primary research in this evaluation principally
on qualitative tools. Recent research had either provided specific data which could be readily
used (UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021) or revealed the fragility of certain data sets (Haarr,
2020).
A detailed discussion of the methodology, a comprehensive list of KII and FDG by location
and sector, and a listing of tools are provided in the Annex.5 There, the evaluation matrix is
presented. It follows the standard logic of evaluation criteria, evaluation question (EQ),
indicator, and source. It is broken down according to the respective components of the CPS.
5 The evaluation matrix has not been reproduced in the main body of the report in order to safe space.
However, in the report – at the beginning of each of the sections on the CPS components – the EQ and
the respective indicator is reproduced. In order to see which tools (sources of data collection) are used
to answer which question it is still necessary to refer to the annexed Matrix.

It also specifies which evaluation criteria, as per the OECD DAC framework (OECD, 2019), is
covered by each of the evaluation questions. Each of the evaluation questions is tackled with
specific research tools and indicators. These sources of information, as per the respective
method applied, are detailed as well in the evaluation matrix.
Seven types of tools were used in the evaluation. Table 2 lists the different methods. For
systematic data collection, specific tools – such as interview guidelines or case study
templates – were developed for each of them. These are accessible in the Annex.6

The research was undertaken at central level and regional level in the Oblasts of Mangistau,
East-Kazakhstan and Turkestan, as well as in the city of Nursultan.
Table 3 lists the respective methodologies and details the number of actions undertaken. The
sampling method for both KII and FGD was purposive sampling, based on an identification of
profiles and a request to the administration channelled via UNICEF and the ERG. In the case

of duty-bearers, the request for interviews with authorities with the respective competencies
was channelled via the Human Rights Commissioner (HRC). The respective ministries
identified the specific persons to be interviewed. In the case of civil society groups, UNICEF
in cooperation with the HRC indicated the organizations and networks that are most active
and have nationwide coverage. A comprehensive list of profiles is given in Annex D: “List of
Key informants and focus group participants” and Annex G: “Participant profiles”. As
documented in the Annex, the response rate was sometimes challenging.

Scope of the evaluation and limitations
During the inception phase, the scope of the evaluation was delimited. Priority was given to
some components of the CPS over others. The following components and sub-components
have received particular attention.
- Legislation and policies (legal and policy frameworks)
- Governance structure (at the central and local level)
- A continuum of services at the local level
- Human resources at the central and local levels.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
24
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Two evaluation criteria have not been fully evaluated as originally expected in the TORs. The
first one is the criterion of efficiency: as there is no available data on the investment of public
resources in the CPS, neither in 2011 nor in the following years, it is not possible to measure
whether the CPS has been efficient in using the invested resources. The second criterion
concerns the impact of the CPS on children and their protection. As agreed during the
inception phase, these two criteria have been assessed in terms of readiness of the CPS.7
During the evaluation, the team encountered a series of limitations amongst which are:
- Confusion of terminology amongst some interlocutors between the protection of
children’s rights and the protection from violence. These were mitigated by
introducing every a general explanation of the understanding of violence against
children used in the evaluation.
- An enormous number of laws, policies, regulations, and standard operation
procedures (SOPs). They were all reviewed but there is an unequal level of detail
between them. Lately, there has been a very intense period of law-making and
regulation.8 The most recent legislative projects, in the making, could not fully be
covered and potentially some were missed.
- A lack of clarity amongst some interlocutors on the difference between public
policies, programmes, projects, and the difficulty in keeping those categories distinct
during the interviews besides the researchers attempts to keep the distinctions clear
as needed.
- A long tradition of piloting projects and uneven coverage and upscaling across the
territory. Some of the services/programmes were available for a certain number of
years in certain regions and when funding run out, they were closed, handed over
without securing capacity and sustainability. This added to the fragmentation of the
system, but also to the complexity of the evaluation.
- Public officials, particularly at local level, tended to provide a more positive
assessment of the services and coordination across them. When limitations were
identified they were very often attributed to external factors: limited mandates, lack
of responsibilities from other sectors, lack of resources etc. These potential biases
were mitigated by triangulating the information with other sources, such as
representatives of NGOs and parents as service users.
- The very broad scope and remit of the evaluation: The level of analysis could have
been much deeper on every single CPS component. But due to the limitations in time
and resources, as well as to keep with a manageable length and uptake of the report,
the evaluation team addressed all system components in equal depth and from a
strategic point of view. As explained amongst the lessons learnt in chapter 7 below,
7 “Readiness” is understood as the extent to which the child protection system is ready to set up: (a)
a baseline on the scale and prevalence of different forms of violence against children against which to
measure impact of policies and programmes in 2030. (b) a baseline measurement of actual
expenditure by the State on child protection as to be able to compare progress over time.
8 For a full list of the registered initiatives see the annex. Not all of them have entered into the
legislative review (Chap 1)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
25
system for prevention and response to violence against children
an evaluability phase would have helped reducing the scope of the evaluation
further.
- The data collection was done remotely only. Some obstacles were derived from
technological challenges, but they were overcome by using mobile devices as broadly
as possible instead of computer-based communication. The main limitation was the
lack of face-to-face communication, which imped seeing and observing services sites
and places.
- The response rate to requests for participation in KII and FDG was limited and this
was mitigated by constant follow-up calls by local researchers.
Evaluation questions
During the inception phase, the evaluation questions were redefined to a more manageable,
yet still broad scope. The annexe documents the methodological choices for the framing of
the questions and their relation to the (standard) evaluation criteria, that were undertaken
during the inception phase. Table 4 documents the specific questions. The report is
structured along with these questions.

Research ethics
Although children were not part of the research, given the sensitivity of the topic under
evaluation, a comprehensive ethics review was conducted (see annexe ZZZ). The evaluation
team ensured full protection of the participants in the evaluation and has applied the Ethical
Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis (UNICEF, 2015). No
disclosure of ongoing violence or abuse happened during the evaluation. The evaluators
declare to have no conflict of interest.

Findings

system for prevention and response to violence against children
1. Legislation and policies
Strong legal and policy frameworks are an essential component of a CPS that prevents,
prohibits, and responds to all forms of violence against children. In addition to protecting
children from harm and providing justice for the victims of violence, laws and policies may
also contribute to attitude and behaviour change in society by influencing norms about the
acceptable treatment of children (UNICEF, 2017a). Laws and policies also establish the basis
for preventing and response services across the different sectors. Finally, laws and policies
are also useful in reducing exposure to key risk factors for violence against children, by
reducing alcohol misuse and limiting youth access to firearms and weapons (WHO, 2016) and
addressing socio-economic vulnerabilities of children and their caregivers.
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in introducing legislation prohibiting
violence in certain settings such as in schools, childcare institutions and penal institutions,
reducing risks for children being subjected to violence and improving the system of social
protection for children in vulnerable situations and their families. Kazakhstan has also
committed to bring its legal and policy frameworks into accord with international human
rights agreements that it ratified, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN
CRC, 1989), the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD, 2006) and
the Convention on the Elimination on All Forms of Discrimination against Women (UN
CEDAW, 1979).
The Kazakh legislation is quite comprehensive in protecting children from physical and sexual
violence. Nevertheless, it still lacks definitions of child abuse, violence, mental violence,
abuse, insult, bullying and self-harm. (Kanatov et al., 2017; Union of Crisis Centers of
Kazakhstan, 2013).
Another gap has also been raised by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2007 and
2015 (UN CRC, 2007, 2015). Although there is a prohibition of corporal punishment in schools,
penal institutions and residential care institutions, corporal punishment is still lawful at home,
in early childhood care centres and in day care for older children (GIEACPC, 2020).
Finally, besides the development of several sectoral laws that have established services for
children, there are still some gaps: for example, under the current law, ill-treatment, neglect,
and domestic violence are not recognized as difficult life circumstances. Only if such neglect
or abuse leads to social deprivation and social maladjustment, then this situation is
recognized as difficult life circumstances and thus qualifies the victim for special social
services (Kanatov et al., 2017).
Secondly, and linked to the point above, specialised services for child victims of violence de
facto do not exist under the law.

A series of legal acts that protect children from different forms of violence were adopted
before 2011, the baseline for the current evaluation. Nevertheless, almost all of them were
amended during the decade that followed (starting from 2015 with a peak of amendments
during 2019) and is therefore within the scope of the current evaluation. The chronology of
the legal acts is illustrated in Figure 2. Their analysis is organised in four blocks: (1) prohibition
of different forms of violence; (2) Gaps and compliance with international standards (3) Legal

1.1.1. Prohibition of violence against children
According to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan (1995, last amended in 2017),
no one should be subjected to torture, violence, other cruel or degrading treatment or
punishment (Art 17.2).
In Kazakhstan, two main mechanisms are used to protect the rights and legitimate interests
of children: civil and criminal. The civil norms (such as family law, child rights law, the law on
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
32
system for prevention and response to violence against children
education, etc.) are applied in cases where the actions of the parents or other adults do not
contain signs of facts and circumstances constituting a crime (Union of Crisis Centers of
Kazakhstan, 2013).
The Law on the Rights of the Child (adopted in 2002 and amended in 2020) sets the
responsibility of the State to protect children from physical and (or) mental violence, cruel,
gross or degrading treatment of human dignity, and sexual actions (article 10). The law
nevertheless does not give definitions of these forms of violence. The law also protects
children from child prostitution (art. 40) and child pornography (art. 40.1). (GoK, 2002).
The Law on Prevention of infractions amongst the Minors and prevention of Child neglect
and homelessness (adopted in 2004 and amended several times from 2009-2019) establishes
a system of legal and pedagogical measures to prevent infractions and anti-social behaviours
by children. The law covers neglect, but it does not protect children from it, as it aims at
rehabilitating the child if s/he adopts antisocial behaviour as a consequence of neglect. The
law defines neglect as “a social phenomenon, characterized by the lack of reasonable control
over the behaviour and way of life of minors, contributing to their commission of infractions”
(art. 7). Parents, guardians, teachers and other education personnel can be held responsible
for not exercising control over children’s behaviour (art. 6). (RoK, 2004b).
The Law on Education (adopted in 2007 and amended in 2020) protect students and pupils
from physical, moral and mental violence in the context of their education (article 28.4) (RoK,
2020b).
The Law on the prevention of domestic violence (adopted in 2009 and amended several
times from 2014-2020) is the most explicit legislative act about the protection of victims of
violence taking place in home settings. Although the law has a broader scope than the
protection of children from violence, it covers all potential victims of domestic violence,
including women, girls, and boys. Article 4 of the law defines 4 types of domestic violence
and namely: physical violence, psychological violence, sexual violence and economic violence9.
(RoK, 2020a). On 23 September 2020, the plenary session of the Mazhilis of the Parliament
of the Republic of Kazakhstan adopted in the first reading with relevant amendments the
draft Law on Combating Domestic Violence. According to a key informant, these
amendments were meant to follow-up on the 2019 recommendations by the UN Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UN CEDAW, 2019) and to bring closer
alignment between national legislation and international standards (KII-C-7). The draft law
expanded on the definitions of some forms of violence: deliberate acts are intended as both
actions and omissions; sexual misconduct without violence amounts to sexual violence.
Nevertheless, the intended amendments did not seem to bring any direct expansion of the
protection of children from violence (RoK, 2021). The draft law (or what was understood to
9 Physical violence - deliberate harm to health through the use of physical force and physical pain;
Psychological violence - deliberate impact on the human psyche, humiliation of honour and dignity
through threats, insults, blackmail, or coercion (compulsion) to commit offenses or acts that pose a
threat to life or health, as well as leading to a violation of mental, physical, and personal development.
Sexual violence is a deliberate unlawful act that infringes on the sexual integrity or sexual freedom of
a person, as well as acts of a sexual nature in relation to minors. Economic violence - the deliberate
deprivation of a person's home, food, clothing, property, funds to which he has the right provided by
law (article 4) (RoK, 2020a)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
33
system for prevention and response to violence against children
be included in it) raised a lot of concerns and resistance in the population and civil society
organizations. The opposition to the new bill reached a point at which the President of
Kazakhstan – who had pledged for a broad consultation on the draft law – decided to recall
it.10 According to a key informant, an alternative to approving the law would be to introduce
amendments to the 2009 Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence rather than an entirely
new law (KII-C-7).
According to the Marriage and Family Code (adopted in 2011 and amended in 2020) parents
(including adoptive parents) as well as guardians and foster parents can be deprived of their
parental authority over his/her child if they abuse a child, including carrying out of a physical
or mental act of outrage against him/her, entrench upon his/her sexual immunity (article 75.4
and 106.4) (GoK, 2011); (KII-G-2).
Kazakhstani Criminal Code (adopted in 2014, last amended in 2019) contains a separate
chapter "Crimes against family and minors", which includes 10 corpus delicti that can be
committed against children11. The criminal code provides for liability for almost all types of
physical and sexual abuse of children. Nevertheless, of the possible forms of mental violence,
only the threat of murder or grievous bodily harm, or driving to suicide is punished (Union of
Crisis Centers of Kazakhstan, 2013). In 2015 and 2019, several amendments were brought to
the Criminal Code (art. 120 and 121) and to the Code of Administrative Offences (adopted in
2014 and amended in 2017 and 2019) to increase liability for the sexual and economic
exploitation of children (UN CRC, 2015) (KII-G-2) as well as for domestic violence (art. 43.2 and
57). Nevertheless, the aggravating factors for domestic violence do not consider the fact that
the victim is underage (KII-G-2). Currently, the Senate discusses a draft law to introduce new
amendments to improve the criminal procedures and prosecution of sexual violence against
children. According to the draft law, the minimum prison term for rape, sexual abuse,
corruption of minors and child pornography should be increased to 20 years (RoK, 2019a).
Finally, a group of parliamentarians started working in January 2021 on draft legislation on
changes and additions to the legislation concerning child protection (Senate Kaz, 2020). This
legislation intends to bring changes to the Penal Code, the Labour Code, the Law on Child
Rights from 2002, and the Law on prevention of crimes by minors and prevention of child
neglect and homelessness from 2004. The expected changes would concern adding new
typologies of crimes committed by minors (“suicide attempt by a minor”, “violation of safety
of minors”) and protecting children from sexual violence. According to two key informants,
this draft law could constitute an opportunity to advance the protection of children from
violence (KII-G-2 and KII-G-3).
1.1.2. Gaps and compliance with international norms
Kazakhstan, being a member of the UN, builds up the national legislation of the Republic of
Kazakhstan based on international legislation and the obligations assumed to fulfil them. In
1994, the Republic of Kazakhstan ratified the Convention "On the Rights of the Child" (UN
CRC, 1989) which served as a serious claim for the state to ensure the protection of children's
10 See chapter 5 for further details
11 Art. 122 - sexual intercourse and other actions of a sexual nature with a person under the age of
sixteen; Art. 124 - corruption of minors; Art. 134 – Involvement of a in prostitution ; Art. 135 - trafficking
in minors (Penal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, 2014)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
34
system for prevention and response to violence against children
rights. (Union of Crisis Centers of Kazakhstan, 2013). Kazakhstan has regularly reported to
the Committee on the Rights of the Child on its compliance with the Convention. The latest
time was in 2015 (UN CRC, 2015).
The Kazakh legislation is quite comprehensive in protecting children from physical and sexual
violence. Nevertheless, it still lacks definitions of child abuse, violence, abuse, insult, bullying
and self-harm. Legislative norms are sometimes declarative and do not have an
implementation mechanism. (Kanatov et al., 2017; Union of Crisis Centers of Kazakhstan,
2013).
Another gap has also been raised by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2007 and
2015 (UN CRC, 2007, 2015). Although there is a prohibition of violence on all levels, at home,
at school, in the institutions, corporal punishment is not explicitly prohibited (GIEACPC,
2017).
It would seem that the draft law on child protection as well as the amendments to the law
on the prevention of domestic violence could constitute good opportunities for Kazakhstan
to further the protection of children from all forms of violence, and in particular from
corporal punishment in the home settings, kindergartens, or orphanages as well as
psychological abuse and bullying.
1.1.3. Legal basis for support services
This section describes and analyses the laws and regulations that established response
services for child victims of violence. The laws are organised along the continuum of
protection, looking at prevention and response services. A thorough description of the type
of services and their functioning is found in chapter 3.
In the area of prevention, the Ministry of Health adopted 2017 The standard for the
organization of paediatric care (2017). It governs the implementation of the universal
progressive patronage nursing of pregnant women and young children at the primary health
care level. The standard introduced a new model of integrated management of childhood
illness aimed at primary prevention of diseases, injuries, accidents, abuse and violence, early
detection of risks disrupting child’s physical, psychosocial, and emotional development
pathway (Babayeva et al., 2018; MoH Kaz, 2017c).
Secondly, the new Code on Health and Public Health System adopted Parliament in 2020
introduced two new services: (1) it introduced the possibility for children aged 10-18 and
young people to directly access confidential comprehensive assistance on reproductive and
mental health services through a network of youth health centres (art. 92); and (2) it
established the use of technologies in schools and secondary schools to protect reproductive
health (art. 91). The code also lowered the age of sexual consent to 16 years of age (GoK,
2020a). These were considered major achievements by two key informants (KII-C-1) (KII-C-5).
Thirdly, schools throughout Kazakhstan have school-based social pedagogues. They are
supposed to perform prevention and primary assistance. They are attached to the training
unit of the school. They work with children at risk, identify and advise the class teacher what
to pay attention to amongst the children in his/her classes. They report children to child
protection or police services in cases of abuse, neglect or violence (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al.,
2016). In 2015, in response to the high number of suicide attempts amongst adolescents (15-
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
35
system for prevention and response to violence against children
18 years old) the government has decided to introduce a program on suicide prevention. The
basis was a common order on gradual introduction of the project on prevention of suicide
among minors signed by the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Public Health and Ministry
of internal affairs (GoK, 2019b). This program justified information provision for teenagers,
the introduction of additional sessions and psychological support for school students,
training for school personnel on identifying the group of risk from the position of suicide
prevention, and identification of such students.
In 2020, the government also introduced the Roadmap on strengthening the protection of
child rights, prevention of domestic violence and suicide among teenagers in 2020-2023.
This Roadmap (art. 11) is supposed to revise the Qualification characteristic of types of
pedagogues and persons equal to them in status during the second half of 2021. They were
supposed to reconsider the responsibilities of pedagogues-psychologists. (GoK, 2020c)
In the area of response, three main laws are relevant to the scope of this evaluation.
The Law on Special Social Services (2008 amended in 2019) establishes the general
framework for developing services to protect vulnerable populations including children.
Services are spilt across education, health, justice, social protection and security sectors. The
law establishes eligibility criteria for a person or a family in a difficult life situation12; these
include situations such as orphanhood; lack of parental care; neglect, including deviant
behaviour; institutionalization of minors, including educational institutions with a special
detention regime; children with special needs; adults with illness or disability; cruel treatment
leading to social maladjustment and social deprivation; homelessness (persons without a
fixed address); release from places of confinement; registration with a probation officer. The
eligibility criteria are assessed by the agencies working in the area of social protection, health
care and education (art 6) (GoK, 2008b).
The law established access to free medical, social, legal and socio-psychological support.
Special services are aimed at creating additional opportunities for the citizens to be
integrated into society. The services are provided by the individuals and (or) legal entities
employed in the state and non-state sectors.
The Law “On Education” (2007) established the adaptation centres for minors as well as
support centres for children in difficult life situations. Children in difficult life situations due
to abuse, leading to social inadaptation and social deprivation are placed and receive services
in the Centre of Adaptation of Children (CAC). CACs support children to reside for up to three
months while a durable solution to their solution is sought. Child Support Centres provide
more holistic support to children in difficult life situations. The centres are managed by
bodies of education. (GoK, 2007b)
The Law on the prevention of domestic violence (2009, amended in 2014 and 2020) created
special structures to protect women from violence (the post of women and children officer
instituted in the regional interior departments); as well as crisis centres (some of them with
shelters). Victims of violence are provided with free medical and social, social and legal, social
12 The concept of “a child in a difficult life situation” indicates a child who cannot overcome those
difficulties independently or with the help of the family. The concept was introduced in 2019 via
multiple amendments in the Health Code (2009), Criminal Code (2014), Administrative Code (2014), the
Law on Child Rights (2002). (GoK, 2017)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
36
system for prevention and response to violence against children
and psychological services as well as temporary shelter services (RoK, 2020a). Although the
Crisis Centres were not established to be adapted to child victims, they were referenced by
several informants as possible examples or models to learn lessons and establish/strengthen
support centres for child victims of violence (KII-C-5; KII-C-7).
Finally, in 2019 the Government of Kazakhstan adopted legislation that puts administrative
responsibilities on health, education, social protection specialist for non-reporting of
suspected cases of violations of child rights to the local police (RoK, 2019b).
The literature reviewed pointed to some gaps in the laws and regulations establishing
services. For example, under the current law, ill-treatment, neglect, and domestic violence
are not recognized as difficult life circumstances. Only if such neglect or abuse leads to social
deprivation and social maladjustment, then this situation is recognized as difficult life
circumstances and thus qualifies the victim for special social services (Kanatov et al., 2017).
Secondly, and linked to the point above, specialised services for child victims of violence de
facto do not exist under the law. No law or regulation describes and sets the legal basis for
what types of services children who have experienced violence should receive (psychosocial
support, counselling, mental health care, legal support), by which sector; how they should
be adapted according to the age, gender and other personal conditions of the child or by
type of violence (i.e. sexual vs physical, or neglect). The only support services that have a
legal basis are the adaptation centres for minors as well as support centres for children in
difficult life situations who mainly provide temporary shelters for children and other basic
services. The report provides more details on these services in chapter 3.

Adel moved into her stepfather's house when she was three. He sexually abused her since
she was six. She, and her mother, lived in an environment of control, violence, and silence.
Adel started thinking something is wrong with her. The abuse got ever more severe. Adel
never encountered support in public services. The trial was a heavy burden on her. Only now,
she recovers with support from a child rights activist organization.

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
37
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The evaluation has found evidence demonstrating that fighting violence against children has
become a national policy priority in the last five years. The second half of the decade has seen
the adoption of several sectoral policies (on social development, on public health, on
education) that set the agenda to further develop and modernise the country until 2025.
Nevertheless, as for the development of the legal framework, policies have followed sectoral
siloes and have left the system fragmented. Fighting domestic violence has received the most
attention and is a cross-sectoral one. And although the respective policies potentially cover
the protection of children from domestic violence, de facto the real focus remains
predominantly on women. As of 2021, Kazakhstan does not have a centralised and unifying
policy on child protection/violence against children. What follows is an analysis of relevant
sectoral policies listed in chronological order.
The National Strategy “Kazakhstan-2050: New political course of an established state"(2012)
sets a course for accelerated modernization and industrialisation of Kazakhstan. The national
strategy sets the protection of children's rights as one of the important directions of the
state policy (GoK, 2012). It is based on this strategy that many state policies were developed
in the last decade (see below), many of which are central to the protection of children from
violence.
The National Concept of Social Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2030 was
adopted in 2014. Its priority number three includes the need to establish inter-sectoral
mechanisms for children in difficult life situations; the need to establish functional
mechanisms for the protection of children victims of violence, abuse and trafficking; special
focus on the social vulnerability of children, prevention of violence against children and
protection of children’s rights (GoK, 2014). One informant mentioned this policy has having
contributed to elevating VAC amongst the national priorities of Kazakhstan (KII-C-8).
The policy with the largest potential for the protection of children from violence is the
Concept of Family and Gender Policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2030 which was
adopted in 2016 (KII-C-8; KII-C-7). (GoK, 2016b). It established the principle of Zero tolerance
against any form of domestic violence. Amongst its objectives, it included (a) the reduction
of incidents of violence against all family members (with the ambition to reduce incidents of
child abuse by 50% by 2030); and (b) improving the quality of state social services provided
to the families.
Amongst its implementation strategies, the concept includes some that are particularly
noteworthy: the consideration (i.e. not the decision) to introduce the services of mediation
and social-psychological support for the family; the development of programmes to increase
the knowledge of families and professionals working with children about various types of
violence; the development of a unified algorithm to enable officials of prevention facilities
(health, education and social services institutions) to take prompt actions when victims of
violence apply for their support; improving the system for early identification of victims of
domestic violence and referral to the crisis centres; the development of a system of psycho-
social assistance to perpetrators of domestic violence. The report will delve into the
effectiveness of the crisis centres for child victims of violence in chapter 3.
The State Program of the development of health care of the Republic of Kazakhstan for
2020 – 2025 was adopted in 2019. It is relevant for both preventing and responding to
violence against children. It includes plans to capacitate parents on the prevention of
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
38
system for prevention and response to violence against children
violence through parenting committees and chat rooms on supporting children under stress,
on providing a safe environment and identifying psychological distress and suicidal thoughts
in children.
The State Programme also aims at improving the health of adolescents and youth by
improving the activities of youth health centres in the PHC network. These are expected to
provide to adolescents and young people, as well as victims of violence and bullying with
counselling for depression, thoughts of suicide. If necessary, narrow specialists and other
services will be involved. (GoK, 2019d)
The 2020-2025 Education Development Programme was also adopted in 2019. It includes an
entire section called “Provide a safe and comfortable learning environment”13. There is a
general indication that programmes to prevent and respond to violence against children will
be implemented, including life skills and suicide prevention programs. Secondly, the
programme states that the activities of the psychological services of educational
organizations and school reconciliation services will be strengthened to identify children
belonging to the “group at risks” early and provide them with timely assistance and to
prevent bullying. Finally, the programme also mentions that “The development of a network
(transformation of orphanages) of centres and psychological services will continue to
provide social, legal and psychological and pedagogical support to families with children in
difficult life situations”. (GoK, 2019c).
Most recently, the national government has enhanced its focus on the prevention of
domestic violence, and this is reflected in a proposed roadmap "To strengthen the
protection of the rights of the child, counter domestic violence and address suicide issues
among adolescents in 2020-22". Two informants mentioned this Roadmap as having
contributed to elevating the agenda on violence against children at the Government level
(KII-C-9; KII-G-3). The roadmap was adopted by the Government of the Republic of
Kazakhstan in 2020, the body responsible for the implementation of the roadmap is the
Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan14. The roadmap is aimed at
ensuring the rights of children to safe living conditions and includes the introduction of
measures to prevent violence, suicidal behaviour, bullying, injury through moral and spiritual
education.
In terms of the programme and methodological support, it is noteworthy that the Roadmap
introduced the development of instructions for interagency interaction to identify and work
with cases of abuse against children, a program to protect the rights of children, a set of
rehabilitation activities (measures) to work with children who are victims/witnesses of
13 The section in reality covers much more than prevention of violence and includes matters such as
child budgeting, the introduction of a child wellbeing index, inclusive education for children with
disabilities and support to foster parents. (GoK, 2019c)
14 The roadmap consists of 4 blocks - 1) improvement of the legislative and regulatory framework, 2)
programme and methodological support, 3) coordination and interagency cooperation, 3) activities
and events, 4) organization of awareness-raising activities. Some of the tasks: - Elaboration of
proposals for amendments and additions to the legislation in terms of: - children's independent appeal
to law enforcement agencies with a petition; - lowering the age of a child to be heard in any court
proceedings, expanding the functions of support centers for children in difficult life situations (GoK,
2020d).

39
system for prevention and response to violence against children
violence or self-destructive influence. The Roadmap also foresees the undertaking to study
international experience on the prohibition of corporal punishment in families (amongst
other subjects). Finally, it also sets the objective to improve the collection of statistical
reports on all forms of violence against children (GoK, 2020d).
Finally, Kazakhstan without domestic violence (May 2020) is a project to implement the
action plan for phase 2 (2020-2022) of the implementation of the Concept of Family and
Gender Policy until 2030 (MoIA Kaz, 2020a). The project aims at preventing domestic violence
through improved legislation and police response, awareness-raising in schools, timely
medical help to victims of domestic violence, combating drug and alcohol addictions and
strengthening the institutions of the family. It is implemented in the cities of Nur-Sultan,
Shymkent and Almaty, Mangystau, East Kazakhstan regions. The project was initiated in 2007
by the National Commission on Women's Affairs and Family and Demographic Policy under
the President of Kazakhstan15. The project covers violence against women mostly. Violence
against children is addressed in relation to domestic violence.
It involves coordinated actions by a variety of ministries: Ministry of Education and Science,
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population, Ministry of
Internal Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Information and Social
Development, Ministry of National Economy, Ministry of Culture and Sport.
From the literature review as well as from the interviews of key informants at the national
level, it is evident that fighting violence against children has become a national policy priority
in the last five years (KII-C-1; KII-C-5). The second half of the decade has seen the adoption of
several sectoral policies (on social development, on public health, on education) that set the
agenda to further develop and modernise the country until 2025. All of them have given
attention to preventing violence against children and reinforcing services and coordination
mechanisms to assist children at risk or victims of violence. Two informants added that the
expansion of social media in Kazakhstan contributed to a great deal to elevate the issue in
the political agenda, as it exposed local cases of violence against children to the national level
and raised awareness in the population and amongst the politicians (KII-C-3; KII-C-5). Another
informant pointed to the role that the President of Kazakhstan has played in keeping the
attention high on violence against children. She nevertheless also added that the initiatives
are still very sector-based, taken by individual ministries rather than in a collegial way by the
whole Government (KII-C-1).
A point of analysis is that undoubtedly noteworthy is that the political attention given to the
Prevention of Domestic Violence has been very high. It started with the adoption of the
“Concept of Family and Gender Policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2030” in 2016,
continued with the adoption of the “Roadmap to strengthen the protection of the rights of
the child, counter domestic violence and address suicide issues among adolescents in 2020-
22” adopted in 2020 and the implementation of the project “Kazakhstan without Domestic
Violence” in 2020. Two informants pointed out that the target group who is in the focus of
the different initiatives to prevent domestic violence are the facto women, rather than
women and children (KII-C-7; KII-C-4). According to one informant, the agenda for the

Gender Policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan till 2030 shows the potential that such a policy – if
existing for child protection – could bring to the protection of children from violence” (KII-C-7).
However, as of 2020, Kazakhstan does not have a national child protection policy that would
(1) help set out a unified and intersectoral vision and plan for the prevention and response to
violence against children; (2) establish responsibilities and roles for state actors and agencies
across sectors and levels; (3) be accompanied by coordination and accountability
mechanisms as well as necessary financial resources and indicators and data management
system to ensure implementation (KII-G-1). For the last decade, sectors have continued to
take important but independent initiatives that have maintained a set of separated and
complex sectoral systems. This fragmentation was already identified as a barrier to the
protection of children in 2011 (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011) and it appears to be a persisting
feature still in 2020 (Haarr, 2020). The report analyses coordination and governance in
chapter 2.

(from TORs) - – EQ1.3-(3)
Evaluation criteria -Relevance
In general, the evaluation has found no evidence in the laws and policies identified as relevant
to violence against children of any proactive approach to identify specific characteristics of
children (such as gender, age, disability, income-level, migration status) to guide the
implementing agencies to adapt interventions accordingly.
Nevertheless, some policies established interventions that are targeted at particular groups
of children: patronage nurses pay a visit to (mothers and) children from 0-5 years old;
targeted social assistance is for families and children below a certain level of income; youth
centres are meant to provide sexual and reproductive health care to adolescents; residential
centres exist to provide support to children with disabilities.
Finally, the existing response services – the Centres for Adaptation and the Centres for
Children in difficult life circumstances – are accessible for children belonging to “risk-groups”:
these are (a) children left without parental care, (b) neglected children; (c) children in difficult
life situations, and (d) children referred to special educational institutions or facilities (GoK,
2007b). There is no evidence that the services that should be provided to the children
belonging to these different groups should receive services adapted to their age, gender,
disability, or other characteristics.

(from TORs) – EQ1.4-(4)
Evaluation criteria -Effectiveness
All the policies that have been analysed for the present evaluation are accompanied by an
action plan detailing the actors responsible for the implementation of each specific action
and by when (Concept of Social Development (GoK, 2014)); they nominate the line-ministry
responsible for its implementation (2020-2025 Education Development Programme (GoK,
2019c); State Program of development of health care of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020
(GoK, 2019d)); the person in the Government responsible to oversee the implementation
(Concept of Social Development); they determine the necessary budget and the respective
funding sources (2020-2025 Education Development Programme; State Program of
development of health care of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2020).
Nominally, these would be all relevant indications and enabling factors of an existing ability
of the government and its line-ministries to secure the implementation of national policies.
Nevertheless, during the interviews, it became evident that the implementation of national
policies is generally lagging behind (KII-C-2). This has been identified as one major barrier and
is fully analysed in Chapter 2 on Governance. One informant pointed out the fact that as
implementation happens at local level, it is dependent on the budget made available to
governors, their personality and goodwill (KII-C-1).16 When it comes to the implementation of
child protection policies, one informant particularly pointed to the lack of coordination at
local level. According to her, the decision to dismantle the territorial departments of Child
Protection in 2013 has left a coordination gap that hasn’t been filled since (KII-C-1).17 The lack
of coordination at sub-national level has been identified as a major barrier and is addressed
in detail in Chapter 2.
Violence against children as an issue was identified as presenting in itself an implementation
challenge. Violence is very often accompanied by stigma and shame and programmes and
policies that tackle violence should take that into account by communicating their purpose,
supporting acceptance and knowledge of the issue (KII-C-2). The experience with the
parliamentarian debate on the new draft law on the prevention of domestic violence
demonstrated that national ministries have still to acquire the communication skills to avoid
resistance in the public and the parents (KII-C-1).
According to the literature reviewed, one of the barriers, found in some child protection laws
and policies, is that their text is at times declaratory in nature and it is not accompanied by

Evaluation criteria -Coherence
According to two key informants as well as the literature reviewed, there are no cross-
sectoral protocols to identify, report, refer and follow-up child victims of violence (KII-C-1; KII-
C-3); (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018). Every sector has developed its algorithm, standards
operating procedures and protocols. (KII-C-1; FGD-Q-2). Sectoral protocols are examined in
section 4.2. What follows represents emerging protocols that have been recently adopted
and that provide for some elements of procedures and standards that apply to more than
one sector.
In 2019, a new legislative act introduced the medical-social registry as an entry point for
integrated social service provisions to children in difficult-life situations (medical,
psychological and social assistance). The evaluation was not able to find any evidence on it
and how this medical-social registry has been operationalised. (RoK, 2019b)
In 2020, a joint regulatory act [Guidelines for interagency cooperation in identifying and
dealing with the facts of violence and cruel treatment against minors - Order No. 569] was
adopted by the Ministry of Education together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the
Ministry of Health (MoES Kaz, 2020a). The regulatory act is meant to help officials – including
the juvenile police – to identify cruel acts against children. The act establishes measures,
competencies, and an algorithm of actions when violence against children is identified (FGD-
Q-2).
Although the protection of children from human trafficking is beyond the scope of this
evaluation, the recommendation to develop a national identification and referral mechanism
for victims of trafficking might constitute a good example of cross-sectoral procedures. In
June 2021, the Kazakhstan Commission on Human Rights under the President of the Republic
of Kazakhstan presented a special report on social and economic, labour, civic and cultural
rights of citizens and other persons in the prevention of trafficking in the Republic of
Kazakhstan (MLSP Kaz, 2021). This report recommends developing and launch effective
national identification and referral mechanism for victims of trafficking (potentially also
covering child victims of human trafficking) that would bring together law enforcement
agencies, NGOs, health care, education, social services, and other government agencies. This
referral mechanism would allow defining the responsibilities and the role of each agency and
organisation in the area of identification of victims of human trafficking, their referral and
provision of protection and assistance, along with coordination between different

2. Governance
2.1. Coordination at the central level
Effective governance structures including coordination across government ministries and
departments, between levels of administration and between formal and informal actors is a
fundamental component of any CPS (UNICEF, 2018b). Addressing the underlying risk and
protective factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of violence are the responsibility
of multiple sectors. Therefore, engaging multiple sectors to contribute towards
strengthening violence prevention and outcomes for children no one sector can achieve
alone (GPEVAC, 2020).
In Kazakhstan, the governance of the CPS has not evolved much from 2011. Although there
have been multiple reforms in the laws and in the policies as seen in chapter 1, these have
been taken by individual sectors in a siloed way. As in 2021, there is no single central
government body responsible for setting state policies on child protection /violence against
children. This has continued to result in a segmented approach with fragmented sectoral
initiatives: multiple agencies develop and implement programmes without sufficient
collaboration and coordination resulting in gaps.
Unlike Child Protection, gender issues and violence against women have been better
coordinated at central level. The Commission on Gender, Family and Demographic Policies
has contributed to the adoption of the Concept of Family and Gender Policy till 2030.

EQ2.1-(6)
Evaluation criteria -Effectiveness
At the central level, there is no mandated body for the development of state policies on child
protection or violence against children. This responsibility is shared across different line-
ministries and agencies and in particular the Ministry of Education and Science (and
Committee of the Protection of Children’s Rights (CPCR) under the auspices of the Ministry),
Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Labour and Social Protection, Ministry of Public Health, the
Inter-Agency Commission on Issues of Minors and Protection of Children’s Rights, the
Commission on Gender, Families and Demographic Affairs under the President and the
Committee on Families and Youth under the Ministry of Information and Social Development.
Lack of coordination was constantly highlighted by many key informants at the central level,
including as a characteristic of the administration and not only concerning children’s rights,
child protection or violence against children. Working in silos and within ministries and

45
system for prevention and response to violence against children
sectors has been the prevalent norm for the last 20 years (KII-C-1; KII-C-4; KII-C-7; KII-C-8; KII-
C-9; KII-C-11; KII-G-4; KII-G-6).
Some informants mentioned the Commission on Gender, Families and Demographic Policy
as an example of how gender and women’s issues are kept high on the political agenda (KII-
C-7; KII-C-9; KII-G-6). The Commission was formed in 2006 and it operates under the President
of Kazakhstan (GoK, 2006). It is composed of 28 people including 4 men.18 These are experts
on different subject matters and sitting in the Commission voluntarily. The President
appoints the members upon recommendations of the Commission. The Commission
convenes every quarter and has also contact persons at the Akimat level. The Commission
has a strong political weight, it can speak with authority to the different line ministries and
propose policies, actions, recommendations. One noteworthy result of the Commission was
the adoption of the Concept on Family and Gender Policy till 2030 adopted in 2016 (KII-C-7).19
Other informants added that the Commission has nevertheless low resources and capacities
(3-persons secretariat) and that has impacted on their work (KII-C-7; KIIC-9). For the same
informants if the Commission was provided with more resources, it could also take up the
responsibility for advocating for the protection of children from violence (KII-C-7; KIIC-9);
while others were more cautious about that, arguing that stronger coordination is needed
but it has to be ensured by a ministry with the mandate and capacity to reach the sub-national
level (KII-C-8).
When it comes to the implementation of State Policies on the Protection of Children’s Rights,
the main authorised body in Kazakhstan is the Committee on Protection of Children’s Rights
(CPCR) under the Ministry of Education and Science. The CPCR was created in 2006 with the
mandate to implement state policy on child rights protection and establish an effective
system to guarantee the rights of all children (GoK, 2007c). Amongst its functions, the
Committee has responsibility for the coordination and direction of other interested
authorised bodies in the field of protection of children’s rights as well as for exercising
control and supervisory functions over the activities of central and local executive bodies.
(MoES Kaz, 2016).
Theoretically, the CPCR has coordinating functions, however, it has no authority over the
other ministries such as the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The
CRC Committee has recommended (UN CRC, 2007, 2015) to enhance the status and the
authority of the CPCR by moving it out of the Ministry of Education and Science. That has not
happened as of 2020. The 2020 roadmap directed at strengthening the protection of child
rights, violence prevention (GoK, 2020d) mentions providing MoES with additional control
over other agencies working in the area of child protection. However, during this evaluation,
it was too early to find evidence on how this control has started being implemented.
When it comes to coordination of the implementation of laws and policies across
administrative levels, the responsibilities rest with the respective line ministries. The only
noticeable exception is the Inter-Agency Commission on Issues of Minors and Protection of

system for prevention and response to violence against children
their Rights. It was established in 2004 and it is mandated to ensure the coordination of
activities of State bodies and institutions in the field of preventing infractions, neglect, and
homelessness amongst minors. A Commission is formed under the Government and at the
regional (oblast), city, district (rayon) and city of regional significance levels. The composition
of the Commission at the oblast, city of republican significance and Capital level is proposed
by the local executive body (Akimats) to the corresponding local representative bodies
(Maslikhats) for approval (RoK, 2004b).20
The Commission consists of representatives of all interested ministries, departments, local
executive bodies, and non-governmental organisations. The 2019 law “On amendments to
Some Legislative Acts on Issues related to the Activities of the organisations on Protection
of Child Rights” extended the competencies of the Commission to include the protection
from violence and abuse, the coordination of state authorities on the matter, including
through the establishment of a medical-social registry and the introduction of standards for
the special social services on the protection of children’s rights (RoK, 2019b).

EQ2.2-(7)
Evaluation criteria -Effectiveness
The lack of coordination at the national level is transposed at the sub-national level. At the
local level, the delivery of child protection services is carried out in a fragmented way and
follows sectoral lines. There are several bodies responsible for delivering the services to
children and their families21 but none of them has a coordinating function (KII-C-10; KII-G-1).
Two informants stressed that coordination works a little better at the local level as all
sectoral departments work under the executive bodies of Akimats and Oblasts and therefore
the accountability is stronger (KII-C-2; KII-C-10).
All these structures work within their sector which leads to fragmentation, a significant
amount of duplication and limited awareness as to which professionals are working and/or
are involved with specific families and what services are being provided to children and their
families. Figure 3: Competencies and roles in Child Protection per sector give a general idea

paragraph.
21 Prevention and response services are described and analysed in chapter 3.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
47
system for prevention and response to violence against children
of the distribution of state organizations and specialists across the CPS in the country. This
system is complex, hierarchical, and fragmented.
There was an attempt during the early 2010s to improve the coordination of child protection
at the sub-national level via the establishment of territorial Departments of Child Protection
(local branches of the CPCR) that were responsible for providing assistance to children in
difficult circumstances. Nevertheless, they were abolished in mid-2013. The coordinating
functions were taken over by the akimats (regional and local public authorities), on a much
lower scale, through the newly set up Children’s Rights Protection Units (Gheorghe &
Mussagaliyeva, 2014). Following a Government Decree in January 2014, these units were also
abolished, with staff transferred to the Guardianship and Care Unit and the new Moral and
Spiritual Development Unit (within the Education Department of the regional akimats).
The only multi-sectoral body that exists at the sub-national level is the (local) Commissions
on Issues of Minors and Protection of their Rights.22 A Commission must include ‘Deputies’
from ‘relevant Maslikhats’ and representatives from the following bodies: bodies of internal
affairs; education; culture; health care service; justice; authorised body on issues of
employment; Guardianship and Trusteeship Authority; and public and other organisations
relating to the prevention of infractions, neglect and homelessness amongst minors (Haarr,
2020). Their main function is to decide on the need for a child to be placed in alternative care
and to refer them to the centres for adaptation or child support centres. (KII-L-N-005).
In 2020, all regions of the country have introduced positions of Deputy Directors of
Departments for Ensuring the Quality Education to take prompt measures to eliminate
violations of children’s rights. They have become members of the Regional Commissions for
Minors Affairs (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2020).
It will be important to see how the recently decided expansion of their work to assess cases
of violence against children will impact their work and will create the necessary coordination
mechanisms that are so much needed.
It is noteworthy that some informants at the sub-national level pointed out increased
cooperation between health, education, social protection, law enforcement agencies and
NGOs. But they pointed to the fact that this cooperation has a voluntary basis, is not based
on cross-sectoral protocols or memorandum of understanding. Every state body functions
according to its sectoral protocol and is accountable to it (KII-L-T-003; FG-S-T-006; KII-L-T-001;
KII-S-EK; FGD-L-EK).
According to other key informants, NGOs have played an important role in furthering the
coordination of services on violence against children across state bodies and private service
providers. For example, a single database was created in Turkestan under the Besterek
Programme (see chapter 3 for details) for school psychologists to identify children at risk and
the assistance been provided to them. The same participants in the focus group also talked
about the improvement of coordination in the last 3 years when representatives of NGOs and
22 Their composition at the rayon or city of regional significance levels is proposed by the Akimat of
that level to the corresponding Maslikhats for approval. The Law permits the establishment of a
Commission under the Mayor (Akim) of rural settlements, villages or rural districts which are located
a ‘considerable distance’ from the centre of the district (Haarr, 2020).

from “Reframe” – a psychological assistance centre – were admitted to the Commission on
Issues of Minors and Protection of their Rights (FG-L-T-007).
Regardless of these sporadic and voluntary improvements in the collaboration across bodies
delivering services, several informants mentioned that because of the lack of universal
quality standards, services are not planned together, they can either duplicate existing
services or missing out on those which are needed. (KII-S-EK; FDG-l-EK).
Finally, and potentially very detrimental for the protection of children from violence, this lack
of cross-sectoral coordination and accountability has induced some services to simply refer
child victims to other services and discharge themselves from the responsibility to protect
them. As a result, services are not creating a protective environment for child victims of
violence (FGD-L-M)

EQ2.3-(8)
Evaluation criteria -Coherence
Besides the reforms in laws and policies that were analysed in chapter 1, in the last 10 years,
there have been multiple initiatives on violence against children undertook by other actors.
The evaluation could not find evidence indicating that there was coordination amongst the
different actors or that the different initiatives were triggered by the same objective and a
consequent division of labour. What appeared to be clear is that the Commissioner on Human
Rights has played a fundamental role in advancing the reforms on violence against children,
moving from school settings to childcare and detention institutions and, more recently,
thanks to the support from UNICEF to violence against children in home settings.
Amongst them, the reports by the Commissioner on Human Rights are noteworthy. These
include the 2011 Report assessing the prevalence of violence against children in institutions
(Commissioner for Human Rights RoK et al., 2011), the 2013 Report on assessing the
prevalence of violence against children in schools (Commissioner for Human Rights RoK et
al., 2013). The studies triggered a Pilot Project on the Prevention of VAC in Schools that was
implemented in 10 schools in East Kazakhstan (UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2014). Very
importantly, these studies informed the Law on introducing changes and additions into some
legislative acts related to child protection organizations from April 1, 2019 (RoK, 2019b). This
law allowed for the expansions of the mandate of the National Preventive Mechanism
(NPM)(see chapter 4) and resulted in the inclusion of several types of children’s institutions
(centres for the adaptation of minors, special education institutions and educational
institutions with special detention regime) within the NPM’s monitoring process (Gheorghe
& Mussagaliyeva, 2014; RoK, 2019b). Furthermore, the 2019 Law related to organisations on
child rights protection expanded the NPM mandate to all types of residential care institutions
for children, they include orphanages, institutions for children with disabilities
The Prosecutor General Office of Kazakhstan23 also undertook some initiatives in the field of
domestic violence. “Kazakhstan without domestic violence (2020)” was developed based
on a pilot project developed in 2017 by the General Prosecutor Office and the Commission on
Gender, Family and Demographic Policy for the Abay district of Shymkent city and Saryagash
23 The Prosecutor General Office is a state body accountable to the President of Kazakhstan, exercising
supreme supervision over the precise and uniform application of laws, decrees of the President of the
Republic of Kazakhstan and other regulatory legal acts on the territory of the Republic, over the
legality of operational-search activities, inquiry and investigation, administrative and enforcement
proceedings (https://www.gov.kz/memleket/entities/prokuror?lang=en accessed on 2 July 2021)

district of South Kazakhstan region (Turkestan)24. The evaluation was not able to assess
whether there were more specific results on VAC out of the initiatives by the General
Prosecution Office.
The Law chamber of the Parliament has been involved in the debates on several draft laws
that might have a direct impact on violence against children. These include the draft law on
child protection. A group of parliamentarians started working on it in May 2020 and January
2021. The group involves 65 people (including lawyers, psychologists, members of public
administration). The draft law is supposed to make 35 amendments into 3 codes and 6 laws
of the Republic of Kazakhstan. These norms are related to housing provisions for orphans,
families raising children with disabilities, rehabilitation for such children, the introduction of
the concept of bullying into the Law on Education and the Law on the Rights of Children
laws25.
Finally, the lower chamber has been discussing the draft law on domestic violence for quite
a while. As noted in chapters 1 and 6, the law was withheld by the President because of the
resistance that is created in the general public and families. A draft social code that is inclusive
of the code on the social worker status, as well as a draft law on child protection, are also
under discussion (see chapter 1),
As analysed in chapter 4, the National Statistics Office (NSO) has also been an active actor in
carrying out various national representative surveys on women, children and families that
revealed the prevalence of some forms of violence against children in Kazakhstan. As of 2011,
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) were carried out in Kazakhstan in 2010/2011 (MICS4)
(The Agency of Statistics et al., 2012) and 2015 (MICS5) (The Statistics Committee of the
Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan et al., 2016). MICS6 are in the
design phase and are expected to be carried out in 20217. In 2017 the National Statical Office26
carried out a national survey on violence against women27; a new survey is under
development, and it will contain also questions on violence against girls (KII-C-5).
As described further in chapter 6, UNICEF Kazakhstan has been particularly active in studying
and exposing the social norms that are underpinning the understanding and acceptance of
some forms of violence against children in the families. UNICEF carried out a survey on
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practice (KAP) on violence against children in families in 2016
(Haarr, 2017) and repeated it in 2020 (Preliminary results, UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
Based on the results of the first survey UNICEF developed and carried out a communication
campaign in 2018 (Action Global Communications Kazakhstan, 2018).
Finally, it is worth noting the coordination amongst NGOs. The working group of NGOs "On
the Protection of Children's Rights" is a coalition of non-governmental organizations

Group has been active in promoting the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the
Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan, monitoring the implementation of child rights since 2001
through receiving appeals from children, parents, and their legal representatives through the
Public Reception. It is composed of a group of individuals representing seven NGO
members28, and it has a coordinator.
The working group’s main objective is to produce alternative NGOs reports for the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child. Those reports also include information on violence
against children in Kazakhstan.
The working group regularly makes official statements regarding VAC, especially residing in
the state institutions, drawing attention to inaction or incomplete implementation of the
rights of the child in a particular case.
Its members have also produced tools and studies on violence against children. For example,
in 2013, the Union of Crisis Centres together with others prepared a textbook "Childhood
without cruelty and violence", which summarizes the best practices of working with children
subjected to sexual violence and abuse. It is intended for educational organizations to
improve the skills of pedagogical workers, including psychologists, social workers for the
prevention of violence and abuse against children (Baysakova & Mukhamedsadykova, 2013)

The evaluation found evidence of emerging political commitment at the highest level of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, as the President used some official occasions during 2020 and 2021
to address sexual violence against children as well as bullying. Secondly, the number of laws
and policies with relevance to VAC that have been adopted especially since 2018 is also a clear
indication of a stronger commitment to tackling violence against children. Nevertheless, the
evaluation also revealed that the political will still translate too often in more punitive
measures and punishment and not enough on support to victims. This is also corroborated
by the findings in chapter 3 (services) and chapter 6 (social norms).
Some key informants mentioned that the most eloquent sign of political commitment to VAC
comes from the statements by the President of the Republic (KII-C-1; KII-G-7; FGD-Q-2). For

example, in September 2020, during his address to the nation, the President mentions the
increased liability for sexual abuses against minors but acknowledged that the problem
remains acute. He also called for more severe punishment for those criminals, without the
right to pardon and early release (RoK, 2020d). In January 2021, the President announced at
the opening of a new session of parliament, that measures should be taken to protect the
rights of children, including protecting them from bullying. Earlier, in his September 2020
Presidential Address, the President emphasized the importance of taking measures to
protect children against cyberbullying.29
Undoubtedly, the number of new laws and national policies that have been adopted,
especially in the past 5 years (see chapter 1) are a clear sign that there is a growing
commitment to tackle violence against children.
Some other informants mentioned nevertheless, violence against children becomes high in
the political arena also in reaction to cases of violence against children who are rendered
public and discussed in social media (KII-C-1; KII-C-3; KII-C-5).
Finally, some informants shared that there is a tendency in governmental institutions to
understand and communicate on violence against children primarily from a punitive
perspective. Very often the discourse is about further criminalising and punishing
perpetrators, controlling children’s behaviours, putting pressure on parents, teachers, social
workers and punishing them if they don’t comply with their duties (KII-C-3; KII-G-3: FDG-Q-2).
Furthermore, some other informants stressed the need for the government to focus more
and more on the prevention of violence against children and work on the causes of violence
against children, via reinforcing psychological education at school, support professionals to
identify early signs of violence and supporting children to speak out (KII-C-9; KII-G-3). Two
informants also mentioned the need to develop special programmes for abusers involving
the Union of Crisis Centres and the Courts and being carried out by psychologists and social
workers to understand the root causes of violence in the abuser and work with him/her to
overcome them (FGD-Q-1; KII-C-9).
Box 2: Case study on violence and bullying in a rural area
Arkhat moved with his family to a small rural town when he was 10. One way of integrating
into the new environment was to embark on Kazakh wrestling. The trainer was abusive and
extremely violent to him. Arkhat always felt that he did something wrong and thought the
trainer’s behaviour was normal. It took him years to reveal the abuse. Nobody in school, the
health system or the sports club would detect the abuse. Only later, Arkhat realized what
harm had been inflicted on him. Today, he argues that referring to culture and traditional
norms in child-raising should not be taken as an excuse for justifying violent actions towards
children.

system for prevention and response to violence against children
3. Services
Obligations derive from the CRC, for states to provide public services to prevent and respond
to violence against children. These can be structured (US DHHS, 2018) around primary
prevention (for the general population), secondary prevention (for children perceived to be
at risk), tertiary prevention and intervention/response (for children that have been exposed
to VAC). These services have to be provided along the life cycle of the child, starting from
pregnancy up to adolescence and early adulthood. As described in the definition of the CPS
in the introduction, these services need to be provided from different sectors (GPEVAC,
2020). These services, most of them hosted in provision functions of line ministries – such as
education, health, social services, or law enforcement need to collaborate and integrate into
a system. Ideally, these services offer support to children – and their immediate environment
(parents and schools) – for them to live a live without violence (primary and secondary
prevention). Beyond prevention, at the response end if VAC occurs, these services aim to
stop the abuse, mitigate its impact and prevent sequels (tertiary prevention and response).
The Law on Special Social Services (2008) created the legal basis for the development of
social services for children and families (see chapter 1).
Except for the universal patronage nurses and the piloting of the whole-school violence
prevention programmes in 2014 (which was discontinued because of lack of funding) none
of the other prevention programmes was introduced with violence prevention as one of the
objectives. This has resulted in a piecemeal approach with overlaps (for example between
youth health centres and youth resource centres) and overlooked areas such as parenting
programmes. At the same time school programmes directed at prevention offer resources
to school administration and psychologists to incorporate violence prevention lessons into
the existing school curriculum, but their capacity seems to be limited by an approach that is
perceived by parents and children to be stigmatising and punitive and sheading bad
reputations on schools. Targeted social assistance has been introduced and strengthened,
nevertheless, it is not accompanied by any violence prevention in family or parent support.
When it comes to response services, specialised services for child victims of violence are very
rare in Kazakhstan, both in terms of availability and coverage. Support services for child
victims of violence (treatment, psycho-social and mental health, recovery, and reintegration)
are mainly residential, are provided both by NGOs and the State. They only provide support
to children who are eligible for them but not to their parents or siblings if they would need
it. There is a small number of crisis centres – both state and private – available for women
victims of violence, that potentially offer service for girls, but they de-facto are primarily
targeted at women.
The planning at the state and oblast level for prevention and response services does not have
adequate mechanisms to ensure the appropriateness of services neither at the population
nor individual level. Structured consultations with experts, service-user and
providers/advocates could help to define better-adapted services. Likewise, certain most
vulnerable groups – defined by gender, disability, migrant, or ethnic status and particularly
on their intersections – often face barriers to entering services and sometimes mistreatment
by public agents. In the COVID lockdown, the response of services has been interrupted.
However, while the situation of vulnerability of children has increased in general and services
had to close down or go online, some innovative responses have surged that might even

55
system for prevention and response to violence against children
indicate breakthroughs to better attention when building back to normal after COVID. In that
respect, the landscape of service innovation is suffering a proliferation of pilot projects that
seldom get scaled up to transition to being integrated into full public service coverage.

Evaluation criteria - Relevance
3.1.1. Prevention services for the general population
There are limited prevention services provided to children and their families. Universal
prevention services considered here include the health sector (children 0-5 covered with the
patronage services, and children aged 12-18 who have access to the youth health centres),
education (children 7 to 18 attending schools); and general information provision (for
teenagers 14 to 18 in youth resource centres). The services described in the section are not
exclusive to the evaluated regions, instead, they are available across all Kazakhstan. The
universal progressive model of patronage visitations directed at future mothers and young
children allow developing trust between women and a team of professionals, who focus on
health, development and the well-being of a whole family and community. Youth health and
youth resource centres engage, educate and empower youth to build lives free from violence
by offering safety tools on reproductive and mental health, along with re-direction to other
social services. At the same time school programmes directed at prevention offer resources
to school administration and psychologists to incorporate violence prevention lessons into
the existing school curriculum.
Medical consultation in the earliest life: paediatric care and the universal patronage model
In terms of the child life-cycle, prevention of child neglect and abuse potentially starts during
pregnancy, especially in cases of an existing relationship of abuse in the households. Medical
consultations are available for pregnant women, including girls (from the 11-12th week of
pregnancy) at the public health organizations (Standard of obstetric and gynaecological
health provision, 2018; Code on the health of the nation and public health system, 2020).
According to the Standard (2018), medical consultations (cabinets) in public or private
policlinics support women in family planning and reproductive health, along with prevention,
diagnostics and treatment of gynaecological diseases of the reproductive system during
pregnancy and after birth. This is executed via at least six medical consultations during the
pregnancy (MoH Kaz, 2003).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
56
system for prevention and response to violence against children
When it comes to preventing VAC and neglect, the Standard of obstetric and gynaecological
health provision (2018) mentions that in cases of signs of violence, the doctor must inform
representatives of internal affairs agency and provide medical assistance to the victim (MoH
Kaz, 2018). There are Evaluation criteria of abuse that leads to social maladjustment and
social deprivation, adopted by the MoH in 2014 (along with MoIA, MOES), that provides a
scale allowing to assess the level of degree of physical, psychological or sexual violence (from
5 to 25 points) (MoIA Kaz, MoES Kaz, & MoH Kaz, 2014). Identified signs of violence in a
mother automatically put a woman in the high-risk group and requires the involvement of a
psychologist, social worker. However, it is nevertheless unclear the extent to which such
information is used by the visiting nurses to follow-up on the wellbeing of the newborn after
the birth of a child unless the woman makes an official appeal to the Department of Internal
Affairs (MoIA Kaz et al., 2021).
Furthermore, according to the official data, there is a deficit in medical doctors,
gynaecologists and medical nurses and this has resulted in a high increase in workload30. In
Nur Sultan, for example, the number of medical consultations decreased almost twice from
48 consultations in 2016 to 26 consultations in 2019 which increased the load on the system
(NSO Kaz, 2017b). With this workload, a doctor in Nur Sultan can spare about 15 minutes per
consultation.31 It is highly doubtful that a woman would be able to discuss anything related
to violence in the given amount of time.
From birth and up to the age of 5, patronage nurses provide home visitation to mothers and
children. The service was introduced in 2017 via Paediatric Care Standard approved by the
Ministry of Public Health (MoH Kaz, 2017e). summarised as the ‘patronage model’.

According to the Standard (2018), progressive home visitation by the medical personnel
allows dividing patients into different groups depending on the assigned risk (as shown in
Table 15). Women experiencing violence, abuse, women with disabilities are considered as a
high-risk group, that require social assistance: in such cases, information about the family is
shared with a social worker, psychologist, and representatives of other bodies (including
education, social protection, internal affairs, Akimat, NGOs, etc) (Standard 2018, Chapter 3,
Art. 26).
Gesaworld S.A. (2019) mentions this as access of the patronage team to the inter-sectoral
commission under the Akim. This commission, consisting of representatives from other
sectors and services and local NGOs, considers each presented case and allocates resources
to reduce the family’s vulnerability. Additionally, home visitation nurses may also ask
neighbours or the community where the family lives, to support the caregiver and the family
(Gesaworld, 2019).
According to the literature, patronage nurses demonstrated efficiency in identifying early
signs of VAC (Babayeva et al., 2018; GoK, 2020b; MoH Kaz, 2018). The progressive patronage
model provides opportunities for prevention of VAC, by promoting positive parent-child
interactions, prevention and treatment of parental depression (however, the quality of this
service depends on the experience of the team’s psychologist), maternal education and
education about child’s development (Gesaworld, 2019)32.
Unfortunately, it was impossible to determine how many women and children in the
evaluated regions received access to the progressive patronage service. According to an
informant in Nur Sultan, the updated patronage service has been available for women with
children 0 to 4 years of age. The patronage nurse who was interviewed was aware of the
importance of re-directing information about acts of violence to the police. However, the
informant was not familiar with the existence of the document that describes the response
to VAC (KII-L-N-26), developed by the Ministry of Public Health (National Center for Public
Health of the MoH RK, 2020)
Patronage nurses, interviewed during the evaluation, mentioned that they report any VAC
cases they witnessed to the head of the department and the police. However, there was
32 The model has not been evaluated after its expansion, however, the pilot evaluation showed a
decrease of child mortality from controlled causes and household injuries, increase in immunization
coverage, increase in exclusive breastfeeding (Babayeva et al., 2018). According to the authors, this
change was correlated with improved parental knowledge and skills, awareness of infectious diseases,
importance of attachment, safe home environment, etc (Gesaworld, 2019).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

rarely any follow up from the police on the cases (KII-L-N-026). Similar claims came from a
different region (see the Case study on services): the representative of the healthcare sector
mentions that medical workers are disincentivized from reporting cases of violence:
“If there is no statement, …, there is no problem”. [Nurses] are afraid of losing their
jobs.” (CS-S-001, p. 4).
The representatives of the department of public health, however, dismissed this claim,
quoting Order no. 1027, and saying that intersectoral cooperation between health and police
works well (FG-L-N-023).
Programmes to foster parenting skills
Based on our evaluation, there is a small number of parenting programmes in Kazakhstan
directed at improving positive parenting skills and reducing harsh and abusive parenting.
Some of the efforts are directed at the provision of information, as mentioned in Chapter 6.
Some information on parenting skills and practice is provided through the state programmes
for future mothers at the level of policlinics (medical consultations) and focused mostly on
health care for children 0-6 years old ( Standard for the Organization of the Provision of
Pediatric Care, 2017, Art. 12). The evaluation learned about psychological assistance provided
to parents through the psychological support service at the Department of public health in
the Turkestan region (KII-L-T-055). Patronage nurses do not organise training for the parents,
but they support families in developing positive parent-child interactions (Babayeva et al.,
2018; Gesaworld, 2019; UNICEF Kazakhstan, Núñez-Sabarís, Satorras, Nurmagambetova,
Shevshenko, & Gesaworld, 2019). There are parenting courses provided free of charge for
people interested in adoption, guardianship or foster parenting (GoK, 2008a).33 Three-month
courses touch upon various topics, including child rights aspects, child needs depending on
the age of the child, conflict resolution along with the development of communication skills
when dealing with children (Vox Populi, 2021). The courses took place even during the
lockdown when they have been offered remotely: the potential parents had an opportunity
to interact with psychologists and lawyers for three hours every week. But parenting courses
for biological parents do not exist.
33 The courses are organised in small groups with involvement of social workers, psychologists,
medical personnel and lawyers, and parents who have experience of adoption (EGov (2020), Школа
приемных родителей, accessed on July 18, 2021 at
https://egov.kz/cms/ru/articles/guardianship/2Ffoster_parents). The “school of adopted parents”
exists on the basis of residential institutions for children in every region of Kazakhstan. The first
schools have been launched in 2016, when a public foundation “Ana yui” (Mother’s House) established
a National Adoption Agency, devoted to developing adoption in Kazakhstan society and professional
support of families with adopted children (FGD-L-M, Cabar IWRP (2020), (Kopzhasarova, 2020). From
2016, 1 700 families participated in such courses, and 800 of those families adopted children (Cabar
IWRP (2020), ibid.). This “school” was formalized after introduction of changes into the Code On
Marriage and Family in 2020, therefore, now application for adoption of children requires a certificate
of completion of psychological assistance courses for future parents: Chapter 13, Art 85, (GoK, 2011).,

system for prevention and response to violence against children
Violence prevention programmes in schools
There were plans in 2014 to introduce universal violence and whole-school prevention
programme for children attending schools (aged 7 to 18) (Commissioner for Human Rights
RoK et al., 2013; UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2014). Unfortunately, the service was
discontinued due to a lack of funding. In comparison to the existing prevention programmes
that are discussed at some length below, the discontinued program aimed at preventing
violence through the development of social and emotional skills of students, and response
to violence34. The primary prevention curriculum for school children was looking at a general
school-wide environment, instead of labelling children as children at risk as practised in the
current system. The developed curriculum was targeting students between the 3rd and 7th
grades (for children 9 to 14 years of age) and presented as seven lessons taking up to 20-30
minutes to teach. The original idea was to provide training to students in one week.
The program involved 7 state schools and 3 boarding schools to develop a system for
detecting, responding, and preventing violence in schools, creating School Safety Teams, a
mechanism for redirecting cases of violence, etc. (IAC, 2016).
The curriculum focused on creating a school-wide system of change, including (a) defining,
teaching and reinforcing the school’s ethical rules (b) Promoting positive character and
positive individual behaviours; (c) Enhancing student’s skills at problem-solving and conflict
resolution (d) Preventing the occurrence of problem behaviours and school violence.
(UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2014)
The primary prevention curriculum was supposed to be scaled to the school programs across
the country after 2018, however, due to the lack of funding, it has been left up to schools to
carry on with the programme.35 According to the informant, certain ideas on safe schools
from the primary prevention curriculum have been introduced in the new educational
standard for 12-year schools that will be launched in 2023-2024.
The new State programme on the development of education and science for 2020-2025
contains information about the development of prevention curriculum for school children
with implementation planned for 2021-2025 (GoK, 2019c). It is not clear if the prevention
curriculum in the State programme reproduces ideas of the UNICEF program piloted in 2014.
In the evaluated regions, there are programmes on the prevention of bullying and peer
violence available at schools and run by school psychologists and representatives of school
administration. A more detailed analysis is provided in the case studies on services in the
Annex. The programme allows raising general awareness about bullying among the school
population, while school psychologists work with children victims of bullying and children
who initiated bullying, as well as their parents. The existing programmes are age-specific (7th
to 11th grade in Turkestan; and 5th to 11th grade in East Kazakhstan) and are not provided for
primary school children. According to the informants in the Turkestan region, the service was
developed as a response to the high number of suicides, and presumably, this programme
34 This program has been implemented within the framework of cooperation between the
Commissioner on Human Rights, UNICEF, and Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs along with
regional education department in East Kazakhstan at Information and Analytical Centre (IAC, 2016)

Kazakhstan has brought any significant results.
Prevention for adolescents: youth health centres
In terms of prevention services targeted at children and young people (12 to 29 years old),
youth health centres are good examples. Legally, the centres have been established by the
MPH order “On introduction of services friendly to young people” (MoH Kaz, 2006) with
further clarification of their activities in the Statute on public health organizations, directed
at the promotion of healthy lifestyles (MoH Kaz, 2011).
In 2019, there were 128 youth health centres across the country, with 115 situated in the
regional hospitals or other public health organizations, 1 placed in the higher education
institution, a dozen located in the oblast and districts centres of healthy lifestyles (National
Center for Public Health of the MoH RK, 2019b). Table 16: Number of youth health centres
provides the geographical distribution of the youth health centres.

These centres allow young people to address questions regarding sexual health and
education by accessing specialists, including gynaecologists, urologists and psychologists,
lawyers, social workers (National centre of public health of MPH, 2019). The legislative act
under consideration specifies that young people can approach the centre independently, or
they can be re-directed through the local policlinic (MoH Kaz, 2019b).
In terms of response to violence, these centres provide consultations, medical and
psychological assistance, especially to youth in crises related to reproductive health (i.e.,
sexual violence, unwanted pregnancy, STIs, etc.) (MoH Kaz, 2006). According to our
informants, the idea of creating such centres was logical, because quite often a child would
hesitate to approach school specialists, including psychologists, due to the stigma of being
branded as “weird” or “not normal” (KII-C-3). Therefore, in theory, a separate youth health
centre provides better opportunities for a teenager due to privacy (UNFPA Kazakhstan,
2020).
However, the effectiveness and efficiency of the youth health centre in many cases depend
on the director (KII-C-3). Our informants shared their concern, that even the centres were
functioning on paper, the personnel have not been qualified to work with young people.
There was no monitoring of service provision in the three existing centres in one of the
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
61
system for prevention and response to violence against children
regions of Kazakhstan, with only one being fully accessible for consultations for young
people (KII-C-3).
According to the informants in Nur Sultan, the centres did not see themselves as places for
violence prevention or violence response. However, when confronted with VAC cases, the
centres' personnel re-directed it to the policlinic level (FG-L-N-41).
Youth resource centres
Youth resource centres also direct their efforts at providing consultations to youth.
According to the Law on state youth policy, youth is defined as citizens of the Republic of
Kazakhstan from 14 to 29 years of age (GoK, 2015a).
In 2015, they were formalized by the Law on state youth policy (GoK, 2015b) as organizations
providing services (consultations and information provision) to support and develop youth
and youth organizations. Their general direction is the provision of information regarding
state and social programmes for young people. Accordingly, the focus of youth resource
centres is vulnerable young people, including young people with special needs, in conflict
with the law, young families, young repatriates36 (14 to 29 years of age), orphans and children
and young people left without parental care (14 to 29 years of age), rural youth, unemployed
youth, and Youth not in employment, education or training (NEET) (Youth Research Centre
Kazakhstan, 2017a).
The Statute on youth resource centres (2019) mentions provision of psychological support
on personal and emotional issues along with legal support to young people, and support to
the young families and young people, preparing them for family life (consultations to young
families on family and marriage affairs, development of projects and programs directed at
strengthening family values in the society) (MoJ Kaz, 2019). The Statute raises the
importance of cooperation of the centre with volunteer organizations, educational, cultural
and social organisations, but only to support volunteer activities of young people. It does not
clarify the mechanisms of cooperation, or information-sharing regarding complex cases
when the staff of the youth centre does not feel qualified to address them.
In 2019, there were 208 resource centres across Kazakhstan at the oblast, city and district
levels working with young people.37 Table 17 provides more information regarding the
geographical distribution of resources centres and the population they can potentially
serve.38

According to the informants in the Turkestan region, a youth resource centre has been
operating there since 2016 (KII-L-T-021). This centre provides psychological assistance for
young people and their parents, free music and robotics classes, computer skills and
entrepreneurial courses. The state allocates grants from 500,000 tenge for up to 5 million
tenge for young people in a difficult life situation to start up their own business (KII-L-T-
022/023).
During the evaluation, we interviewed the representatives of the “Youth resource centre of
Mangystau region” under the Department of Internal policy of Mangystau region. One of the
tasks of the resource centre is counselling adolescents and their parents, providing them
with medical, information and educational assistance and psychosocial support on issues in
the field of reproductive health, increasing interaction with organizations of the educational
system in matters of sex and gender education, psychological support to the target group,
strengthening partnerships with organizations providing medical and psychosocial
assistance to adolescents and youth (FGD-L-M). In this sense, youth health centres and youth
resource centres have the same functionality.
3.1.2. Prevention services targeting families and children at risk
There are limited prevention services targeting families and children at risk, including
targeted social assistance and social payments to the families along with services provided
by school psychologists and social pedagogues working with children attending schools (7
to 18 years of age). In contrast to the previous group of prevention services, this section looks
at services available for children coming from a family with certain vulnerability, and these
services are designed to mitigate risk factors like low income or unemployment of the
parents, or being from a family with many children. Psychological and social services
provided at school, target children who have been identified by a test or flagged by
Commission on Minors’ Affairs or Akimat. The state deserves recognition for the
development of such a complex approach to services provision with detailed eligibility
criteria, however, none of the existing services allows a child (or a family) to decide which
types or combinations of services they would prefer to receive.
Targeted social assistance (TSA)
Targeted social assistance (TSA) is a payment in cash provided by the state to individuals
(families). Per the Law “On state targeted social assistance”, TSA could be received by
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
63
system for prevention and response to violence against children
citizens, repatriates39, persons with refugee status, foreigners, stateless persons with a
residence permit and permanently residing in Kazakhstan (MoH Kaz, 2001).
There are two types of social assistance (Unconditional and conditional) as well as social
payments for households in particular situations: one-time allowance for any newborn,
monthly allowances to mother of several children, households with children with disabilities,
amongst others (Temirbayeva, 2019).
There is only one connection between social assistance and the prevention of violence
against children is found in the Standard or the provision of special social services in the field
of social protection of the population in the context of the provision of services at home. It
specifies that in the event of physical and mental violence committed in the family against
the child who receives services, the social worker should assist in bringing the perpetrators
to criminal responsibility (MoH Kaz, 2015). The standard is nevertheless silent about the need
for the social worker to provide support to families with more comprehensive programmes,
such as parenting support or other awareness-raising programmes with parents on violence
prevention or providing assistance to child victims of violence, besides helping to bring
perpetrators to justice.
Services in Schools: School psychologists and social pedagogues
Psychological service in schools has existed since the end of the 1980s, is based on the
Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Law on Education (2007), and region-specific
Rules on psychological service in public schools (USSR State Committee on Public Education,
1989). From 2014, per the Law on self-governance, every region independently introduced
rules on the organization of psychological service valid on the territory of the region
(Nursultan City Akimat, 2015; Pavlodar oblast, 2015). 40
The service is tasked with supporting the personal and intellectual growth of young people,
assisting in successful socialization, etc. In terms of VAC prevention, this service is not
provided to children who might need counselling, help, find themselves in distress or
experiencing violence at home or by a peer unless they would be noticed through routine
testing or decide to address the psychologist (or any other school representative) directly.
Conversely, the service performs every quarter a psychological diagnostic of students to
identify those prone to self-destructive behaviour (suicide) or those who attempted suicide;
students inclined to use or using psychoactive substances, alcoholic beverages, drugs;
students prone to committing offences, as well as being registered with the internal affairs
bodies; students from socially disadvantaged families; students from single-parent families,
etc (Akimat of the Kostanay Region, 2015).
The service then holds consultations to the parents or guardians and teachers in solving
psychological and pedagogical issues, suicide prevention and asocial inclinations (crime
prevention, alcohol abuse, drug abuse).
39 Qandas, former oralmans, are ethnic Kazakh people who migrated to Kazakhstan from other
countries
40 Until 2014, the school psychological service has been defined by the Rules on psychological service
in the organizations of secondary education based on (MoES Kaz, 2011)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
64
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan supports the work of
school psychologists by providing recommendations and manuals for the prevention of
deviant and self-destructive behaviour of students, determination of the level of
aggressiveness of children and the manifestation of acts of cruelty and violence, increase of
stress resistance of students, etc (IAC, 2016)
There are currently 7,652 school psychologists working across Kazakhstan41 in 7,440
secondary schools providing assistance to 3.4 million students (6 to 18 years of age).42
The evaluation was not able to find how many psychologists work in each school in the four
geographical territories covered by the evaluation. Nevertheless, according, to the
informants in Turkestan, each school has two psychologists who work with students from
different age groups (KII-L-T-011). According to the Ministry of Education and Science (2018),
there are about 300 students per 1 psychologist. However, due to the higher number of
students in Nur Sultan, Almaty and Shymkent, one psychologist is required to work with up
to 1,000 students.43 Moreover, according to our informants, school psychologists spend a lot
of time on administrative and other unrelated issues, due to unclear job descriptions, almost
anybody can require school psychologists to do things unrelated to their direct
responsibilities (KII-C-3).
When it comes to violence, the psychologist is supposed to file a report and involve a social
pedagogue who will work with the family of a child trying to assess the situation in the family
or re-direct it to the attention of school administration, school medical nurses, social services,
police, etc. According to our informants both school psychologists and social pedagogues
sabotage this work and avoid reporting cases and working with the family:
“When a child is in trouble, the school does not consider it as a signal to work with a
child. School is concerned about how to avoid punishment. The Director is not
interested to initiate certain cases, because they [the administration] will get more
pressure on the school, the school would lose funding, get a worse position in the
ratings. Schools face huge risk if they decide to address issues of violence and want to
work with the family and child” (KII-C-3).
As practice shows, in cases of violence, especially the ones that receive publicity, the school
administration is usually the ones who lose their jobs.44

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
65
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The school social pedagogues are another category of school staff working with school
children (7 to 18 years of age) from the families that have a right to apply for TSA, children
from families with low income (but not receiving TSA), orphans and children left without
parental care, children requiring urgent help in emergency situations and other categories of
children (Rules for public spending for financial and material assistance to students from
socially vulnerable groups and students from low-income families) (GoK, 2008d). The
position of the social pedagogue exists since 2009, in accordance with the Qualification
characteristics of pedagogues (MoES Kaz, 2009a).
Social pedagogues are tasked with researching psychological, medical and pedagogical
characteristics of the individual and their living conditions, identifying their interests and
needs, problems, conflict situations, deviations in the behaviour of students and providing
them with social assistance and support; acting as an intermediary between students,
schools, family, specialists of various social services, departments and administrative bodies
(MoES Kaz, 2009b).
The social pedagogue is expected to keep a database with information on every child in the
school and helps applicants to benefit from subsidies for food, transportation, free summer
camps and vacation activities, etc. The process of working with individual cases includes the
assessment and development of the individual work plan. Complicated cases are brought to
the attention of the Commission for Minors' Affairs.
According to our informants representing secondary schools, children attending schools can
seek help from a psychologist or a social pedagogue through the helpline provided by the
school or directly (FG-S-T-006; FG-L-N-41; FG-L-N-008), because psychologists and social
pedagogues work to respond to mental, physical, and domestic cases of violence. In theory,
social pedagogues work with teachers, parents or guardians of children; exchanging
necessary information with administrative and teaching staff of the school.45 However, our
informants from NGOs dealing with cases of domestic and school violence stress that
cooperation between psychologists, social pedagogues and other school administration is
lacking, due to punitive aspect: any investigation on violence leads to firing school
administration:
“In case of violence, the director gets punished. This is the rule. Even, in theory, the focus
should be on assistance (to the child), in reality, it creates an impossible situation. It is
important to change the focus from punishment, introduce it in the legislation
somehow. Schools rarely involve the police, in the majority of cases we just wait when
the child would graduate” (KII-C-3).
A more effective example of preventing violence at school is the Besterek program in the
Turkestan region. Since 2019, all schools of the Turkestan region have been working under
the Besterek program, which was created and adopted by the Reframe Centre for
Psychological Assistance, Department of Education, and Akimat of the Turkestan region.
From 2018, Reframe Centre closely interacts with the guardianship authorities, department
45 Some of the schools that participated in this evaluation had their own helpline service staffed by the
school psychologists (FG-L-N-008). In Turkestan region, the school also provided information about
availability of psychological service in mobile chat rooms and channels and mobile rapid response
groups on social networks (KII-L-T-034/KII-L-T-019).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
66
system for prevention and response to violence against children
of public health, department of internal affairs, social protection bodies, the centre for the
adaptation of minors, crisis centres, and a centre for children with deviant behaviour (KII, L-
T-003; FG-L-T-007). The centre also created a centralised database of children from the oblast
that receives information from school psychologists, social workers, and inspectors working
with minors. In cases when a schoolteacher sees or suspects signs of violence, s/he reports
the case to the school psychologist, social pedagogue, and headteacher responsible for
educational work, and the school director. According to the informants in the Turkestan
region, when school psychologists do not feel qualified to address cases of VAC (this
concerns cases of attempted suicide, and cases of sexual abuse), they can flag them in the
database mentioned earlier, and the school involves psychologists from the NGO (KII-L-T-
004, KII-S-T-062). The representatives of the local government expressed their satisfaction
with how this referral mechanism has been working over the last three years, since the NGO
helped school psychologists in the identification of children in the risk groups, who required
consultation, and provided both children and their families with required psychological
support (KII-L-T-004).
3.1.3. Response services
Specialised services for child victims of violence are very rare in Kazakhstan, both in terms of
availability and coverage. This section will touch upon social services and medical services
and law enforcement provided for children victims of violence. Support services for child
victims of violence (treatment, psycho-social and mental health, recovery and
reintegration) are mainly residential in nature, are provided both by NGOs and the State.
There is a small number of crisis centres – both state and private – available for women
victims of violence, that potentially offer services for girls.
Centres for children in difficult life situations
Centres for Support of Children in Difficult Life Situations are organisations that report to
MOES and provide special social services that allow children to reside temporarily at the
centres. The centres also share information, arrange consultations and legal services to
prevent difficult life situations (MoES Kaz, 2019b). The centres provide 8 types of special
social services to several categories of children, including children victims of violence, but
also neglected children, orphans, children whose parents have been deprived of parental
rights (MoES Kaz, 2019b). 46
There is a significant difference from the centres for adaption (see below) because children
have a right to receive consultation even if they were not directed to the centre by the
department of education. No data is available on the number and percentage of children that
request the services independently. Usually, the centre accepts children that are directed
46 These are 1. orphans; 2. children left without parental care of one or both parents due to limitation
or deprivation of their parental rights; 3. neglected and street children placed in the centre to identify
parents or other legal representatives; 4. children with deviant behaviour; 5. children sent to special
educational organisations; 6. children in a difficult life situation as a result of abuse, which led to social
maladjustment and social deprivation; 7. children, whose vital activity has been disrupted as a result
of the prevailing circumstances and who cannot overcome these circumstances on their own or with
the help of their families.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
67
system for prevention and response to violence against children
there by the Department of Education, along with the Commission on minors’ affairs (MoES
Kaz, 2019b) KII-L-T-001; KII-L-N-006).
The centres try to reproduce family environment, provide social and psychological assistance
to children and their parents, work on the identification of the social status of the child;
provide for the protection of their rights and interests, provide support to children who will
be living in the foster families (MoES Kaz, 2019b). The centre acts as a temporary setting
providing services for up to 6 months for a child residing in the centre or allowing them to
visit the centre and use the facilities during the daytime. The centres for children in difficult
life situations have usually a psychologist and a social worker.
In 2018, there were 19 centres, including 13 situated in regional centres, and 6 are in the cities
of Astana, Almaty, Semey, Zhezkazgan, Shymkent and Temirtau. They are regulated by the
MoES Order “On Approval of the Standard Rules for Types of Educational Organizations for
Orphans and Children Left Without Parental Care" (Appendix 6 "Standard rules for keeping
minors in centres for adaptation of minors") (2013). The representative of one of the centres
interviewed for this evaluation also mentioned the rules for the provision of public service
“Conduct of state scientific and technical expertise” (MoES Kaz, 2020b) as a legal act that
supports their functioning (FG-S-M-015).
Crisis Centres for Victims of Domestic Violence.
Another service model mentioned by several informants is the Crisis Centres for Victims of
Domestic Violence. They provide services to women with children according to the Standard
on special social services (FG-L-N-007) and can be run both by the State and NGOs. The first
crisis centres were created in 2002, even before the introduction of the Domestic Violence
Prevention Law in 2009 (MoH Kaz, 2019a; NSO Kaz, 2017a; UNFPA Kazakhstan, 2017; UNFPA
Kazakhstan & NSO Kaz, 2017).
According to NGO representatives, these centres should not be treated as shelters, because
they provide multiple services, including shelter, but also psychological, legal, and social
assistance47 (FGD-S-M; KII-S-M). Indeed, crisis centres provide 8 types of special social
services per the MPH Standard No. 1079 (fr0m December 21, 2016), in compliance with the
Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Special Social Services": medical, legal, psychological,
related to employment, economic, etc.
The standard uses the term “victim of domestic violence” as a person that could have been
subjected to domestic violence, and who received psychological, physical harm and/or harm
to their property. The level of harm is determined based on the Criteria for assessing the
presence of cruel treatment leading to social maladjustment and social deprivation,
approved by the joint order of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan
(September 22, 2014, No. 630), the Minister of Education and Science (September 26, 2014,
No. 399) and the Minister health care and social development (November 19, 2014, No. 240).
Criteria define “abuse leading to social maladjustment and social deprivation” as domestic
violence, trafficking of people (including minors), exploitation, kidnapping (MoIA Kaz et al.,
47 https://eca.unwomen.org/ru/news/stories/2016/10/kazakhstans-nonstate-domestic-violence-crisis-
centres-seek-funding
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
68
system for prevention and response to violence against children
2021). The criteria allow assigning a grade to abuse, which includes physical violence, mental
violence, economic violence, sexual violence.
Victims of violence could be re-directed to the crisis centre (shelter) by departments of
employment and social protection; public health departments, department of internal
affairs, or following the direct statement from a victim that arrived at the crisis centre or
shelter.
Based on the statement from the victim of violence the centre conducts identification
following the criteria for assessing the presence of cruel treatment leading to social
maladjustment and social deprivation. Identification takes place with the participation of the
representative of the department of internal affairs, along with the social worker and
psychologist. Based on the identification, the centre fills in the evaluation list. If the identified
person is classified as a victim of domestic violence, the crisis centre sends the evaluation list
to the departments of social protection regarding the provision of special social services
(MoH Kaz, 2017a). In cases when the person cannot be identified as a victim of domestic
violence, they cannot be provided with special social services.
According to the informants, enrolment in the centre and service provision becomes possible
only after a woman submits a written statement to the police, regarding the case of violence
(KII-L-T-001).48 However, psychological violence does not trigger the opening of the case
(FGD-S-EK). Acceptance becomes more complicated when a victim of violence resides in a
different town because service provision is location-specific (KII-S-EK-001).
In comparison with the state-run centres, crisis centres ran by NGOs would still accept a
woman, even without a written statement submitted to the police.49 This flexibility of
acceptance standards, demonstrated by NGOs, potentially provide for better protection and
faster support to the victim.
The existing standard does not specify the age group of service recipients: but it is implied
that all victims of violence and service recipients are adults. The standard does not specify if
the victim has to be a female: the language in the standard refers to the “victims of domestic
violence”, as mentioned earlier (MoH Kaz, 2017a). Therefore, theoretically, the standard
provides for acceptance of male victims by crisis centres. Indeed, male victims of violence
also request help from the crisis centres. According to the Union of Crisis Centres, the staff
provides psychological support and consultations to the male victims, however, they do not
direct them to the shelter, since it is occupied by mothers with children.50
Both state and NGO-run centres accept a person that arrives with a child, so the child will be
accepted by the centre (MoH Kaz, 2017a). In reality, it is the only occasion when the standard
mentions children: a victim might arrive at the crisis centre (and shelter) with a child, and that
48 In 2019, 8,000 cases were redirected to the crisis centres by representatives of police, which
constitute 60 per cent of all number of people who received help at crisis centres. See (UNFPA
Kazakhstan, 2019)

children will be considered as separate service recipients (MoH Kaz, 2017a). Our respondents
also confirmed that crisis centres for victims of domestic violence regard children as
secondary recipients because the primary ones are their mothers (KII-S-EK-001; KII-S-N-001).
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there are 40 crisis centres for victims of
domestic violence that provided assistance to 24 000 women who were subjected to
domestic violence in 2020 (MoIA Kaz, 2020b). Based on the data from the NSO, there were
33 centres in 2019 and only 27 centres had shelters (NSO Kaz, 2017b). In the case of NGO ran
crisis centres, they would still rely on state support, which is usually temporary.51
Table 18 shows the regional distribution of crisis centres in evaluated regions, along with the
number of calls related to violence these centres processed in 2019. The numbers are not
disaggregated by age groups and gender, so it is not possible to determine how many girls
or children were amongst the clients of the centres. The crisis centre in the Mangystau region
seems to underreport calls related to violence, or victims of violence do not reach out to the
crisis centre. The number of people who received assistance from the Mangystau crisis
centre is significantly lower, compared to other regions.

Children and the law: juvenile justice, interdistrict juvenile courts, and psychologist support
In 2009-2011, Kazakhstan has introduced a Concept for the development of juvenile justice,
that allowed creating specialized interdistrict courts on issues of children in large cities and
regional centres of the country. This is the culmination of several reform initiatives related to
children and justice, that started in 2004 and had a major legislative milestone in 2008 and
2014 (Carolyn Hamilton;Awaz Raoof, 2014; Chistyakov & Naurzalieva, 2020; GoK, 2008c,
51 Funding depends on participation in the tenders for social state order, and NGOs treat this funding
as temporary, since it lasts only for the length of a project that was won during the tender. (Sultan,
2020)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
70
system for prevention and response to violence against children
2008a; RoK, 2004a, 2008; Taitorina & Bogatyreva, n.d.; UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2015a).52 These
courts deal with cases where the victims or suspects are underage children 6 to 18 years of
age (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2015a). Each minor is provided with a lawyer and a psychologist at
the expense of the state budget, and interrogations can only take place in the presence of a
legal representative, a psychologist and a lawyer. Sentences in the courts on issues of
children depend on the age of the child - the younger the child, the softer the sentence.
The courts on issues of children had worked on creating a child-friendly atmosphere. There
are no bars in any of the rooms, while a court hearing takes place in the form of a dialogue
between an adult and a child. Courts on issues of children also introduced rooms for holding
hearings and interviews with minor children participating in court proceedings. For example,
children who have become witnesses or victims of a crime, as well as those who have broken
the law, can be questioned by the court in a separate room. The child, without entering the
courtroom, gives evidence and answers questions in the presence of a legal representative
and a psychologist, while the video is transmitted from this room to the courtroom (UNICEF
Kazakhstan, 2015b)53
Courts on issues of children consider criminal, administrative and civil cases (Chistyakov &
Naurzalieva, 2020; UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2015a). Civil cases concern determining the child's
place of residence; deprivation (restriction) and restoration of parental rights; on the
adoption of a child; referral of minors to special educational organizations or organizations
with a special regime of detention, disputes related to custody and guardianship over
minors.54 The court on issues of children also considers administrative cases related to the
improper performance of parental responsibilities for the upbringing and education of
children; selling tobacco products to teenagers; drunken minors in public places, the use of
narcotic, psychotropic substances; the presence of minors in entertainment establishments
without legal representatives at night, etc.
According to the East Kazakhstan specialized court, the law enforcement practice
concerning minors who find themselves in conflict with the law has significantly changed
after the introduction of juvenile courts. The punitive practice has noticeably decreased.
Imprisonment to minors is imposed only in extreme cases.55
Originally, it was planned to create a position of a social worker in the court ((UNICEF
Kazakhstan, Hamilton, et al., 2015)). This social worker after receiving information regarding
a new case was supposed to be involved in researching the case, living conditions of the
minor and upbringing. However, in Kazakhstan, this position was not introduced (Taitorina
& Bogatyreva, n.d.), instead all specialized juvenile courts have contracted psychologists.
Psychologists also make proposals on measures necessary to prevent juvenile delinquency in
the future, suggest ways to adapt and correct his/her behaviour.

Thus, psychologists provide the court with consulting assistance in understanding the
personality of minors and also participate in the process of his re-education.56 If in the
nineties there were about a thousand convicted minors throughout Kazakhstan, today one
educational colony for boys in Almaty contains about 37 convicts. "
However, justice for children is not only courts, but a set of services – including law
enforcement agencies, social psychologists, pedagogical services and others. During the
hearing proceedings that might last for some months, the children are provided with an
option of social adaptation. The juvenile courts involve local NGOs that sign a special
agreement, including centres "Pravo", "Chance", Public Foundation "Centre of Social
Adaptation of Children". These NGOs place the main emphasis on organizing children's
leisure time, including the study of foreign languages, swimming, hiking, music classes, etc.57
Courts on issues of children have authority to place minors in a special educational
organization, per Chapter 33-1 of the Civil Procedure Code. Per this provision, "the
guardianship and adoption authorities" and Departments of internal affairs can apply to the
court to place a minor in a special school for children with "deviant" behaviour or an
institution with a special containment regime. In practice, the guardianship and adoption
authority, police and other government authorities, including schools and orphanages, can
use their power to place minors who, as they believe show "deviant behaviour" in places of
deprivation of freedom. However, these children may also be at risk of violence, need care
and protection, or be at risk of conflict with the law and/or have psychological issues.
The Supreme Court has been taking steps since June 2014 to ensure that each court has an
attending psychologist or a psychologist from an external organization that can assist on a
part-time basis. Certain NGOs state that they provide psychological services to the juvenile
courts, including the «Institute of Equal Rights & Equal Opportunities in Kazakhstan» in
Almaty, the «Positive Development» Private Institution in Karaganda, and «Sana Sezim» in
Shymkent. As is the case with psychologists, the attendance of social workers varies,
although it is particularly low in administrative cases. Kazakhstan’s law does not require that
a qualified social worker should be involved in cases that are considered in the juvenile court
(UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2015b).
Centre of adaptation (TSAN) for children
As it was mentioned earlier, the Courts on issues of children can make a decision to direct
children “in a difficult life situation as a result of abuse, that led to the social maladjustment
and social deprivation” into the Centre of adaptation (TSAN) for children. The court’s
decision provides a legal basis for accepting a child. There are three other categories of
children who are directed to these centres: neglected children and street children aged from

system for prevention and response to violence against children
The centre is tasked with the prevention of neglect and social adaptation of children (FGD-S-
EK, FGD-L-EK). Children of 4 to 18 years old could reside at the centre for up to three months
(KII-S-M-001). After the end of three month period, the child will be sent either back to the
family, or to a different residential institution, based on the decision of the Commission on
affairs of minors (KII-S-M-001).
When children are accepted into the centre, they are going through a medical check, and a
person filling in the form on accepting a child into the centre has to make a note of any traces
of physical violence. While at the Centre, children receive social and psychological assistance
(their parents also can have access to this assistance). Centres have psychologists, social
pedagogues, paediatricians, and nurses (Gok, 2008). According to our informants, specialists
develop an individual care plan for each child, however, the staff does not have standardized
referral protocols, and in their absence, they use existing legislation and the charter of the
centre (FG-S-EK-034).
In 2019, 6,953 children were accepted by these centres: from 2015 the number of children has
been decreasing by about 7 per cent annually. According to the National Statistical Office,
about 85 per cent of the children accepted by the centres are considered neglected or
homeless, while children in difficult life situations constitute about 1 per cent of the total
number of children.58 According to the Committee on child rights, 67 parents were brought
to administrative responsibility for improper performance of their duties under Article 127,
paragraph 3 of Article 409 of the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Administrative
Offenses".59 According to our informants, children that were accepted to the centre of
adaptation due to violence constitute a very small number (FG-S-M-015).

activists and expert groups, such as academics and professional organizations. On the other
hand, services need to be adapted to the specific need of the individual. To that end,
mechanisms of needs assessment and case management need to be applied.
According to the legislation, social workers providing special social services to children and
their families (at the place of residence or in a centre where the services are provided) rely
on needs assessment. The 2008 Law on Special Social Services (Art. 14-1) has provided an
opportunity for social workers to assess population needs in specialized social services based
on the information received from local executive bodies (GoK, 2008). At the local level, this
assessment is undertaken by a social worker, after receiving the information from local
executive organs. However, service provision is based on appeals made by beneficiaries
themselves. Therefore, certain groups, including persons with disabilities, migrants, and
others who might not be aware of this opportunity, have no access to service provision.
Moreover, in some cases, the needs assessment provided by the social worker is a mere
formality.
However, in some cases the needs assessment procedures are difficult to access by users,
are too standard and often neither adequate nor adapted. This has been reported in the case
of children with disabilities - regulated by an application procedure (GoK, 2008b, sec. three)-
where limited responsiveness and limitation of dedication is detected (Parliament Kaz, 2016).
Likewise, social pedagogues and psychologists working with school children use the testing
of school children every quarter as a method of identifying the most vulnerable ones (usually,
the ones prone to suicidal behaviour, which can be considered as a practice of child labelling,
instead of helping them). Similarly, social pedagogues attending to families in difficult life
situations tend to focus their efforts on providing the basic goods and amenities (as one of
the social pedagogues started describing what she does: “I provide children from vulnerable
families with a free meal at school” (FG-S-M_007)).
According to our informants, Turkestan oblast provides an example, when declared
principles are being implemented due to the willingness of the akimat (and Department of
Human Development) to involve NGOs and parental community and introduce psychological
needs assessment in their work with the parents and children (KII-L-T-002).

TORs) – EQ3.3-(12)
Evaluation criteria - Relevance
Existing Standard Operation Procedures do not take into account the specific vulnerability of
children victims of violence, including the gender of children-victims of violence, or their age,
or disability, urban or rural background or other characteristics, like migration status or
ethnic origin (KII-S-EK). Existing services do not have unified codes of conduct or clear
operating procedures when it comes to different forms of VAC. Response services are similar
for children of any age, girls and boys, children with disabilities, or children from rural or
urban settings (KII-S-EK). However, there are few exceptions, where services do take into
account specific vulnerabilities of children.
The universal progressive model of home visits model, described above, is focused on
pregnant women and the risks they face, including nutrition, depression, medical risks, bad
habits and social risks – everything that affects the provision of the needs of women and
young children (Gesaworld, 2019). Due to the existence of progressive patronage aspect,
that service significantly improves service availability for children from vulnerable and socially
excluded families, because the patronage worker is required to work with families who face
barriers to accessing health and social services (migrant families, families with cultural or
religious beliefs, families in difficult life situations, any other socially excluded families)
(Babayeva et al., 2018). Therefore, the universal progressive model of home visitation makes
detection of and response to VAC cases (especially in vulnerable groups of the population)
more likely.
In the Turkestan region, due to the established cooperation between the NGOs and schools,
and their specific focus on the psychological wellbeing of children, according to informants,
all schools have two psychologists who work with children from different age groups (9 to
13, and 14 to 17) (KII-L-T-011). School psychologists in Turkestan do not provide assistance to
children with disabilities, as they are not sufficiently qualified. Such children are sent to
special rooms of pedagogical and psychological correction (KII-L-T-028/030).
In 2019, Human Rights Watch conducted series of interviews with adult survivors of domestic
violence in Kazakhstan. Police response to violence was mentioned as one of the serious
shortcomings, including a refusal to accept a victim complaint, failure to ensure that women
are informed of their right to a protection order, and attempts to dissuade victims to make
an official appeal. According to some survivors, police insistently asked them to reconcile
with the abuser (HRW, 2019). In interviews with HRW, staff from both state and non-

governmental crisis centres also noted that police did not take domestic violence seriously
or considered it a crime.
Our informants have mentioned that representatives of law enforcement agencies do not
take into consideration the age of children and specifics of children’s psychological condition
during the investigation (KII-C-10, KII-S-T-062). Representatives of law enforcement bodies
do not treat children as a vulnerable category of victims, acting rudely and aggressively
towards children. One NGO representative who works with children-survivors of violence
said:
“Children receive another emotional trauma during the investigation because
investigators are not taught to talk to children. We had a case when a 13-year old girl
jumped from the building because the investigator did not believe her statement that
she was sexually abused. Another girl had an emotional breakdown during the
investigation because the investigator put the pants of the violator in front of her on
the table.” (KII-C-10).

Evaluation criteria -Relevance
Government and service providers decisions did not ensure the continuing functioning of
VAC services at local levels. During Covid-19 pandemics, many government agencies closed
their offices and worked online. Schools have switched to remote education. Some crisis
centres have been turned into provisional hospitals.
Most of the measures directed at prevention at the level of schools have been cancelled
(FGD-L-EK): school psychologists switched to remote work with children, which introduced
an additional challenge, since it was impossible to identify whether children experience
violence at home (KII-S-M) (in contrast to state kindergartens that continued to function but
had limited number of children – 15 that were later on increased to 25 in April 2021 - who were
able to attend them (KII-S-M).
To support school psychologists, MoES and the Centre of mental health of the Ministry of
Public Health have developed a website that provided materials for school psychologists in
working with children and their families (MoH Kaz, n.d.). According to NGO representatives
who work with school psychologists across Kazakhstan, the low level of internet literacy did
not allow psychologists and social pedagogues to use the tool, with only 30 per cent of them
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
76
system for prevention and response to violence against children
being able to access it. The informants mentioned the complaints they heard from the
psychologists:
“We do not understand online. We don’t know-how. We don’t want to learn… The
ministry has reported: we created the website, and the rest was delegated to the
specialists. It was up to them (psychologists) to use it. As a result, we got a huge hole
(dyrka) when it came to practice.” (KII-C-3).
An informant in one of the evaluated regions reports a significant drop in the quality of the
provided psychological service, due to the lack of privacy: parents were present during the
sessions with the psychologists, and children felt uncomfortable sharing information (FG-S-
M-007).
There was a lack of initiative and direction provided at the school level when it concerned
working with children, especially children in the risk group. Informants report that in many
cases it depended on the class principal: therefore,
“in cases when a principal was focused on children, children had an opportunity to reach
out to teachers and administration” (KII-C-3).
However, many of the teachers felt overwhelmed and burned out during the first months of
lockdown. According to the survey on changes to teaching that occurred during the
pandemic, teachers’ working hours have lengthened to 13-15 hours per day, teachers
mentioned impossibility to teach from their houses due to the level of noise and lack of
privacy. 66 per cent of teachers who participated in the survey, had 4 or more people residing
in the same apartment with them during the lockdown.60 Informants mention that as a result
“children fell out of the (education) system”: many children did not attend online classes for
weeks, and teachers had no idea what was happening with those children (KII-C-3).
According to some reports, the situation with violence has significantly worsened, and the
number of cases of domestic violence has increased: (KII-S-M-006).61 One of the informants
makes a connection between the cases of violence and children being left in the closed
apartments: the school and school attendance “was a restraining factor” for the abusers (KII-
C-10).
An informant in Nur Sultan mentions that some children filed applications for deprivation of
parental rights due to the fact of domestic violence. These official appeals were considered
by the Commission on minors’ affairs, and in some cases, children were granted separation
from their parents. However, there is an additional complication in cases when children were
17 to 18 years old. Authorities are reluctant to grant these rights to children, because the
process takes several months, including submission of the statement to the Commission on
Minors’ affairs (1 month), followed by the process when the guardianship authorities
together with the juvenile police prepare materials for the court (2 months), followed by the
court hearing and court decision coming into legal force (another month). In cases like this,
the parent is threatened by the Commission on Minors Affairs, which dismisses the case (KII-
S-N-001).

In one of the regions, the centre for victims of domestic violence experienced an increase in
the number of applications from survivors, but due to a small number of places, the staff was
unable to accommodate them (FG-M-017). In another region, a crisis centre for women
victims of violence has been transformed into the COVID hospital, so the staff of the crisis
centre did not accept any women for three summer months in 2020, while there was no
availability to provide services online (KII-S-EK-001).
In the evaluated regions, the crisis centres, and the centres for children in difficult life
situations did not accept children without a negative PCR test.62 Children who required help
were not re-directed to the centre of adaptation, because it was closed for quarantine.
Therefore, an NGO, that has been involved in this case, covered the costs of the PCR tests
and temporarily kept children and women with children in their premises or homes of the
staff while victims of violence (FG-S-N-018). NGO expenses on the PCR tests have not been
compensated by the state, due to the lack of funding.

Evaluation criteria -Sustainability
Social innovation connects public services with private initiatives to generate new responses
to emerging challenges (Mulgan, 2019). The challenge in Kazakhstan does not seem so much
related to generating new ideas, but to transition programmes, that have proven successful,
to public policies that guarantee the rights of the citizens to access them. There seems to be
an immense landscape of pilot projects, but the uptake towards a systematic public policy, is
often blocked by lack of rigorous evidence, rapid retreat of funding without considerations
for handing over, and in general a rigid and bureaucratic attitude towards the much-needed
co-production of services between state and society (Osborne, 2018).
Two services meet conditions for scaling up. Piloting of patronage home visitation
programme and UNICEF programme on violence through the development of social and
emotional skills of students have proved to be effective. The Turkestan programme requires
a separate evaluation that would allow to interview teachers and administration across all
regions and visit school sites. Already existing patronage home visitation programmes
proved to be successful in decreasing the cases of child mortality and household injuries
among children. However, the pilot also demonstrated the importance of coordination
between patronage nurses, healthcare managers, representatives of akimats, along with the

importance of training for PHC staff (Babayeva et al., 2018). This recommendation remains
relevant even now.
The 2014 UNICEF Kazakhstan programme on violence prevention through the development
of social and emotional skills of students, and response to violence. The program has
involved 7 state schools and 3 boarding schools to develop a system for detecting,
responding, and preventing violence in schools, creating School Safety Teams, a mechanism
for redirecting cases of violence, etc (IAC, 2016). A primary prevention curriculum for school
children (UNICEF & Haarr, 2014) developed within the frameworks of this focuses on creating
a school-wide system of change teaching ethical rules, positive behaviour, enhancing
students’ communication, problem student and conflict resolution skills. The programme has
been planned for scaling up but due to the lack of funding certain elements of the
programme should be introduced only 2023-2024.
Turkestan region demonstrated a good experience of cooperation between an NGO
Reframe and Department of Human Development under the Akimat in implementation of
the Besterek program, with the involvement of school psychologists and social pedagogues
and parental community. The cooperation and coordination between the NGO and state
agencies led to the decrease in the statistics of suicide attempts among adolescents within a
year after the introduction of this program. The Turkestan region akimat plans to extend this
program to 2025 to train more psychologists to work with parents on domestic and
psychological violence (KII –L-T-001).

Evaluation criteria -Impact*
An essential starting point for any State action to combat VAC is robust and regular
measurement of violence indicators, which in turn can help to track progress over time.
Ideally, such measurement should cover children across different age groups and record all
forms of violence across different settings. The requirement of countries to report on
progress towards the SDGs provides an excellent opportunity for governments to start
strengthening their data gathering systems on violence63 (Know Violence in Childhood, 2017).
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has taken considerable steps to develop its national surveillance
system on violence against children. With the support from UN agencies, it carried out
several nationally representative surveys (amongst them MICS, VAW, and HBSC)
(Abdrakhmanova et al., 2019; UNFPA Kazakhstan, 2014; UNFPA Kazakhstan & NSO Kaz, 2017).
The new survey on violence against women is currently under development and the survey
will include indicators on violence against girls. Kazakhstan has the capacity at the national
level to produce national reports on children and families drawing from existing criminal
administrative data (NSO, 2017) and newly generated data from surveys (KISD, 2020). These
surveys track and report on some forms of violence against children, especially violent
discipline against children by parents and caregivers and peer-violence in schools. MICS
reports allow to see trends and progression since they were carried out twice, moreover, it
will produce a new set of data in the near future.
Surveillance through the use of criminal and administrative data has nevertheless lagged, and
little progress has been made since 2011. As of 2020, Kazakhstan still lacks national standards
and indicators for collective data on VAC and no inter-agency protocols to facilitate the
63 In 2015, with the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the global community made
a commitment to end all forms of violence against children by 2030. The SDGs include specific targets
for measuring progress towards ending violence against children. In particular, Goal 16 on promoting
just, peaceful and inclusive societies, includes two targets that explicitly relate to violence: Target 16.1,
“Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere”; and Target 16.2, “End
abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence and torture of children”

sharing of administrative data across sectors and ministries, agencies and service providers
(Haarr, 2020).
The only institution with the mandate to manage, analyse and disseminate data on VAC is the
Committee for Legal Statistics and Special Accounts of the Office of the General Prosecutor
of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Committee’s data on VAC, however, comes only from
data on crimes against children that are registered/recorded by the police under the aegis of
the MoIA and processed through the judicial system.
Without the regular collection of data across sectors and systems, it is hard for Kazakhstan
to develop, plan, execute public policies on VAC that are based on baselines and monitor their
effectiveness in reducing the prevalence of VAC across the country, per age group, sex or any
other criteria.
4.1.1. National surveillance system
As of 2011, MICS were carried out in Kazakhstan in 2010/2011 (MICS4) (NSO Kaz et al., 2012)and
2015 (MICS5) (NSO Kaz et al., 2017; UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2017b). MICS6 is in the design phase
and is expected to be carried out in 2021-22.
UNICEF supported the national government to carry out the surveys: in 2010/11 MICS were
officially carried out by the National Statistical Office; UNICEF provided technical and
financial support and UNFPA co-financed them (NSO Kaz et al., 2012). In 2015, MICS were
carried out by the National Statistical Office of the Ministry of National Economy of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, which also financed a significant part of the survey activities and
made an in-kind contribution. The majority of the funding came from UNICEF and UNFPA
(NSO Kaz et al., 2016). However, the national government has increased its financial and in-
kind contributions between 2010/11 and 2015.
Both MICS collected three indicators that are relevant to understanding the level of some
forms of violence in the families: these are inappropriate care of children under 5; the
discipline of children 0-14 years old, including psychological and physical aggression, and
attitudes towards physical punishment; women’s attitudes (15-49 years old) towards
domestic violence. Indicators are disaggregated by sex, residence, age, wealth index
quintiles, ethnicity of the household head.
From 2015, the National Statistical Office produces an annual edition of the Children of
Kazakhstan Statistical Yearbook, that presents a general analysis of the main indicators,
characterizing the situation of children in the Republic of Kazakhstan: the latest edition
covers four years from 2015 to 2019 (NSO Kaz, 2020). This edition provides data on
demographic characteristics, health and healthy lifestyle, education, leisure, social
protection of children, children in conflict with the law, children's well-being and social
Inequality, employment of youth, and international comparisons. Provided data was
disaggregated by gender and age group, based on the availability of relevant information
from the National Statistical Office, as well as from other ministries and agencies involved in
the collection of data.
The yearbook provides data on the number of orphans, children left without parental care
and children with disabilities, along with the number of different residential institutions for
children. In particular, the yearbook mentions centres for adaptation, that are available for
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
81
system for prevention and response to violence against children
child victims of abuse and violence. According to this document, in 2011, there were no
children victims of violence at the centres of adaptation, while in 2015, the centres accepted
102 such children, which corresponds to 1.3 per cent out of the total number of 7.648 children
at the centres countrywide (NSO, 2017).
The yearbook provides statistics on registered criminal offences of adults against children,
which is directly linked to VAC. The highest numbers are related to sexual violence (738 cases
in 2015, which is significantly higher, when compared to 79 cases in 2000, or 377 cases in
2019). The publication reports several minors affected by criminal assault (2 223 in 2019). It is
unclear, how this is different from the criminal offences of adults, but the numbers specify
assaults resulting in death and serious health damage.
VAC indicators in the statistical yearbook seem to be ill-defined since definitions of forms of
violence are missing. Their main sources seem to come from criminal court proceedings and
their number is low, with the highest numbers related to sexual violence. The types of
violence covered in the yearbook include the murder of newborns by mothers; sexual
intercourse and other acts of a sexual nature with a person under the age of sixteen years;
deprivation of children. None of the indicators above is broken down by age group/gender
or any other dimension. Moreover, the yearbook does not specify how much these data
inform public policies and programmes.
The yearbook also demonstrates existing capacity at the national level to publish annual
reports on VAC based upon administrative data from across sectors and ministries, agencies
and service providers. The Government, however, does not produce such annual reports on
VAC.
Kazakhstan Institute for Social Development has produced a report devoted to Kazakhstan
families in 2020. This was a study that looked at the state of Kazakhstan families to develop
recommendations to improve family policy in the country. In chapter 4, the report notes
that currently in the Republic of Kazakhstan there is no unified system for monitoring and
collecting information on cases of domestic violence and there is no official statistics on that
issue. The problem of domestic violence is latent: many victims of violence do not seek help
and support from law enforcement agencies due to their helplessness: age (for minors),
psychological characteristics of the individual (for example, already formed psychological
syndromes and addiction), fear of repetition and aggravation of the fact of violence, and a
virtual lack of faith in the provision of assistance by law enforcement authorities. There is also
no statistical record of fatalities due to moderate and severe harm to health, torture and
rape. According to the authors of the report, if these data would be taken into account, the
real statistics of deaths due to domestic violence would exceed the official figures (KISD,
2020).
In 2017- 2018, the National Centre of Public Health, with the support of the MoPH and the
MoES conducted the first national survey on Health Behaviour in schoolchildren (HBSC) aged
11, 13 and 15. The study was based on HBSC methodology, a WHO collaborative cross-national
survey that provides information about the health, well-being, social conditions and health
behaviours of boys and girls (Abdrakhmanova et al., 2019), and the staff of the National
Centre participated in the development of the survey protocol and questionnaire and
conducting the focus group discussions. The full report follows two pilot studies in Aktobe
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
82
system for prevention and response to violence against children
(2014), Kyzylorda and Mangystau regions (2015).64 The evaluation was not able to find
evidence on whether the Kazakhstan government (NSO) has contributed to the funding of
the survey. The next report should be produced in four years.
The survey had as an explicit objective to establish the basis to monitor and influence policies,
programmes and measures promoting the health and wellbeing of young people in a school
setting. The results of the HBSC are supposed to be used to inform the policy at the national
and regional level to develop medical service provision at Kazakhstan schools. According to
the authors, the data was needed to start promoting healthy lifestyles among school
students, and in particular, this survey has informed the European Network of Health
Promoting Schools project that started in Kazakhstan and currently involves 806 schools (it
was piloted in 2017 in Almaty, Nur Sultan, Mangystau and Kyzylorda regions).65
In terms of relevant VAC indicators that the survey collected, the report mainly covers peer-
to-peer violence (amongst young adolescents) of physical and psychological nature,
including via the use of ITC: physical fighting (percentage of boys and girls involved in
physical fighting three or more times), bullying and cyberbullying both as victims and
perpetrators. There is data on relationships with the parents, peers, and teachers, along with
the level of support children receive from these groups.
As this was the first survey carried out, it is not possible to compare prevalence and trends
over the years. The report mostly focuses on statements without any attempt to find
correlations between the indicators or generalize the results. This study was based on the
self-report questionnaires, that allow the collection of a large amount of quantitative data,
however, this method is known for social desirability bias, when respondents provide socially
acceptable answers. There are certain inconsistencies in the results of the survey (i.e., 90 per
cent of respondents state their satisfaction with life, while 20% of participants report signs of
depression, and 25% state problems with their health), that are not addressed by the authors
(Abrakhmanova et al., 2019).
In 2020, UNICEF Kazakhstan has requested an assessment of administrative data on VAC,
which was conducted by an international consultant. According to the report, the
Government of Kazakhstan has taken very few steps to develop or improve administrative
data on VAC across each of the sectors, even though the Government has spent the past
decade researching the prevalence of VAC across settings in the country, has created a
discourse on VAC, has banned the use of corporal punishment in schools, and has taken steps
to improve responses to VAC. These are very important steps to improving understanding of
and responses to VAC, however, they need to be coupled with the development of
administrative data management systems on VAC across sectors and
ministries/agencies/organizations (Haarr, 2020).

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
83
system for prevention and response to violence against children
There are no national standards or protocols for collective administrative data on VAC and
no inter-agency agreements or protocols to facilitate the sharing of admin data on VAC
across sectors and ministries, agencies and service providers (Haarr, 2020).
The only institution with the mandate to manage, analyse and disseminate data on VAC is
the Committee for Legal Statistics and Special Accounts of the Office of the General
Prosecutor of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Committee’s data on VAC, however, comes
only from data on crimes against children that are registered/recorded by the police under
the aegis of the MoIA and processed through the judicial system. Police and courts have a
computer-based data management system to manage their data and an agreement to share
this data with the Committee on Legal Statistics and Special Accounts of the General
Prosecutor. Nevertheless, this data is limited to that collected by the police and courts and it
does not include data on VAC from the education, health or child protection sectors, or NGO
service providers (Haarr, 2020).
Given the lack of a national action plan on VAC, there are no national indicators related to
VAC that serve to measure the performance of ministries and agencies, and service
providers to protect children from violence and provide child victims with support services.
There are no national standards or protocols for collecting administrative data on VAC (i.e.,
that serve to guide ministries and agencies across sectors and service providers) and no inter-
agency agreements or protocols to facilitate the sharing of administrative on VAC across
sectors and ministries, agencies and service provider (Haarr, 2020). Indicators that exist
relate to registered criminal offences committed against children, with a particular focus
on sexual offences, child homicides and child suicides (even child suicides are not necessarily
criminal offences). These data are collected by MoIA and the courts and compiled, analysed
and disseminated by the Committee on Legal Statistics and Special Accounts.
According to the assessment, schools are currently not mandated to collect incidents on VAC
on school property. However, health workers (doctors, nurses) are mandated/legally
required to record/register incidents of child maltreatment, abuse and violence, but are not
required to record/register incidents of sexual assault/rape. Currently, the MoH has no
system for collecting data on domestic violence and they do not have records of sexual abuse
against children. However, in keeping with the Manual on Effective Investigation and
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
commonly known as the Istanbul Protocol, the MoH is trying to create a proper database at
the MoH that will collect administrative data on violence and improve their system to report
crimes of violence to the police (Haarr, 2020).
In terms of disaggregation, the assessment found that at the national level and across each of
the sectors, ministries and agencies did not have some good practices for disaggregating
VAC administrative data (Haarr, 2020).
In Kazakhstan, VAC administrative data that are collected are under-analysed and under-
utilized. Limited VAC administrative data are compiled, analysed, reported on or
disseminated. It is not clear from this assessment in what ways VAC administrative data are
analysed and utilized by ministries, agencies and service providers. It was noted, however,
that MoIA generates special reports on children under 18 years of age. The desk review did
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
84
system for prevention and response to violence against children
not reveal these reports, so it appears that these reports may be produced only for internal
purposes. Administrative data on VAC that is collected is not used to its fullest potential.
In 2019, the National Statistical Office (NSO) joined the Inter-Agency Expert Group on VAC
Measurement (IAEG-VAC) led by UNICEF, but there is still no agency/institution or
technical/expert working group responsible for monitoring the quality of administrative data
on VAC, and there is no dedicated budget for monitoring and evaluation of the relevance,
accuracy and timeliness of administrative data on VAC. There is, however, a technical/expert
working group on data related to violence against women (VAW).
Overall, in Kazakhstan, indicators related to VAC are limited at the national level and lacking
at the sectoral level. The few indicators that are regularly collected, analysed and
disseminated by the government, are the ones related to criminal offences committed
against children, with a particular focus on sexual offences, child homicide and child suicides
(although these last examples are not necessarily criminal offences (Haarr, 2020).
4.1.2. Monitoring and complaint mechanisms
Human Rights Institutions established in Kazakhstan has played a significant role in
monitoring and exposing the status of violence against children in Kazakhstan. Although not
fully compliant with the Paris Principles, the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights
has been championing the issue of violence against children in state-run institutions, in
schools and lately in the family. Under the same office, the National Prevention Mechanism
to prevent torture is mandated to visit children’s institutions. An Ombudsperson for children
was appointed in 2016, but without the necessary resources to exercise its functions. Finally,
in 2020, during his annual address to the nation, the President mentioned the importance of
ratifying the Third Optional Protocol to the CRC on communication procedure. The project of
the presidential decree that would ratify the Third Optional Protocol has been published in
June 2021, and caused a negative reaction from the population: certain representatives has
mixed the document with required vaccination for children.66
The Commissioner for Human Rights was established in 2002 to independently monitor the
implementation of human rights, including those of children. It is accredited with status B,
not fully compliant with the Paris Principles, as the body is appointed by a Presidential
Decree. Although children were considered as not having the legal capacity to submit
complaints, the Commissioner for Human Rights was ready to receive them (Gheorghe &
Mussagaliyeva, 2014).
The Commissioner for Human Rights, with support from UNICEF and donors, carried out two
landmark studies on VAC in state-run institutions (Commissioner for Human Rights RoK et al.,
2011) and on violence against children in schools (Commissioner for Human Rights RoK et al.,
2013). These provided independent assessments and disaggregated data on children’s
vulnerability to abuse, exploitation and trafficking, violence against children in schools and
institutions (Gheorghe & Mussagaliyeva, 2014). The studies triggered a Pilot Project on the

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

system for prevention and response to violence against children
Prevention of VAC in Schools that was implemented in 10 schools in East Kazakhstan (UNICEF
Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2014).
Very importantly, these studies informed the new Law on the National Preventive
Mechanism (NPM), which was established in 2013 for the prevention of torture and other
cruel inhuman treatment of people in closed Institutions (GoK, 2013). The mechanism
operates under the office of the Commissioner for Human Rights (GoK, 2013). The
establishment of the NPM resulted in the inclusion of several types of children’s institutions
(centres for the adaptation of minors, special education institutions and educational
institutions with special detention regimes) within the NPM’s monitoring process and in the
opening of access to independent experts and CSOs to closed-access institutions to conduct
monitoring (RoK, 2019b).
The new law on Commissioner for Human Rights is currently under discussion. This law is
supposed to define the status of the office of the Commissioner and its activities, strengthen
the apparatus of the Commissioner, establish regional representation that would allow
responding to the situations when human rights are violated. The draft law has been recently
presented to the Parliament67. Potentially, the office of the Commissioner might broaden the
mandate in case of access to adequate powers and resources, and cooperative methods, that
will bring it international recognition.
Kazakhstan has introduced a Decree on the creation of the Office of Ombudsperson for
Children’s Rights on 10 February 2016. The position is also a political appointment by a
Presidential Decree. It can receive complaints directly from children (RoK, 2002).
Unfortunately, the office of the Ombudsperson lacks both human and financial resources,
which significantly hampers its capacity and effectiveness to carry out its functions, including
considering “appeals and complaints concerning violation of the rights, freedoms and
legitimate interests of the child,”, “assisting in the implementation and restoration of
violated rights,” “develop and submit recommendations for legislation improvement,”
monitor “organizations of education, health care and social protection of the population,
defence, culture and sports, as well as institutions of the penal system where minors are
kept,” provide analysis of the “documents of state and public institutions”, or perform other
functions (Law On the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan, 2002, Art. 7-2).
There are two child helplines: the 111 Helpline, which was launched in 2017 by the
Ombudsperson for Children’s Rights and re-established again in 2020 as a helpline addressing
issues of domestic violence; and the helpline 150 which is run by the NGO "Union of Crisis
Centres". These should ensure immediate counselling assistance and psychological support
for children in difficult life situations. The helplines serve as re-direction points in cases when
the child requires help. There are no official statistics, that could be gathered regarding the
number of calls received by any of the helplines. The “Union of Crisis Centres” claims that
they receive up to 16 to 29 000 calls, and 40 per cent of these calls come from children and
teenagers.68 Both helplines redirect information to other services that work directly with

Evaluation criteria -Sustainability
As of 2015, different line ministries have adopted quality standards and sectoral practices to
deal with the identification, referral, and support of child victims of violence. All the
standards were developed based on the Law on Special Social Services of 2008 (last
amended in 2019). The section below analyses the relevant ones which are listed in
chronological order. Only a few of them (the most noticeable exception is the SOPs on VAC
for medical staff) require the services to carry out multi-disciplinary needs assessment,
develop an individualised plan and assign a case manager to monitor it and follow it up. None
of them requests the services to consult children in the assessment of their needs and in the
identification of services that are made available to him/her.
1) Criteria for assessing the degree of risk and checklists in the field of protecting the
rights of the child” of the Minister of Education and Science of the Republic of
Kazakhstan (2015). The order establishes the criteria and checklist to assess the risks
of children in need of social protection, recipients of state targeted social assistance
or living with per capita income below the subsistence level and for children living
with foster parents. (GoK, 2016a).
2) In 2016, the Ministry of Health and Social Development adopted Rules for assessing
and determining the need for special social services as covered by the Law on
Special Social Services in the field of Social Protection, Health Care and Education.
Based on the rules, the need for special social services shall be determined by the
social worker based on an assessment and determination of the needs for special
social services. The establishment of a multidisciplinary commission is only foreseen
in the case the social worker needs to consult with specialists in education,
healthcare, or other disciplines. The local executive bodies decide on the provision of
special social services. In the forms included in the appendixes, there is one to be
used to assess the social environment of the family. It includes questions on “abusive
treatment” and “Parenting style (overprotectiveness, overly control, neglect, lack of
care etc.)” which are relevant for supporting child victims of violence. Nevertheless,
as noted in chapter 1, the experience of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect,

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

system for prevention and response to violence against children
does not trigger access to special social services. It does so only if it results in “social
maladaptation” (reduced capability of the individual to social interact) or “Social
deprivation” (reduced capability of the individual to be independent) (MoHSD Kaz,
2016c). In a subsequent rule, adopted in 2018, by the Ministry of Labour and Social
Protection, a person (family) who is in a difficult life situation should apply for the
provision of special social services by submitting a written application to the local
executive bodies of districts. The application is reviewed by the social worker within
ten days. It is not clear whether the assessment is done on be the basis of the
application or if it does foresee a meeting with the person or family members
applying (MLSP Kaz, 2018b).
3) In 2016, the Ministry of Health adopted the Standard for the provision of special
social services to victims of domestic violence. The order provides minimum
standards for the Crisis Centres. It is noteworthy that the order establishes the
obligation for the services to provide protection and assistance through the provision
of services following an individual plan and the interaction with Local Executive
Authorities, Authorities of Education, Healthcare, Social Protection, Internal Affairs,
Justice, Non-governmental Organizations. The assessment of needs should be done
by the social workers together with other specialists at the centre. The social worker
is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of the plan (MoHSD Kaz,
2016b).
4) Ministry of Interior Kazakhstan. Child-Friendly Justice – Guidelines: Interviewing
Victims and Witnesses. (2017). This guideline describes best practices in interviewing
children to minimize harm for children and ensure accuracy. It elaborates on the
types of questions the interviewer should ask, age-appropriate interview practices,
use of video and audio recordings, setting up the interview room, allowing parents
and other participants in the room during the interview. (MoIA Kaz, 2017). The
Guidelines were nevertheless not formalised via any decree by the Ministry of
Internal Affairs.
5) Order of the Minister of Public Health from December 29th, 2017, on approval of
Standard of organization of paediatric help in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The
document describes the functions of patronage nurses and doctors working with
pregnant women and young children. In case of violence, according to Chapter 2 (art
14), the victim should receive medical help, medical rehabilitation. The same article
states that the departments of internal affairs should be informed in cases of
violence. Chapter 3 (art 43) states, that the nurse should define a level of risk of abuse
or violence for a child. In case of medium risk (issues with feeding, hygienic standards,
games, communication, etc), the patronage nurse might work with the mother
independently or with a doctor assigned to the precinct. In cases of high risk (child
abuse, violence, neglect, disability of the child, etc), the family might require social
assistance. The information regarding the family is provided to the social worker,
psychologist or other representatives (including departments of education, social
protection, internal affairs, akimats, NGOs, etc) (MoH Kaz, 2017b).
6) Appendix 2 to the Standard for the provision of special social services in education
and child protection, provided by education organizations from January 19th, 2015,
amended in 2019 (MoES Kaz, 2015). Appendix 2 has a reference to service provision
to children who experienced violence, including sexual violence and lists the
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

organizations covered by the Standard that include the centres of adaptation of
minors, centres of child support in difficult life situations, other organizations
providing special social assistance to minors in difficult life situation. Services that
could be received by children include a multitude of them ranging from residence to
social and medical support, social and psychological support, pedagogical support).
The standards do not foresee any multi-disciplinary assessment nor the development
of an individualized care plan with delegated responsibility for its monitoring.
Children are not asked for their opinions on services.
7) In 2019, MoPH introduced a clinical protocol on Gender violence to be used by health
care providers, in cases of violence against women, against children, and against
elderly people (MoH Kaz, 2019a). The protocol mostly focuses on sexual violence. The
protocol contains a schematic representation of what should be done in cases when
urgent help is required to the victim of sexual violence (i.e., call emergency, hospital,
police, crisis centre) and inform the department of internal affairs. In cases when
violence is confirmed, the diagram suggests informing the social worker who will
provide the primary case assessment, followed by case management. It establishes
that if health care providers see signs of violence, they should contact the social
workers within their health care services. (FGD-Q-3). There wasn’t any direct
consultation with WHO in developing it but the protocol is based on WHO
recommendations. The protocol does not establish any algorithm on how to work
across services. (KII-C-1).
8) In November 2020, the National Centre on Public Health introduced a Standard
Operating Procedure on identification and response to violence against children for
medical staff. According to the SOP, in cases when violence is suspected, the
information regarding the child should be referred to the head of the medical
organization, where the child is located, or the social worker. The head of the medical
organization refers this information to the department of internal affairs (102),
guardianship and adoption authorities, commission on the affairs of minors and
protection of their rights; social protection bodies, head of (pre)school attended by
the child, policlinics, or any other medical institution when violence has been
identified by emergency. Within 1 day, the head of the medical organization sends
written information about the case to all the aforementioned bodies. Within one
hour after the identification of the child victim of violence, the head of the medical
organization conducts a medical evaluation of the child’s condition. The evaluation
of the child’s condition is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team whose composition
depends on the setting (medical organisations of education settings) and the
presence of staff. Normally, teams are composed of the following professionals:
social worker, psychologist, medical worker, representatives of the department of
internal affairs, adoption and guardianship authorities, nurses. When violence is
confirmed, the team responsible for this case is formed. The social worker is assigned
as responsible for this case (National Center for Public Health of the MoH RK, 2020).
According to a participant in an FGD about 200 workers of primary healthcare school
nurses, social workers and psychologists were trained on the SOPs between 2020-21
(FGD-Q-2).

5. Human and financial resources
5.1. Human Resources
A well-planned, developed, and supported social service workforce can be a life-changing
and powerful force for children, adults, families and communities and for facilitating social
inclusion and delivering a wide range of goals in the fight against poverty and violence
against women and children (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2017).
Table 25: Evaluation question 5.2 Human resources
Evaluation criteria, evaluation question Indicator
5.2 Human resources: To what extent has the The extent to which resources (training,
existing system for planning, developing, and workload management, supervision, etc.) are
supporting the social services workforce been sufficient to meet the capacity strengthening
adequate and equity-focused? (qualifications, needs across different sectors (social service
training, workload, supervision, etc.) – EQ5.2- workforce, police, magistrates, educators, and
(18) health providers)
Evaluation criteria -Effectiveness
Since the adoption of the Law on Specialised Social Services in 2008, Kazakhstan has invested
enormously in the planning, development and support of the social service workforce. It has
established the necessary legal and regulatory framework, the classifications of cadres and
other professionals, certification requirements and practice. Nevertheless, every sector has
taken its path without coordinating with other sectors or learning from similar processes.
This is particularly problematic for an area of work, such as preventing and responding to
violence against children, where the collaboration across sectors and disciplines brings
better outcomes for children than what each sector can achieve alone (GPEVAC, 2020).
Kazakhstan has the ambition to strengthen the social sector, by building on what exists and
unifying and consolidating standards and regulatory frameworks across ministerial silos. It is
nevertheless unclear whether the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection has the necessary
governmental support to carry out this concept of a unified system and strengthened
workforce.
Needs assessment, the drawing of a personalized assistance plan and the follow up make up
the core of a case-management system which relies on proper training of the frontline staff,
whether social workers, nurses, psychologist, social-pedagogues and so on. Still today,
services that provide an in-depth assessment of the needs of the child are limited. The model
of Progressive home visitations is one of these examples (see chapter 3 for the details). The
first contact with the family starts with a comprehensive assessment of the family’s health,
psycho-social and economic situation. Nurses are supposed to reach out to every child in the
attachment area, assess the risks – socio-economic, poverty, environment, etc – and then
develop an individual plan of action, not limited to the health sector (Gesaworld, 2019). In
cases of maternal depression or anxiety, food insecurity, unsafe home environments, or the
risk for violence, abuse or neglect, the home visitor develops an eco-map of the child’s
relevant relationships (Gesaworld, 2019). In cases of VAC, this pilot demonstrated a reduction
of child abuse, neglect and institutionalization of children under three. Likewise, the
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
90
system for prevention and response to violence against children
coverage of monitoring in contexts of vulnerability due to violence and abuse of children has
increased by more than 10% from 2015 to 2018 (from 61 to 71%) (Gesaworld, 2019).
There is emerging training on VAC by the initiative of different universities, training centres;
UN agencies and NGOs, but these are not certified and are not equally provided across all the
disciplines and grades.
The number of social workers and their caseload is difficult to assess across the sectors, given
the different classifications and functions. There is nevertheless anecdotal evidence that half
of the social workers are lacking.
Finally, the social workforce across the sectors has low salaries and low status. Incentives,
performance management and supervision are unequal across the sectors.
The planning of the social workforce predates 2011, the baseline for this evaluation. In
Kazakhstan, the Law on Special Social Services (2008) mandated the Ministries of Health,
Education and Social Protection and local authorities to implement specialised social
services. (GoK, 2008b). As a result, the development of social services, since 2008, has taken
place across services sectors at the same time. Each sector (social protection, health,
education and law enforcement) has developed its own social services in parallel without
necessarily taking into account similar processes in other sectors (OPM et al., 2018).
Between 2009-2011 each ministry introduced its own description of the work of social
workers, other service workforce cadres and the standards for their employment and the
services in which they are employed69. Each ministry further developed its own system of
case management and service standards70 (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018).
The national government and line ministries have since invested in building up a professional
social workforce (generalists and specialists) across the four sectors (MoLSP, MoES, MoPH,
MoIA). However, the profession of social work remains fragmented across sectors and
services, reduced to a limited and compartmentalised set of functions and tasks mainly
involved with assessment, referral, coordination, provision of home care services and
provision of information (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018).
Each ministry has its own nomenclature for social work functions, qualification requirements
and rules of certification. Table 26 reproduces the summary of the different types of social
service cadres who are deployed in each sector and at each level of response that was
produced for a UNICEF regional conference on Social Work/Social Workforce in 2018.

The Government is committed to strengthening the existing system, as demonstrated by the
adoption in 2014 of the Concept of Social Development till 2030 (GoK, 2014) (KII-C-8), the
holding of the first Social Worker Forum in 2017 and the opening of a Social Work Reference
Centre (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018). When it comes to workforce strengthening, the
concept aims to build on the existing systems by unifying and consolidating standards and
regulatory frameworks across ministerial silos. It is nevertheless unclear whether the
Ministry of Labour and Social Protection has the necessary governmental support to carry
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

system for prevention and response to violence against children
out this concept of a unified system and strengthened workforce (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al.,
2018) (KII-C8; KII-C9).
Social work first began to be taught in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 1991 and, by 2017, 18
universities were offering social work degrees in Kazakhstan through an accreditation
system (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018). Few universities offering courses in social work
which are also inclusive of modules/programmes on prevention of violence and abuse were
mentioned during the focus group discussion at the central level: these included the Eurasian
National University named after Gumilyov (ENU) (both at BA and Master levels), the Al Farabi
State University (Violence prevention is not taught within the curricula of Social Work but
included in other curricula) (FGD-Q-3).
Some participants in the focus group mentioned two national centres responsible for the
development of the capacities of the social service workforce on topics related to violence
against children:
1) The National Centre for Advanced Training which will be training social pedagogues
and psychologist working in the school system. It is based on the Roadmap on
strengthening children’s rights and for the prevention of domestic violence that
strengthening the professional workforce has become the priority of the Ministry of
Education (GoK, 2020c) (FGD-Q-2); and
2) the National Centre for Public Health was established in 2018 and trained during 2019
health workers (including visiting nurses, social workers, district doctors and school
nurses) the standard operating procedures that were adopted for detecting signs of
violence against children71 (FGD-Q-3).
Some participants in the focus groups further mentioned that NGOs also conduct specialised
training on violence against children. Some examples included training for social workers
employed by Crisis Centres on subjects such as detection of sexual violence and working with
parents of victims of sexual abuse. The development and delivery of these training depend
on the grant made available to them. And funding is not always secured (FGD-Q-3; FGD-Q-2).
International organisations and donors have also supported training on domestic violence
and human trafficking (FGD-Q-3).
According to a recent literature review (OPM et al., 2018), an analysis of the educational
qualifications of 61 managers and staff of employment and social programme offices in two
regions of Kazakhstan found that only one person had a social work education, three had
educational backgrounds in psychology, sociology or teaching and the rest had qualifications
in finance, economics, administration, book-keeping and other professions unrelated to
social work. This situation reflects the considerable challenges facing the government, with
many of the staff tasked with social work functions lacking social work qualifications, and a
specific focus on knowledge and practice of VAC.
Gathering data on the number and caseload of social workers and other professionals is
challenging given the differences in classification of the processions across the different
sectors.

Standards operating procedures see chapter 1.

Recent estimates reported by a UNICEF report (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018) indicate:
• 9,731 people are employed in the social protection system of whom 1742 have social
work degrees;
• 4,842 social workers work in the health care sector – it is not clear whether these are
qualified social workers or uncertified social workers; According to standard, there
shall be one social worker for 10,000 persons (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019b).
• 3,515 social pedagogues and specialists work for the regional and local authority
Guardianship and Trusteeship agencies.
In total, the social service workforce can be considered to comprise around 18,088 personnel
across health, education, and social protection. With a population of 18 million people, this
gives a ratio of one social service worker per 1,011 population, or more social workers and
other social service personnel per population than most of the countries in the ECA region
(UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2018).72 However, it is believed, that Kazakhstan is still lacking half
of the needed social workers (MLSP Kaz, 2020).
Incentives, performance management and supervision for social workers vary a great deal
across the sectors. Only the health sector, with the support of UNICEF, developed a
professional supervision mechanism. In the other sectors, there is no supervision mechanism
(Joanna Rogers and Svetlana Rijicova, 2018). This has been confirmed by the participants in
focus groups discussions at the central level (FGD-Q-1; FGD-Q-2; FGD-Q-3).
Informants and participants in FGDs also spoke about the low status, low recognition and
low salaries of many of the professionals working in state agencies (in education, public
health and social protection). They also pointed out the fact that many of these professionals
have to spend a lot of time on the administrative issue, they spend their salaries on
transportation costs because these are not covered by the service budget. One informant
called this treatment of civil servants “degrading” (KII-G-1; FGD-Q-1; FGD-Q-2; FGD-Q-3).
A recently published report identified similar challenges faced by professionals working in
social work: lack of official recognition and status, insufficient salaries, training, staff capacity
and competence, and deployment of the right profile and calibre of staff in the right places,
combined with an overall lack of professional resources, the burdens of administrative work
and, for some, high caseloads. (OPM & Salmon, 2019). Informants for this evaluation also
pointed out high turnover and burnout amongst social workers (FGD-Q-1; FGD-Q-2; FGD-Q-3).
OPM report also pointed out that availability of funding for services and personnel were not
considered by respondents to be a barrier in itself, as they are of the view that sufficiently
funded and relevant social programmes are in place. The quality of management and
implementation needs to be improved and more efficient targeting is required to ensure that
they reach those most in need. Mistrust is also highlighted as needing to address - between
local community members, in particular parents, and local authorities, including schools,
social assistance administrators, and members of Commissions of Minors and guardianship
bodies (OPM & Salmon, 2019).
72 In South Asia, the number of governmental social service workers with responsibility for child
protection (per 100,000 children) varies from 0.62 (in Afghanistan) to 527.41 (in Sri Lanka) (UNICEF
ROSA, 2018)

5.2. Financial resources
Assessing the adequacy of the financial resources available for CPSs, and the cost of reform
of these systems is a necessary step to make a difference in effectively protecting children,
as defined by article 19 of the CRC.73 Kazakhstan, like many other countries, has advanced
significantly in enacting legislation for the protection of children and adolescents. However,
legislation, policies and programmes of child protection cannot be implemented without
sufficient financial resources. In the budgeting process, these need to be mobilized, allocated
and spent. To put the hand to where the mouth is, fiscal policies and public financial
management need to be exercised in an accountable, effective, efficient, equitable,
participatory, transparent and sustainable manner (OHCHR, 2016).
Given the current unclear institutionalization of cross-departmental child protection services
and the lack of definition of a single minimum service package for CP, the allocation of
financial resources to the CPS cannot yet be measured rigorously. However, the government
has made substantive steps in determining the necessary budgets for each new legislative
action. In some sectors, namely education and health, the government is capable of
determining the level of investment needed. Furthermore, the new law on education (2019)
commits to having a consolidated child budget. These are important steps that can be
considered as necessary preconditions to track expenditures in a defined, cross-sectorial
service package for CP, once established.
Table 27 reflects the evaluation question 5.1 on financial resources.
Table 27: Evaluation question 5.1: Financial resources

resources for the child protection /VAC
strategies and programmes can be done in the
most cost-efficient manner? – EQ5.1-(17)
Evaluation criteria -Efficiency*
This section approaches the question in three dimensions.74 First, it asks which measures
need to be put in place to be able to trace the specific spending on preventing and
responding to violence. Second, it asks whether the general social protection system allows
73 Article 19 of the CRC obliges states to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and
educational measures to protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse,
neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse.
74 As no conclusive data on the spending on the CPS is available, the evaluation dimension of efficiency
cannot be answered. Therefore, this report rather than responding to the efficiency dimension of the
evaluation as such, aims to establish what criteria need to be fulfilled in order to do so. As per Inception
Report, “given the lack of financial data on public funding allocation and expenditures on coordination
and programmes on preventing and responding to VAC, it was agreed that the evaluation dimension
of ‘efficiency’ should be treated by enumerating necessary conditions and identifying bottlenecks that
would allow identifying criteria for the future measurability of such dimension.” (p.10) and “the criteria
of efficiency: as there is no available data on the investment of public resources in the child protection
system, neither in 2011 nor in the following years, it will not be possible to measure whether the child
protection system has been efficient in using the invested resources” (p. 20)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the

system for prevention and response to violence against children
for adequate coverage of minimum income, which is considered as a reducing factor of
vulnerability towards VAC. Thirdly, it dwells on deinstitutionalization, including its cost
implications, which had been a prominent goal in 2011 (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
5.2.1. Budget allocation and spending for VAC programmes, both prevention and response
It is challenging to establish actual spending on the CPS in Kazakhstan. UNICEF’s 2019
Situation Analysis (SitAn) states that “Budget allocations for children’s rights are not
presented separately within the national budget but are included within sectoral budget-lines
such as education and health care” (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019, p. 15). However, the 2019 State
Programme on Education commits to the development of a methodology for the formation
of a consolidated child budget and provide for its annual growth (GoK, 2019c).
"Children's budget" is a measurement of the consolidated budget, which includes
republican and local budgets for supporting children and evaluating the effectiveness
of public spending in the interests of children. The introduction of the "Children's
Budget" will allow determining the level of budget expenditures in the interests of
children, focused on ensuring their well-being and rights, and will also increase the
attention of state and local authorities to considering the interests and needs of
children in all areas. Having a "Children's Budget", state bodies receive a tool for
determining priorities in budgetary policy, its compliance with the social obligations of
the authorities. The development of a methodology for calculating the "Children's
budget" will allow introducing monitoring of the total amount of the state budget
allocated to children.
Such Children's Budget, however, would measure all spending on children. Although this
would include spending on the CPS, or specifically on response and prevention of VAC, it
would likely not be disaggregated to visualize the spending of the CPS.75 The current public
finance system does not allow for determining how much is spent on the CPS or even on
child-related social services.76 Besides the genuine challenge due to the cross-sectoral
character of the CPS as in any other country, there are specific challenges in Kazakhstan. As
seen above, these are high fragmentation, unclear identification and definitions of CP
services from prevention to response, both within general services (such as education and
health), as well as specialised services for child victims of violence, which generally lack. This
institutional configuration makes it currently impossible to establish how much is invested in
CP/VAC.
However, Order No. 371 of the MoLSP on ‘methodological recommendations in the provision
of special social services’ gives detailed orientation on how to calculate both human
resources and investment in or maintenance of infrastructure (MLSP Kaz, 2018a). This
represents an important step towards calculating the cost of service coverage. It also gives
orientation to subnational entities for budgeting. While cost structures – namely in human
resources – are different in each sector, these recommendations provide a point of departure
75 A Child Protection System can be charged with several tasks, amongst which is the prevention and
response to VAC. Usually, to these the mandates on children without parental care and children in
conflict with the law are added (UNICEF, 2018b, 2019a; UNICEF ECA, 2020).
76 The CPS is a cross-departmental response structure. Therefore, there is no single budget line, as in
specific line-ministries.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
96
system for prevention and response to violence against children
to calculate the cost of the CPS as an interdepartmental exercise. In any case, the definition
of ’special social services’ – as regulated in the 2008 law on special social services and
updated successively (GoK, 2008b; MLSP Kaz, 2018a, 2018b; MoES Kaz, 2019c, 2019a, 2019d;
MoH Kaz, 2016a, 2016b, 2017a; MoHSD Kaz, 2016a, 2016b, 2015) – while it entails a great
number of services that are supposed to be delivered by the CPS, it also entails others and is
therefore not fully the same.
UNICEF’s work on Public Finance for Children (PF4C) at the global level has not only revealed
that investment in children is low, but also that rigorous data is scarce: child-friendliness of
national budgets requires both more transparency and better allocation (UNICEF, 2017b;
UNICEF et al., 2020). Responding to this challenge, UNICEF engaged in an exercise at the
global level to make spending on the CPS traceable and visible (UNICEF, 2020).
In Kazakhstan, the government currently does not seem to have the capacity to determine
the necessary budget allocation and spending for VAC programmes at the central and local
level [KII-C-8; KII-C-2]. In 2015, the CRC highlighted the “lack of information about any
targeted and transparent budget allocations for children, in particular for those in
marginalized and disadvantaged situations” (UN CRC, 2015, para. 12). Few cost-effective
analyses of pilot services have been carried out, most of them limited to a specific service
and often in pilot projects (see for example (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2016; UNICEF
Kazakhstan, Núñez-Sabarís, Satorras, Nurmagambetova, Shevshenko, & Gesaworld, 2019;
UNICEF Kazakhstan & ITAD, 2018)).
Furthermore, in Kazakhstan, the administrative fragmentation of competencies between
state, regional and municipal level poses additional challenges in establishing spending levels
[KKI-C-2]. For example, in the health care sector, provision and financing have been largely
devolved to the regional administrations (oblasts) and their health departments (Katsaga et
al., 2012).
The above mentioned UNICEF CP Financial Benchmark looks at per-child expenditure on CP
and compares that to the per-person public expenditure (UNICEF, 2020). To that end, CP
measures and services are identified across the state budget that responds to a list of CP
harms and risks (GPEVAC, 2020).77 In Kazakhstan, this kind of exercise has not yet been
undertaken, neither by state actors for accountability purposes nor by civil society for
oversight. Given the current provisions of public finance and disaggregation of the state
budget as well as the institutional configuration of the CPS, undertaking such spending
estimates would be technically challenging, at this point in time.
However, with the latest legislative action, amongst them on the social services code, as well
as the definition of staffing profiles and SOPs (as described in section 3.1), these budgeted
measures and services could be identified and potentially tagged in the state budget.
77 The child protection risks and harms, and the services that are needed are defined according to
UNICEF as these: “Children not registered at birth; Children in labour and other work that is harmful;
Children subjected to harmful cultural practices (such as child marriage, female genital
mutilation/circumcision (FGM/C) or gender discrimination); Abused children (physical, sexual,
emotional); Neglected children; Children without adequate family care; Children on the move due to
migration, kidnapping and trafficking; Children who are sexually exploited commercially; Children in
contact with the law; Children affected by emergencies; Children in trans-national crime; Children
affected by armed conflict and; violence” (UNICEF, 2020).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
97
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Establishing a CPS spending benchmark could be informed by recent efforts to establish a
gender budget, such as the gender-responsive budgeting integration plan (2020–2025),
adopted in 2019 (Association of Business Women of Kazakhstan, 2017; Uzkembaeva &
Rezvushina, 2016). Gender budgeting follows similar technical operations as CPS tracking
would.
The government of Kazakhstan has not yet defined a minimum service package for CP. The
variety of services in prevention and response – across the sectors of health, education, social
protection, and security/justice, as described in chapter 3 – could be reassembled in a
description of essential public services that each and any child can count on, all over
Kazakhstan. These services can be provided directly by state agents or out-contracted to
providers, such as NGOs or private suppliers. One key concern is the dimension of coverage,
which is especially challenging in rural areas, as reconfirmed by the majority of interviewees
listened to in the study. This classification of essential CP services across government
departments and the identification of allocations and execution in the budget, both
Republican and regional, is a precondition for establishing spending levels, and therefore for
measuring whether financial resources for the CP strategies and programmes are
implemented in the most cost-efficient manner.
5.2.2. Minimum income and economic strengthening of families
According to the WHO INSPIRE framework, minimum income levels and improved economic
security and stability of families reduce child maltreatment and therefore protect against VAC
(WHO, 2016, p. 54). CRC-GC13 on violence names poverty as a risk factor for VAC (UN CRC,
2011, para. 72(f)). In this understanding, the Kazakh social protection system works as an
implicit safeguard against VAC. This association between poverty or economic shocks with
VAC had not been addressed explicitly in the 2011 baseline report (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2011).
However, given the prominence of the issue, it will be mentioned here.
Over the last decade, Kazakhstan has achieved significant progress in poverty reduction: The
poverty gap at $5.50 a day (in 2011 PPP) fell from over 25 per cent at the beginning of the
century to under 1 per cent in 2018.78 Social protection systems have been reinforced and
rolled out (GoK, 2020e; Spanova et al., 2019; Temirbayeva, 2019).
However, the social policy design has been criticised to be heavily tilted towards social
insurance, mainly pensions, as well as exclusively towards activation to work (Maltseva,
2021). Furthermore, social assistance represents a low level of adequacy and serious access
barriers, which create targeting errors and generate stigmatization (Scott et al., 2017; UNICEF
Kazakhstan, 2017a; UNICEF Kazakhstan, Babajanian, et al., 2015). Investing in children is
addressed with several targeted social transfers, as well as some universal schemes, such as
birth grants (GoK, 2020e; Temirbayeva, 2019).
In September 2019, the President of Kazakhstan K. Tokayev presented an address to the
people of the Republic of Kazakhstan "Constructive public dialogue is the basis of stability
and prosperity in Kazakhstan” (GoK, 2019a). In his address, he instructed to adjust the
mechanisms for assigning targeted social assistance. In this regard, in 2020, a new law was

adopted on changes and additions into some legislative acts on social security, social
provisions and private-state partnership in the sphere of public health. The law amends the
2001 Law on State Targeted Social Assistance, by including the provision of a guaranteed
social package - assistance to families with low income, that have children aged 1 to 18. This
addition suggests the creation of precinct commissions at the local level that will provide
conclusions regarding the application for targeted social assistance. They also provide
information regarding the size of the social assistance. (RoK, 2020c). The novelty that this
law introduced is the consideration of each case.79
It is difficult to establish how social assistance transfers affect – whether as increase or
decrease – the incidence of VAC. Hence, a statement on the (cost-)effectiveness of social
benefits to prevent VAC cannot be made.80 However, recent international research
demonstrates that the design features of social protection have a gender-related impact, and
thus strengthen or weaken the exposure to violence (World Bank et al., 2021). Child-friendly
social policy needs to consider the ‘collateral effects’ of social benefit schemes on domestic
relations and the options to mitigate any disempowering side-effects of social protection. To
that end, it is necessary to assess the consequences of social welfare programmes on
relations of power, control, and participation in the households and the community. This has
not yet been done in Kazakhstan.
5.2.3. The cost of (de)institutionalization
The 2011 UNICEF report, which serves as a baseline for this evaluation, identified that the CPS
“is still largely based on the pre-1991 Soviet model [and] relies heavily on institutionalisation”
and recommended to put “the foundations for community-based service delivery and family
support rather than the institutionalisation of children in need of protection” (UNICEF
Kazakhstan, 2011, pp. 6; 32). In that respect, it has been in line with the International standard
(UN, 2009). It also follows scientific evidence, which establishes strong negative associations
between institutional care and children’s development as well as a higher risk of severe
physical or sexual abuse (van IJzendoorn et al., 2020). Retrieving reliable budgetary data on
the institutionalization process is relevant because, when estimating the overall cost of a
CPS, a significant amount might be absorbed by certain types of services, such as large-scale
institutions, that are meant to be phased out. To determine CP budget allocation and cost-
effectiveness, the system needs to be able to distinguish between the respective
expenditures. Kazakhstan, while having invested during the past decade on
deinstitutionalization, is not yet able to determine how much it spends in public resources on
the type of services that shall be phased out – and it does not know whether those
80 In any country, linking the decline of VAC to specific social protection measures – as claimed by the
INSPIRE framework - would run into methodological attribution problems. However, making the case
via situational evidence increases to ground any public action in better probability of the truthfulness
of a policy proposition. For a technical account on SP and CP, see Sheahan, F. (2011). A Focus on Child
Protection within Social Protection Systems: Transforming Children’s lives.

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
99
system for prevention and response to violence against children
investments have been cost-effective (NGO Coalition Kazakhstan & Soros Foundation KZ,
2020).
In Kazakhstan, violence in institutions has been documented and recommendations are given
on how to reform institutions and prevent institutionalization (Commissioner for Human
Rights RoK et al., 2011; UN OHCHR, 2017). Again in 2015, the CRC expressed concern about
the high institutionalization rate of children without parental care and denounced exposure
to abuse, neglect, degrading treatment, and corporal punishment, while it acknowledged
efforts by public authorities to transition to family-type care settings (UN CRC, 2015).
Deinstitutionalization has budget implications. An attempt to assess these for Kazakhstan
has been undertaken yet in 2009 (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2009). The report recommended
reforming the “entire system of social protection of children, changing its orientation from
residential care to prevention and support of blood and substitute families.” It also warned
about the related cost but claimed that “these investments can bring significant social and
economic returns through reduced expenditures on residential care and increased
productivity of labour of the graduates of child care system” (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2009).
Pilot programmes have been run and evaluated to establish family support practices, that
would prevent residential care (UNICEF Kazakhstan et al., 2016). However, elevating these
pilots to regional or national public policy, including cost-estimate for universal coverage with
these services, could not be provided. In general, no specific study on the cost effects of
deinstitutionalization has been conducted since the initial 2009 statement. In the
international arena, a useful set of guidelines are available to budget care reforms (CTWWC
et al., 2021). However, beyond financial calculations, it seems necessary that child care
reforms are embedded in the specific national context, which is very specific in Kazakhstan
(An & Kulmala, 2021; Schmidt, 2017).
In any case, calculating the cost for deinstitutionalizations needs to include the resources
required to transition away from residential care facilities and towards family- and
community-based care. These costs can be significant. They include a range of expenditures
such as reconverting the physical facilities to new purposes as well as staff retraining and
redeployment.
Box 4: Case study on violence in care institutions
Ainur was sent to an orphanage after a violent situation of family breakdown. In the
institution, she suffered severe abuse from the internees. The social workers were aware of
the violent conditions but did not stop the abuse. They interpreted Ainur’s withdrawal as a
sign of retardation. Later, Ainur worked on these experiences to recover and regain her self-
esteem. Today, Ainur is actively advocating for the rights of children.

Evaluation criteria -Relevance
Providing children with the opportunity to be engaged in decision-making processes and to
voice their opinions is an important aspect of children’s development. However, the
discussion of childhood in society is often reduced to the fact that children are in the process
of growing up to become adults, to contribute to the economic or political development of
the country in the future. ‘Children (or youth) are the future’ is one of the favourite slogans
of the Soviet times that continues to exist in contemporary Kazakhstan (GoK, 2012; Kelly,
2009; Kirschenbaum, 2013). It is often mentioned in the speeches of the officials and state
programs concerning education, healthcare, or social care of children. Nevertheless, UNICEF
applies the Human Rights-Based Approach and therefore the international agency always
tried to focus the government’s efforts on the present (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019a).
After the 2007-2011 Programme “Children of Kazakhstan,” there was no national framework
or vision on children and youth participation in Kazakhstan (GoK, 2007a). The UN Committee
on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) called on the government to start public national
consultations with children on issues that affect them (UN CRC, 2007, 2015). According to a
survey on civic participation that UNICEF carried out in 2017, young people would like to be
more engaged in social life (UNICEF, Key findings of the 2017 online consultation cited in
(UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019a).
As there is no national strategy on violence against children in Kazakhstan, and since different
components of the CPS have been developed in a somehow separate way, there has not
been any real attempt to create a space or channels for systematic consultation with children
on violence.
There are nevertheless some examples of initiatives to consult with children at the local level,
especially in-school organisations, various community activities and national campaigns. The
Child-Friendly City initiative that involves 25 cities across the country is one example of safe
spaces for adolescents to raise their voices and concerns and to enhance local accountability
(UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019a). UNFPA piloted sexuality education in schools in East
Kazakhstan, Mangystau, Kyzylorda and Turkestan regions (KII-C-5). Moreover, the
programme supported courses for 15–16-year-old teenagers attending colleges on family
values, family relations and family and children relations, including issues of responsible
parenthood, also providing information to young people regarding existing youth health
centres (more on this service in Chapter 3).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
101
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Nevertheless, the evaluation has found no evidence as to whether these campaigns also
include information on violence against children.
Parents who have been interviewed during this evaluation, have expressed different
attitudes concerning the question of the importance of their children’s views. During the
interviews and focus group discussion, the Interviewers asked if children had an opportunity
to provide feedback to the psychologist or school administration regarding the quality of
their service and if this feedback would make any difference, from the point of view of the
parents.
Our sample was too small to be considered representative of the parental community in
Kazakhstan, however, it seems important to mention the outcome of the interviews here.
One of the participants of the focus group in East Kazakhstan dismissed the interviewer,
stating that young children could not possibly understand the complexity of the
psychologist’s job, and therefore, it did not make sense to ask the child about the service and
what they felt during the session (FG-B-EK-015). At the same time, the other parent
participant of the same focus group mentioned that the children might not have an opinion,
because they have never been explained the purpose of the session or its importance. During
another interview, the parent said it was important to distinguish between ages of children:
the feedback of the child could improve the quality of the service, however, the age matters
(the older children can provide better feedback compared to the young ones) (KII-B).
The parents in the Mangystau region felt similar to the last parent in East Kazakhstan, even
defining the minimal age (12-13 years) when children could be asked for their opinion. From
the viewpoint of one parent, children’s feedback could improve the psychological service at
school and motivate them to use new methods. However, another parent in this focus group
stayed unconvinced, referring to children’s lack of experience and knowledge and therefore,
inability to judge a grownup (FG-B-M).
The evaluation enquired into whether children are consulted on policies and programmes
that concern them at the central level. A government representative expressed surprise that
such an approach might be practised when legislation or programs concerning children are
being discussed by the government (KII-C-11). The representative of a community
organization stated that historically children in Kazakhstan were never asked about their
opinion, which is explained by the Soviet Union policy towards children as a passive group,
that should be cared for, but not questioned regarding their views (KII-G-6).
According to this interviewee, "people working in schools ... [treat]... all children as idiots.
Children are not asked because it does not make sense. The state writes textbooks, the state
provides training to teachers, and no one pays attention to how different children are these
days. The Soviet Union saw them as all the same” (KII-G-6). Children and young people are
often regarded by the state agencies as dependent and not yet mature enough to exercise
their participation rights, and not only in Kazakhstan (Gadda, 2008).
The disregard for children’s voices is something that children themselves are aware of.
Almost two out of three children (58.5%) who participated in the 2012-2013 consultations with
UNICEF Kazakhstan stated that their opinion was not taken into consideration during the
decision-making process (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2014a). Most of the participants believed this
was due to the traditional approach that “adults know better” and that youth should “respect
older people”. A common opinion expressed by respondents was that the voice of children
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
102
system for prevention and response to violence against children
and young people was not heard due to an established paternalistic system that does not
support or encourage youth to take responsibility for their actions and choices. Indeed,
Roose and Bouverne-de Bie (2007) mentioned that this perception of children was typical for
the countries where children were not considered as equal to adults in the situations that
concern children’s lives and well-being (Roose & Bouverne-de Bie, 2007). However, Lowden
(2002) stresses, there is a different perspective, that assumes that all people are equal,
irrespective of their age, and therefore, children as subjects are entitled to civil rights and the
autonomous exercise of those rights (Lowden, 2002). This approach might be shared by the
Kazakhstan children since about 30% of young people believed that their opinions and their
participation in the life of the community would make a significant contribution to solving
social issues, build their confidence and skills, and support them in making all sorts of
decisions (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2014b).

In 2011 there was no evidence of the recognition that in Kazakhstan children experienced
violence at home, in schools, in state institutions and the community. However, since the
mid-2010s thanks to the efforts of UNICEF and the National Human Rights Centre, there was
an emerging discussion about the importance of social norms affecting VAC.
Currently, there is a recognition that negative social norms such as tolerance towards
violence against children are strong (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2015). These negative norms seem
to be well-rooted and confirmed again in 2019 (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019a).
In 2016-2017, UNICEF Kazakhstan with the National Human Rights Centre conducted a
Knowledge Attitude and Practices (KAP) Survey around issues of violence against children in
families (Haarr, 2017). The study demonstrated that violence against children, both physical
and mental, is widely practised in Kazakhstan: 67.0% of general public adults reported that
they used mental and/or physical violence against children. Among them, 65.0% of adults
used mental violence and 39.5% used physical violence to discipline and control children in
the family (Haarr, 2017).
As a result of this study, UNICEF jointly with the Ombudsperson for Human Rights and MoES
initiated a national campaign on changing social norms and behavioural patterns for the
prevention of VAC (UNICEF Kazakhstan, 2019b). The communication campaign aimed at
obtaining positive behaviour change with respect to VAC, building awareness on the forms
of VAC, increasing knowledge of its negative effect, connecting and engaging people to
address it. The campaign targeted the government, NGOs, companies, media and social
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
103
system for prevention and response to violence against children
media, and involved parents between 20-35 years of age (Cecchetti, 2018). In 2019, this
campaign reached more than 1.5 million persons in Kazakhstan. Social media influencers
became key supporters of the campaign and rolled an online positive parenting marathon
throughout the year. While achieving social norms change is a long-term process, the
campaign has contributed to a more open dialogue on VAC in Kazakhstan in national media
and among the public, including the private sector. Addressing VAC became a priority in the
newly adopted state health and education programmes 2020-2025 (UNICEF Kazakhstan,
2019b).
In 2021, to measure a change from the 2016 baseline survey and to begin to monitor certain
VAC indicators, UNICEF has conducted a follow-up survey in the Almaty, East Kazakhstan,
Kyzylorda, Mangystau, Turkestan regions and the city of Shymkent. The survey has involved
participants from the general population (18-65) and child protection professionals (including
representatives of guardianship authorities, social workers, psychologists, health specialists,
staff of child institutions) (UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
Compared to 2016, there was some decrease in the frequency of use of violent discipline
(more than two different types in the previous two years) from 76% to 74% per cent of
participants. Parents reported a significant drop in the use of physical VAC (from 45 % in 2016
to 21in 2021), and fewer parents were using threats about hitting the child. Compared to 2016,
parents were relying more often on non-violent forms of disciplining their children, including
providing an explanation to the child or taking privileges from the child (UNICEF Kazakhstan
& Haarr, 2021).
However, certain trends have remained unchanged: for example, the support of corporal
punishment of children among the grown-up population remains high (46% in 2021, compared
to 53% in 2016). It is quite concerning that every third child protection professional supports
corporal punishment to discipline and control children (compared to 43% in 2016). According
to the KAP research, women were more likely to use physical and mental violence to
discipline children, compared to males, even there were fewer women (45%) who supported
the use of corporal punishment. This shows that males are more likely to support corporal
punishment, but females are more likely to use it. One possible explanation that the
researcher provided was that females felt pressured by males to use physical violence against
children. This could be a window of opportunity for women to use non-violent means of
upbringing if supported in doing so (UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
During the interviews, some respondents indicated that physical abuse was an accepted way
of management of children in the family (KII-C-6; KII-C-12). One informant said, that physical
punishment was well justified because according to the common believes, it did not cause
any harm, it was not exercised often, or it was used only when needed, and it did not show
that parents do not love their children (KII-C-6). Another argument referred to the history of
violent upbringing in the family: according to some parents the informant was counselling,
violence still allowed the parents to grow into “normal persons” (KII-C-6).
Another informant mentioned that violence in Kazakhstan families was treated as something
mundane, even banal, that it could be considered as part of the family culture (KII-C-12). While
discussing brides kidnapping, as a form of violence prevalent even today, the informant
stated that people often justify this violence as a tradition (KII-C-12). In the interview, this
NGO representative said
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
104
system for prevention and response to violence against children
“People tend to forget that the tradition was related to something else: young men and
women were not able to get married due to the absence of financial resources, and they
would elope. What is happening today is a crime, not a tradition, and it is prohibited by
the Art 125 of the Penal Code. The parents often say this is a tradition, and raise their
children with this notion. It is important to understand that it should not be like that.”
Another informant (KII-C-11), a government representative, stated that neither religion nor
culture in Kazakhstan tolerates violence against children. According to the informant,
historically, children of any gender held a special honourable place in the family. Therefore,
when violence against children takes place, it cannot be justified by religious practices or
historical roots.
The 2021 KAP results showed there was less understanding of physical violence as a notion
both among the general population (the indicator decreased from 60% to 55% of the
population from 2016 to 2021) and CPS professionals (from 58% to 50% respectively).
According to Robin Haarr, the potential explanation is the new knowledge that certain types
of physical violence are not appropriate to be exercised against children, and therefore, some
representatives of the public are no longer sure what forms of physical violence exist
(UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
Another trend mentioned during the presentation of KAP survey results relates to attitudes
to VAC reporting both among the general public and child protection professionals. Every
fifth representative of the general public felt it was not important to report witnessed acts
of VAC to the state bodies (this share of the population has increased from 7% in 2016 to 19%
in 2021). There was more support among the general public for no reporting of VAC in the
situations when the violence was witnessed by school teachers (18% in 2016 compared to 22%
in 2021), and medical personnel (14% in 2016 compared to 16% in 2021) (UNICEF Kazakhstan &
Haarr, 2021).
The second KAP survey (2021), also showed that child protection professionals did not see
the importance of reporting VAC, however, the share of no reporting supporters was smaller
(3% in 2016 compared to 10% in 2021 in cases when teachers witnessed an act of VAC, 4% in
2016 compared to 11% in 2021 when medical personnel were involved).
To understand the causes for non-reporting both among the general public and child rights
specialists, we used the South Korean study that provides a ground for possible comparison
with Kazakhstan KAP findings. However, it is difficult to directly compare these two studies,
because KAP 2021 addresses attitudes, while the Korean study looks at existing practices. A
study conducted in South Korea in 2015, showed that most medical professionals did not
report cases when they suspected abuse and violence, because they were not confident or
did not have sufficient evidence of abuse, or lacked awareness about the reporting
procedure (Cho et al., 2015). For domestic violence cases, the second biggest reason for not
reporting the incident was that the Korean medical personnel did “not want to be involved in
a personal or family matter”. In one of the interviews conducted for this evaluation, when
responding to the question of referral of children at risk or in need of protection to other
services, a medical worker stated that medical workers are disincentivized from reporting
cases of violence:
“If there is no statement, …, there is no problem”. [Nurses] are afraid of losing their
jobs.” (CS-S-001).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
105
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The participants of another interview mentioned several times that schools were not
prepared to address and report the issue of VAC at schools or in the family because the school
administration was not keen to lose the funding or their place in the school ratings.
Moreover, according to the same respondents, the school psychologists and social
pedagogues were underreporting the cases because they felt disappointed in the existing
system that would not investigate the cases (KII-C-3). It is impossible to make any general
conclusion based on the provided statements.
The KAP 2021 survey showed a significant drop in the support of an investigation of VAC
cases: the percentage of the general population who believed it was “very important” that
state agencies investigated cases of VAC has dropped by half from 45% in 2016 to 22% in 2021
(UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
Several interviewees acknowledge the importance of changing knowledge, attitudes and
behaviours that condone VAC of parents, social workers, police, judges and society at large.
Several respondents (KII-C-6, KII-G-6, FGD-Q-1) stated it was important to work with families,
including single mothers, through parenting and relationship courses to provide
psychological relief.
Several organizations directed their efforts to put together programmes for parents,
including the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) that initiated the development of a
package of information and educational materials on "Conscious Parenting" and
relationships between men and women on the principles of non-violence; effectively discuss
issues of a fulfilling and safe sex life, and make joint decisions regarding the care and
upbringing of children. The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan
developed a methodological manual "General recommendations for parents on preparing
a child for schooling" that while it focuses on preparing a child for school, also provides
practical advice to young parents. The Ministry of Information and Social Development
launched a project supporting institution of paternity that developed the Methodological
Guide “Secrets of Successful Parenting: School of Fathers and Mothers.” The manual
examines in detail the factors contributing to the development and strengthening of the
family, along with them, the risk factors are analysed, and possible ways to overcome them
are proposed (UNICEF Kazakhstan & Haarr, 2021).
A representative of a think tank (KII-G-7) mentioned that not only parents require work and
training, but journalists as well, especially when they cover cases of violence. The informant
expressed her concern that Kazakhstan media was not familiar with ethical ways of covering
violence, providing an example of an evening TV show when a victim of sexual violence was
invited in the same room with a perpetrator, where both the host of the show and parents
of the perpetrator were putting pressure on the victim to forgive the act of violence.
According to the respondent, “this young woman has been raped twice – once psychically,
and another time - on TV. People in the audience condemned the victim – she was asked to
forgive the rapist.”
There are significant positive social changes taking place in Kazakhstan during the last
decade, however, it seems that to decrease VAC, society still needs to gain a full
understanding of this issue to form a negative stance.

7. Lessons Learnt
several lessons were learnt during the evaluation. Considering these would be useful for
similar future evaluations.
First, the evaluation scope was too wide besides its reduction that was agreed upon during
the inception phase. A Child Protection System is a relatively new concept and a framework
that captures and exemplifies a very complex reality. A thorough evaluation of the evolution
and reforms of its six components over 10 years appeared to be an overambitious task. An
in-depth evaluability assessment of the objectives against what was possible to evaluate
would have been helpful before developing the methodology. It would have set a more
focused scope and possibly indicated the need for a deeper analysis of some components
over others or their interdependences.
Secondly, the evaluation had to use an exogenous definition of the Child Protection System,
given that such definition did not exist in any public policy or programme in Kazakhstan. It
would have been helpful to start the evaluation by agreeing on a working definition of the
Child Protection System with the members of the Evaluation Reference Group, the main
stakeholders of the evaluation. This would have eased the development of the methodology,
and helped the process, ownership and uptake of the evaluation and its findings.
The third lesson learnt concerns the definition of the child protection system that was used
in the evaluation. The evaluation used UNICEF’s definition that distinguishes components
and actors and indicates that it is interlinkages and interactions amongst these components
and actors that make the system (see the background of the evaluation above).
Nevertheless, those interactions and linkages are not spelt out in the definition; the definition
does not provide indications as to whether all components and actors are expected to relate
to each other; or whether those linkages are supposed to be of equal importance for a
system to exist or if some are pre-requisites to others; or whether there are linear, circular,
bidirectional relationships between components and actors. Future evaluations of child
protection systems may wish to explore the interdependencies between different
components first. It may be useful for identifying bottlenecks and prioritise interventions
that may be the most effective in improving the system overall.
Finally, the governance of the evaluation would have benefitted from a stronger political
leadership. The involvement of the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner was essential
and highly appreciated. Nevertheless, it was not matched by the same level of commitment
and engagement by relevant line ministries. This appears to be both the cause and effect of
a fragmented child protection system that has not been sufficiently supported by strong
enough political gravitas. Greater involvement of relevant ministries would be essential to
the adoption and implementation of the evaluation's recommendations.

8. Theory of change: A vision up to 2030
This section presents an overarching, multi-sectoral theory of change, to start a conversation
with the Government of Kazakhstan on strengthening the CPS to prevent and respond to
violence against children for the next 10 years until 2030.
The purpose is to provide a strategic vision, that is based on the outcomes of this formative
evaluation. The theory of change describes pathways of change, propose a course of actions,
outputs, and outcomes, and articulates a chain of results.
The Theory of Change is built on the six components of the CPS which were used as the
analytical framework for the present evaluation. The definitions of the different forms of
violence that the Theory of Change covers as well as of the remit of each component are
found in the introduction of this report.
This section includes two components that together comprise the Theory of Change:
(1) A schematic representation of the results chain that shows proposed results at the
Impact/Goal, Outcome, and Output levels; Activities that need to be put in place to
achieve the identified changes; Barriers, Bottlenecks and Drivers identified by the
evaluation; and Assumptions, the conditions upon which the barriers can be
overcome, Activities undertaken, and Outputs/Outcomes achieved;
(2) A narrative summary of the Theory of Change provides the rationale of the proposed
results and describes the links between the different levels of the results.
The Theory of Change has been informed by a two-day online workshop that was organised
with the members of the Evaluation Reference Group on 22-23 June 2021. The detailed
programme of the workshop as well as the list of participants are found in Annex.

8.2. Narrative summary of the Theory of Change
The following section provides the rationale of the proposed results and describes the links
between the different levels of the results.
2030 Vision: Kazakhstan free of violence against girls, boys, and adolescents
Impact: All girls, boys and adolescents in Kazakhstan grow up with greater freedom from all
forms of violence; and those who do experience violence benefit from greater access to care,
support, justice, and other services needed to ensure physical, mental, and social well-being.
Cross-cutting outcome: A multi-sectoral CPS that multiplies the existing capacities of its
individual components and actors to achieve better protection of children from violence
The vision 2030 aligns with the Sustainable Development Goal (and especially 16.2) which sets
for every country of the world, including Kazakhstan, the objective to eliminate all forms of
violence against children (UN, 2016).
The impact statement is made of two parts: the first one focuses on preventing violence
against children and avoid its occurrence; the second one focuses on supporting children
who experience violence to restore their physical, mental, and social well-being. These parts
are in line with Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Kazakhstan is
a State Party (UN CRC, 1989, 2006, 2011).
The cross-cutting outcome is about strengthening the CPS, not as an end in itself but to
achieve greater protection of children from violence. A stronger system recognises existing
capacities, components and sectors, links them more strongly together and multiplies their
outcomes for children.
Within the field of violence prevention and response, there are no narrow vertical chains of
results linking an activity, to an output, outcome, and impact (WHO & End Violence Against
Children Global Partnership et all., 2020). One activity (i.e., the reform of law; the
implementation of new services) may influence multiple outcomes and be most effective at
preventing violence when used in combination with others. As a result, this Theory of Change
assumes that outcomes will produce changes across the results chain, both horizontally and
vertically (UNICEF, 2017a). This vision also aligns with the definition of the CPS, whereby it is
the interlinkages with sectors, actors and components which make up the system(UNICEF,
2019b).81

introduction chapter above.

of data and its analysis. The new Commission
annually reports on progress made to the
President and the Parliament.
The rationale for outcomes, outputs, and activities in CPS Component 1 ‘Laws and policies’
The CPS component on laws and policies should be strengthened in three ways:
1. ensuring full legal protection of children from corporal punishment and mental
violence against children; this will close the gap and bring the national law in full
alignment with the obligations derived from the Convention on the Rights of the
Child as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UN CRC,
2015). The Parliament will be the responsible body to amend the existing law. Given
the recent experience of the drafting of the bill on countering domestic violence, the
resistance and fear that it induced, it is recommended that the new provisions are
civil law provisions, that do not criminalise parents but support them. It is
recommended that the law is widely disseminated within the citizenship and
accompanied by a budget for its implementation.
2. Introducing a law establishing a minimum package of child protection services -
ranging from prevention to response across sectors that would ensure primary
prevention of violence, and assistance and support to child victims of violence; this
outcome is linked to the outcome on services; it will be important that the package
of minimum services builds on existing services that are already established,
identifies existing gaps and proposes new services to fill those gaps.82 It is important
that the establishment of the package of minimum services is done in a consultative
way and jointly led by the new proposed Multi-Ministerial and Multi-Sectoral
Commission on Child Protection/VAC and the new proposed Standing Multi-Sector
Agency for the implementation of CP policies (these new proposed structures are
explained under the governance component below).
Within the proposed new package of minimum services, a model is developed for an
integrated service – one-stop-centres – for child victims of violence and their families.
This should be a child-friendly, multidisciplinary, and interagency model for
responding to child violence and witnesses of violence. The purpose of a one-stop
centre is to offer each child coordinated and effective child protection and criminal
justice response and to prevent traumatisation and re-traumatisation during an
investigation and court proceedings. The centre provides specialised services to child
victims of sexual violence and their families. The centre is not residential and can be
either established anew or graduate from the centres in difficult life circumstances.83

of Child Protection Services that will be useful to implement this change

112
system for prevention and response to violence against children
3. Strengthening and consolidating a high-level, unified vision for the next 10 years on
violence against children. Kazakhstan has expanded enormously the number of
sectoral policies (on social protection, health, education, law enforcement) that
establishes roles and responsibilities of different sectors to prevent and respond to
violence against children. But none of these sectors has the full vision of what the
sum of those sectoral results will mean for the protection of children from violence.
The gender agenda appears to be much more advanced and united than the
protection of children from violence. It is therefore proposed that the central
government – under the leadership of the new proposed Multi-Ministerial and Multi-
Sectoral Commission on Child Protection/VAC (see governance below) lead the
development of a new multi-year policy on CP, that is based on the existing sectoral
ones and integrates them. During its development, the CP Commission involves and
consults NGOs, parents, and children. to it, It also attaches VAC indicators and
establishes the responsibility and necessary budget for the collection of data and its
analysis. This change is linked to the outcomes of oversight and monitoring.

Figure 4: New proposed governance structure of the CPS in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
115
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The rationale for outcomes, outputs, and activities in CPS Component 2 ‘Governance’
The governance of the CPS in Kazakhstan has been the component with the least progress
in the last 10 years. Effective governance has to guarantee multi-ministerial and multi-agency
coordination at the central level for policy setting, across administrative levels for policy
implementation and at the sub-national level for planning and coordination of service
delivery. The new proposed governance structure across levels is illustrated in Figure 4: New
proposed governance structure of the CPS in Kazakhstan.
1) At the central level, Child Protection and Violence against children need to be
elevated above any existing minister to recognise the cross-sectoral nature of
programmes and services to prevent and respond to violence against children. A
similar approach to what the Government has taken to prioritise gender issues and
violence against women. It is therefore proposed to set up a new Multi-Ministerial
and Multi-Agency Commission on Child Protection/Violence against Children, to be
chaired by the Vice Prime Minister and reporting directly to the President of the
Republic of Kazakhstan. The new CP Commission would be in charge of policy
development on Child Protection and Violence against Children. All the relevant
ministries would be part of it, as well as representatives from the Commission on
Gender, Family and Demographic Policies, as well as from NGOs.
2) Secondly, and likewise, at the central level, the President should appoint a Special
Envoy on Violence against children. The Special Envoy is an independent expert who
could speak up on emerging issues related to Violence against Children and make
sure that they remain high on the political agenda. The Special Envoy should advise
both the President and the new CP Commission. The Special Envoy could be selected
amongst representatives of the existing bodies such as the Commissioner for Human
Rights, the Ombudsperson for Children or amongst the members of the Commission
on Gender, Family and Demographic Policies.
3) Thirdly, and again at the central level, a stronger CPS should be equipped with a
Standing Multi-Sectoral Agency, headed by a director and reporting to the new Child
Protection Commission. This agency would not be a convening platform with civil
servants from different ministries representing their sectors. It should be constituted
of appointed officials with sectoral expertise and linked to the respective ministerial
departments that are mandated to ensure coordinated implementation of the cross-
sectoral policies, production of guidance, protocols and guidance that are multi-
sectoral. As existing standing agencies with some responsibility for the
implementation of child protection policies do already exist (Commission on Minors’
Affairs and Committee for the Protection of Children’s Rights), it is advisable that the
new CP Commission decides, upon agreed criteria, if any of the existing agency can
be adapted and equipped to take up the new role. The bottom line is that the
accountability and reporting lines of the multi-sector agency should be taken out of
the Ministry of Education and Science to ensure equal oversight authority over all the
sectors and ministries.
4) It would be important that the new CP-Commission and Multi-sector Agency are
established by law and are provided, like the Special Envoy on VAC, with the
necessary financial resources to effectively exercise their functions.
5) As sectoral fragmentation of service provisions is also a feature of the CPS at the local
level, Oblast, District and Municipal level, it is recommended to strengthen cross-
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
116
system for prevention and response to violence against children
sectoral coordination and accountability at the local level too. It is proposed that a
Cross-agency Department is established at Oblast, District and Municipal level and
chaired by the Deputy Akim. Representatives from the different sectoral
departments as well as from NGOs active on CP on the territory would be the
members of the Department. Their main function would be to assess Child Protection
needs, identify the necessary services to respond to them, coordinate their delivery
and support them in using the multi-sectoral guidance, standards and procedures
developed by the Multi-Sector Agency on CP. Given that at regional, district and
municipal levels Multi-sectoral Commissions on Minors’ Affairs exist already, it would
be important for the Multi-Sector Agency to assess whether they would be suitable
to change their role in coordinating planning and implementation of services and
report to the Multi-Sector Agency at the central level. The cross-agency departments
must be provided with the necessary budget and human capacity to be able to
exercise the extra mandate. The outcomes on governance at sub-national levels are
linked to those on prevention and response services.

system for prevention and response to violence against children
The rationale for outcomes, outputs, and activities in CPS Component 3 ‘Prevention and
response services’
1) Services represent the component that needs further strengthening to ensure better
coverage, availability and access to primary prevention and response services. These
outcomes and outputs are linked to those under Laws (establishment of a minimum
package of services); Governance at the local level (strengthening planning and
coordination of service delivery); Oversight and Monitoring (quality of services) and
financial resources.
2) On the prevention side, it would be important that the primary prevention is
strengthened with universal services that reach the entire child population (0-18
years old) and their parents. New services are needed to reduce the risks of violence
and its occurrence and reach children via schools, medical facilities, youth centres,
social media, sports clubs and worship places. Parents should also have better access
to quality parenting advice and support via visiting nurses, school psychologists,
psychologists, and the established one-stop centres. Finally, families receiving
targeted social assistance should also be able to access programmes that support
gender equity and the prevention of family violence.
3) On the response side, the CPS at the sub-national level should establish and pilot the
model on integrated services (one stop-centres) for children and families as
foreseen under the component on Laws and Policies. It is proposed that the sub-
national Commissions on minors’ affairs lead the pilot in connection with the multi-
sectoral Agency on CP. The pilot should consider whether existing centres for
children in difficult life circumstances could graduate to become one-stop centres for
children and families. The process of graduation is a substantive one, accompanied
by benchmarks and indicators as currently the centres for adaptation are closed
residential centres, do not provide assistance to families and the eligibility criteria
need revising.
4) It is important that the establishment, adaptation, and piloting of new/existing
services are supported by the necessary financial resources needed.

Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
120
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The rationale for outcomes, outputs, and activities in CPS Component 4 ‘Oversight and
monitoring’
1) Kazakhstan Government should strengthen its capacity to routinely collect and
analyse administrative data and indicators on VAC from across the sectors beyond
the data on crimes against children which is currently collected. All sectors should be
mandated to collect administrative data on violence against children according to
agreed definitions, disaggregation, and indicators. The systematic collection and
analysis of such data will improve the capacity to inform and monitor national policies
and services on VAC. The work must be led by the national statistical office together
with the new CP Commission on CP. The indicators on VAC should also be part of the
new national policy on CP/VAC to ensure consistency (link with the outcomes on
policies). Finally, it is important that the Parliament mandate the agencies and
ministries to develop and implement the data information management system and
provide the necessary funds to roll it out.
2) The CPS should have common minimum standards and procedures for sectoral
services that prevent and respond to VAC. Multiple standards exist but have not
been developed in a cross-sectoral fashion and that create obstacles to the
coordination of service provisions. In particular, standards would be needed for
multi-disciplinary assessments, development of individualised care plans, referrals
templates, case management to ensure monitoring and follow-up, consultation with
children and their families on the development and monitoring of the individualised
plan. It is important that these cross-sectoral common standards are based on
existing ones and that the process of reviewing them, identify gaps and develop new
common standards and practices is led by the Multi-Sector Agency. The Multi-Sector
Agency should also be responsible for developing the implementation plan, that is
fully budgeted and funded, and for supporting and overseeing its implementation.

Financial Resources
1) To be able to allocate adequate public resources to prevention and response
services, the Government has to develop a benchmark methodology by which it
identifies the relevant services (as per the minimum package under law’s outcomes)
and calculates the costs of providing them while ensuring full territorial coverage. It
then tracks how they are allocated and executed in each ministerial budget line. As a
subsequent step, the Government should develop a methodology to measure the
cost-effectiveness of some of those services, by comparing the investment needed
versus their outcomes. The two methodologies must be developed under the
leadership of the Ministry of Finance, together with the relevant ministries.
2) The CPS will be strengthened by harmonising nomenclature, functions, and
qualifications of the social workforce across the sectors; by strengthening their
capacity in identifying, referring and support child victims of violence; and by
developing joint common training modules on VAC which is officially accredited and
included in existing training across sectors. It will be important that the Multi-Sector
Agency: lead the work of (a) reviewing existing nomenclature, functions and
qualification across sectors and propose how to harmonise them; and (b) reviewing
all existing assessments of numbers, levels and technical capacities of professionals
across sectors with the responsibility to prevent and respond to VAC with the view
of harmonise them and adapt them to the needs. It develops an implementation plan

The rationale for outcomes, outputs, and activities in CPS Component 6 ‘Participation and
norms’
1) The CPS should be strengthened by ensuring that children are more empowered to
exercise and advocate for their rights, for a life free of violence; and consulted in the
development of laws, policies and services that concern them. It is recommended
that their participation and consultation take place at the municipal level, including
via online platforms and social media and as close as possible to where they live. The
Ombudsperson for children should develop a participation framework to be
developed and implemented with selected municipal-based Commission on Minors’
affairs to develop a permanent consultation structure. The development and roll-out
of the participation structure should be accompanied by the necessary financial
resources.
2) Parents and caregivers should be supported to build more nurturing
parent/children relationships and to improve their non-violent skills and practice in
upbringing. This should be done by the development of communication campaigns
for parents developed by the Ministry of Information and Social Development that
involve influencers and social leaders. The National Statistical Office should regularly
repeat that KAP Survey that was carried out in 2016 and 2020 to measure trends in
violence against children in the family at regular intervals.
3) Child Protection Professionals and the general public should also be supported to
strengthen their understanding of the different forms of violence and support for
non-violent behaviours. This should be led by the Ministry of Information and Social
Development via the development of behavioural change campaigns that involve the
social workforce in their development. The campaigns are implemented by different
actors at the local level together with local leaders, professionals, influencers,
teachers, parents and children.

9. Conclusions and Recommendations
This chapter presents the conclusions and the recommendations.
9.1. Conclusions
The CPS in Kazakhstan has made remarkable progress in the last 10 years. These are
noticeable in the high number of national laws, policies, protocols, and standard operating
procedures that have been adopted and/or are under discussion at the time of writing. This
represents an important enabler to further strengthen the child protection system.
It is equally evident that these reforms haven’t been driven by a common vision and plan to
adequately address violence against children. Individual sectors (health, education and law
enforcement in particular) have taken remarkable steps but without enough cross-sectoral
consultation, coordination and learning.
The CPS as a concept was not there in 2011 and 2021 is still little or differently understood by
policymakers, officials and professionals. Secondly, it is still too fragmented to be able to
provide to children at risk or victims of violence the multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary
support that they need to avoid or repair the experience of violence.
The evaluation found evidence of delays, bottlenecks and opportunities for further
strengthening each of the six components of the CPS (see individual sections below). But it
also confirmed the findings from the inception phase according to which two components
require priority investment and attention by the President and the Government: these are (1)
the component of prevention and response services and (2) the component on governance
at central and sub-national level.
Strengthening and establishing new services is urgently needed as the ones that exist do
provide some bits and pieces of prevention, support and rehabilitation. But they result in a
piecemeal approach that does not guarantee full coverage of needs. Existing services do not
differentiate their support according to different age groups (for example young children
versus adolescents), gender (boy and girl victims of violence), a situation of vulnerabilities
(disability, belonging to an ethnic minority or being from a foreign country) and access across
all territory. Specialised and integrated services for child victims of violence, including sexual
violence, do not exist.
Strengthening the governance of the CPS is an equally high-level priority, both at central and
sub-national levels. The responsibility for developing, implementing, evaluating policies,
programmes and services on violence against children still sit within each line-ministries and
this has not provided for strong enough accountability and execution of policies.
The CPS in Kazakhstan is still too fragmented and built on sectors. Several components of it
have been strengthened during the last decade that would demonstrate that Kazakhstan is
on the right track to bring those pieces under a clearer and unified framework and vision.
Laws and policies
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in introducing legislation prohibiting
violence in certain settings, reducing risks for children being subjected to violence and
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
126
system for prevention and response to violence against children
improving the system of social protection for children in vulnerable situations and their
families.
In terms of prohibition, the Kazakh legislation is quite comprehensive in protecting children
from physical and sexual violence. Nevertheless, it presents two main gaps: (1) it still lacks
definitions of child abuse, violence, abuse, insult, bullying and self-harm; and (2) Although
there is a prohibition of violence on all levels, at home, in the institutions, corporal
punishment is not explicitly prohibited.
In terms of the legal basis for prevention and response services, Kazakhstan has developed
several sectoral laws that have established services for children. Nevertheless, there are still
some gaps that need to be addressed: (1) the experience of violence, abuse and neglect does
not trigger direct eligibility for special social services but only if violence leads to social
deprivation and social maladjustment; (2) specialised services for child victims of violence de
facto do not exist under the law.
Fighting violence against children has become a national policy priority in the last five years.
The second half of the decade has seen the adoption of several sectoral policies (on social
development, on public health, on education) that set the agenda to further develop and
modernise the country until 2025. These are important steps and key enablers for further
reforms. Nevertheless, policies have followed sectoral siloes and have left the system
fragmented. Fighting domestic violence has received the most attention and a cross-sectoral
one; nevertheless, it de-facto focuses on women and not really on women and children. As
of 2021, Kazakhstan does not have a centralised and unifying policy on child
protection/violence against children.
Governance
In Kazakhstan, the governance of the CPS has not evolved much from 2011. This appears to
be one of the main bottlenecks to further strengthen the child protection system. Although
multiple laws and policies were adopted in the last decade, these have been the initiatives by
individual sectors in a siloed way. As in 2021, there is no single central government body
responsible for setting state policies on child protection /violence against children. This has
continued to result in a segmented approach with fragmented sectoral initiatives: multiple
agencies develop and implement programmes without sufficient collaboration and
coordination resulting in gaps.
Unlike Child Protection, gender issues and violence against women have been better
coordinated at central level. The Commission on Gender, Family and Demographic Policies
has contributed to the adoption of the Concept of Family and Gender Policy till 2030. Many
stakeholders used the Commission on Gender as a good example of effective multi-sectoral
coordination, while also recognising its limitation in resources and capacities.
The lack of coordination at the national level is transposed at the sub-national level. Although
the evaluation found some anecdotal evidence of increased cooperation between health,
education, social protection, law enforcement agencies and NGOs, this cooperation is
voluntary, depending on the goodwill of professionals and not based on cross-sectoral
protocols or memorandum of understanding.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
127
system for prevention and response to violence against children
At the local level, the delivery of child protection services is carried out in a fragmented way
and follows sectoral lines. There are several bodies responsible for delivering the services to
children and their families but none of them has a coordinating function. The only official
body with a mandated function for coordination is the multi-sectoral Commissions on Minor’s
Affairs. Nevertheless, its role is limited to assessing the need for the alternative care of
children and out-of-home placement. If provided with more resources and with an expanded
mandate the Commission on Minor’s Affairs could potentially become the coordinating
platform to plan, delivery and coordinate child protection services at local level.
Two informants stressed that coordination works a little better at the local level as all
sectoral departments work under the executive bodies of Akimats and Oblast administration
and therefore the accountability is stronger. This is something that would need further
research.
Prevention and Response Services
The Law on Special Social Services (2008) created the legal basis for the development of
social services for children and families. The Law has therefore been the greatest enabler as
well as bottlenecks for the creation of cross-sectoral services for child victims of violence.
Several specialised social services were created in the last decade and across services, but
very few of them with the prevention or response to VAC as the central objective.
In prevention, some noticeable signs of progress have been made through the introduction
of the universal patronage nurses in 2017 and the piloting of the whole-school violence
prevention programmes in 2014 (which was discontinued because of lack of funding).
Nevertheless, prevention services are still the result of a piecemeal approach that presents
either overlap (for example between youth health centres and youth resource centres, or
between school psychologists and school pedagogues) or overlooked areas such as
parenting programmes. At the same time school programmes directed at prevention offer
resources to school administration and psychologists to incorporate violence prevention
lessons into the existing school curriculum, but their capacity seems to be limited by an
approach that is perceived to be stigmatising and punitive and sheading bad reputation on
schools. Targeted social assistance has been introduced and strengthened and this is an
important step to reduce the vulnerabilities of fragile households, nevertheless, it has not
been accompanied by any violence prevention in family or parent support.
When it comes to response services, specialised services for child victims of violence are very
rare in Kazakhstan, both in terms of availability and coverage. Support services for child
victims of violence (treatment, psycho-social and mental health, recovery and reintegration)
are mainly residential in nature, are provided both by NGOs and the State. They only provide
support to children who are eligible for them but not to their parents or siblings if they would
need it. There is a small number of crisis centres – both state and private – available for
women victims of violence, that potentially offer service for girls, but they de-facto are
primarily targeted at women. Therefore, it would be important to ensure that existing and
new services for child victims of violence consider the gender of the victims and adapt the
assessment of needs and the support to be provided accordingly.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
128
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Oversight and monitoring, quality of services
Since 2011, Kazakhstan has taken considerable steps to develop its national surveillance
system on violence against children. With the support from UN agencies, it carried out
several nationally representative surveys (amongst them MICS, VAW, and HBSC). It is also
noticeable that the National Statistical Office joined in 2019 the Inter-Agency Expert Group
on VAC measurement led by UNICEF at global level.
Surveillance using criminal and administrative data has nevertheless lagged, and little
progress has been made since 2011. As of 2020, Kazakhstan, besides the collection of criminal
data, still lacks national standards and indicators for collecting data on VAC and no inter-
agency protocols to facilitate the sharing of administrative data across sectors and ministries,
agencies, and services providers.
Human Rights Institutions established in Kazakhstan has played a significant role in
monitoring and exposing the status of violence against children in Kazakhstan. Although not
fully compliant with the Paris Principle, the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights has
been championing the issue of violence against children in state-run institutions, in schools
and lately in the family. Under the same office, the National Prevention Mechanism to
prevent torture is mandated to visit children’s institutions. Finally, a Children’s
ombudsperson was appointed in 2016, but without the necessary resources to fully exercise
its functions.
As of 2015, different line ministries have adopted quality standards and sectoral practices to
deal with the identification, referral, and support of child victims of violence. All the
standards were developed based on the Law on Special Social Services of 2008 (last
amended in 2019). Only a few of them (the most noticeable exception is the SOP on VAC for
medical staff) require the services to carry out multi-disciplinary needs assessment, develop
an individualised plan and assign a case manager to monitor it and follow it up. None of them
requests the services to consult children in the assessment of their needs and in the
identification of services that are made available to him/her. The existing ones do
nevertheless represent a strong basis from which to develop new cross-sectoral ones on
VAC.
Human and financial resources
Since the adoption of the Law on Specialised Social Services in 2008, Kazakhstan has invested
enormously in the planning, development and support of the social service workforce. It has
established the necessary legal and regulatory framework, the classifications of cadres and
other professionals, certification requirements and practice. Nevertheless, every sector has
taken its path without coordinating with other sectors or learning from similar processes.
This is particularly problematic for an area of work, such as preventing and responding to
violence against children, where the collaboration across sectors and disciplines brings
better outcomes for children than what each sector can achieve alone. Kazakhstan has the
ambition to strengthen the social sector, by building on what exists and unifying and
consolidating standards and regulatory frameworks across ministerial silos.
There is emerging training on VAC by the initiative of different universities, training centres,
UN agencies and NGOs, but these are not certified and are not equally provided across all the
disciplines and grades.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
129
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The number of social workers and their caseload is difficult to assess across the sectors, given
the different classifications and functions. There is nevertheless anecdotal evidence that half
of the social workers are lacking.
Finally, the social workforce across the sectors has low salaries and low status. Incentives,
performance management and supervision are unequal across the sectors and these need to
be addressed.
Given the current unclear institutionalization of cross-departmental child protection services
and the lack of definition of a single minimum service package for CP, the allocation of
financial resources to the CPS cannot yet be measured rigorously. However, the government
has made substantive steps in determining the necessary budgets for each new legislative
action. In some sectors, namely education and health, Government is capable of determining
the level of investment needed. Furthermore, the new State Programme on education (2019)
commits to having a consolidated child budget. These are important steps that can be
considered as necessary preconditions to track expenditures in a defined, cross-sectorial
service package for CP, once established.
Social Participation
After the 2007-2011 Programme “Children of Kazakhstan,” there hasn’t been any national
framework or vision on children and youth participation in Kazakhstan. Although there have
been initiatives to consult children and youth at the local level, these have still to be
institutionalised and given a formal framework and importance.
In 2011 there was no evidence of the recognition that in Kazakhstan children experienced
violence at home, in schools, in state institutions and the community. However, since the
mid-2010s thanks to the efforts of UNICEF and the National Human Rights Centre, there is an
emerging discussion about the importance of social norms affecting VAC. Knowledge,
attitudes, and practices on violence against children in families have been assessed twice
(2016 and 2020) and although there are some persisting patterns in support of violence to
discipline and control children, there have also been some positive changes in the reduction
of the use of physical violence by parents. Nevertheless, in 2020, there is still 33% of child
protection professionals who support the use of corporal punishment to discipline and
control children.
9.2. Recommendations
The recommendations were developed emerging from the systematic analysis of the data
and a discussion of hypotheses during the stakeholder workshop with the ERG on 22-23 of
June 2021. All hypotheses were contrasted with the UNICEF country office. The
recommendations were presented to the ERG on the 2nd of September 2021, and ERG was
given the opportunity to comment.
The evaluation highlighted that there are two components of the CPS that need substantive
and urgent strengthening: these are the component on prevention and response services
(component 3) and the component on governance (component 2). These are the
components that are lagging behind, relatively to the others, and that would require major
reform and investment of capacities and resources to ensure better protection of children
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
130
system for prevention and response to violence against children
from all forms of violence. These are also the components that require strong political will
and major incentives to make the CPS truly cross-sectoral and child-centred.
The other 4 components (laws&policies; monitoring&oversight; human&financial resources;
participation&norms) also present weaknesses and bottlenecks that need to be addressed.
Many of the required changes are nevertheless supportive, pre-requisites or consequences
of the reforms needed in services and governance. This is consistent with a systems
approach, in which the collective strength of various system components is important for the
functioning of the system as a whole.
The recommendations are organised per CPS components, starting with those on services
and governance and following with the others. They are built on the outputs (medium-term
recommendations) and activities (short-term recommendations) as identified in the Theory
of Change. They identify the primary intended users and uses.
9.2.1. Top priority recommendations
Recommendations on Prevention and Response Services
R I. Improve the availability, coverage, and access to primary prevention services
across sectors
Medium-term action:
Action 1) At the most appropriate sub-national administrative level (region, district,
municipal), respective sectors should strengthen primary prevention of
violence against children via either existing services or the establishment of
new ones. The gaps that the evaluation identified included:
a. For children:
i. Education, life skills, livelihood, and whole-school violence
prevention programmes
ii. Age-appropriate information about sexuality and healthy
relationship in secondary schools, medical facilities, and youth
centres
iii. Knowledge about rights and age-appropriate information on where
to seek help for violence (on social media, in schools, in youth
centres, in sports clubs, worship places, etc.)
b. For parents:
i. access to quality parenting advice and support (through universal
patronage nurses, school psychologists and in one-stop centres for
children and families (see response services)
c. For households in vulnerable socio-economic situations: integrate attention
to gender equity and family violence prevention in targeted social assistance
Short term actions
Action 2) It is recommended that the process is driven by the sub-national level in a
coordinated fashion: the Sub-national Commissions on Minor’s affairs (with
an extended mandate, capacities and resources – see governance) together
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
131
system for prevention and response to violence against children
with sectoral departments (education, health, social protection, law
enforcement) responsible for their services map and assess existing primary
prevention services and identify those that need to be strengthened and/or
established.
Action 3) It is recommended that the gaps assessment of primary prevention services
is carried out by using the Package of Essential Child Protection Services that
is recommended to be established (see laws and policies).
Action 4) Based on the results of the gaps assessment the Sub-national Commissions
on Minor’s affairs (with an extended mandate, capacities, and resources – see
governance) establishes an implementation plan that is costed, budgeted
and resourced. They coordinate and oversee its implementation and report
on progress (see reporting lines on governance).
R II. Improve the availability, coverage, and access of integrated services for the care
and support to child victims/survivors of violence and their families
Medium-term action:
Action 5) At the most appropriate sub-national administrative level (region, district,
municipal), a new integrated service model – or one-stop centre - is tested
and scaled up. The integrated service model should provide to each child a
child-friendly, multidisciplinary, and interagency response model to child
sexual abuse and the provision of services for child victims and witnesses of
violence. It should enable effective collaboration between relevant judicial,
social, and health care actors in one child-friendly premise, to avoid any
secondary victimisation of the child.
Action 6) It is recommended that the integrated service model is part of the minimum
package of child protection services, and it is established under the law (see
laws and policies).
Short term actions
Action 7) It is recommended that the pilot and scale-up process is driven by the sub-
national level in a coordinated fashion: the Sub-national Commissions on
Minor’s affairs (with the extended mandate, capacities, and resources – see
governance) together with the new Multi-Sectoral Agency for CP policy
implementation (see governance) establishes a plan for the piloting and
scaling up of one-stop centres for children and families.
Action 8) It is recommended that the piloting and scaling up of one-stop centres
consider whether existing centres for children in difficult life circumstances
could graduate to become the one-stop centres for children and families. The
process of graduation should nevertheless be a substantive one,
accompanied by benchmarks and indicators as currently the centres for
adaptation are closed residential centres, do not provide assistance to
families and the eligibility criteria need revising.

Action 9) It is recommended that the establishment, adaptation, and piloting of the
new integrated service model for children and families are supported by the
necessary financial resources needed to ensure their sustainability.

R III. Strengthening cross-ministerial and multi-agency coordination and accountability
for policy development, advocacy, and implementation (central level)
Medium-term actions:
Action 10) The central government should establish the mandate and responsibility for:
a. A new central high-level multi-ministerial and multi-agency Commission to
develop and monitor the implementation of state policies on VAC. The
Commission should be chaired by the Vice Prime Minister and reporting
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
133
system for prevention and response to violence against children
directly to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. All the relevant
ministries would be part of it, as well as representatives from the Commission
on Gender, Family and Demographic Policies, as well as from NGOs.
b. A high-level special envoy on ending VAC to keep the topic high on the
Government agenda
c. A standing multi-sector agency under the inter-ministerial Commission with
clear accountability lines towards Health, Education, Social Protection, Law
enforcement to coordinate the implementation of the state policies on VAC
across administrative levels. The agency should be made by appointed
officials with sectoral expertise and linked to the respective ministerial
departments. They are mandated to ensure coordinated implementation of
the cross-sectoral policies, production of guidance, protocols and guidance
that are multi-sectoral.
Action 11) It is recommended that the new CP-Commission and Multi-sector Agency are
established by law (defining composition, mandate, accountability lines) and
are provided, like the Special Envoy on VAC, with the necessary financial
resources to effectively exercise their functions.
Short-term actions:
Action 12) It is recommended that the President:
a. mandates the establishment of the new multi-ministerial and multi-agency
Commission to provide the necessary political weight and leadership.
b. adopt a presidential decree to establish the post of Special Envoy on VAC and
appoints him/her. The new multi-ministerial and multi-agency Commission
should advise the President as to who is best poised to assume that role
(Human Rights Commissioner, Ombudsperson for Children, a member of the
Commission on Gender, family, and demographic policies)
Action 13) Concerning the recommended establishment of the multi-sector standing
agency, it is recommended that options are considered as to whether
existing bodies (Committee on the Protection of Children Rights or the
Commission on Minors’ Affairs) could be reformed and assume the new
mandate, role and be accountable to the new CP Commission. It is
recommended that it is the new Commission assessing the feasibility of such
options, according to a clear analytical framework.
R IV. Strengthen the coordination of Oblast, District and Municipal Akimats to plan and
deliver services that prevent and respond to VAC
Medium-term actions:
Action 14) It is recommended that a Cross-agency Department is established at Oblast,
District and Municipal level and chaired by the Deputy Akim. Representatives
from the different sectoral departments as well as from NGOs active on CP
on the territory should be the members of the Department. Their main
function would be to assess Child Protection needs, identify the necessary
services to respond to them, coordinate their delivery and support them in
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
134
system for prevention and response to violence against children
using the multi-sectoral guidance, standards and procedures developed by
the Multi-Sector Agency on CP.
Action 15) It is recommended that the Multi-Sector Agency assesses whether existing
Multi-sectoral Commissions on Minors’ Affairs (at regional, district and
municipal levels) would be suitable to change their role to coordinating
planning and implementation of services and report to the Multi-Sector
Agency at the central level.
Action 16) It is recommended that the Multi-sectoral Commissions (with expanded
mandate) are provided with the necessary budget and human capacity to be
able to exercise the extra mandate.

9.2.2. Second priority recommendations
Recommendations on laws and policies
R V. Strengthen the legal protection of children from corporal punishment in the home
and kindergartens, from mental violence and bullying
Medium-term action
Action 17) The Parliament should adopt/amend the civil law to explicitly prohibit
corporal punishment in the home, kindergartens, and orphanages as well as
mental violence and bullying. It is recommended that the law establishes the
necessary budget for its implementation.
Short-term actions
Action 18) The appropriate parliament committee should propose the necessary
amendments to introduce a clear ban on corporal punishment of children in
home settings, kindergartens and orphanages as well as mental violence and
bullying. It is recommended that law does not criminalise parents and is
accompanied by a communication campaign to diffuse knowledge and
support behaviour change campaigns at the local level (link with participation
and norms)
R VI. Strengthen the legal basis for specialised services for child victims of violence
Medium-term action
Action 19) The Parliament should adopt a law that establishes a minimum package of
child protection services. It is recommended that the minimum package is
organised along the continuum of child protection, from prevention to
response and across the sector. It is recommended that the minimum
package builds on existing services that are already established and proposes
new services to fill existing gaps. (Link with services)
Short-term actions
Action 20) It is recommended that the establishment of the package of minimum
services is done in a consultative way and jointly led by the new proposed
Multi-Ministerial and Multi-Sectoral Commission on Child Protection/VAC and
the new proposed Standing Multi-Sector Agency for the implementation of
CP policies working in coordination with the Parliament.
R VII. Strengthening and consolidating a high-level, unified vision for the next 10 years
on violence against children.
Medium-term action
Action 21) The Central Government – under the leadership of the new proposed Multi-
Ministerial and Multi-Sectoral Commission on Child Protection/VAC (see
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
136
system for prevention and response to violence against children
governance above) should lead the development of a new multi-year policy
on CP, that is based on the existing sectoral ones and integrates them.
Action 22) Strengthening and consolidating a high-level, unified vision for the next 10
years on violence against children. It is recommended that the policy also
includes VAC indicators, establishes the responsibility and necessary budget
for the routine collection of data and its analysis, and defines the periodicity
of external evaluation (Link to monitoring and oversight)
Short-term actions
Action 23) It is recommended that CP Commission involves and consults NGOs, parents,
and children.
Medium-term action
Action 24) The central Government should strengthen its capacity to routinely collect
and analyse administrative and criminal data and indicators on VAC from
across the sectors beyond the data on crimes against children which is
currently collected. All sectors should be mandated to collect administrative
data on violence against children according to agreed definitions,
disaggregation, and indicators.
Short-term actions
Action 25) It is recommended that the work is led by the national statistical office
together with the new CP Commission (see governance above) through a
working group that includes all sectors. The indicators must be built upon
national legislation and align with relevant global indicators (especially on
SDGs indicators). The indicators on VAC (or a sub-set of them) should also be
part of the new national policy on CP/VAC to ensure consistency (see policies
above). It is recommended that the working group develop a digitalised and
centralised Child Protection Information Management System (CPIMS) to
collect, safely store and transfer data. Finally, it is recommended that the
Parliament mandate the agencies and ministries implement the CPIMS and
provide the necessary funds to roll it out.
R VIII. Developing common cross-sectoral minimum standards and procedures for all
services preventing and responding to VAC
Medium-term action
Action 26) The new Multi-sector Agency on CP (see governance) should lead the
development of common minimum standards and procedures for sectoral
services that prevent and respond to VAC. The evaluation has found that
these are particularly needed for multi-disciplinary assessments,
development of individualised care plans, referrals templates, case
management to ensure monitoring and follow-up, consultation with children
and their families on the development and monitoring of the individualised
plan. It is recommended that these cross-sectoral common standards are
based on existing ones across sectors.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
137
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Short-term action
Action 27) It is recommended that the new Multi-sector Agency on CP together with
relevant sectors review all existing standards, identifies commonalities, good
practices and gaps and develop common ones. The Multi-sector Agency
should develop and oversee the implementation of the roll-out plan and
support the sectors and services to implement them. It is recommended that
the implementation plan is budgeted and financially supported.

R IX. Strengthening the Government capacity to allocate the necessary financial
resources to services and programmes on VAC and to assess their cost-
effectiveness
Medium-term actions:
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
138
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Action 28) It is recommended that the Ministry of Finance gives priority to the
development of the methodology to calculate the financial benchmark for
child protection. It is recommended that it involves relevant line ministries
and involve them in the following steps: mapping child protection services,
track how they are financed in each ministerial budget line, calculate their
running and capital costs and the total cost to ensure full geographical
coverage. It is recommended that the analysis is carried out every two years
to be able to adjust costs with resources in a swift manner.
Action 29) It is recommended that the Ministry of Finance develop the cost-effective
methodology after the one to financially benchmark child protection and
with the involvement of the relevant line ministries. It is recommended that
the cost-effectiveness of services is developed for a selected type and
number of them (most likely response services whose impact might be easier
to determine and cost) and carried out as of 2030 onwards.
Short-term action
Action 30) It is recommended that the Ministry of Finance consults with the relevant line
ministries on the options to track expenditures related to the CPS, and to
prevention and response to VAC specifically, in the National Budget, based on
the minimum package of child protection services (see laws and services
above)
R X. Strengthening the number, capacities, and harmonising social workforce across
sectors
Medium-term actions
Action 31) The Government should harmonise the nomenclature, functions and rules of
certification and training of the social workforce with the responsibility to
prevent and respond to VAC. It identifies commonalities, good practices, and
gaps; as well as proposing harmonisation. It is recommended that the reform
is led by the new Multi-sector Agency on CP, by creating an ad-hoc multi-
sectoral public service task force together with relevant ministries.
Action 32) The Government should increase the number and capacity of the social
workforce to identify, refer and support children at risk and victims of
violence. Necessary steps would include reviewing all existing assessments of
number, salary levels and competencies of professionals across sectors;
identify discrepancies, alignments, and gaps; make a proposal to harmonise
them and adapt numbers and capacities to the needs.
Action 33) The Ministry of Education and Science should certify a common multi-
disciplinary training module at BA level on VAC to be integrated with
accredited training on social work, primary health care, social pedagogy, and
police investigation.
Short-term actions:
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
139

and services that concern them
Medium-term action
Action 35) It is recommended that the Ombudsperson for children develops a
framework for Municipal Akimats to consult children on draft laws, policies
and services that concern them, including on VAC
Short-term action
Action 36) It is recommended that the Ombudsperson for children convenes a group of
municipal-based Commission on Minors’ Affairs (with an extended mandate
– see governance) to consult with them on the development of a permanent

to implement it.
R XII. Supporting parents and caregivers to build more nurturing relationships with
their children and improve non-violent skills and practices in upbringings
Medium-term actions:
Action 37) It is recommended that the Ministry of Information and Social Development
develops and implements communication campaigns for parents which
involve influencers, personalities, and social media actors to multiply the
reach and outputs.
Action 38) It is recommended that the National Statistical Office regularly repeats the
KAP Survey on VAC in families (carried out in 2016 and 2020) and keeps track
of trends and informs the Ministry of Information and Social Development
and the new CP Multi-Ministerial Commission (see governance) on
progress/setbacks on social norms on violence against children.
R XIII. Supporting professionals and the general public’s engagement in protecting the
rights of all children to grow up free of violence
Medium-term actions:
Action 39) It is recommended that the Ministry of Information and Social Development
involve professionals from across the social workforce services in the
development of behavioural change campaigns at the local level.

Note: In some cases, the lead responsibility has been identified to be assumed by the CP Commission or the CP agency, as well as the Special Envoy on VAC. While the CP Commission is
assigned a series of policy-related tasks, the CP agency is charged with rather technical tasks of standard developments, assessments, and the development of operational systems. The
Special Envoy has a decisive task in the political communication of the institutional efforts to prevent and respond to VAC. These institutions do not yet exist. Their creation is a central
recommendation of this evaluation to better ensure a cross-departmental and whole-of-government response to VAC, as well as the deployment of primary and secondary prevention.
Whilst these institutions do not exist, the very – multisectoral! - nature of CP does not allow to assign the tasks to a specific line ministry, as argued in the body of this study and the
literature (UNICEF, 2018a, 2019a, 2019b, 2021). Therefore, while awaiting the creation of these permanent coordination structures, a properly mandated institution, most likely at the level
of a Vice-presidency, will have to assume the identified tasks in a provisional and transitory manner.

Annex 1: Case studies on children’s journeys through the Child
Protection System
To provide an illustrative narrative of the lived experience of children at risk of violence or
who have suffered violence, this section presents case studies that relay the past situation
of four persons who have suffered abuse or violence as children or adolescents. The research
team recreated their experience by speaking to four young adults and their environment.84
The majority of the information and data for these case studies have been gathered through
qualitative methods – both interviews with young adults, as well as their relatives, friends
and professionals that gave support. In some cases, the social researcher has selected several
persons that form part of the social relations and the child protection system, both the care
environment and professional guardians, principally NGO service provider staff. The
interviews had been guided by the case study methodology, which in detail is replicated in
the annexe.
The aim is to provide a biographical reconstruction of their lived experiences as a child, the
opportunities and barriers faced, as well as their aspirations, hopes, and dreams for the
future. The purpose of the case study is to understand and narrate the journey of one child
through the child protection system. In particular, the case studies on young adults respond
to the refined research questions on availability, coordination, appropriateness, equity, and
participation.
The conclusions of the case studies are informed by the statements of the young adults
themselves who reflect on their childhood and upbringing.
Case study on sexual violence – abuse by the stepfather
In 2001, Adel* was born as the first child in her family.
In 2004, when Adel was a three-year-old child, her mother married again, and she had a
stepfather.
In 2007, her stepfather started to sexually abuse her when she was 6 years old. She was a
victim of all types of violence from her stepfather from 6 years old until the age of 18.
In 2014, she was raped by her stepfather when she was 13 years old. When she became elder,
she realised that what he was doing was wrong and wanted to tell her mother, but he
threatened her into silence and controlled her relations.
In 2019, she told her aunts and mother about her stepfather's sexual, emotional, and
psychical abuse which continued over 12 years. They sought care from a trained health
provider for symptoms and conditions, including injuries that needed medical attention.
In 2019, a criminal case was opened against the perpetrator, and – contrary to legal provisions
– she started participating in court hearings alone.
84 All names, places and names of organizations were changed in order to ensure privacy and
protection of the persons that have shared their experiences. Where a name was changed it is
indicated with a star*.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
161
system for prevention and response to violence against children
My mother got married the second time when I was three years old, and my stepfather
started to assault me and touch my intimate parts. He raped me when I was 13 years old.
At that time, I did not know what he was doing, and I thought it is normal, and he loved
me like other fathers. When I became elder, I realised that what he was doing was wrong
and wanted to tell my mother, but he said that he would kill my mother and my little
brothers and sisters if I told someone about it. I was afraid of him because he beat me,
emotionally assaulted me, and did not leave me alone with my mother. I even did not
have any friends from school. Probably, he was afraid that I would talk to someone. I did
not even have a personal cell phone. I changed many schools and wanted to go to the
medical college after 9 the grade, but he did not let me. Nowadays, I have only a school
certificate and have not attended any university yet. In the future, I would like to
become a doctor and help other girls, who survived sexual violence like me.
Availability and access to services
Most existing services that address sexual violence against girls are embedded in services
that address violence against women and domestic violence. This has the disadvantage that
sexual violence against girls is often dealt with as a problem for the family unit, rather than
as a problem for the individual child. The Children’s rights committee works to protect
children’s rights as well as prevent crime. It disseminates information and works with schools
and communities. However, they were not able to identify the victim of sexual violence at
school. Effectively, Adel could not access any of the child protection services.
I did not even know that in my schools should be a psychologist because I never saw
them.
I just wanted to die in critical moments, and I took several attempts to kill myself, but
all of them were unsuccessful. Only later, after several sessions with my psychologist, I
realised that I have to live. (Adel).
Adults and parents must take the steps needed to prevent child sexual abuse. They are
responsible for ensuring that children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and
environments. (Adel’s mother).
Appropriateness and equity of available services
Frontline personnel are often not trained properly to deal sensitively with children.
Moreover, the guidelines on how to approach such cases are often unclear. There is a lack of
effective approaches to identify and protect the child- and adolescent victims of sexual abuse
and exploitation. There are no youth organizations or NGOs which are interested in adopting
strategies to prevent child sexual abuse. Hotline services cannot maintain a 24-hour hotline
for receiving all reports of sexual violence. NGOs are the main actors involved in providing
psychosocial support and working at the community level to reduce the risks of
stigmatisation. The local police and the prosecutor’s office often re-victimise the victims of
sexual violence because of their prejudicial attitudes towards denunciations of sexual
violence against girls and because of the lack of training and resources they receive.
When I was 18 years old, I told my mothers’ sister about it and filed a lawsuit against him
at the local police. We spent 1.5 years in court proceedings, and we lost this case.
Afterwards, he said that he had bribed the judge and even our attorney.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
162
system for prevention and response to violence against children
It was a jury trial. When they took the witness account, I was shocked at how they were
talking to me. All these procedures of proving that he had raped me were hard to
handle. I was sitting alone during the court proceeding because they did not let my
mother sit with me. Our attorney did not help me, and he said that I probably made it
up all these stories, and I lost my memory. However, I do remember everything that he
did to me. Sometimes during those 12 years, I intentionally started to gain weight and
even stopped to take a shower to disgust him and avoid his sexual abuse, but he did not
pay attention to it. However, the attorney did. He said to the jury trial that how 18 years
old girl, who gains 120 kg could attract him.
Coordination of services
Adel faced revictimization risk due to a lack of support from police and other child protection
system services. Adel and her mother contacted specialised and confidential telephone lines
to report domestic violence against women. These initiatives follow successful initiatives by
NGOs such as “Talk-to-me”*, which helped and consulted her. “Talk-to-me” NGO operates
telephone lines that help victims of domestic violence to seek confidential support. They
develop and promote accessible, culturally relevant, and trauma-informed responses to
domestic violence and other lifetime trauma to include sexual abuse. Effectively addressing
victims’ medical needs must be a priority, without which victims may not be able to engage
in any judicial proceedings, which is not available at the local level. Courts and other justice
system processes usually do not have a victim-centred approach for the child victim of sexual
violence. Victims must be prepared with a realistic assessment for court proceedings.
The system did not work at all I can say that with 100%. I thought they would help me
escape that horrible situation where I lived for 12 years, but they demonstrated to me
like I was a prostitute who seduced her stepfather. After losing the court case, we
contacted “Talk-to-me”, and they told us that we easily could have won this case. I
cannot trust anyone. I keep everything inside. Perhaps because of this, I cannot forget
my childhood. They provided the services of a psychologist, medical experts, and they
supported us financially. They found an attorney for us who would be dealing with our
other civil cases with him. (Adel).
We did not access any services except the local police. The local police did not provide
any services. After losing our case, we found Dina Tansari and her fund NGO who helped
us. They explained that we should have applied to the appeal court, but our attorney
said we could not go to any further court instances. Our attorney knew that we do not
know anything about legislation, and we believed them. (Adel’s mother).
Participation and consultation of the child in key decisions and monitoring progress
Girls who suffer sexual violence from their stepfathers are exposed to a lack of recognition
and legal protection. Adel’s mother, who had four children with her daughter’s abuser,
related the abuse and the regime of menace and control exercised by the father. She
exposed how everyone knew he was a violent sexual predator, but nobody said or did
anything during court hearings. Adel was having depression and posttraumatic stress
disorder symptoms. Other negative consequences of sexual violence victimization included
decreased self-esteem and disruptions to the daily routine in Adel’s life.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
163
system for prevention and response to violence against children
It was a devastating time for me. I started to hate myself and started to believe that I
am evil, not him. (Adel).
Before filing a lawsuit at the local court, I went to several attorneys, and they explained
that our case is helpless because Adel was 18 years old, and it was almost impossible to
prove that he has raped her. None of the attorneys wanted to take our case. Finally, I
found an attorney. However, he took almost 3 million tenges from me and received a
bribe from my ex-husband. So we lost our case. (Adel’s mother).
Critical gaps and positive outcomes
Adel made public an event that involved some combination of personal shame, fear, or
anticipation of negative consequences like blame, disbelief, and stigmatization. She
experienced substantial emotional conflict about making disclosures. Adel and her attorney
had weak community support, unprepared evidence against the perpetrator and he was
found not guilty at the end of the trial. The perpetrator was in a position of trust and
authority, being older than the victim of sexual violence. The child has been criminalised
referring to laws on prostitution rather than being protected and supported as a child victim.
There is an urgent need to shift the attention to perpetrators and work preventively by
regulating the sexual exploitation of children. Cases of sexual violence have not been
predominantly addressed from a perspective of criminal liability, in some cases neglecting
key aspects of victims’ protection, rights and needs.
Conclusion
Today, looking back, Adel relates the following:
I still have nightmares. I am currently working on it. Because I have a lot of fear, disgust,
bad thoughts towards myself ... A lot of regrets that I did not talk to anyone before.
When I reached emotional peaks, when I wanted to scream at how much it hurt
internally, I thought that it would be better if my life ended right now. I then begged for
something to happen to me. Because for me it was the easiest way out of this situation.
In critical moments, I could only rely on NGO “Talk to me”. I guess only the NGOs worried
about us. State institutions do not care about the victims of violence, it had been proven
during our court proceedings.
I always imagined that all this did not exist: everything is fine, everybody is like normal
people. I repeated this to myself every day. I tried to cross out immediately – press
delete! I erased from my memory what happened yesterday. I have learned so well to
convince myself that sometimes it was difficult to reconstruct the events of the previous
days.
We need to be attentive to our relatives and friends. Ask what is happening to them. If
there is an opportunity to influence a person for the better, you need to stop and help.
But you can't make a deal with your conscience. We live in a kind of society where you
cannot escape condemnation ...
Case study on violence and bullying in a rural area
In 1998, Arkhat Nugmanov* was born as a 5th child, after his four sisters.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
164
system for prevention and response to violence against children
In 2008, his father passed away and they moved to a small village. Arkhat was 10 years old.
During 2012-2016, Arkhat participated in Kazakh wrestling and took part in regional sports
competitions. He was 14-18 years old. During that time, he was bullied and insulted by his
coach. His coach was beating him with his leather belt and insulting him emotionally.
Only in 2015, he revealed his coach’s violence to his sister Gulden* when he was 17 years old,
however, she could not help him to inform about it. She was bringing pain-relieving drugs to
him. They were silent together about it. From their siblings, they hid the fact that Arkhat was
abused. Never did they get in contact with any organization in the child protection system.
I am the only man in our family, I was born after my 5 sisters, and we lost my father when
I was ten years old. If you know Kazakh traditions, you know how my parents wanted to
have a boy and raised me like a prince. In our auyl (auyl-village), we did not have many
activities for children, and I was engaged in Kazakh wrestling since I was ten years old.
I changed my school in 5th grade because we moved from Aktau city to our village to
live there after my father passed away. I guess I was a target for the village boys because
I was a city boy and some of them never saw a city. I decided to engage in Kazakh
wrestling because my classmates bullied me and called me "Kyzteke" ( A boy like a girl).
According to them, I acted like a girl, and I was not masculine enough to study at that
school.
Firstly, I was emotionally bullied by my classmates, and my Kazakh wrestling coach was
also rude because he did not want to take me for his sports section, but I insisted to
become one of the members of that section, which existed in our school to avoid all
evenings with my neighbours and classmates. From 14 years old until 18 years old, I
always participated in regional sports competitions and demonstrated promising
results. I had to spend my free time somewhere.
After all my unsuccessful sports competitions, my coach started to insult me, and later
on, he started to beat me with his leather belt. In the beginning, I thought it was a
normal reaction because I deserve it and I was not good enough at a sports competition.
Nevertheless, his violent actions did not stop, and I got used to it. According to our
tradition, I had to obey the older man and my coach. Also, I assumed that he is 60 years
old, and he can be nervous sometimes. I did not know anything about the child
protection system. If my mother could not protect me from physical violence, how could
I think about other systems or state bodies? I was hopeless and had to face my “own
tragedy”. I had a dream to win first place in competitions and deserve my coach’s
respect. However, it did not happen. Probably I was a “weak as a girl or mommy’s little
boy” like he said to me. [Arkhat]
Availability and access to services
Arkhat and his sister did not have access to good-quality health, social welfare, and criminal
justice support services for victims of physical, emotional or psychological violence and
sexual violence in three specific settings: households, schools and communities in their
village.
I did not know about services which were available in our village. We have only one
hospital; we could not go there because all the medical staff knew my mother and could
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
165
system for prevention and response to violence against children
gossip. Our family would be ashamed because our little brother could not protect
himself. In our school, we did not have a psychologist, and there was a deficit of even
schoolteachers. [Gulden, Arkhat sister]
Appropriateness and equity of available services
Arkhat did not have access to any service of the child protection system, including prevention
and response of VAC at the local level. Because the service providers did not identify, treat,
support, and refer children and adolescent survivors of violence at the local level. The
children did not know about their rights. He did not even consider informing about his
abusive coach.
After one of the competitions, my coach beat my face and I bled when I took second
place. After this situation, my elder sister Gulden* realised that my coach’s actions
calmed me down. Before, during all those years, I had become aggressive at home. My
mother thought that it was due to my age. After several years, I realised that it was not
due to my age. I was having panic attacks and was helpless. I survived those years alone,
and those years affected my behaviour and shaped my character, I guess.
Coordination of services
Arkhat was afraid and ashamed to inform anyone about his coach considering his age and his
relationship with his family. He did not how to access any services, whether justice, health,
education, or social services. They were not aware and could not provide specialised
rehabilitative response and support services to children affected by violence in a rural area.
In our village, they do not know about child protection! How would they know about
those systems if they do not know about children’s rights and cannot distinguish
violence from traditions?
Participation and consultation of the child in key decisions and monitoring progress
Arkhat was never involved in critical decision processes because he did not disclose his VAC
case to any child protection system.
I always respected my coach because he became like a father to me. I closed my eyes to
his violence. I thought that was normal and every father beats his boy my age. When he
beat me with his leather belt, I thought I deserve it, because I did not win.
We did not want to talk about it with our mother because I knew it could break her
heart. She was the only breadwinner in our family and it seemed fair to us to keep our
secret, instead of worrying about what we cannot control [Gulden, Arkhat sister]
Conclusion
Arkhat could not think about any positive experience from the system’s response. Local
services, local communities, NGOs, and civil society did not have any awareness of children’ s
rights to promote positive social norms and grow up free of violence at the local level. As a
boy, Arkhat was afraid of public humiliation and had not been empowered by knowledge
about his rights, non-violent conflict resolution and non-discrimination. Today, these are his
reflections:
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
166
system for prevention and response to violence against children
We cannot change our mindset with legislation. I could not disclose my coach’s violent
actions. I think our society expects us to be strong as a man, and – considering those
labels – we are ashamed to say that we were victims of violence. If so, it means you are
not strong enough, and you are blackmailed again. Also, we have to know the difference
between respect and hiding inappropriate behaviour. I can indeed say that you will
never hear from our village about sexual assault cases or cases of violence against
children’s because, for them, it is much easier to hide it rather than disclose it and
become “national shame.” Children in our village still are not capable of speaking about
bullying in schools because this is a shame and kind of tradition to obey teachers or
other elderly people. I read about the Law on Children’s rights and Washington
Convention when I was in 2-course student at law school. Since that time, I realised that
I had to speak about my experience and do something to change this “horrible
situation".
As a single boy in my family and as a Kazakh boy, who respects our tradition I was not
able to differentiate when I was emotionally and physically abused and when I was
hiding my abusive coach’s methods. I assumed that it had to be that way and even had
a doubt to complain about it or seek some help from the competent state bodies. I think
this was not only my fault, but my mother, siblings and school teachers also failed to
protect my rights. After a while, I started to believe that there was not any help, and it
just became easier to stay silent. I think these abuse coaches will always find their way
into our society. No state bodies, no policies can stop that because a lot of people won’t
have records, or they’ve never been caught. So, all I can hope is we will have the policies
and the education in a place that when something does go wrong, it’s a swift reaction
to it in social media. But that reaction needs to include consequences or actions that
prevent future harm.
Case study on violence in care institutions
In 1993, Ainur Rakhmanova* was born as a second child in her family.
In 2002, he was sent to an orphanage home after eye witnessing her family’s drama. She was
9 years old.
In 2002-2003, when she was 9-10 years old, during the first two at the orphanage home, she
was bullied, psychically and emotionally abused by other children. They hit, kicked, and
physically hurt her, up to a stage of serious injuries. The staff in the institution did not respond
to the violence among the children. Nor did they provide the injured child with medical
treatment.
In 2011, Ainur left the orphanage home at the age of 18 years and faced stigmatisation at her
university.
In 2016, She moved to Russian Federation when she was 23 years old.
I was sent to an orphanage home when I was nine years old because my father killed my
mother in front of me during their fight. When I came to an orphanage home, I was
emotionally hurt after all those procedures and court hearings. Of course, no one
welcomed me in the orphanage home. I tried to avoid all the people there, but other
elder girls always tried to speak with me and scared me at night. Since my second day at
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
167
system for prevention and response to violence against children
the orphanage, the other girls bullied me. We had “dedovshina,” which is when more
senior pupils dominate younger pupils. They made little pupils work for them, “go bring
this or that.” They said a lot of hurtful words about my parents. They were waking me
up in the middle of the night and ordered me to jump from the closet down. I had to
jump from the closet down more than a hundred times, and they were having fun of me.
I was crying and asking them to stop it, but they did not. I could not walk the next day
properly, and our nannies yelled at me because I was slow as a turtle. On cold winter
nights, they took my blanket, and I had to sleep without anything, even without my
sleepwear. These nightmares continued for more than one year – until we had a new
girl, and they started to repeat these inhuman things with her. Then we grew up and it
became easier. I have never beat the kids.
Availability and access to services
Ainur did not know how to report what she suffered. She was afraid of elder children at the
orphanage home. Then, she was emotionally bullied by her teachers for being a slow learner.
Vulnerable children were punished harshly by staff and victimised again in the name of
discipline. The child was normally very secretive about her self-harm behaviours and suicidal
thoughts. The systematic violence used by elderly children creates an unsafe and
unpredictable environment for children, which instilled a significant level of fear and anxiety
in children. She recalled that she often lived in fear of the elderly children.
Our school physiologist’s door was always closed. I was even scared to say anything to
our nanny. The other girls repeated several times that they would kill me like my father
killed my mother if I would say any word. How could we know about those services? Of
course, we did not know.
Appropriateness and equity of available services
The government has not yet taken steps to improve the physical and structural conditions of
many state-run residential institutions for children. Furthermore, their efforts to address the
care the children receive in institutions and to reduce the occurrence of violence against
children in institutions has not been improved. There is a lack of trained social workers,
psychologists, teachers and social services that support and help children at child’ s
institutions, who faces VAC.
I lived with my memories in my dreams, when my father did not start to drink alcohol
and when we were a happy family. One of the school teachers started to call me "Mulkau
kyz" (Dumb girl). I did not have any friends until 12 years old. I started to speak with
myself, and sometimes, my new habit scared my teachers and nannies. Probably they
thought that I am out of my mind. It was the most challenging three years of my life;
probably it was the beginning of my adult life.
Coordination of services
At her institution, children did not know about the institutions’ psychologist or social
pedagogue, who could involve in the VAC cases. She had a difficult time telling someone
about the violence she experienced. Moreover, she could not understand that she was being
abused, particularly as it was directed to her by other children. She revealed that many staff
did not react or respond to acts of violence against children.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
168
system for prevention and response to violence against children
The system did not work at all and did not protect children like me, who were scared
every night that someone could kill her because she deserved it. The staff also closed
their eyes to the fact that older children beat the younger children.
Participation and consultation of the child in key decisions and monitoring progress
Ainur attempted to avoid conflict still experienced physical violence and injuries from other
children at her orphanage home.
What should the orphanage have done? Ask questions to the child and if they do not
answer, try to figure out why they are not speaking. I did not speak at all. If a child is
silent, it means something is wrong, and they have to fix it as an adult. How are they
adults if they cannot even see or feel what is happening in a child's life?
Conclusion
Asked about her journey through the institutions about her suffering, but also the positive
experiences, Ainur relates the following:
Of course, [life in the institution] was not without conflicts. At first, it was very
challenging and there was a conflict with elder female pupils. I had to show that I was
worth something and show to other children and elder pupils that I could protect myself
from others. During the first year, there were cases of physical and emotional violence.
I had to fight. I was beaten at night several times. I had bruises. I had to tolerate this
because I was afraid of them. Mostly, I was afraid that he could do anything to me at
night. Then it became better when they had a new target.
From my experience in care institutions, I could say that the personnel who work with
children are practically not trained. Most children have experienced something terrible.
But the employees do not know how to work with them, they are not prepared for this
in any way! They do not have mechanisms and tools to support and rehabilitate children
in care institutions. They have to work with each child, based on his or her situation,
whether there was violence against him/her or not. Whether the break with his blood
family is for him was traumatic. All this work should be carried out by experts. The
number of experts in social work and psychologists in care institutions should be ten
times more than there is now. Children in care institutions beat each other not because
they hate – it is their defensive reaction. It manifests itself due to the lack of an
individual approach to each child. Most of us are psychically and emotionally abused at
care institutions. We were trying to find help through the social security system or the
education system, which are designed to protect us. But the system was also cruel to us.
We did try to make a complaint, but we never found find support. We harbour all this
anger and bring it down on our peers, friends, orphanage staff, teachers and this cycle
continue.
Case study on sexual violence – abused by her employer
Dana* was born in Uzbekistan in 2002.
In 2014, she moved to Kazakhstan with her grandmother after losing her parents. They came
to Kazakhstan as undocumented migrant workers.
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
169
system for prevention and response to violence against children
In 2016, when Dana was 14 years old, she was raped and became pregnant. The perpetrator
was the owner of the home, where she lived with her grandmother, and her employer. From
2016 until 2020 she was the victim of sexual violence, emotional threats, and psychical abuse
by her landlord.
In 2016, Dana gave birth at 14 to a girl when she was almost 15 years old. This year, she
reported to local police about sexual violence. However, the local police did not accept her
lawsuit blaming her and threatening to deport her from Kazakhstan.
In 2020, Dana moved from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan when she was 18 years old with 3 years
old children. Before moving to Uzbekistan, she contacted the hotline number of the NGO
“Talk-to-me”* and obtained legal support.
In 2020, a criminal case was opened against her perpetrator and is still ongoing.
My grandmother came to Kazakhstan from Uzbekistan with me, when I was 12 years old,
and we did not have a place to live. He offered to lease a home together, and I worked
with him and his brother. We sold some products at the local market. My grandmother
had to take that offer because she did not have a choice. When we were at home, he
started to touch me despite my reactions and raped me. I was afraid to talk about it
because he threatened me, broke my nose, and constantly beat me because he was
jealous of me. I am 18 years now and I gave birth when I was 14 years old. Giving birth to
my child was the most traumatic day of my life.
Availability and access to services
Dana’s custodian, her grandmother, who is 70 years old now, could not access any of the
child protection system’s services due to her irregular status as an undocumented migrant in
Kazakhstan, as well as due to her lack of education.
Dana’s grandmother did not want to speak to anyone. She knew what was happening
was not right. But she was driven by fear. She felt so helpless against the authorities.
[support worker, NGO Talk-to-me]
Dana did seek services because she was afraid that the information, she shares about sexual
assault will not be kept private and she would be deported to Uzbekistan. Although there
are laws, statutes, and regulations that establish legal rights regarding privacy and
confidential communication for sexual assault victims, these might not be adhered to. In any
case, Dana was not aware that this kind of protection existed.
We did not access any services because we were afraid, considering that we did to our
passports and were living illegally in Kazakhstan. When I gave birth to a child, local police
came and threatened me, screamed at me, and was afraid because they told me that
they would take my child and send me to an orphanage home. I will be deported to my
country, and my child will be living here in Kazakhstan with her father. I knew that I was
living in a foreign country without any documents. When I was 18 years old, I told my
colleagues. At that time, I was working in a car washing service. A criminal case was
opened, and I'm waiting for the next court hearing now because he is in jail. (Dana).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
170
system for prevention and response to violence against children
It is important for adults to feel confident in their ability to protect children from
violence. Children are not responsible for protecting themselves or avoiding sexual
abuse. Parents, guardians, educators, and other adults should create safe communities.
(NGO representative).
Appropriateness and equity of available services
After revealing her situation, the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Kazakhstan helped her to re-
establish documents and they issued a passport to her child. There was “Talk-to-me" NGO
that helped her. Police and other law enforcement authorities should only question child
victims about their experience of sexual abuse in the presence of the appropriate guardian,
but in the case of Dana local police did not provide or contact any professional services from
the judicial body. Law enforcement authorities should minimise the length and scope of
questioning to minimize further trauma or psychological distress to the child victim.
The “Talk-to-me" public fund helped me a lot. They gave a service of a psychologist and
medical services. They crowdfunded money for me. I am grateful for them for
everything. They helped me to restore our documents.
Coordination of services
Dana received support only from the “Talk-to-me” NGO. Also, they are still providing money
for her and providing legal consultations.
After writing a lawsuit against him, I was threatened several times by his siblings, and
even local police acted like I was a criminal, not a victim. They were repeating that I lived
in Kazakhstan without any documents, and I could provoke his actions.
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Ministries of the Interior and other relevant state authorities
shall establish agreements and procedures for collaboration with each other to ensure that
a thorough inquiry into the individual and family circumstances of the child victim of sexual
violence.
Participation and consultation of the child in key decisions and monitoring progress
Dana was not involved in any key decisions with any part of the public administration. She
was not participating in court proceedings.
Child protection, if they exist, they did not help my child or me. My little girl also
experienced violence, and our psychologist had a session with her too. She eye-
witnessed how he was beating me. I am afraid that she will remember everything.
Critical gaps and positive outcomes
Giving birth as a survivor of sexual abuse while living in threat put Dana under tremendous
stress. Dana only went to primary school in Uzbekistan and did not graduate from school.
Since she was twelve years old, she was working as an undocumented migrant worker and
was afraid to deal with any state institution. The local government and the Ministry of the
Interior or other relevant state authorities and the social service authority did not start the
process of obtaining documentation and information from the child’s country of origin from
Uzbekistan to conduct a risk and security assessment. In the management of the case, both
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
171
system for prevention and response to violence against children
from the judiciary and social services, it is necessary to assist the relevant judicial and
administrative bodies to acquire information and documentation. The Ministries of the
Interior failed to assist those authorities in contact with the corresponding authorities in the
child’s country of origin. Psychological abuse was used to control and isolate her and
intimating and causing fear in her child.
Local police screamed at me and say that they could take away my child and deport me
from Kazakhstan.
Everyone who lived with us knew about it, but they did not do anything. I did not believe
that these problems could be solved. I really did not know whom I could tell these facts
to, where could I go for help. I was always under total control.
After the criminal case opened, his siblings threatened me and asked me to take the
statement back from the police.
Conclusion
Looking back at her experience, Ainur reflects on the following:
Our family has never had a close relationship with each other: My mother died when I
was young, and I had only my grandmother. Due to the age difference, it was impossible
to have a close relation. I have never been close friends with my grandmother. She didn't
seem to be very interested in me, even when we moved to Kazakhstan as an illegal
migrant.
Life with my grandmother and our new owner of the house did not work out right away.
At any opportunity, he tried to pinch me, then hug, then slaps on the buttocks and so
on. He finally raped me, when I was 13 years old. But where could I go if I was still very
young?! It was like being in slavery.
I gave birth to my baby very early. Only one NGO and the Embassy of Uzbekistan in
Kazakhstan would help me – when it was too late: after 5 years of such unbearable
disaster!
Now everything revolves around my daughter. I want to be a caring mother. I want to
protect her and support her in her life. I wish I had an education. Perhaps it will not open
new horizons for me, but still … I love my job in Uzbekistan now. I love that I'm busy.
Time flies by for me. And I would like to continue to grow professionally. Probably, I will
decide to do some further education.

system for prevention and response to violence against children
Annex 2: Case studies on local service provision
This annex presents case studies on provision of services at local level, both at in prevention
and response. It aims to illustrate local service provision and inquire whether these services
function as a part of a local child protection system. The research team interviewed medical
professionals, school psychologists and school administration, and staff of centre for
children in difficult life situations and centre of adaptation that informed the following case
studies:
• prevention of neglect and physical abuse through home visitations by patronage
nurses;
• prevention of bullying and peer violence through training of children in schools on
life and social skills;
• psycho-social support to child victims of violence in centre for children in difficult life
situations and centre for adaptation.
All information and data for these case studies has been gathered through qualitative
methods – document review of regulations and protocols and key informant interviews with
service providers in two regions of East Kazakhstan and Turkestan. The interviews had been
guided by the case study methodology, which in detail is replicated in Annex XXX. There were
3 informants, including 2 paediatricians and 1 patronage nurse for the case study on home
visitation who worked at the level of the policlinic. Two social pedagogues informed the case
study on training children in schools on live and social skills. For the case study on psycho-
social support to children in rehabilitation centres, there were 7 interviews conducted with
social pedagogues and psychologists working at the centre for adaptation of children and
centre for children and families in difficult life situations.
The aim is to demonstrate how existing child protection services support their respective
communities, how they collaborate, apply existing policies and protocols to ensure the
safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families. In particular, the case studies on
services respond to the refined research questions on implementation, coordination,
complementarity, appropriateness, and quality (see evaluation matrix).
Case study on home visitations by patronage nurses
Description of the service
The universal-progressive home visiting system of patronage nurses is described in the
evaluation report, Chapter 3 on social services. Order No 1027 (2017) outlines patronage as
preventive care and informational services at home for newborns and young children (MoH
Kaz, 2017e). During the patronage visit of a newborn the medical professional assesses signs
of illnesses, assesses the mood of the mother for signs of postpartum depression, informs
the mother (parent) on proper care for the newborn, promotes timely vaccinations, assesses
social risks that can threaten a child’s life, and identifies children who need special care like
children with congenital diseases and children of HIV-positive mothers. In case of identified
illnesses, the nurse informs the doctors. In case of threatening social risks, the nurse informs
the social worker of the polyclinic (Chapter 3, Art 46, Order No.1027, 2017).
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
173
system for prevention and response to violence against children
All children below the age of three receive the service according to the universal package of
services. Children below the age of five in the risk group receive a progressive package of
services where the frequency of patronage visits is determined by the individual plan
(Appendix 3, Order No.1027, 2017).
Legal and policy basis for the service
The service of patronage nurses works on the basis of the Order No. 1027 on the approval of
Standard for the organization of the provision of paediatric care in the Republic of
Kazakhstan, dated December 29, 2017 (MoH Kaz, 2017b). It has been piloted and evaluated a
in several occasions (Babayeva et al., 2018; Gesaworld, 2019; UNICEF Kazakhstan, Núñez-
Sabarís, Satorras, Nurmagambetova, Shevshenko, & Núñez-Sabarís, 2019).
Implementing actors, structures, and protocols
Patronage nurses deliver the progressive patronage home visitation service to pregnant
women and their children below the age of five. Social workers from a medical organization
(polyclinic) visit the family for an in-depth assessment after a patronage nurse identifies a
risk. Social workers evaluate the family, the child, and the family documents and assign a
rating to the family, where “red” implies provision of intensive package of services (CS-S-001,
p. 3).
Order 1027 on the standards of paediatric care outlines the steps of patronage visits service
provision for nurses. However, in the interviews, the medical professionals from East
Kazakhstan and Turkestan oblasts admitted that the protocols for cases of violence either
did not exist or were not followed:
“There is no specific protocol of the algorithm for providing assistance to victims of
violence”. (FG-L-T-024, p. 3)
“We don’t use these SOP, to be honest”. (CS-S-001, p. 4)
Coordination
The informants were not able to describe a protocol for coordination with other sectors.
In East Kazakhstan, the informant mentioned an interdepartmental commission comprised
of different structures to meet social, medical, legal, educational, and psychological needs of
the child. This interdepartmental commission was created together with the deputy akim of
Semey (CS-S-001). The reports on the service provision, including any reports on cases of
violence are sent to the Ministry of Health. (CS-S-001). However, the medical worker from the
East Kazakhstan region, mentions that medical workers are disincentivized from reporting
cases of violence:
“If there is no statement, …, there is no problem”. [Nurses] are afraid of losing their
jobs.” (CS-S-001)
In Turkestan, the clinics work directly with the social protection agencies, law enforcement
agencies, and the department of health. The work of these agencies is controlled both by
local akimats and line-ministries. (FG-L-T-24, p.)
Kazakhstan: Formative evaluation of the
174
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Appropriateness
In Turkestan, informants did not address this aspect during the interview.
In East Kazakhstan, the services provided to the child are adapted according to the identified
needs of the child. The Social worker from the medical organization and the case manager
work together in accordance to the individual plan where legal, educational, medical, and
housing needs of the child are addressed. However, the respondents were not able to
describe how the needs of the child are being identified.
Quality
Based on conducted interviews and a focus group, the quality of service is not ensured.
According to one of the informants, all cases of violence when women and children are
involved are being addressed (CS-S-001, p. 5). Case management is briefly mentioned as a
“very effective” tool to address risks first identified by the patronage nurse (CS-S-001, p. 3).
Medical workers interviewed for the cases study mention the lack of trainings. Due to the
pandemic, it became impossible to conduct two-week trainings that are needed, instead they
were replaced with two-hour online sessions, which result only in a certificate, while practical
sessions that allowed to apply newly acquired knowledge were missing (CS-S-001, p.2). A
patronage nurse in Turkestan also underlines the need for trainings:
“we need training sessions, we don’t even know how to properly help women and
children victims of violence” (FG-L-T-024, p. 4).
Conclusion
• An interdepartmental commission exists, but it is unclear how it works and whether
it is effective in responding to VAC. Effectively, nurses and medical workers are
disincentivized from reporting VAC because of fear of losing their jobs. This
represents a serious bottleneck for coordination with other services, including social
services and law enforcement.
• There is little evidence on collaborations on VAC in either Turkestan or East
Kazakhstan oblast. It is mentioned that local departments of health and internal
affairs as well as the social protection agencies are involved in responding to VAC.
The extent to which this collaboration is effective and complimentary is unclear.
• Reportedly after the needs-assessment, an individual plan is drawn up that addresses
different needs of a child (medical, housing, legal, educational). There is insufficient
evidence for the success of this approach, or its improvement compared to 10 years
ago.
• The quality of patronage nurse visits depends mainly on the professionalism of the
nurses. According to the informants, nurses and other medical workers feel the need
for additional training with an emphasis on practical skills development.
• There is some evidence of case management being implemented in the East
Kazakhstan oblast.

175
system for prevention and response to violence against children
Case study on psycho-social support
Description of the service
The centres for children in difficult life situations and centres for adaptation are described in
the evaluation report Chapter 3 on services. In East Kazakhstan, the centre providing social
and psychological support to children and families in difficult life situations functions under
the Akimat and the Department of education since 2019. They work in two directions: the
first is prevention, the second is direct assistance. In the line of prevention, together with the
schools, the municipal social and psychological service runs programmes for parents and
children at school. After identifying topics of interest at the school, the service offers
programmes on prevention of crime and delinquency, prevention of suicide, sexual integrity,
and prevention of violence. As direct assistance in cases of violence, the social and
psychological service accompanies children throughout the case (C-S-S-002, p. 3).
In Turkestan, social and psychological service to children is provided by the Centre for
Adaptation and the Centre for children with Deviant Behaviour. The latter provides housing,
education, and psychological help to children sent to the Centre by the court order (CS-S-
006).
The Centre for adaptation provides temporary stay for homeless children, children left
without parental care, children victims of violence and children in difficult life circumstances,
and children awaiting a court decision (MoES Kaz, 2013, Chapter 6). The Centre for adaptation
works with children ages 3 to 18 and provides legal, material, and psychological assistance
(CS-S-T-009).
Legal and policy basis for the service
In East Kazakhstan, the centre for children in difficult life situation is regulated by the own
charter and the decree on the opening of centres (CS-S-002, CS-S-003).
In Turkestan, the Centre for children with deviant behaviour operates under the law “On the
rights of the child” (GoK, 2002), law “On education” (GoK, 2007b), and court decisions and
the Commission on Minors’ Affairs (CS-S-T-006). The Centre for adaptation works according
to the MOES Order No. 229 (Appendix 6) of 2013 (MoES Kaz, 2013) which states that children
can be referred to the centre by the court order, order of other state bodies or non-
governmental organizations (CS-S-T-009, p. 2).
Implementing actors, structures, and protocols
The role of social pedagogue at the centre for children in difficult life situations in East
Kazakhstan is to visit the families with the head teacher and inspector, make a primary
assessment of housing conditions, provide a report on the social portrait of the family, and
develop recommendations. The role of a psychologist at the service is to provide
consultations for children, communicate with the family, receive initial complaints from the
children in person and through the helpline (CS-S-003, p. 3).
At the Centre for children with deviant behaviour, the roles of social pedagogue and
psychologist are very similar in terms of the description. For instance, both the social
pedagogue and the psychologist should communicate with children, and with the parents,
help with welcoming the newcomers, and explain the rules of the centre (CS-S-004, p. 2).

Apart from providing psychological help to children at the Centre for adaptation, it is also
psychologist’s job to locate child’s parents, determine the status of the child, restore their
documents (CS-T-010, p. 2).
None of informants mentioned protocols or guidelines that inform the service provision.
Coordination
The centre for children in difficult life situation in East Kazakhstan is connected with multiple
structures and agencies, and – according to the informants – the direction of coordination
depends on the needs of the child or family in every case. One of the informants (CS-S-002,
p. 5) describes coordination with department of education, the Commission on the minor’s
affairs, department of internal, healthcare organisations, children’s villages, and crisis
centres.
There is a joint memorandum, but no specific protocol for re-direction, with the children’s
villages to work on the cases. If a child requiring help is accepted by one of those structures,
then the centre develops an individual working plan for the child. (CS-S-002, p. 3). Children
could also be referred to the centre by the Commission on minor’s affairs, Department of
Internal Affairs, health care and social protection institutions. Whenever there is need for
psychological help, the child could be redirected to that service (CS-S-002, p.4).
The informant mentioned high turnover of employees working in the different state agencies
that collaborate with centre. This factor limits opportunities for coordination, which weakens
the connections and mutual trust (CS-S-003, p. 4).
“… now people also change often, every 2-3 years, they do not stay any longer... mutual
work starts to be built, another person comes in. He will have to learn about us all over
again, we will learn about him, a new system of relationship has to be built with this
person, it is not quite convenient” (CS-S-003, p. 4)
The centre has no right to visit families directly, and this was mentioned by the centre
representative as a limiting factor for coordination, while the agencies that have this
authority are not readily available to intervene to provide assistance to the family.
“…we face a lot of restrictions; we do not have the authority to go to the family. We
had a situation where we received a call, we went to the family, then the parents wrote
a statement against us that we allegedly invaded their space… we have the authority
to carry out some work, but we do not have the competence to work independently. …
We can’t do anything, and the child remains in a dangerous situation.” (CS-S-002, p. 4)
In Turkestan, the Centre for children with deviant behaviour collaborates with the
psychologists from local youth resource centres. The collaboration is complicated by the fact
that the centre is a closed-type institution that require granting a special access for visitors.
The centre also has connections with the polyclinic, the library, and approved inspectors (CS-
S-004, p. 3). They work under the local department of education and report to them (CS-S-
006, p. 3).
The Centre for Adaption in Turkestan coordinates with the guardianship authorities and the
Department of Education (CS-T-009, p. 3). There is an established collaboration with
psychologists and educators from youth resource centres, NGOs like Sana Sezim and the
rehabilitation centre for the drug addicts (CS-T-010, p. 3).

“There are difficulties in communication between the authorities. For example, a child
comes to us without documents. Then, we apply to different authorities to help the
child faster, but the process is delayed and the child is staying with us longer, which
further complicates the process.” (CS-T-009, p. 3)
Appropriateness
In the centre for children in difficult life situations in East Kazakhstan, the services are
adjusted in accordance to the results of the needs assessment during first contact with the
child (CS-S-002, p. 3).
In the Centre for adaptation of minors and the Centre for children with deviant behaviour in
Turkestan, housing is provided depending of the gender of the child, while assignment to a
various educational classes depends on the age (CS-S-006, p. 4).
Quality
Centre for children in difficult life situations in East Kazakhstan has a methodology
department that conducts seminars and workshops based on the needs of employees.
However, they note the shortage of trained professionals, especially the ones qualified to
work on suicide cases. The service used to have a program of supervision for young
professionals by a more experienced colleagues, but this option is no longer in place.
“For young professionals, nothing is held or organized, there is such a shortage of
everything, they go only with a university education”. (CS-S-003, p.4)
Before the pandemic, social pedagogues and psychologists from the Centre for children with
deviant behaviour used to visit city trainings in Kentau once a year (CS-S-004, p. 3) and
participate in trainings from the department of education twice a year (CS-S-005, p. 3).
“As for quality, each specialist is directly responsible for his/her own sphere.” (CS-S-006,
p. 4)
The department of education and the prosecutor’s office hold yearly inspections of the
Centre of Adaptation to ensure quality of services (CS-T-009, p. 3).
Conclusion
• Coordination between the centres that participated in the set of interviews for this
evaluation and their state counterparts working in education, health, etc is not very
effective because the process of replacing employees in the collaborating agencies
is not streamlined and the mechanisms for coordination between the organisations
are not clearly defined.
• All three structures (centre for adaptation, centre for children in difficult life situation
and centre for children with deviant behaviour) receive children in cases of VAC
because they require psychological help. Children could be re-directed from other
organisations in the region, but also from other organisations in the country, e.g., a
child from Nur-Sultan was sent to the Centre for children with deviant behaviour in
Turkestan. This takes children away from the familiar environment and support
system that might exist in their own regions.

• In East Kazakhstan, the support services provided by the centre for children in
difficult life situation are said to be adapted based on the results of the initial needs
assessment. In Turkestan at the centre of adaptation and centre for children with
deviant behaviour, accommodation and education provision take into consideration
gender of the child in case of accommodation, and age of the child when education
is concerned.
• Quality of service provision is ensured through annual and biannual trainings from
the Department of Education in Turkestan and regular trainings from within the
centre for children in difficult life situation in East Kazakhstan. Despite this effort,
quality of services provided still largely depends on the professionalism of employees
themselves. In the interviews, they note lack of trainings, shortage of qualified
professionals, and the need for supervision or mentorship program for young
employees.
Case study on preventing bullying in schools
Description of the service
Prevention of bullying and peer violence in schools is carried out by the school psychologist
and the head teacher for educational work. The role of school psychologists and social
pedagogues are described in the evaluation report Chapter 3 on services.
In Turkestan, school psychologists provide trainings for children from seventh to eleventh
grade (ages 13-17) on bullying. Moreover, there are meetings with parents where teachers
and a school psychologist raise awareness about bullying and importance of addressing it
(CS-S-EK-007). In East Kazakhstan, the trainings are held for children beginning with grade
five up to grade eleven (ages 11-17), these trainings include the concept of cyberbullying as
well (CS-S-T-008).
The cases of violence and bullying are registered and processed by the school psychologist
and the administration. If cases of violence and bullying are identified, the school provides
psychological assistance to the child suffering from bullying. The school also meets with the
parents of both children, the one being bullied and the one bullying. The school psychologist
monitors and checks on the child who was bullied for a period of time.
Legal and policy basis for the service
According to the interview, in Turkestan the school psychological service works under the
school’s own internal acts (CS-S-T-008, p.2). The informants in East Kazakhstan did not
discuss any legal documents or protocols that inform the work of psychologists or social
pedagogues.
Implementing actors, structures, and protocols
The role of social pedagogue and psychologist is similar in nature. In the line of prevention of
bullying, they raise awareness through trainings and seminars for children and parents, they
conduct surveys to identify children in risk groups and try to engage children at risk in
afterschool activities and establish contact with them. As for response to violence, social
pedagogue and psychologist meet with the child who is bullied and his/her parents, follow
up and monitor him/her for a period of time.

179
system for prevention and response to violence against children
No protocols were described during the interviews.
Coordination
The school reports directly to the local Department of Education. The schools work together
with the inspectors from the Department of Internal Affairs. The inspectors are called in to
participate in the meetings on the cases of bullying and to document the case if violence
happened at school. (CS-S-EK-007).
In Turkestan, schools together with the Department of Internal Affairs and Department of
Education develop a plan to prevent bullying. The school’s psychological service is also
assisted by the Reframe psychological assistance center under the Besterek program. (CS-S-
T-008, p. 3)
Appropriateness
The classes on bullying are carried out only for children at the level of secondary school,
grades five to eleven (ages 11-17) in East Kazakhstan oblast, and grades seven to eleven (ages
13-17) in Turkestan.
There are no services for primary school children. There is no data on services being adjusted
to other needs and differences except for age.
Quality
In Turkestan, the Besterek programme is said to be helping as there are no cases of suicide
or violence in the school since the programme has been implemented (CS-S-T-008). However,
counterparts identified the need for more professionals on cyberbullying and specific offer
for training and education for school staff:
“I think we also need seminars and trainings for teachers and psychologists” (CS-S-EK-
007, p. 3)
Conclusion
• Representatives of schools who informed this case study in Turkestan and East
Kazakhstan oblast mostly coordinate with the Department of Education and
Department of Internal Affairs, when cases of prevention and response to bullying
are involved. The effectiveness of such coordination and the outcomes for children
is not very clear.
• In Turkestan schools, Department of Education and Department of Internal Affairs
work according to a joint plan on bullying prevention. However, there is insufficient
evidence to draw conclusions on the success of such collaborations.
• Psychological services that prevent and respond to bullying are differentiated
according to age, i.e. grade level. There is no programme directed at primary school
children. Existing psychological services do not take into consideration any other
child characteristics.
• According to the informant who participated in this cases study, there is a need for
more training of psychologists working at schools, along with clearly defined
prevention and response mechanisms.
