Executive Summary
About the evaluated programme
UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme consists of three pillars, equivalent to those of RACE II. It aims at
supporting education services that respond to the needs of the most vulnerable children and adolescents in
Lebanon. It consists of three pillars: (I) Improve access to public education; (II) Improve quality of public
education; (III) Improve the governance of public education. The pillars are articulated around specific
outcomes, indicators and targets. These were to be achieved through a plethora of activities, such as subsidies
for formal and non-formal education, transportation assistance, education supplies, textbooks, hygiene
supplies, community outreach and engagement, and cash for well-being as well as school rehabilitation and
construction (in the context of the Beirut blast).
Evaluation methodology
The evaluation followed a theory-driven design and a mixed-methods data collection and analysis approach.
quantitative component, the evaluation relied on the identified statistical data already available.
For the qualitative component, desk research and primary qualitative data collection was conducted at the
national and regional levels. The latter included individual interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions
(FGDs) at the national level, as well as deep dives during local field visits in schools. These deep dives involved
both IDIs and FGDs, as well as Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) sessions and observations.
At the national level 29 IDIs were conducted with 34 people representing UNICEF and other UN agencies,
donors and the Lebanese government. Two focus groups were also carried out with representatives of NGOs,
with 10 people overall. During local fieldwork, 8 schools were visited. These were selected based on criteria
such as geographic distribution, refugee population in the area, participation in the Inclusive Schools Pilot or
school rehabilitation/reconstruction activities, type of school (boys, girls, mixed). Overall, country experts
conducted: 8 IDIs with school principals; 8 REM sessions with 44 teachers, including 41 women and 3 men; 8
FGDs with 50 parents, including 39 women and 11 men, 33 Lebanese and 17 non-Lebanese; Observations
on school premises with a filled-out observation sheet; 6 IDIs with local authorities.
Findings
Relevance
UNICEF's education program in Lebanon (LCO-EP) is strongly aligned with global priorities. It adheres
to international human rights standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child (UNCRC) and the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
The program's focus on gender parity corresponds with SDG 4's objective to provide inclusive and quality
education for all. The program is also consistent with UNICEF’s broader mandate, emphasizing core
commitments to children and the Strategic Plan for 2022-2025, which promotes quality learning opportunities
inclusive of modern skills like digital competency. Furthermore, the LCO-EP is in harmony with the Lebanon
Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), emphasizing equitable access to basic services. On a grassroots level,
Lebanese parents, regardless of origin, underscore the significance of education as a protective factor for their
children, especially amidst the country's ongoing challenges.
The programme is crucially relevant to Lebanon's context, particularly in addressing the multifaceted
challenges the country faces in its education sector. UNICEF has recognized access to education as
/ 9
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
vital, given the increased migration of Syrian families and the compounded vulnerabilities that subsequent
crises brought to both Syrian refugees and Lebanese communities. Although the subsidization of enrolment
for Syrian children is relevant, there have been discussions about its effectiveness in retaining students,
suggesting a focus on attendance might be more effective. UNICEF recognized the need to intensify non-
formal education (NFE) initiatives, especially to aid Syrian children who might be entering the education system
for the first time. However, transitioning from NFE to formal education (FE) has proven to be a challenge, partly
due to external factors such as political priorities. Though some stakeholders are uncertain about UNICEF's
exact role in improving education quality, its primary focus appears to be on ensuring equality, inclusion, and
child protection, as opposed to solely academic outcomes, which is in line with UNICEF’s mandate and local
needs.
LCO-EP aligns closely with the country's official education priorities, as articulated in the 5-Year
General Education Plan 2021-2025 and previously in RACE I and II. However, there seems to be an
ambiguity in differentiating LCO-EP from RACE I and II among respondents, indicating a potential
communication gap within the organization. While policy alignment exists in theory, practical alignment
diverges, especially concerning the integration of refugees. Political reluctance is rooted in concerns about
demographics and power dynamics in the country. The strong anti-refugee sentiment in society and the
government's reluctance to adopt relevant reforms present challenges for UNICEF. Interviewees believed that
UNICEF should exert more pressure on the MEHE, leveraging its long-standing relationship and in-depth
knowledge of Lebanon's education system to advocate for systemic reforms, ensuring sustainability and self-
sufficiency in education.
In addressing inherent equity gaps in Lebanon, UNICEF has actively sought to support the most
vulnerable groups, including Syrian refugees and children with special educational needs and
disabilities. Notably, UNICEF launched the Inclusive Education Pilot Project in 2018, targeting learners with
disabilities, particularly those with learning difficulties. UNICEF's financial support in Lebanon's education
sector, including covering operational costs, subsidizing enrolment, and providing cash assistance to
vulnerable children, has been largely praised for increasing enrolment rates, especially during crises like the
Beirut Blast and the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, UNICEF's efforts to improve education quality, such
as organizing teacher training sessions, have faced scrutiny due to challenges in measuring their impact.
Concerns were also raised about the proportion of results achieved relative to the funding provided.
In response to the changing Lebanese context, marked by political instability, the Beirut Blast, COVID-
19, and economic downturns, UNICEF has exhibited significant flexibility in tailoring its activities. Key
initiatives included covering the majority of operational school costs to ensure educational continuity during
the economic crisis and devising a Learning Continuity Plan as a safeguard against potential teacher strikes.
After the Beirut Blast, UNICEF immediately supported the rehabilitation of schools, replaced damaged
infrastructure, and facilitated both financial and psychological assistance to affected children and families. In
relation to mental health, there were noted inconsistencies in the presence and effectiveness of PSS
(Psychosocial Support) counsellors across schools, revealing a pressing need for comprehensive
psychological support for students in both shifts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF provided non-
formal education tools, hygiene materials, and collaborated with MEHE to devise a remote learning strategy,
ensuring continued access to education. Some stakeholders, however, expressed concerns that UNICEF's
emergency-centric approach detracted from their focus on core educational interventions, suggesting a need
for a more sustainable long-term approach to emergencies.
Effectiveness
LCO-EP operated in a highly volatile political and social climate, impacting the achievement of initial
goals and necessitating modifications. Constant adaptation to current circumstances was required, with a

focus on addressing emerging issues instead of sticking to the original objectives. Significant challenges were
encountered in collecting data to monitor progress toward established targets. Reliance on government data
with questionable credibility posed a challenge. Inadequate monitoring tools in certain intervention areas
impacted alternative data collection. Indicators chosen for tracking progress were not always optimal.
UNICEF support was critical for guaranteeing access to education for many vulnerable children in
Lebanon. UNICEF's involvement led to a significant decrease in out-of-school non-Lebanese children,
especially Syrian refugees, dropping from 49% in 2015 to 31% in 2019. However, the COVID-19
pandemic and Beirut's subsequent financial crises reversed this trend and saw an increase in out-of-
school Syrian children, reaching 47% in 2021. While UNICEF exceeded its support targets for Lebanese
children, subsidizing the education of 272,515 in 2021 compared to the projected 149,831, it finally fell short
of its goal for non-Lebanese children, assisting 191,398 against a target of 251,474. Transportation subsidies
were slightly underachieved due to potential prolonged school closures and declining demand amid crises.
Distributing free textbooks was a significant achievement, benefiting over 506,000 students in 2021. However,
in 2022, this type of support was notably reduced, which was a major concern voiced by school communities
during their fieldwork. On infrastructure, UNICEF has initiated rehabilitation works for several schools and
plans to construct new ones, although some challenges have caused delays. Field reports praise UNICEF's
renovation efforts but also highlight concerns about the quality of some works undertaken and certain
maintenance problems.
The effectiveness of UNICEF activities in improving the quality of education remains ambiguous due
to a lack of reliable data. Progress has been observed in certain intervention areas; however, there is
still no visible improvement in students' learning outcomes. UNICEF's involvement in improving
education quality primarily focused on teacher training, including through the Teacher Training Curriculum
Model (TTCM), with positive feedback from participants and positive changes in teachers' attitudes observed
during fieldwork. Behavioral changes seem to be stronger in the case of teachers' attitudes towards Lebanese
students than towards Syrian students. UNICEF, in collaboration with the MEHE, implemented the Child
Protection policy and internal and external referral pathways were developed. However, there is a lack of data
regarding the number of reported cases and their effective management on the ground. Findings from the
fieldwork indicate that school staff is unaware of the existence of referral systems, and reported cases are
being addressed at the school level.
UNICEF's actions in system strengthening have yet to bear fruit. Limited successes over the evaluated
period were also related to the high turnover of MEHE staff. Amid a financial crisis that saw a surge of
students from private to public sectors, UNICEF shifted its primary attention to ensuring access to education,
sidelining other initiatives such as capacity-building. This pivot was further influenced by frequent staff changes
and challenges within MEHE. While the partnership between UNICEF and MEHE produced essential policy
frameworks for a better educational environment, its practical implementation rests mainly with MEHE. The
introduction of TREF has been a positive step, focusing on crucial education priorities, and recognizing key
capacity-building needs of MEHE, especially in transitioning to institutionalized structures such as an IT
department.
UNICEF's support of the education programme in Lebanon had some unintended consequences,
including the reinforcement of a two-shift school system and improvement in quality, but also limited
access to some NFE activities. While the two-shift system accommodated the influx of refugee students, it
inadvertently reinforced segregation, as most Syrian students were channelled into these second shifts. These
schools operate for fewer hours and have teachers on temporary contracts, with a slightly modified curriculum
that excludes extracurricular activities. Consequently, students receive what some considered a "second-rate"
education. This separation further entrenched prejudiced notions, making integration for Syrian students more
challenging. Stakeholders had mixed feelings: some viewed this as a necessary compromise, while others
/ 11
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
saw it in a more negative light. The work on NFE together with MEHE also brough about some unintended
effects. While it led to standardized NFE programs and potential quality improvements, it also imposed stricter
entry criteria, effectively sidelining various NGOs and barring numerous children from these educational
opportunities. The rigid structure of the NFE system and additional requirements, such as the Accelerated
Learning Program (ALP) certificate, further impeded many children from accessing formal education.
LCO-EP have seen notable success in the realm of inclusive education for children with disabilities
(CWD). Two significant milestones in this area include the creation of the Inclusive Education Policy draft and
the National Action Plan on Inclusion, both of which have focused on ensuring equal education opportunities
for CWD. The launching of the Inclusive Schools Pilot in 2018 has been particularly influential, nevertheless
mainstream schools still remain largely unadopted for children with special educational needs. Though gender
disparities are not pronounced in Lebanese education, some challenges still persist. Disparities emerge in the
later stages of education, with a slightly higher enrolment of girls in upper grades and a tendency for boys,
especially from impoverished backgrounds, to drop out earlier.
Efficiency
From 2018 to 2022 the LCO-EP funding amounted to $787.3 Mn. Most of the funds were allocated to
pillar I – $728.9 Mn (92.6%), with pillar II receiving $39.8 Mn (5.1%) and pillar III – $18.6 Mn (2.4%). Having
gained attention from donors, LCO-EP grew until 2019-2020. Since then teachers’ strikes, closed schools,
crashing economy have contributed to donor fatigue. Most notable changes in allocations are visible when
comparing 2021 and 2022. Pillar III funding decreased from 2018 to 2021, then increased by 576% ($7.9 Mn).
Pillar II funding increased by 138% ($6.4 Mn), while pillar I – 14%.
Support to education of Syrian refugees was managed by the PMU, while support to education of
Lebanese children by the MEHE Directorate General (DG). This set up was not working optimally for all
stakeholders because of issues linked to duplication of structures and centralization of functions. In addition,
high turnover in positions in both MEHE and UNICEF hindered efficient delivery of LCO-EP. Issues with the
transparency and accountability mechanisms in place during the period of the RACE II modality have been
identified. Solutions adopted in TREF are viewed as better suited for timely monitoring of results and financial
transfers, as well as overall accountability. Interviewees expect that once all mechanisms are implemented, it
will be easier for UNICEF to monitor progress and communicate results to donors.
There has been challenges with data collection and analysis regarding the programme performance.
MEHE has been unable to develop a national data management and analysis framework that would have
predictably reported on the health of the public education system (teachers, students). UNICEF has served an
interim/supporting role, but data issues have negatively impacted the programme’s monitoring and relevant
payments. Integration of databases and development of a uniform, clear and error-free information system
should have been a key prerequisite for efficient implementation of LCO-EP. VASyR and the online Inter-
agency education sector dashboard evidence that social- and gender-disaggregated data are collected.
TREF presents a shift in resource management and model of fund distribution aimed at increasing
efficiency. Its implementation goes along the restructuring of UNICEF education section and stabilization of
human resources. The finances are managed directly by UNICEF and are delivered to recipients, which is
viewed as more flexible and adequate in the economic crisis. Stakeholders have a better understanding of
where the funding goes, but this also creates an additional administrative burden on UNICEF. At the same
time, scarce resources of MEHE limit possible capacity building and transferring tasks (payment distribution,
data management).

Coherence
The LCO-EP demonstrates an ability to align with varying priorities among donors and stakeholders,
encompassing different educational pillars, sectors, and target groups. Its broad scope acts as a
beneficial factor, allowing LCO-EP to serve as a hub for coordinating educational investments and activities.
However, coherence is somewhat diminished when it comes to NFE. Multiple interventions are conducted
nationwide by different entities, leading to fragmented resources and increased coordination needs.
Additionally, there is ambiguity for donors regarding how TREF’s window II aligns with their priorities, as its
conceptual framework remains undefined.
UNICEF's initiatives under the LCO-EP synchronize effectively with external partners in the
educational domain. A noteworthy synergy exists between UNICEF and UNHCR, with the latter focusing on
community-level actions and the former having a more centralized approach. UNHCR enhances the
implementation and impact of UNICEF's work in the access domain. Collaborations with the QITABI program
and UNESCO further highlight the focus on education quality and system strengthening, although a call for
better coordination is evident to maximize synergy. In future initiatives, UNICEF's association with the World
Bank could be pivotal, especially in advocacy and strategic reforms. While UNICEF is recognized for its
leadership in access to education, it could redefine its quality focus towards themes like equality, diversity, and
inclusion, considering the presence of other influential players, such as QITABI and UNESCO, in the
educational outcomes domain.
Impact
The LCO-EP's impact on educational quality is debated. The education system has grown more
inclusive and equitable, with many non-Lebanese children receiving formal education for the first time.
However, the tumultuous political and economic climate in Lebanon posed challenges to effecting
structural changes in the education system. The partnership between MEHE and UNICEF has emphasized
inclusivity, especially for CWD. However, the program faced challenges in system strengthening, largely
managing the LCO-EP independently due to high staff turnovers at MEHE. This resulted in a parallel
management structure that may not be sustainable long-term. Some data suggest a decline in educational
outcomes between 2016 and 2019, while others highlight the promise of the TTCM introduced by UNICEF and
CERD.
UNICEF’s most pronounced strength is its capacity to offer educational access to vulnerable
populations, particularly Syrian refugees. UNICEF's multidimensional approach, which involved partnering
with the government to craft suitable educational pathways for non-Lebanese children and directly addressing
barriers refugees face, e.g. high enrolment fees and transportation challenges, was effective. If not for the
persistent crises, it is probable that Syrian children's enrolment in Lebanese schools would have continuously
risen. Stakeholders also commend UNICEF's initiatives regarding child protection policy and programme
development, recommending their expansion nationwide. Several innovative initiatives were also introduced
by LCO-EP in 2022, such as remote learning hotlines and summer schools. Preliminary results from these
efforts are promising, but continued observation is crucial to gauge their scalability.
Sustainability
The sustainability of UNICEF's education programming in Lebanon faces significant challenges, both
external and internal. Externally, the country's unstable political and socio-economic environment,
characterized by frequent changes in ministerial positions, political instability, mismanagement, corruption, and
multiple crises, has impeded systematic efforts to ensure sustainability. Internally, the Lebanese education
system itself suffers from structural issues, such as resource-intensiveness due to a high teacher-student ratio,
the presence of "ghost" teachers, and a brain drain. Furthermore, the crises have strained resources, leading
/ 13
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
to schools struggling to function and accommodate refugee children, which UNICEF has tried to alleviate. The
humanitarian nature of the crises has blurred the distinction between emergency response and developmental
interventions. Although UNICEF has been instrumental in shaping the education sector's strategy and
coordination with donors, its potential influence on systemic reform was limited, especially during the RACE II
implementation. However, despite these challenges, some systemic changes have been initiated. To enhance
sustainability, future program directions should prioritize focusing on core educational needs, forming strategic
partnerships for reform, and adopting a more regional approach. UNICEF's lack of an exit strategy underscores
the need for future planning.
Conclusions
The LCO-EP program has aligned well with the current educational needs of Lebanon and has shown
clear relevance. Its flexible approach has allowed it to address many immediate challenges effectively.
However, this adaptability has potentially overlooked some long-term systemic issues. A notable challenge
has been finding the right balance between humanitarian aid and developmental projects within the program.
Achieving this balance is important for long-term success in Lebanon's education sector.
LCO-EP's achievements across its multifaceted pillars are varied. Its most pronounced success is in
ensuring access to education, an effort deemed indispensable for sustaining the Lebanese public education
system. Though strides have been made in enhancing teacher competencies, the tangible impact on student
outcomes remains elusive. Significant accomplishments in child protection and inclusion indicate a promising
direction for future activities. System-strengthening, a critical component of the programme, witnessed limited
earlier success but has gained momentum with the introduction of TREF. The latter not only emphasizes timely
monitoring and financial accountability but also presents a potential lever for instigating much-needed
educational reforms in collaboration with the Lebanese government.
Stakeholder perspectives on LCO-EP are marked by a blend of recognition and uncertainty. While
UNICEF's substantial contributions to the education sector in Lebanon are acknowledged, there's a discernible
communication gap. Both donors and schools express a lack of clarity regarding the organization's initiatives,
emphasizing the necessity for improved and transparent communication strategies.
System-level recommendations
UNICEF should strongly engage in advocacy for and implementation of broader education system
reforms. This recommendation is supported by analysis under all evaluation criteria and with respect to all
pillars. UNICEF is seen as particularly well-placed for this role due to: (i) the scale of its interventions, (ii) donor
trust, (iii) depth of its relationship with MEHE and (iv) system-level know-how.
Based on the findings from the national- and local-level research, following up on this recommendation would
include:
1. a stronger push for policy and legislative reforms (accompanied by efforts to change related practices)
to:
a. remove barriers to refugee participation in education, e.g. by ensuring smooth pathways from
NFE to FE for all children;
b. find a systemic solution to ensure timely access to education for children of Lebanese mothers
who do not have the Lebanese nationality;
c. reduce systemic inefficiencies in the education sector, e.g. by:
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021

i. reforming the teacher employment and contracting arrangements to simplify the
system, and
ii. decreasing the high teacher-to-student ratio in Lebanese schools and the number of
schools;
iii. removing ghost teachers from pay-roll;
d. increase the quality of education, e.g. through pushing for:
i. changes in curricula to modernize teaching and set ambitious learning targets,
especially for Cycle 3 which is perceived as neglected by parents and teachers;
ii. consistent and robust teacher recruitment policy, and
iii. strengthened teacher competence framework and professional development
pathway, linked to performance assessment and incentives;
e. promote the public school system and to ensure that MEHE’s financial commitments to this
system systematically increase over time, including through increases in and paying teacher
salaries. Specifically, UNICEF could encourage MEHE to develop fundraising activities
towards that aim, e.g. among the Lebanese diaspora.
2. continuation of current system-strengthening efforts to increase MEHE’s capacity regarding education
data collection and analysis, including supporting MEHE in producing an Information Management
Strategy. MEHE committed itself to producing an Information Management Strategy 2019-2021 as an
effort for a clear way forward on quality data collection and analysis, but this commitment has not been
fulfilled as of the submission of this report;
3. pushing for stronger coordination within MEHE to benefit further work on the quality of education,
especially between MEHE’s DG, CERD and DOPS to ensure clarity in and complementarity of
mandates and effective communication between these units. Communication between MEHE units
could be strengthened by consistent inclusion of relevant MEHE staff (beyond DG which is a core
member) in the work of the SMB;
4. encouraging MEHE to improve communication with schools. Currently, school directors and teachers
feel unsupported, as they have low awareness of MEHE’s plans and priorities, or the roles of key
education bodies, such as CERD and DOPS. Improving communication channels and disseminating
relevant information could help boost collaboration and cooperation within the education system;
5. attracting men to the teaching profession to broaden the talent pool. Currently, the profession is heavily
feminized, with some visited schools having no male teachers;
6. aiming for a sustainable approach to achieving inclusion and relevance of education services for
refugees.
Many of those reforms will be a mid- to long-term effort, but the initiation of this work is urgent in view of
decreasing donor patience and funds.
UNICEF needs to strongly coordinate and cooperate with donors, the World Bank and other UN
agencies on the advocacy and implementation of the reform agenda. It should build on the exiting
previous plans to avoid reinventing the wheel. Such plans have been put forward before, e.g. by the World
Bank.1 Given the magnitude of their respective interventions, UNICEF and the World Bank need to join
forces and speak in one voice on systemic reforms.

fundamental issue hindering effective educational practices
by all stakeholders in the visited locations.
Relevance Invest in a school transportation system for students and H Mid-term
teachers. Consider replacing the current transportation
Effectiveness
subsidy system, which has sparked controversy among
parents, with direct funding for a safe transportation system.
Interviews revealed that transportation unavailability or
danger remains a primary barrier to school attendance for
students and school staff.
Relevance Address other types of in-kind support expected by M Short-,
school communities, including further renovation works, mid- to
solar panels, heating systems, alternative electricity long-term
production systems, food packages, drinking water and
computers. However, regarding computers, it is essential to
note that fieldwork revealed some locations where digital
equipment is underutilized due to the lack of necessary skills
among school staff and electricity access limitations.
Relevance Introduce outdoor activities and recreational activities for H Mid-term
children. These activities not only provide an opportunity for
physical exercise but also contribute to children’s social,
emotional, and cognitive development and reduce stress and
anxiety levels. During the interviews, parents particularly
emphasized the importance of including outdoor and art
activities in the school curriculum, hoping that this would
improve the well-being of their children.
Relevance Implement PSS programs during the first shift and M Mid-term
increase school staff awareness of the role of PSS
counsellors. PSS is essential for addressing the emotional
and mental health needs of students. In the face of crises
affecting the Lebanese population as well, limiting the
provision of PSS to the second shift does not seem justified.

Moreover, such a distinction may create a sense of unfair
privilege for non-Lebanese students and exacerbate
hostilities between different nationality groups.
Relevance Improve communication regarding the program, e.g. by H Short- to
developing stories about the program’s aspirations, specific mid-term
Effectiveness
work and how it benefits different stakeholders. Improved
communication should target a wide range of stakeholders,
including donors, the Lebanese public, and stakeholders at
school level (principals, teachers and parents):
• Provide clearer communication to donors on what the H
program does under the quality pillar.
• Enhance the communication plan with school H
principals, especially during onboarding, after a
change in school leadership. The communication
plan should include clear information about UNICEF's
and the international community's efforts to support
the Lebanese community and the education sector in
general. It should also provide transparency
regarding the calculation of school funding to address
any existing ambiguities that might lead to
resentment in this area.
• Develop and implement an analogous H
communication plan with the Lebanese population,
showcasing the support that UNICEF provides to the
first shift in schools and the education sector as a
whole.
• Provide advance notice about UNICEF's planned M
activities, such as summer schools. Currently, some
participating schools still have not received detailed
information on this matter. Ensuring timely
communication and sharing upcoming initiatives
would help schools prepare and participate effectively
in UNICEF's programs.
Relevance Develop a clear vision of TREF window II and specific H Short-term
proposals for donors to facilitate funding decisions and
fund allocation.
Donors see the need to increase engagement on NFE, but
they expect clear communication and initiative from UNICEF.
Relevance Develop further interventions which address the needs of H Short- to
teachers and principles to increase/maintain their mid-term
motivation and engagement, as well as address well-being.

• Develop methods to recognize and appreciate the H
efforts of individual principals and teachers through
positive acknowledgement. Currently, they feel
underappreciated by MEHE, and many schools
continue to function solely due to their heroic efforts.
Recognizing their hard work and dedication can
foster a sense of value and motivation among the
education professionals.
• Consider involving school principals in training M
sessions targeted at teachers. This approach can
foster better collaboration between school staff at
different levels, align the understanding of
educational goals, and ensure consistent
implementation of the acquired knowledge
throughout the school.
• Rethink the timing of training sessions. Avoid M
conducting training on public holidays and better align
the training calendar with the school year to enable
teachers to start the new academic year equipped
with the necessary knowledge and skills.
Relevance Continue efforts to improve teachers' approach towards H Short- to
students, addressing aggressive and offensive mid-term
behaviors. Additionally, sensitize teachers to the issue of
access to toilets for children during class time, which was
identified as a problem in several visited schools. By
promoting a positive and respectful teacher-student
relationship, students are more likely to feel safe, supported,
and motivated to learn. Ensuring easy access to toilets for
children during class time is essential for their comfort, health,
and dignity.
Relevance Continue supporting inclusive education by strengthening M Short- to

1.0 Introduction
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Syrian war
Started in March 2011, the Syrian civil war has devastated communities across the country causing the
displacement of nearly 5.7 million Syrians and remaining the largest displacement crisis globally.2 Due to this
conflict, Lebanon has received more international refugees per capita per kilometer than any other country in
the world. Out of 6 million inhabitants, around 1.5 million are Syrian refugees and around 14,000 are refugees
of other nationalities.3 According to the latest data from UNHCR, the refugee population accounts for nearly a
quarter of Lebanon’s total population with children representing 54.3% of the refugees.4
The high number of Syrian child refugees in Lebanon further increased the structural deficiencies of the already
weak education system. With weak infrastructure, an economic crisis worsening every year, and the lack of
political stability, this massive influx of refugees has posed significant challenges to Lebanon and made the
entire Syrian population severely vulnerable. The results of the 2020 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian
Refugees (VASyR) show that close to 90% live below the poverty line. Due to extreme poverty, education-
related expenses are often seen as secondary and not prioritized within Syrian households, with basic
necessities taking precedence over education.
Precarious living conditions of refugee families affect access to and quality of education. The lack of financial
resources correlates with low school attendance and school dropout. The high dropout levels for Syrian
children might have serious impacts on the long-term development path of the Syrian economy after the crisis.
The uneducated children will not have the qualifications needed to partake in the reconstruction of Syria. By
aggravating the situation in Lebanon and putting an additional strain on the country’s weak education system,
the Syrian war also increased the vulnerability of Lebanese students.
1.1.2 Economic downturn
The World Bank depicted the Lebanese economic depression as “likely to rank in the top 10, possibly top 3,
most severe crisis episodes globally since the mid-nineteenth century”.5 The economic and political situation
in Lebanon was almost always characterized by instability and disturbance, but matters came to a head in
October 2019, when the Government of Lebanon (GoL) planned on imposing taxes on WhatsApp calls,
gasoline and tobacco.6 Despite the fact that the GoL reversed its decision, nationwide protests, driven by a
disenchanted population demanding change, erupted against the political and economic elite.
The crisis became fully apparent in 2019, but Lebanon’s financial hardships commenced well before and are
rooted in decades of political and financial mismanagement, with COVID-19 pandemic and Port of Beirut
explosion as aggravators of these difficulties. For the last 30 years, the Lebanese Pound (LBP) has been
pegged to the US dollar. The spectacular fall of the currency has been ongoing for almost three years. The

national currency has lost 95% of its value in three years of the financial crisis and continues to depreciate.
This devaluation drives surging inflation, in triple digits since July 2020 and reaching an average of 162% for
2022.7 Inflation disproportionally affects the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable inhabitants who can
no longer afford basic goods, as food inflation hit 332% (year-on-year) in June 2022.8 Such inflation also
renders access to basic services, such as education or healthcare, very difficult.
Apart from affecting the economic sector, the Lebanese financial crisis also negatively impacts the education
sector which already struggles with underinvestment, resulting in poorly equipped and overcrowded schools.
Indeed, the GoL’s expenditure on education is feeble and represents 2.6% of the GDP, being one of the lowest
rates amongst Arab countries.9
This economically complicated situation of the country is not without consequences for many Lebanese as
well as non-Lebanese households which do not have the financial means to pay tuition cost, as well as school
supply and commuting costs. In a recent survey by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) with a sample size of
1,209 households, more than a half of the families declared being unable to pay for education tuitions and
school materials, while 43% stated being unable to pay for transport to school or work.10
In parallel, teachers and educational staff experience difficulties to commute to their workplace because of the
lack of gasoline and high commute cost, with hardly any other public transportation alternative available.
Teachers struggle with poor remuneration which, in many cases, does not cover the transportation cost to their
workplaces. With no concrete and structural governmental plans to modify their salaries, teachers have been
on strike since the beginning of 2022, and many left the country looking for better opportunities. This, in turn,
has contracted the Lebanese fragile economy, and teachers who are still in Lebanon are enduring additional
responsibilities brought on by the shortage in qualified teachers.
The economic crisis is happening within the context of deep and structural gender inequalities. In fact, the
latest World Economic Forum Gender Gap Report 2023, indicated that Lebanon has one of the highest overall
gender gaps in the world since it ranked 132th out of 146 countries.11 While Lebanon performs well on gender
parity in the education sector, and in 2023 it scored at 98% gender parity in education according to the Gender
Gap Report,12 gender parity has been affected by the crisis. This means increases in GBV, gender digital divide
and different barriers for girls and boys in accessing education. When boys drop out to work, girls resign from
school for care work, due to period poverty (66% of girls cannot afford sanitary pads),13 for safety reasons
and/or gender discriminatory norms.
1.1.3 Beirut blast
The explosion in the Port of Beirut in August 2020 severely impacted the education sector damaging or
destroying 163 schools and affecting more than 85,000 children and the work of 7,600 teachers.14 In addition,
20 technical and vocational education and training institutions were damaged, affecting approximately 7,300

students.15 According to the initial assessments by the Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher Education
(MEHE), about 80% of schools in the country’s capital suffered light to moderate damage and 20% major
damage.16
With many homes and schools destroyed, and families forced to relocate, access to educational facilities,
materials and connectivity was compromised. The most vulnerable children lacked learning materials and
connectivity to begin with and are at even greater risk of experiencing prolonged delays in accessing learning
and possibly even dropping out of school. Families who have lost their homes and livelihoods also face
financial barriers to enrolling and supporting their children’s education.
In addition to physical and financial losses, the explosions have also had an impact on the psychological well-
being of the youngest. UNICEF estimates that 600,000 children living within a 20-kilometer radius of the blast
site may suffer short and long-term negative psychological impacts.17
1.1.4 COVID-19
Like the rest of the world, Lebanon has been strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 2, in an
effort to contain the outbreak, the Lebanese Government decided to close all schools and education institutions
in the country. Parallelly, non-formal education (NFE) service providers were recommended to close their
centers as well for safety and health concerns. Consequently, over 1.2 million school-aged children saw their
traditional classroom track disrupted and had to shift towards remote learning options for an approximate
period of two years.18
However, with poor telecommunications and internet infrastructure, as well as a limited access to technological
devices, especially in rural areas, Lebanese education facilities had troubles to organize proper distance
learning. Teachers reported a mountain of technical problems, such as unstable electricity, internet
connectivity issues, and the late or non-delivery of electronic learning devices.19 Frequent power-cuts, fuel
shortages and generator breakdowns are extra elements that hindered the smooth running of online courses.
According to a survey conducted by UNHCR in 2020, out of a sample of 10,000 families in need, almost none
had tablets or computers but only smartphones at home.20 Moreover, 95% of the children did not possess their
personal device and needed to share the household device given the limited number of electronic devices
available at home. Out of the 95%, there were only 100 smartphones available for every 212 children, which
would require at least two children to share a device during distance learning – making the learning process
tedious.21
In this way, the pandemic has exacerbated Lebanon’s educational shortcomings, but also inequalities as
refugees and vulnerable children are less likely to access remote learning options. Furthermore, the pandemic
is connected with harmful side effects, such as economic shocks to households and social distancing that
further decrease the well-being and development of children.

1.1.5 Characteristics of the Lebanese education system
The Lebanese education system has gradually deteriorated beginning with the outbreak of the 1975 civil war.
Between 1975 and 1990, the Lebanese government’s investment in education dropped, creating opportunities
for the private sector to engage with educational services.22 Currently, approximately two-thirds of Lebanese
children attend costly private education, while public schools have become the last resort for families without
means.23
The divide into private and public education is characterized by a difference in quality, with private schools
offering higher standards of curriculum. Public schools also struggle with physical capacity limitations, lack of
proper infrastructure, technological materials and science laboratories. They attract less qualified personnel,
as the remuneration offered is substantially lower than in private schools.24 This leads to a widening gap
between economically disadvantaged students and their wealthier peers who can afford to choose private
education. The needs of public-school teachers are also mostly unmet, which triggers regular street protests
to demand a pay rise, proper allocation of resources and an improvement of school infrastructure.25
The language barrier is yet another challenge faced by Syrian refugee students in Lebanon,26 even though
Arabic is the national language of both Syria and Lebanon. Firstly, the official language of instruction in
Lebanese schools is Arabic, but it can differ from the dialect of Arabic spoken in Syria. This linguistic difference
can create comprehension difficulties for Syrian students. Secondly, while French and English are introduced
as languages of instruction for certain subjects, such as math, physics, and chemistry, from primary school in
Lebanon, many Syrian students may not have had sufficient exposure to these languages in their previous
education in Syria. This creates difficulties when it comes to enrollment and retention.27 Even if all UNHCR
status refugees are eligible for enrollment in corresponding grades, those lacking documentation must take a
placement test based on the Lebanese curriculum, which has a language component. As a result, Syrian
students can enroll, but are placed several grades lower in relation to their academic achievements and age.28
In 2010, MEHE introduced a reform of the educational system based on a five-year development plan.29 The
new system emphasized many issues essential for the achievement of equal access to and quality of
education. It highlighted the gap in success rates in official exams between the public and private sectors and
emphasized the importance of counselling and guidance. A budget was then designed and allocated based
on Lebanese educational sector priorities. A US$2.424 million was raised to develop the education system.30
However, with the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in 2011, budget allocations shifted. The Lebanese MEHE
had to respond to an increase in Syrian students, who now outnumbered the Lebanese students.
In 2014, MEHE launched the Reaching All Children with Education (RACE) policy, an official framework to
address Syrian refugee crisis. Initially, RACE targeted 400,000 Syrian refugee children who were out of school,

aiming to enroll 200,000 in formal schooling and the other half with foreign language, basic literacy and
numeracy and accelerated learning programs. The mission of RACE was the expansion of the existing school
system capacity, rather than creation of a separate school system for Syrians. Thus, by 2016-17, MEHE
created second shifts in 314 schools,31 which were designed only for Syrian refugees.32 Children were allowed
to enroll in Lebanese public schools without providing a proof of legal residency. Even if the afternoon shifts
were two hours shorter than a regular school day, they have strained the education budget and overburdened
the educators, since most teachers and principals covered both shifts.33
Prior to RACE, civil society actors provided NFE (homework support, catch-up classes or language support)
or even ran schools in contexts where second shift schools were either far away or full. Whereas in public
schools, teachers in both shifts must be Lebanese nationals, in the NGO run NFE teachers can be Syrian if
they have permission to work in the country, and they may or may not have official teaching certificates.34 In
2014, however, MEHE instructed the NGOs to cease their work until new guidelines are set. In 2016, MEHE
developed an NFE framework, establishing that MEHE shall be the regulating body in full control over of NFE
programs. Any NGOs operating outside of the official framework were to be shut down.
In 2016, RACE was modified and a RACE II strategy for 2017-2021 was developed. The new 5-year
programme consisted of three pillars: (1) Improved access to education to deal with capacity limitations; (2)
Improved quality of education by shifting towards learner-centered pedagogy and creating supportive learning
environment, which is inclusive, safe, healthy and protective; (3) Improved structural capacity by implementing
national education data management system, updated curricula, teacher assessment framework and violence
monitoring mechanisms.35
1.2 Description of the intervention
1.2.1 Rationale behind the Education Programme implementation
The Syrian refugee crisis, the economic downturn, and the Beirut blast, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic
have had and will have serious repercussions on the future of Lebanese and refugee children, adolescents
and youth. In fact, they compromise access to education, health care, nutritional needs and other basic
services while threatening children’s psychological well-being and further straining inter-community
coexistence. The unfortunate and immediate consequence of all these accumulated stressors is a direct
increase in child vulnerability and poverty, a growing number of highly vulnerable at-risk children in need of
education services. The soaring poverty is reflected in the school dropout and school attendance rates.
In fact, during the 2020-2022 school year, school attendance remained low, especially among the youngest
children. Within the Syrian population, only 11% of children in the 3-5 age group attended pre-school with a
relatively more positive situation for children between 6-14 years old since half of them attended an educational
facility during 2020-2022. Concerning Syrian youth aged between 15-17 years old, 27% of them attended
school in the previous scholastic year.36 In addition to low school attendance, Lebanon counts a percentage

of its population that has never attended an educational facility – 30% of children in school age (ages 6-17)
have never been to school, and 46% of 40-60 years old (adult population) have never been to school neither.37
Several factors are responsible for this low school attendance with the most impactful being the cost of
educational materials, cost of transportation to attend an educational facility, the necessity to work (particularly
for young men), marriage (particularly for young women), and the fear of COVID-19, at the time. Additionally,
elements such as period poverty, safety and gendered social norms can be perceived as barriers for low school
attendance amongst young women.38 Rising poverty levels put a significant pressure on children to drop out
of school so that they can work. In Lebanon, children that are working are often the main and/or only
breadwinners in their families, with 10.8% of the households surveyed by World Vision reported having at least
one child aged 3 to 18 years old engaged in child labor.39 Children as young as six have been working in the
streets, in agricultural fields and garages or on construction sites, where they are exposed to risks of
exploitation, violence and abuse.40
In an attempt to address school dropout, the difficulties in accessing education as well as to respond to the
Syrian refugee crisis, the Lebanese Government, jointly with international partners, has implemented various
national, regional and local frameworks and programs (see also Section 1.1.5 above) such as RACE and
RACE II, with the latter being aligned with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Education. Both
RACE I and RACE II are rooted in the premise of a shared long-term vision and partnership with MEHE and
the donor community, including UN agencies (such as UNICEF), and other education stakeholders committed
to strengthening the Lebanese education system.
1.2.2 UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme
UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme (LCO-EP) aimed to support the national education system to be more
inclusive and equitable in its delivery of quality education services to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged
children, regardless of their nationality, gender, physical/intellectual abilities, or socio-economic status. The
programme involved strengthening the MEHE towards building the resilience of the public sector to manage
the Syrian and economic crises, while sustaining the longer-term functioning of the education system.
The programme consists of three pillars, equivalent to those of RACE II, with the overall aim of supporting
education services that respond to the needs of the most vulnerable children and adolescents in Lebanon:
Pillar (I) Improve access to public education by increasing demand and reducing financial barriers for enrolment into
formal and non-formal education and early development opportunities for children between 3 to 18 years of age.
Pillar (II) Improve quality of public education by contributing to increase capacity of the education sector (formal and non-
formal) to deliver quality and inclusive education services, teaching, and learning environments.
Pillar (III) Improve the governance of public education by contributing to enhance governance and managerial capacity
of the MEHE and institutions to coordinate, implement, and monitor public education formal and non-formal education
sector.
Achievement of these three pillars will enhance MEHE governance and managerial capacity to effectively plan,
finance, execute, and monitor public education sector plans in Lebanon and to ensure that all children are
adequately prepared and supported to enroll in, and complete formal education within the Lebanese education

system. The above-mentioned pillars are articulated around specific outcomes, indicators and targets which
are outlined below:
Outcomes41 within Pillar I
- Outcome 1.1.: Children, youth, and their caregivers are provided with necessary support to increase their
demand for formal or regulated non-formal education
- Outcome 1.2.: Children and youth have improved access to appropriately equipped public schools, especially
in under-served areas
These outcomes were to be achieved through a plethora of activities, such as community outreach and
engagement, subsidies for formal and non-formal education, transportation assistance, education supplies,
textbooks, hygiene supplies, and cash for well-being as well as school rehabilitation and construction (in the
context of the Beirut blast).
Outcomes within Pillar II
- Outcome 2.1.: Teachers, education personnel, and educators have enhanced capacities to provide learner-
centered pedagogy in public schools and learning facilities
- Outcome 2.2.: Teachers and education personnel at the school-level and educators in learning spaces are
capacitated to contribute to inclusive, safe, healthy, and protective environments
In practice, this meant implementation of activities, such as training of public-school teachers and NFE
educators, inclusion of children with special needs into public schools, dedicated psychological support (PSS)
and health staff in second shift schools; dedicated monitoring of teacher performance in second shift schools
and operationalizing a child protection policy in public schools.
Outcomes within Pillar III
- Outcome 3.1.: Center for Education Research and Development (CERD) is capacitated to administer an
effective education data management system
- Outcome 3.2.: Revised curricula for school and learning spaces are developed and endorsed to improve quality
learning, life skills, and employability for children and youth
- Outcome 3.3.: Appropriate policy frameworks are endorsed and implemented to regulate education programs
and services, strengthen school management, and professionalize teaching services
- Outcome 3.4.: The Project Management Unit (PMU), in collaboration with Center for Education Research and
Development (CERD) and the Department d’Orientation Pédagogique et Scolaire (DOPS), is capacitated to
lead RACE II with MEHE departments and relevant education stakeholders
As for Pillar III, concrete interventions consisted of improvements towards child-centered pedagogy,
knowledge and evidence generation to support policies for inclusive education and teaching framework,
protective school environment and coordination of the education sector and education donors.
41 It is important to note that all of the listed outcomes (from outcome 1.1 to 3.4) are derived from the RACE II programme. In fact, RACE
II and UNICEF Lebanon Programme outcomes are identical. However, in UNICEF Annual Workplans documents, some outcomes are
formulated in a different manner but without any substantive differences in the idea and meaning of these.

LCO-EP was structured and implemented in cohesion with already existing frameworks, strategies and
programs related to education in Lebanon. Its main external counterparts were the key Lebanese education
stakeholders, such as the MEHE, CERD, and DOPS. UNICEF was also supported by international
organizations committed to ameliorating the education sector in Lebanon, including UN Agencies (UNESCO,
UNHCR), the World Bank, and legally recognized international and national NGO partners, within the
Education Sector Working Group. To achieve its ultimate purpose, i.e. the right to education for all vulnerable
children in Lebanon, UNICEF’s interventions were designed in a way to sustainably include parents and
communities in education and development of their children, to partner with MEHE and other important
education stakeholders, as well as to advocate with local and international donors and partners.
1.2.3 Evolution of the Education Programme over the years
In the first three years following the start of the LCO-EP (2016-2019), its overarching objective was to ensure
that access to education for most vulnerable children in Lebanon is realized. Prior to the 2016 programming
and Syrian refugee arrivals, education was not an area of focus for UNICEF in Lebanon.42 The programme
and interventions were conceived to support the efforts of GoL and other institutions to improve the educational
situation of children in Lebanon and respond to the Syrian refugee crisis. UNICEF’s actions were based on the
three pillars, as well as the outcomes and activities within the RACE programme that were mentioned above.
In 2020, in addition to the ongoing severe economic crisis, Lebanon was hit by two new crises, i.e., the Beirut
blast and COVID-19. Consequently, new challenges and needs emerged. So, in 2020 an output ‘Emergency
response in case of extreme evictions, influx of refugees, natural disaster, outbreak or any other emergency
situation’ was added. UNICEF and partners responded to the crises in a multi-sectoral way, relying on three
pillars: (1) Keeping children safe and healthy, and ensuring their families access to social assistance services;
(2) Rehabilitating essential services, including water and sanitation, education and health infrastructure; (3)
High youth engagement in cleaning and rehabilitation activities.

1.2.4. Transition Resilience Education Fund (TREF)
In June 2022, MEHE launched the Transition Resilience Education Fund (TREF), in partnership with UNICEF
and two main donors – the European Union and Germany through the German Development Bank (KfW). 43
TREF is a new aid modality developed based on previous experiences in response to the education crisis
which stems from three other major crises – financial, governance and trust crises in Lebanon. TREF aims to
strengthen governance, transparency, efficiency and learning outcomes for children in the education sector,
including in formal public education and through alternative learning pathways designed to improve access to
43 The Ministry of Education launches the Transition Resilience Education Fund, to support Lebanon’s Education Sector (unicef.org)
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 28
inclusive and quality education for children who are out of school and not learning.44 TREF is based on two
funding windows:
• Window I – support and upgrade to public education system; and
• Window II – Multiple Flexible Pathways through non-public institutions.
Within Window II, UNICEF implemented NFE programs for children outside school system, enrolling 28,000
children in early childhood education, basic literacy and numeracy, or adapted basic literacy and numeracy.
The pilot phase of “DIRASA”, an innovative education programme launched in 2022 enrolled 5,074 out-of-
school children (including 555 children with disabilities) in 19 private schools across all 8 governorates in
Lebanon. UNICEF covered DIRASA students’ enrolment fees as well as provided school supplies, hygiene
kits, access to digital learning platforms, and other services at the school-level to all children enrolled in the
targeted schools, reaching 13,500 children (including 5,000 DIRASA students). UNICEF also financed running
costs for schools. The programme built the capacity of 320 teachers in quality of education. The pilot phase is
currently under revision based on the lessons learnt.45
Another initiative pertaining to Window II is the MAKANI programme, based on the lessons learnt from the past
decade of NFE and child protection, e.g., in Jordan. The Multi-Service Community Center (MSCC) ‘Makani’
approach is to be launched in 2023 and will support out-of-school marginalized children’, their families’ and
communities’ access to multiple services, including education, child protection, adolescent and youth
engagement, social assistance, and health and nutrition services with referrals to additional specialized
services, as needed. Both DIRASA and MAKANI pathways aim at ensuring that children continue to learn and
at contributing to greater social cohesion, while providing a protective environment for all children.46 They also
integrate gender and ensure targeted programming for girls.47
TREF is foreseen to develop in two phases. The first phase focuses mainly on enrolment fee subsidies, such
as HR costs and funds to schools for vulnerable children in primary education (e.g. the above-mentioned
DIRASA project pilot) and support to MEHE in developing a policy programme to address the deep education
crisis. Phase 2 will ensure funding coverage to all pillars and priority programs of the 5-year plan48 – a new
policy framework following RACE and RACE II. TREF aims at enhancing the implementation of the 5-year plan
with additional funding to be mobilized.
The programme has been designed as a tool to help MEHE manage the deep economic crisis through good
governance, quality data reporting, predictable payments to school staff and strengthened programmatic
decision making. In short, TREF enables MEHE to be more transparent and accountable toward international
donors than in the past years.
The estimate of the annual funding envelope for TREF amounts to about 150 million USD/year, with a third of
this amount (up to 50 million USD per year) making for payments to 12-14,000 special contract teachers as
well as School Fund (23.5 million USD per year) and Parent Council Fund (20 million USD per year) accounts
to about 1,200 schools.
TREF is an attempt to shift focus in several domains. It aims to move away from uncoordinated individual
projects towards a more systemic, sector-wide approach, in order to increase the level of trust and
accountability. Bilateral negotiations and lack of coordination among partners are to be replaced by external

Priority outputs and programs under TREF are embedded in the 5-year plan. Supporting access of first and
second shift students to schools is part of Pillar 1 (Equitable Access to and Participation in Education) of the
5-year plan. The strong focus on capacity building is part of Pillar 3 on System Strengthening and

1.3.2 Specific objectives
The specific objectives of the evaluation, as identified in the ToR, have been to:
• reconstruct the ToC and recommend enhancements of programme focus and ToC;
• examine the relevance, efficiency and agility of UNICEF support to the education sector in view of the
context;
• examine the contribution of the programme outputs towards expected results;
• identify good practices and gaps in interventions;
• recommend improvements or strategic shifts.
1.3.3 Equality and inclusion lens
Throughout the assessment and while identifying and documenting specific learnings and insights, the
evaluation has maintained a focus on inclusion and equity, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable
children, including out-of-school children, children with disabilities (CWD) and Syrian refugees, including girls
and married girls. Both data collection, as well as analysis and reporting used a gender lens to make sure that
the specific situations and experiences of boys and girls are captured.

1.3.4 Phases, tasks and core deliverables
The above purpose and objectives have been translated into a series of tasks spread across three main
evaluation stages:
1. inception;
2. data collection (with quantitative and qualitative components);
3. analysis, triangulation, and report writing (with quantitative and qualitative components).
As per the ToR, the core deliverables included:
• Draft and final inception report,
• PPT presentation of the main preliminary findings and conclusions,
• Draft and final evaluation report.
1.3.5 Temporal and geographical scope
The evaluation is designed to assess UNICEF’s support to the education program and focuses on entire
Lebanon, with visits to selected sites, schools, and municipalities. The evaluation thus has a national and local
dimension. However, in the selection of schools for fieldwork, some schools initially selected (in the North of
Lebanon) were replaced with others due to safety and security concerns.50 The two perspectives – national
and local – feature in the analysis, as well as the presentation of findings and recommendations. Timewise,
the evaluation covers the period from 2016 to 2022.
1.3.6 Evaluation users
UNICEF will use the findings to support its education work in Lebanon. Other users will include national
authorities (MEHE), but also donors and international organizations, including UN agencies, as well as
international and national non-governmental actors (NGOs and CSOs). Since the final report will be translated
into Arabic it will also be available for local stakeholders without English-language capacity.
50 The replacement procedure was based on a random selection of a further two schools sharing the same characteristics as the school
not available to the researchers, i.e. operating in two shifts and subject to renovation work conducted by UNICEF.

2.0 Methodology and approach
2.1 Overview of the methodology
The evaluation used a theory-driven approach which helps to determine not only whether the project worked, but
also how and why. Specifically, the theory of change (ToC) approach has been integrated into the evaluation
design. Apart from the ToC, we also borrowed from the realist evaluation approach by putting a magnifying glass
on the various identified ‘moments of change’51 and pinpointing the factors that were at play, either facilitating and
hindering achievement of change (e.g. transfers from NFE to FE, limited enrolment in specific groups, etc.).
Following the ToR, we applied a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis. In terms of the
quantitative component, the evaluation relied on the identified statistical data already available.
For the qualitative component, primary qualitative data collection was conducted at the national and regional levels.
It included:
• desk research,
• individual interviews (IDIs),
• focus group discussions (FGDs),
• deep dives during field visits in schools, involving both IDIs and FGDs, Ripple Effects Mapping sessions,
and observations.
At the national level 29 IDIs were conducted with 34 people representing UNICEF and other UN agencies, donors
and the Lebanese government. Two focus groups were also carried out with representatives of NGOs, with 10
people overall.
During local fieldwork, 8 schools were visited. These were selected based on a number of criteria, including:
geographic distribution, refugee population in the area, participation in the Inclusive Schools Pilot or school
rehabilitation/reconstruction activities, type of school (boys, girls, mixed). Some initial choices of schools situated
in the North of Lebanon were removed from the sample due to security concerns and replaced. The replacement
procedure was based on a random selection of a further two schools sharing the same characteristics as the
school not available to the researchers, i.e. operating in two shifts and subject to renovation work conducted by
UNICEF.
Overall, Ecorys’ national experts conducted:
• 8 IDIs with school principles;
• 8 Ripple Effects Mapping sessions with 44 teachers, including 41 women and 3 men;
• 8 FGDs with 50 parents, including 39 women and 11 men, 33 Lebanese and 17 non-Lebanese;
• Observations on 8 school premises with a filled out observation sheet;
• 7 IDIs with local authorities.

Besides data collection, the analysis was carried out from the qualitative and quantitative perspectives.
Triangulation was used as the main approach.
The evaluation applied the human-rights based approach, as well as the equity and inclusion lens throughout data
collection, analysis and reporting. This means, among others, seeing children as rights holders and authorities as
duty bearers. It also means sensitivity to gender, race, nationality, disability and other similar status as important
factors affecting lived experiences of children and their parents. When implementing the evaluation we have been
mindful of vulnerabilities and intersectionality. The figure below presents the overall implementation approach to
the evaluation.
Figure 2 Overall evaluation implementation approach
2.2 Limitations
Prior to conducting research, we identified a number of issues that have informed our approach to the evaluation
design. Other issues emerged during the implementation of research, and while the overall framework allowed for
adaptations of methodology, the following limitations should be noted:
The need to cover only formal education interventions during local fieldwork: Desk research and
consultations with UNICEF revealed that, apart from supporting formal education, the LCO-EP provided
considerable support for different types of NFE interventions in hundreds of NFE centers throughout the country.
While the NFE constitutes a significant component of the programme, it has recently undergone a separate
assessment and was not analyzed in-depth in the present evaluation. The assessment report’s findings served as
the primary source of information for the present evaluation as far as the NFE activities are concerned.
Scope of the LCO-EP and the need for prioritization: The inception phase revealed the massive scope of and
abundant complexities within LCO-EP. When this complexity was juxtaposed with the limited resources, including
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 34
time, for this evaluation, the need for prioritization became apparent. Following a conceptualization workshop with
UNICEF, the evaluation team proposed modifications to the evaluation matrix and research tools to address the
identified priorities. Importantly, the scope initially outlined in the Terms of Reference has been extended to include
2022, thus also covering the TREF modality. This addition allowed to strengthen the ‘lessons learned’ dimension
of research and analysis. With reference to the wide temporal scope of this evaluation, it should be noted that
recounting the early years of programme implementation was challenging, because of low institutional memory or
lack of access to previous programme personnel.
Accounting for multiple crises context: Lebanon has faced multiple crises in recent years. It has had to deal
with political instability, the implications of the Syrian war, the Covid-19 pandemic, the Beirut blast, as well as all
the related economic consequences. These factors have inevitably affected the implementation (evidenced e.g. in
Section 1.2 above). The evaluation strived to understand the way these challenges impacted the programme, its
relevance and effectiveness, among others.
Identifying and understanding the needs of heterogeneous populations, in particular the most vulnerable
children: Just as the program aimed to address the needs of the most marginalized groups, the evaluation tried
to determine how these populations had been reached and to what extent they had benefited from support.
However, accessing the most marginalized communities is notoriously difficult. The evaluation was, however, able
to directly engage non-Lebanese parents. Success in this respect required, in particular, engagement of national
experts and collaboration with UNICEF. This provided proxy access to vulnerable individuals by facilitating
provision of information about the evaluation and positively affected the beneficiaries’ and other local stakeholders’
willingness to participate. Beyond outreach and recruitment, concerns about participation of marginalized groups
in research informed evaluation design. We strived to account for specific needs of different groups by ensuring
flexibility in the selection of research techniques, simplifying research tools, adapting research logistics and
organization accordingly.
Ensuring national and local perspectives: The evaluation aimed to include the perspectives represented both
by national and local actors. A significant organizational, coordination and logistical effort has been made to reach
outside of Beirut, and conduct research with populations from various regions by Arabic-speaking experts.
Limitations on determining impact: In the case of this program and its ambitions, the complexity of the system
and multiplicity of the forces at play have to be acknowledged. Apart from UNICEF working with its partners
towards the goal of the right to education for all vulnerable children in Lebanon being realized, there have also
been other actors working on the ground in areas that might directly or indirectly affect achievement of this goal
(e.g. international donor community, UNHCR, UNESCO, WFP and other UN agencies, etc.). Therefore, identifying
straightforward causality links between the program interventions and the dynamics of access to education was
not possible in the evaluation such as this. We aimed to determine the program’s contribution towards the expected
impact. In this context, the evaluation encountered challenges in assessing effectiveness and efficiency, which are
described in detail in the respective sections of the report.

3.0 Findings
3.1 Relevance
3.1.1 How aligned is UNICEF’s education programme with global
priorities?
The overreaching objective of LCO-EP is to ensure respect for the right to education for all vulnerable children in
Lebanon by improving access to public education, its quality and governance. This objective is well-aligned with
international human rights standards, UNICEF’s mandate and the global priorities of UN agencies more broadly.
UNICEF Lebanon’s education programme is guided by international human rights standards, in particular
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) which recognizes and protects the specific
rights of children, including the right to education.52 The programme also aligns with the Convention on Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which ensures women’s equal access to and equal
opportunities in political and public life, including education, health, and employment.53 The programme seeks to
achieve gender parity in all its interventions by guaranteeing that both boys and girls have access to quality
education without any distinction based on gender. It is thus strongly aligned with SDG 4, which focuses on
education and aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities
for all.”54
The evaluated intervention is also in line with the broader UNICEF mandate and priorities. The education
programme is closely linked with UNICEF’s core commitments to children, with the education sectoral commitment
strategic result assuring that “[c]hildren and adolescents have access to inclusive, quality education and learning in
safe and protective environments”.55 Guided by the core commitments, the UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2022-2025 in
Goal Area 2 states that every child has the right to an education and should be able to access quality learning
opportunities.56 This includes chances to develop digital, transferrable, and vocational skills for specific jobs to make
sure that children and adolescents possess skills and competencies adapted to the modern world. In the same vein,
UNICEF’s education programme has supported the development of such skills by promoting the usage of digital
devices for educational purposes and the development of technological competencies of children, inter alia, during
the pandemic. In implementing the LCO-EP, UNICEF Lebanon is committed to UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan,
ensuring that gender is mainstreamed across the strategic plan goals and that there is targeted programming for
adolescent girls. LCO-EP is committed to the identification and tackling of accessibility barriers faced by girls for
equitable programming.
Last but not least, UNICEF’s education programme falls under the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP)
whose core purpose is to assist crisis-affected Lebanese population with its third impact being to ensure that
vulnerable populations have equitable access to basic services through national systems. Education sector outcomes
contributing to impact include: (1) increased equitable access to, participation in, and retention in education for all
learners in Lebanon, with a focus on the most vulnerable; (2) improved learning outcomes for children and youth
through enhanced quality of education services adapted to multi-crisis situations; (3) enhanced governance and

managerial capacities of the education system to plan effectively and manage efficiently, so that resources are
transformed into high-level results. These outcomes are complementary to those of LCO-EP.
From the Field:
Value of education
All parents interviewed unanimously agreed on the paramount importance of educating their
children, a view that has grown stronger amidst the recent deterioration in the Lebanese economy and
other sectors. Parents expressed their desire for their children to receive education as a means of securing a
better future, even if opportunities within the country are scarce. The respondents share the belief that education
is essential, especially given the challenges posed by the financial crisis and rapid technological advancements in
the job market. The closure of schools during the last strike further reinforced the significance of education in their
minds. Notably, parents of Syrian origin emphasized education as the only hope for their children's future, willing
to make significant sacrifices to ensure their education. Education is perceived as a protective factor, fostering
personal and social development, making it a fundamental aspect regardless of the prevailing circumstances.
“Education is important in all the cases. If our children did not find a job, they can at least use this knowledge to
educate their children.” (parent)
“As a Syrian, I have lost everything. I don’t want to lose my children. This is why education is the only hope for
them. I am ready to sell my kidney to make sure that all my children complete their education.” (parent)
“Education is very important to our children and our country; this is why we need the international support to focus
more on Lebanese children.” (parent)
“What distinguished the Lebanese state is education, and what will save the Lebanese state is education.”

3.1.2 How relevant is the UNICEF education programme and its
interventions to the country context?
The UNICEF education programme and its interventions are highly relevant to the country context, as they
address the identified serious issues. The Lebanese education sector has been battling a range of problems,
both pre-existing and related to the Syrian refugee influx (see Section 1.1. and 1.2.1.). These have been further
exacerbated by consecutive crises, whether caused by governmental financial mismanagement, the Beirut blast
or the COVID-19 pandemic.
Both desk review and stakeholder testimonies confirm that the UNICEF’s education programme rightly
identified access to education as a key intervention area, demanding substantial financial investment. The
need for supporting access became apparent when Syrian families with children started massively migrating to
Lebanon following the outbreak of the Syrian war. It has remained so, and strengthened, when the consecutive
crises raised the levels of poverty and vulnerability among the Syrian refugees, but also increasingly the Lebanese
host communities. The activation of negative coping mechanisms has translated into low attendance rates and
high drop-outs among children, in addition to other consequences.
UNICEF’s subsidization of Syrian children’s enrolment should thus be seen as very relevant to the country
context. Yet enrolment as a basis for subsidies has been contested by some respondents, including among
UNICEF (e.g. due to the possible multiple enrolments and subsequent drop outs), who believe that tying subsidies
to attendance was a better option. Indeed, as it appears, subsidization of attendance could have been more
relevant vis-à-vis the pursued objectives of not only enrolling children but also retaining them in education
(see more Section 3.2.1.1).

UNICEF’s engagement in the provision of NFE as part of its access pillar is also highly relevant to the
Lebanese context and could be increased in view of stakeholder feedback. Many Syrian refugee children did
not have prior schooling, had a significant break in education or were out-of-school for various reasons, which
created a need for pathways enabling their introduction or reintroduction to any education in Lebanon, and
eventually bridging to FE. While agreeing that formal education deserved prioritization, some interviewees
indicated that the focus on the NFE could have been stronger within the LCO-EP. In this context, TREF goes
in the right direction, since it aims to bring dispersed NFE initiatives under its second window. However,
in contrast to window one, window two was at the time of writing this report still considered as
underdeveloped by donor stakeholders who were keen to support NFE.57 It was not clear to respondents what
specific interventions it would entail, and therefore where funding could specifically be committed, as its final shape
was still being decided.
Although many children benefited from access to public education and NFE thanks to UNICEF’s LCO-EP (see
Section 3.2.1.1.), there is still a significant population of out-of-school children, which raises questions not
only around effectiveness but also relevance. The roots of the problem could entail targeting which focuses on
children who are easier to reach and/or outreach methods that do not resonate with or reach the targeted
populations. In relation specifically to NFE, the previous evaluation noted a prohibitive character of some formal
requirements, rendering part of the offer irrelevant to specific groups of children.58
From the Field:
Out-of-school education and ECEC
Parental awareness regarding access to informal education, other out-of-school learning
activities, and ECEC services in Lebanon is limited, as evidenced by the responses. Parents reported that
they have never received any direct messages about learning opportunities for their children, although they have
come across announcements on social media platforms regarding vocational training opportunities and
scholarships. While private kindergartens exist, parents expressed doubt whether there are any free alternatives
for pre-primary education. The costs associated with private kindergartens were considered prohibitive. However,
there were encouraging examples of individuals taking personal initiatives to bridge the gap, such as one
participant running a small care center in her house, providing free education to children, emphasizing the vital
significance of education.
Similarly, while some children have been able to cross the path from NFE to FE, the programme’s success in
bridging this gap has been lower than expected. Stakeholder testimonies and desk review point to reasons
such as governmental political priorities, which hinder integration, and discontinuation of the ALP in 2019,59 which
are beyond UNICEF’s power. However, NFE-FE bridging being a key step in ensuring access should have
perhaps benefited from stronger advocacy and emphasis in UNICEF’s cooperation with MEHE. The current
research indicates that the work is on-going on finding a solution to this bottleneck.
Interventions such as learning recovery or catch up classes, summer schools and similar also have high
relevance in view of the context. Both Syrian and Lebanese children have experienced a break in education
with the physical closures of public schools (or work in a hybrid mode) for roughly two years, starting even before
the COVID-19 pandemic. The continued need for engagement on NFE was highlighted throughout interviews with
stakeholders.

The introduction of interventions aimed at public school teachers under TREF, such as the productivity
allowance, also responds to a significant need, with the government being unable to bear the financial
responsibility for remunerating its educational professional workforce. The concurring crises affected public school
teachers by simultaneously demanding their mobilization to respond to the challenges of nationally diverse classes
(e.g. language barriers) and online education, while also reducing the value of their already low salaries, including
in comparison to the private sector.60 Consequently, teacher strikes leading to school closures have been an
additional barrier to children accessing education. At the same time, teachers’ motivation and engagement is key
not only for keeping schools open, but also for student learning variation.61
The fieldwork at school-level shows a need for developing interventions which can help to maintain
teachers’ motivation and engagement, and improve their work. Appropriate remuneration can positively
influence motivation and engagement, and is thus a factor in the success of future reforms, especially around
education quality. UNICEF could respond to this need through shaping its future work so as to go beyond
subsidizing teacher remuneration, in such formats as the ad hoc MEHE-requested productivity allowance, towards
supporting MEHE in finding a more durable and adequate solution for fair teacher salaries.
When addressing the needs of teachers, the interventions should also include principals who, as evidenced
by the interviews, feel undervalued, despite their efforts. With the taxing demands stemming from various crises,
the fieldwork points to the need for interventions allowing principles and teachers to engage in self-care.
From the Field:
Teacher recruitment, retention and approach towards students
The forefront issue in all visited schools is the massive shortage of qualified teachers. Those
teachers who remain in the public education system are poorly paid and feel undervalued. Teachers'
approach to students in the school varies, with both extremely positive and negative opinions voiced by
parents, with the former predominating. According to data provided by school principals, there has been no
government recruitment of teachers for years, resulting in a drastic shortage. Due to the economic crisis, some
teachers are no longer receiving their salaries, leading to a decrease in motivation among school staff, although
many teachers continue to fulfil their duties due to their sense of responsibility towards school communities.
Parents generally reported that teachers' attitudes towards their children have improved significantly in recent
years. They praised the teachers for their support and encouragement, with some teachers going above and
beyond to help students with their lessons, provide additional resources, and establish effective communication
with parents. Despite this, there were still some complaints about certain teachers' lack of effort in teaching and
occasional impolite behavior towards students, with teachers' habit of scrolling their personal mobile phones during
lessons being frequently mentioned by parents. Not allowing students to use the toilets during lessons is also a
common problem. The interviewed principals often mentioned that while the training and educational materials
provided to schools have improved the quality of education, they have also imposed an additional workload on
teachers, which not everyone is able to manage effectively.
“My daughter failed the exam and when I tried to know why, I realized that teachers during the session watch
movies and use their mobiles all the time.” (parent)
“Teachers treat our children like they were their own children although they are not being fairly paid.” (parent)
“My daughter started her educational journey in this school and graduated from it. I have noticed that each year,
teachers were becoming more supportive than the year before.” (parent)

“I always do meetings with school principals. One of them told me that his salary is less than 100$. How do you
expect that I would care about other’s children when I am not able to take care of my own children?” (parent)
“Schools are in a complete mess since 2019 until today. It is impossible to come back 100% to normal unless the
MEHE reconsider the salaries.”62
“Good teachers left, politically affiliated teachers will stay, and you have the fixed term teachers – it is impossible
to fire them or to hold them accountable, most of them are old-school, not aware of modern pedagogies, it is
affecting the education system.”63
Apart from access, UNICEF Lebanon’s education programme aimed to support the quality of education, a
valid objective considering the context, as confirmed both in available literature and stakeholder testimonies.
The nexus of problems in this area include: children’s low educational outcomes, evidenced e.g. in low PISA 2018
performance (see more Section 3.2.1.2); flawed practices in recruitment of teachers; missing national qualification
framework for teachers; actual low qualifications of public school teachers; as well as the low quality and outdated
curricula.64
UNICEF has supported MEHE and CERD in the development of curricula and teacher training with some
successes (see Section 3.2.1.2), although the Agency’s contribution in the quality pillar has been much lower
financially than on the access pillar (see Section 3.3.1) and was focused on cross-cutting themes, such as
inclusion and equality. The latter was visible both in curricula development and the implementation of the
dedicated Inclusive Education Pilot Project (see also Section 3.1.5).65 While representing a specific aspect of
quality education, this is highly pertinent given poor infrastructure and lacking reasonable accommodations; a gap
in resources and awareness, as well as attitudinal barriers that still affect the education sector in Lebanon and
make education an inaccessible or simply a worse experience for children with special educational needs or
disabilities (SEND). While one donor respondent claimed that this was a less urgent matter compared to enabling
access, even if a systemically valid issue,66 these types of interventions are not only relevant, but also required in
light of international human rights obligations, as expressed e.g. in the UNCRC and the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).67
Outside inclusion and equality, the work in the quality pillar (which crosses to pillar three on system-
strengthening) also concerned child protection, an issue of key importance given that violence is a
systemic problem. Children experience violence at home (which affects their right to education), but also directly
at school. Bullying is considered a key push-out factor driving vulnerable students towards school drop-out.68 The
World Bank’s Research for Results 2021 report indicates that 26% boys and 14% girls experience bullying on a
weekly basis.69 This is significantly higher than the international average, where 8% of students report experiencing
weekly bullying. UNICEF, in collaboration with the Ministries of Justice, Education, Interior, and Social Affairs,
launched a child protection policy and the MEHE endorsed the policy and initiated its roll-out in 600 public
schools.70
Regarding quality, it was not clear for some respondents what UNICEF does in this area, although
stakeholders acknowledged the increasing need to work on this pillar.71 The broad framing of UNICEF’s

work on quality – at least at a theoretical level – can be misleading. It can create expectations that the end
product will e.g. be a new and better curriculum for math, Arabic or science, quickly translating into improved
student outcomes. But, as the evaluators see it, UNICEF’s focus in the work on quality is, in fact, horizontally
focused on equality, inclusion and child protection. And while it should also eventually lead to improved student
learning outcomes, such a result is more remote. Stakeholders may feel a sense of frustration because they hold
expectations that are not warranted by UNICEF’s actual plans. If this focus on equality, inclusion and child
protection is maintained, without expansion into other areas (which are also occupied by actors more directly linked
to quality education – see Section 3.4), then UNICEF’s work would benefit from better external
communication and framing, perhaps around equality, inclusion and safety in education, rather than
quality of education. These are also aspects closely linked to sectors where UNICEF has a strong mandate,
expertise and portfolios.
From the Field:
Play and recreation
Although the evaluation did not focus on recreational activities available for children at schools,
this topic arose spontaneously during conversations with the respondents, which demonstrates how
significant this area is for parents and children. The school communities emphasized that for many children,
especially Syrian children, school is the only place where they can find relief, do sport and play. Parents
consistently appealed for the inclusion of recreational, art and outdoor activities into the school schedule. Teachers
highlighted the need for renovation and equipping playgrounds. The request to allocate funds for playgrounds and
green spaces was also voiced by the municipal authorities. Research acknowledges the importance of social
activities, including music, dance, and free play, in helping children and adults cope with trauma, which confirms
the need for relevant interventions.
“Our children are not even allowed to play in front of their house. Neighbors will go crazy if they saw them playing.”
(parent)
“All my husband’s family died in an air strike in Syria. He cries all the time, and my children were negatively
affected. This is why I am happy that they can come to school and play with their friends to forget.” (parent)
“There is no place for students to sit in the playground. The playground does not accommodate the big numbers
of students in the afternoon shift.” (principal)
“The village needs to have more public spaces, like playgrounds, so that students can play during their recess, as
part of improving their wellbeing.” (local authority representative)
“As a Syrian, I am not allowed to walk on street after 8 pm. We feel that we are in jail.” (parent)
Both desk research and stakeholder testimonies reveal multiple systemic issues within the education sector
and an overwhelming need for reforms. While LCO-EP foresaw work on system-strengthening, until 2021
the scope of this work was rather limited. The work on this pillar received new impetus with the development
of TREF. At this point, however, it appears largely concentrated on establishing a system for collecting robust and
reliable data about the education system and its participants. Lack of accurate data about the education system
poses a serious challenge which, if solved, could open the way to tacking other systemic problems. So,
UNICEF’s efforts to support MEHE in this respect respond to existing needs.
“Our data could be incredibly inaccurate. There are no points of reference to estimate the margin of error.”
(IDI 16)
Yet there are also other pressing systemic problems independent of data which could be tackled in
UNICEF’s advocacy for specific policies and legal developments, e.g. related to the surplus of schools and

teachers, teacher qualifications and recruitment, solutions for fair teacher remuneration, etc. As observed by
respondents, the humanitarian aspect of LCO-EP has seemed to dominate thus far (with financial transfers forming
the bulk of the intervention), but there is currently a strong push for development work and reform, with
stakeholders expecting results at system level. With continuing focus on humanitarian interventions, the LCO-EP
will be able to treat the symptoms, but with less influence over the underlying problems.
The context of the LCO-EP was dynamically changing while the programme was being implemented. The
evaluation shows that UNICEF’s work on education remained relevant, if not more pressing throughout
these turbulent times, which saw also the Lebanese communities becoming increasingly vulnerable and poor.
These context changes created challenges for LCO-EP, for example as many Lebanese children started moving
from private education to public education due to the crisis. As one interviewee noted:
“I wouldn’t say that something is missing, but I would say that the context has changed. Today more
Lebanese than before moved to the public system from the private because they can’t afford it anymore.
So I think the former system may not be fit for the current context.” (IDI 07)
These fluctuations have required UNICEF to adapt its actions. In this respect, TREF shifts the perspective of support
from nationality to vulnerability,72 signifying that the support is also open to vulnerable Lebanese communities. The
results of our fieldwork at school level underscore the importance of delivering support to Lebanese
children in AM shifts, but also the vulnerable Lebanese communities. This work can help relieve tensions
between the Syrian and Lebanese communities that have been revealed during school visits. As to the work
already conducted, the fieldwork suggests a need for better communication so that stakeholders, including in
particular the beneficiaries, are aware what support they already receive.

3.1.3 How relevant is the UNICEF education programme to government
priorities?
The UNICEF’s education programme is highly relevant to government priorities, at least as they are
officially framed in programming documents. For education, the latter are currently expressed in the 5-Year
General Education Plan 2021-2025. Its main objectives are reflected in three pillars, focusing on equitable access
to education, learning (quality) and governance (system strengthening). These priorities were earlier expressed in
RACE I and II. The LCO-EP was full aligned also with RACE I and RACE II, so much so that it has been
sometimes difficult for respondents in this evaluation to practically separate their reflections about these
programs. The understanding of the relations between the programs was not uniform among the consulted
UNICEF staff, which may signal a need for clearer internal communication.
However, what is aligned at the theoretical policy level may not be equally aligned when it comes to practice. For
example, the pro-refugee policy narratives reflected in programme priorities do not fully correspond to
decisions being made at the government level and the lack of political will to support integration. There is
a preference to perceive refugees as short-term guests, rather than future citizens. This is the case even when
some of the Syrian refugees have already been in Lebanon for years. Prospects of naturalization are limited,
because nationality is being transferred by parental descent only.73 Moreover, many gaps in the protection of
refugees stem from the de facto transfer of responsibility for managing the refugee policy from sovereign states to
UN agencies.74
The interviews for this evaluation suggest that the Lebanese government does not prioritize integration
of refugees.75 In this sense, the UNICEF education programme is not, and should not be, aligned with government
priorities.
“They have no intent to integrate the refugees. The government of Lebanon is very much against the
integration of Syrians. They are closing every possible door.” (IDI 13)
Interviewees reflected that the unwillingness to integrate refugee children into the Lebanese society is a
political priority connected to demographics, power sharing and sectarianism.76 The change of context in
Lebanon has made support for refugees even more difficult than in the past. The presence of a strong anti-refugee
rhetoric and the resistance of the government to integrate refugees impacted UNICEF’s work.
Interviewees pointed to a need for systemic reforms, which are currently not an element of government priorities
as decisions are not being made in this respect,77 e.g. regarding the number of teachers to be reduced or schools
to be shut down.
“There were decisions that needed to be made, that nobody took.” (IDI 16)
“The main challenges, in my view, is a lack of ownership from the government side to many initiatives and
activities which are being implemented. Lacking long term vision for the reforms in all sectors. […] I would
love us to do more at the reforms front, but you cannot do the reforms [in] the country, if the government
is not there, is not in the driving seat.” (IDI 25)

The non-agency on the part of the government when it comes to structural reforms created many issues,
but can be viewed as an area for UNICEF’s stronger work in the future, with its financial contributions into the
system working as a leverage.
3.1.4 Were the mechanisms and approaches applied in the programme
relevant for achievements of the objectives? What other
mechanisms and approaches could UNICEF have used to achieve
its programme objectives, i.e., working differently and working on
different things?
On several occasions, interviewees have praised UNICEF’s financial support to schools, students, and
vulnerable populations.
“UNICEF keeps the Lebanese education sector alive by funding operational costs that are necessary to
school functioning.” (IDI 03)
Since the start of the LCO-EP, UNICEF has subsidized enrolment, supported schools by covering their operational
costs and launched various cash assistance interventions to aid the most vulnerable groups, e.g. in covering
transportation costs. Since 2015, UNICEF has distributed fuel for winterization for more than 750 schools and has
supported (on an annual basis) up to 88,000 eligible vulnerable children with cash assistance programs to cover
school-related expenses and, thus, facilitating children’s access to education. This financial aid directly translates
into an increase in enrolment rates, which several interviewees have greeted, while also acknowledging the
corresponding sustainability challenges. Aside from sustainability concerns related to financial transfers, the
interviewees questioned the approach of basing subsidies on enrolment rather than attendance. However,
with this lesson having been learnt, TREF already proposes a solution by using a percentage increase in attendance
as one of the indicators and placing emphasis on this aspect in monitoring (see Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.1.1).
UNICEF’s flexibility in the unstable Lebanese context (COVID-19, Beirut Blast) has also allowed children and
families affected by adversities to respond quickly to these crises and prevent further disruption in their
education. For instance, during the pandemic, School-in-a-box kits were provided for NFE partners to ensure
learning continuity of the most marginalized children with no or little access to technological devices. In this sense,
UNICEF’s financial support to schools, learners, and families has definitely played a key role in augmenting
the enrolment rates. However, after the end of the programme, the school attendance rates remain very uncertain
due to the unsustainability of this scheme.
LCO-EP applied approaches to achieve a good quality education remain more questionable. Admittedly, jointly
with the CERD, UNICEF has organized multiple teachers’ training sessions and has supported the operational costs
of these, but several respondents noted the difficulty in measuring the real impact and relevance of these
training since they are hardly quantifiable and not mandatory, “such an indicator as 4000 teachers trained, for me,
it means nothing.”78 Moreover, a donor representative stated that the quality of education component was not
assessed, and no reports or data have been submitted to the international community/donor on this point.
As for the system strengthening pillar, interviewees mentioned a level of indulgence from UNICEF towards
the MEHE. In fact, there is a sense of fatigue and hopelessness from the international community/donors that a huge
amount of funds is disbursed and still more than 700,000 children in Lebanon are out of school. While important
results have been achieved, to some respondents, these are not proportionate to the funding received.
78 IDI 02.
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021

“If you look at the amount of funding that has gone into a sector and the state that is it in, I think it’s difficult
to say that we have been successful. Well, to be a bit more clear, I think we have not been successful.”
(IDI 07)
Interviewees have called for more pressure, possibly conditionality, toward the MEHE whilst stating that
UNICEF is the adequate stakeholder to exercise this pressure. Indeed, over the years of the programme’s
existence, UNICEF has developed a deep relationship with the MEHE and a sophisticated knowledge of the
Lebanese education system. The analysis under this question thus reiterates a point already made above that
UNICEF should capitalize on these assets and carefully push the MEHE and the GoL for systemic reforms to make
the education system more sustainable and self-sufficient. In this regard, TREF is going in the right direction because
it insists more on the conditionality for receiving funds.
The nuanced results of approaches applied to enhance the quality of education and system strengthening
could be explained by the fact that these pillars are not entirely under UNICEF’s management but are
strongly shared with the MEHE. In fact, several interviewees79 have pointed out that UNICEF has more say and
influence in the first pillar, i.e., access to education than in quality and system strengthening pillars which heavily
depend on the MEHE.
“UNICEF has not had a major role in reviewing the curriculum and ensuring the quality of education.” (IDI
19)
In this light, with the support of donors, UNICEF could try to better leverage its contributions to access in advocating
for systemic changes.
3.1.5 How relevant is UNICEF’s programme in addressing inherent
equity gaps – taking into consideration any disparities?
Lebanon is a country marked by a socio-culturally heterogeneous population and considerable disparities between
the said. In terms of addressing these equity gaps, in its interventions and initiatives, UNICEF has taken into
account or at least attempted to consider/address the needs of the most vulnerable groups, inter alia, Syrian
refugees and children with SEND. In fact, several interventions were specifically designed to reduce inequities.
One of the most successful initiatives in this regard was the Inclusive Education (IE) Pilot Project launched
in 2018 in 30 Lebanese Public Schools with the aim of promoting and raising awareness about the rights to an
inclusive education as well as increasing the enrollment of children with disabilities in public schools. Within the
Pilot programme – which included 30 schools – in the 2018-2019 school year, 1147 learners with different types
of disabilities were targeted. The largest percentage
Fieldwork at school level confirmed the need to consisted of children with learning difficulties (LD) – a term
focus on children with learning difficulties, encompassing such disabilities as dyslexia, attention deficit
especially speech difficulties in all schools, hyperactivity disorder, or dyspraxia – and which translates
even if the schools are not inclusive. into reading, writing, or mathematics disabilities in the
educational context. In fact, children with LD made up for
around 77% of learners with difficulties served in the IE Pilot in the 2018-2019 school year. In the 2019-2020
school year, 1547 learners were reached through the IE Project. Since then, the Program has expanded and
currently counts 60 schools.80 Besides offering an educational opportunity for children with special needs, the IE
Project also contributes to the development of long-term inclusive practices, such as assisting teachers in lesson
planning, applying adaptations to exams, providing teaching resources, and offering guidance on how to use
visuals in order to reach learners with LD in the classroom. To support teachers, each school benefited from

special educators, and five mobile teams of psychologists, psychomotor therapists, and speech therapists were
deployed to provide services to children with special needs.81 Despite the success and further expansion of the
initiative, Children with Disabilities (CWDs) remain among the most marginalized group in Lebanon.
Several interviewees82 mentioned the lack of a comprehensive nationwide educational database, including
the lack of enrollment data and disability statistics. This data gap renders it difficult to promote policy change
and initiatives for the benefit of inclusive education in the country. Moreover, as one UNICEF interviewee explained
the notion of disability remains medicalized, and there is still an important mentality shift to occur, which requires
time.83 However, the same respondent stated that the GoL is “going in the right direction and using the right
language of inclusion and not exclusion” (IDI 25).
In the context of inclusions, one interviewed donor representative voiced concerns about the funds spending and
prioritization of interventions by UNICEF.84 The respondent has pointed out that whilst the integration of CWDs in
educational settings is essential, the primary focus of UNICEF should be to get all children into schools, since
more than 700,000 are still out of the education system. This was, however, a singular opinion and other donors
expressed support for inclusion policies.
In parallel to the IE Project, UNICEF developed an Inclusive Education Policy, and currently, schools have
an obligation to enroll a minimum of 3% of CWDs in their establishment. In 2019, MEHE and UNICEF
launched a Child Protection Policy in schools to ensure a safe learning environment for all learners. The
document is a guide for teachers on how to prevent and address cases of bullying and violence in schools. An
interviewee specified that the policy is mainly targeting female students as they are less empowered to deal
with cases of violence. The respondent also highlighted that “gender stereotypes in education are multiplied by
teachers” (IDI 25). This is why jointly with the CERD, UNICEF developed a set of training materials for modules
on inclusion, gender, and gender-based violence (GBV) for teacher training programme in Lebanon (see also
Section 3.2.12). However, since “there is no mandatory training programme for teachers in Lebanon,” modules on
inclusiveness and gender-related themes are not mandatory either, which poses a problem as to their relevance,
effectiveness and impact.
Syrian children refugees are a vulnerable group affected by severe disparities. They are also the main
beneficiary group for the whole LCO-EP, as well as governmental programs. The programs allowed 200,000 Syrian
refugee children to access any form of education but Syrian refugees still face immense challenges. In 2022, 90%
of them were in need of humanitarian assistance to survive.85 There is an information gap on accessibility barriers
for girls to education, although research is currently being conducted on this issue.86
Finally, the LCO-EP also addressed the needs of populations living in extreme poverty through various cash
transfer programs one of them being the 2017 Back-To-School campaign whose goal was to guarantee access to
FE and NFE for children aged between 3 and 18.87 The campaign offered financial, operational, and logistical support
to reach children and families in the most vulnerable Lebanese districts. The evaluation confirms the increasing need
to support poor and vulnerable Lebanese children to facilitate their access to education, but also help them deal with
the psychological and social toll of consecutive crisis.

3.1.6 To what extent has UNICEF been able to adapt its programme to
changes in needs and priorities caused by changing in country
context, Covid-19, and socio economic and financial crisis?
The changing and unstable Lebanese context has been a recurring theme during evaluation interviews and across
the consulted sources.88 To face these changes and emergencies, UNICEF has shown considerable flexibility in
adjusting its activities in the country. This flexibility and adaptability to the context may be explained by the fact
that “unlike other organizations, UNICEF does not have a political agenda, and their fundamental concern is to
respond to existing needs” (IDI 21). In fact, UNICEF undertook specific activities to respond to Lebanon’s burning
needs, especially with the Beirut Blast, COVID-19, and the socioeconomic and financial crisis.
Considering the harsh socio-economic situation of the Lebanese population, which has deteriorated notably from
2019 onwards, UNICEF covered a vast majority of schools’ operational costs, including school rent,
transportation fees for pupils and teachers, teachers' salaries, and teachers’ training. Several interviewees
pinpointed the importance of this operational cost support by UNICEF, stating that this cost coverage has allowed
schools and the educational system to survive. In some instances, UNICEF also acts proactively e.g., by
developing the Learning Continuity Plan – a contingency plan in case of further teacher strikes.89 This will
ensure school continuity with courses taking place at least once or twice a week, so students are not subject to
further loss of education.
The education programme rapidly accommodated the needs of children and families following the Beirut
Blast. Indeed, UNICEF rehabilitated nine private and public schools, supported the refurbishment and
replacement of damaged furniture and laboratory equipment for 90 public schools, and purchased school supplies
for 50,000 students affected by the blast. Children and families affected by the blast were also supported financially
via the emergency cash transfer programme designed to assist households in priority areas that had at least one
member from a vulnerable group, i.e., children, persons with disability, female-headed households, pregnant
women and persons above the age of 70. Apart from the financial aid per se, children were provided with
psychological assistance through PSS and well-being activities.
From the Field:
PSS counsellors
The presence and effectiveness of PSS counsellors varied across the schools evaluated, with a
clear need for extending this support to all shifts to ensure students' mental well-being and emotional
development. In some schools, PSS counsellors were present, referring children to specialized services and
playing a crucial role in improving students' mental well-being and self-esteem. Students felt safe and supported,
making it easier for teachers to engage with them effectively. However, in many schools, either there were no
specialized PSS counsellors or PSS services, or the school staff (especially directors) lacked awareness of their
existence. In general, no counselling was available in the morning shift, in line with the programme design. The
absence of PSS counsellors in the morning shift raised concerns about the lack of psychological support for
students, especially Lebanese children, who face challenging living environments. Many participants
recommended the need for PSS counsellors in both shifts.
When the COVID-19 pandemic appeared, UNICEF once again demonstrated the flexibility of its programme
with the provision of school-in-a-box kits to NFE partners to ensure access to educational programs for
marginalized children with limited or no access to digital devices. Hygiene materials such as masks, hand
sanitizers, and bleach were also provided to all schools to ensure a safe learning environment. Moreover, jointly

with MEHE, UNICEF developed a remote learning strategy to adapt the educational system and students to online
learning.
Various stakeholders mentioned that in reacting to emergencies UNICEF focused too much on the humanitarian
interventions. By concentrating on humanitarian aid, UNICEF has limited time and resources to devote to
education-related interventions per se. The comments appear to indicate that emergency aid must be rethought
to become sustainable over the long term (see more section 3.6).
3.2 Effectiveness
3.2.1 To what extent was UNICEF support effective in achieving its
intended results, on the following levels: the overall expected
outcome of UNICEF Education programme; the contribution to the
broader education goals; results at national and regional levels, in
all areas of focus?
The programme's effectiveness is evaluated below separately for the three pillars that the LCO-EP aimed at:
enhanced access to education opportunities, improved quality of education services, and better education
systems. However, there are two overarching observations that are relevant across these areas.
Firstly, the programme operated in a highly volatile political and social climate. Numerous crises (see
Sections 1.1 and 1.2) hindered the achievement of several initial goals and necessitated the modification of others.
The programme had to adapt to the current circumstances by relinquishing certain goals and approaches and
redirecting efforts toward addressing emerging issues. This was frequently done under considerable time and
financial constraints, which affected the programme's ability to attain its intended outcomes.
Secondly, during the assessment period, UNICEF encountered significant challenges in collecting data to
precisely monitor and evaluate progress toward the established targets. There are two dimensions of this
difficulty. On the one hand, many targets set by UNICEF relied on government data, the credibility of which was
not obvious.90
“In fact, I can say it over and over again, lack of data, lack of reporting, that was the biggest problem. It
must also have been very difficult for UNICEF to work in such circumstances.” (IDI 10, Donor)
On the other hand, UNICEF itself did not design adequate monitoring tools in some areas of interventions (e.g.
with regard to the quality of teaching). The indicators chosen to track specific progress were not always optimal.
For example, even long-term targets regarding school enrolment, retention, and completion rates of non-Lebanese
students relied on numerical values (with no alternative percentage specifications), without considering that the
influx or outflow of refugees could render those numbers irrelevant (for more see also Section 3.3 on efficiency).
The analysis prepared by UNICEF in 2020 (see box below) remains relevant as of 2023.
Persistent challenges of data collection
“The MEHE does not yet have the capacity to produce cogent data trends or analysis on standard education
indicators. Currently, there are three main disparate data systems – CERD database, the School Information
Management System (SIMS) and the Compiler – that produce independent datasets of varying credibility. The
MEHE – through the S2R2 programme91 – has committed to producing an Information Management Strategy
2019-2021 as an effort for a clear way forward on quality data collection and analysis to inform evidence-based

programming and policies92. However, the MEHE is unable yet to structure or enforce a national data management
and analysis framework that predictably reports on the health of the public education system, its teaching corps,
or its students. This gap disallows meaningful or incisive investments into the public education system, because
there is no clear evidence-based diagnosis of the root issues that need to be sustainably addressed. For example,
basic datasets on the gender disaggregation of children enrolled in the public education system is not readily
available; the same stands for trends on retention, drop-out, or learning outcomes. Similarly, the MEHE has not
yet produced a historic accounting of the build of its teaching corps (their qualifications, training needs, teaching
profiles), or the overall condition of their public-school premises, to name a few”.
Source: Data management analysis, UNICEF internal document
Despite these challenges, based on data collected by the research team, including interviews with key
stakeholders, it is possible to provide an initial evaluation of the effectiveness of UNICEF's interventions on broad
educational goals in key areas of focus.
TREF: Comprehensive and reliable data
Since 2021, UNICEF has gradually strengthened its position vis-à-vis MEHE, devoting more efforts to verifying
official data and operationalizing national data management systems.93 However, many of these efforts have not
yet yielded the expected results due to the growing problems with access to electricity in the country and the lack
of functioning servers and internet networks.
TREF places a remarkable emphasis on effective data collection, recognizing information management for
evidence-based policy formulation and decision-making as one of the programme priorities,94 which is definitely a
step in the right direction.
3.2.1.1 Access to education
The analyzed data and IDIs clearly show that MEHE-UNICEF partnership has been instrumental in
guaranteeing access to education for many vulnerable children in Lebanon. In the period under the
evaluation, a growing proportion of the Lebanese and influx populations become vulnerable, which has significantly
increased the demand for support from UNICEF and its partners, during the programme period.
“UNICEF played an important role in ensuring that we do provide formal education […] They are the best
placed actor to work with the government. Whereas civil society can do more service delivery on the non-
formal education side.” (IDI 07, Donor)
The programme's outcomes on access to education for Syrian refugees are particularly worth
acknowledging. Quantitative data and interviews with respondents suggest that UNICEF’s intervention can be
linked to a reduction in the number of non-Lebanese children who remain out of school. In 2015, as many as 49%
of non-Lebanese children (of whom 90% were refugees from Syria95) aged 6-14 were not enrolled in schools.96
Only four years later, in 2019, the proportion of Syrian refugee children outside the education system was at a
historic low at 31%.97 However, while the COVID-19 pandemic caused a slight increase in the number of non-
Lebanese children out of school (up to 33% of Syrian children), the Beirut blast and the subsequent financial crisis

have almost completely cancelled the progress in this field, with 47% of Syrian children again out of school in
2021.98
“In terms of numbers, 200,000 Syrian children in schools is no doubt a success. If it wasn't for the UNICEF
programme, we wouldn't have that for sure, because the Lebanese government feels no responsibility
even to school Lebanese children. […] And I have to say frankly that things are getting worse and worse
in this respect [regarding government]. There is more and more anti-immigrant rhetoric. And in terms of
what is not a success is that there is still a huge and growing number of refugee children out of school.”99

“Syrian refugee students enrolment in public schools was the UNICEF’s main achievement.”100 (IDI 03,

The table below presents enrolment rates for non-Lebanese children in 2021 compared to the final RACE II targets.
The data shows that in the initial years of the programme, the number of enrolled children grew rapidly (children
who started their education in 2016-2019 are currently in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, with each cycle comprising three
grades or three years of schooling). However, this trend was disrupted in the 2019/2020 school year due to the
outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent socio-economic crises. As a result, the number of non-Lebanese children
in Cycle 1 is significantly lower than the (very ambitious) projections. The target for pre-primary education was
also not achieved.

Since its inception, the LCO has also had a strong focus on Lebanese children. In the face of increasing challenges
in providing education for children by Lebanese citizens, support for this group has steadily increased. An
additional motivation for UNICEF’s increased assistance to Lebanese children was the desire to mitigate tensions
between the majority and minority communities that could arise if support for the latter was perceived to be
disproportionately high.102 However, success in this regard was limited (see more in the box 'From the field:
National tensions'). Increased focus on Lebanese children coupled with a significant influx of Lebanese students
from private to public schools resulted in exceeding the key targets for this population for 2021, as set out in RACE
II.

Table 4 below presents the annual programme effectiveness regarding access to education, as per the targets set
in the annual MEHE-UNICEF work plans. Unlike the rigid objective of RACE II, these targets could be adjusted to
best respond to developments in the current socio-economic situation in the country. Particular attention should
be paid to the increase in the number of Lebanese children enrolled in public schools, which was caused by
Lebanese families losing the ability to finance their children's private education. The table also indicates a sharp
decline in the enrolment of non-Lebanese children due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent financial crisis.

Although overall increasing children's enrolment (or maintaining it at a steady level during crisis situations) in
Lebanon represents an undisputable success for UNICEF, there are concerns as to whether this is the most
effective indicator of children's participation in the education system.107 These concerns were around enrolment of

children in multiple schools and the fact that enrolment does not equal attendance and does not account for drop-
out. This is on top of lacking reliable governmental data on enrolment. UNICEF, responsive to donors' requests,
has recently started exploring other indicators such as the rate of participation during the school year, which should
be considered commendable.
“UNICEF had an ongoing problem with extracting data from the government. MEHE supposedly had some
kind of an information management system that they used to track student attendance. But how that
system was used was very inconsistent. Overall, there was a very strong focus on enrolment rates. And
much less on the actual attendance of children in schools. We were concerned that these numbers could
be inflated. But I don't think it was UNICEF's fault, they tried to do as much as possible to get additional
data, over the years.” (IDI 11)
TREF: Focus on attendance
TREF includes a percentage increase in the attendance rate in public schools for both Lebanese and non-
Lebanese students as one of the outcome indicators of the program. This represents a significant development
compared to the RACE II log frame, which primarily focused on enrolment rates. Within TREF, attendance will
be monitored using SIMS Quarterly Attendance Reports and TP Monitoring.
Access to education was facilitated mainly through the partial or full subsidization of registration fees for public
formal education and education-related costs. Available data shows that UNICEF partially achieved its targets in
this area. In particular, the programme aimed to provide partial or full subsidization of registration fees for Lebanese
children, with a RACE II target of 149,831 beneficiaries. The actual number of individuals supported exceeded this
number with 272,515 children receiving assistance. For non-Lebanese children, the target was 251,474
beneficiaries. However, the actual number of individuals supported was significantly lower, with only 191,398
children being assisted. The differences in the number of beneficiaries may be attributed to the expansion of
UNICEF's support to a larger number of Lebanese children (without a significant increase in its aid budget) and
many non-Lebanese children dropping out of education due to the financial crisis starting in 2021.
During the given period, the primary means of subsidizing education-related costs was through the coverage of
transportation expenses, with the aim of supporting half of all students. However, this form of assistance fell
significantly short of its target, only reaching 27,000 students in 2021, against the planned 88,600 students.108
Available data does not indicate the causes of this underachievement. It can be assumed that this is due, on the
one hand, to the long period of school closures and the lack of necessity/possibility to commute to schools, and
on the other hand, to the decreased demand for education during the crisis among the most vulnerable populations
who relied on transportation subsidies.
From the Field:
Transportation
Serious safety concerns and high costs regarding school transportation were one of the most
hotly discussed issues during conversations with school communities in all eight visited locations. Transportation
fees pose a significant barrier to education for many students, both Lebanese and non-Lebanese. Some children
have to walk long distances, even in unfavorable weather conditions, to reach school, while others resort to risky
means like tuk-tuks. Although there is a provision of transportation fees for selected families, many parents still
struggle to afford these expenses, leading to concerns about their children's safety. Some children are registered
for buses, but overcrowding is a serious issue. The lack of safe and affordable transportation options forces some

parents to make difficult decisions, such as not sending their child to school every day. Addressing this challenge
is crucial to ensure equitable access to education and improve the overall well-being of students and their families.
“The bus driver put my children on the roof of the bus because the bus was too small to capacitate all the children.”
(parent)
“During winter, we feel afraid when our children come back alone.” (parent)
“Some of my students come on tuk-tuk and this is extremely dangerous.” (principal)
The distribution of free textbooks should be considered a considerable success, with paperback copies
delivered to 506,398 students in 2021, including 150,620 in the second shift. However, in the last year, educational
materials have ceased to be provided, as noted in all locations visited by fieldwork. UNICEF also supported the
delivery of fuel to winterize more than 700 public schools (slightly less than the 880 targeted).109
From the Field:
Books and stationery
The provision of books and stationery by UNICEF was one of the most appreciated forms of aid
by all beneficiaries interviewed. This in-kind support significantly alleviated financial burdens on schools and
families and may have significantly contributed to educational outcomes. However, over the last year, the provision
of necessary materials was lacking, resulting in significant challenges for visited schools and their students. The
absence of books forced schools to print materials independently, incurring significant expenses for ink, paper,
and maintenance of printing machines. Poor quality or complete lack of educational aids significantly lowered
students' learning experiences. During discussions at all eight visited schools, the topic of books and stationary
was consistently raised by various groups of respondents (directors, teachers, and parents), highlighting the
importance of this kind of aid in education. Ongoing support in this domain is crucial to address beneficiaries’
needs and ensure that students have access to necessary learning materials, enabling schools to fulfil their
educational responsibilities effectively.
“I ask UNICEF to pay money for books. Next year, there will be no books at all.” (teacher)
In 2022, UNICEF initiated the design phase for the rehabilitation of 120 public schools. Among these, rehabilitation
work has already begun in 27 schools. Furthermore, there are plans to construct four new schools, with contracts
already signed for three of them and the fourth currently being evaluated through a tender process. The
construction of these schools is projected to be completed by mid-2024, and the final handover is expected to take
place in mid-2025.110 The delayed start of intervention in this area partly stems from the long waiting time to receive
the list of schools in need of renovation from MEHE.111 Construction works, in turn, were delayed by challenges
related to obtaining multi-stage building permits. Among the respondents, there were suspicions that granting
permission for the construction of schools depended on providing local authorities with financial benefits, which
contradicted UNICEF's operating procedures.
“In comparison, the problem was building schools. It was not possible to acquire public land. Renovations
went ok, but only designs were prepared for construction. There was a lot of corruption.” (IDI 18)

From the Field:
Renovation works
Almost all school communities visited highly appreciated the renovation work commissioned
by UNICEF, especially the improvements made to the bathrooms and the overall enhancement of WASH
standards. UNICEF's efforts have been seen as instrumental in upgrading the school's facilities and providing
essential resources. Teachers and students (as reported by the participating adult respondents) expressed relief
and satisfaction, as the cleaner and upgraded learning environment contributed positively to their overall well-
being and learning experience. Despite the overall positive impact of UNICEF's renovation projects, there have
been some concerns raised regarding the quality of past renovations and certain ongoing maintenance issues.
Reports of poisoning incidents related to the burning of old paint from walls by one of the contractors are particularly
alarming. In other instances, work was carried out using poor-quality materials, leading to rapid leakages. These
issues highlight the importance of addressing any shortcomings to ensure that future renovation initiatives maintain
high-quality standards and result in sustainable improvements for the school community.
“I once visited a school that was renovated by UNICEF in Tripoli, and I could easily see the happiness in the
school.” (local authority representative)
The Covid-19 response
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the educational opportunities of children in Lebanon. The
restrictions imposed by the government to contain the spread of the virus have disrupted the normal functioning
of schools. These extended closures have disrupted the learning process and created difficulties for students,
parents, and educators alike. The lack of access to in-person education has necessitated the implementation of
alternative learning methods, such as distance learning, which has presented its own set of obstacles.
UNICEF's swift and effective action in distributing hygiene and protective materials to all public schools
has likely saved many lives in the country. These materials aimed to promote hygiene measures, including
regular handwashing, the use of protective respiratory equipment, and adequate cleaning of school premises.
Distribution occurred in phases between January and February 2022, supporting a total of 588,517 children and
53,500 school personnel over a six-month period across all public schools. Both direct observations in schools
and data from fieldwork have shown that schools have access to hygienic supplies provided by UNICEF, and this
support is highly appreciated across school communities.
The interventions aimed at facilitating remote learning for children in Lebanon encountered more
challenges. According to the MEHE Distance Learning Initiative interim report, approximately 51% of second-shift
schools implemented distance learning, although there were regional variations, ranging from 30% to around
80%.112 The data also indicated that as the grade level increased, the usage of distance learning among second-
shift students tended to rise, varying from 45% at the KG level to approximately 85% at Grade 9. Fieldwork data
indicates that school staff did not feel sufficient support in the transition to remote learning and believe that the
period of school closure was time lost for most children.
The effectiveness of remote learning was hindered by various obstacles. Firstly, electricity cuts in many areas
across Lebanon disrupted the continuity of online teaching. Moreover, the lack of a reliable internet network
and limited access to technology posed significant challenges in facilitating e-learning for students. Additionally,
untrained parents and caregivers were required to assume the role of teachers, often supporting multiple
children during the concurrent economic crisis. This shift in responsibilities placed an additional burden on families.

At the same time, the government-imposed movement restrictions which aimed at containing the spread of the
disease created obstacles for schools utilizing non-ICT modalities. Delivering remote education proved to be
particularly challenging for children with concentration difficulties, autism, and intellectual disabilities.113
UNICEF implemented numerous innovative solutions to prevent the disruption of learning within the
framework of NFE. A rapid Learning Readiness Assessment (LeaRA) was conducted in partnership with UNHCR
to evaluate 9,996 households' ability to participate in distance learning. Building upon the findings of the
assessment, UNICEF's NFE response encompassed targeted messaging and activities for children and
caregivers, with a focus on promoting health awareness, providing psychosocial support, ensuring well-being, and
fostering active engagement in learning.114 Overall, the NFE community demonstrated commendable flexibility and
adaptability during the COVID-19 emergency, enabling many children to continue their education when formal
schools had to shut down.115 Nevertheless, the problems around access to ICT infrastructure described above
have limited the effectiveness of interventions in this area as well.
From the Field:
Education during Covid-19
The effectiveness of the COVID-19 response in schools varied based on the level of support received and
the availability of resources but overall remained low. Some visited schools attempted to conduct remote
learning through online lessons, but the lack of support in providing necessary tools and technologies hindered
the success of this approach. As a result, students' academic performance was negatively affected. On the other
hand, there were schools that received direct support from UNICEF for remote learning, but the experience still
faced challenges due to the insufficient availability of electronic devices in families. Consequently, they eventually
reverted to traditional in-person learning. The overall impact of the pandemic and subsequent changes in the
education system has been substantial, with many teachers and parents expressing dissatisfaction with the
education system’s response to Covid-19. The pandemic's effects are likely to have long-term consequences on
students' educational attainment, making it crucial for further support and improvement.
3.2.1.2 Quality of education
Assessing the effectiveness of LCOs in the area of quality education is a major challenge due to serious
data gaps. The scarcity of information mainly stems from MEHE's measures taken in reaction to consecutive
crises that occurred within the education sector. With schools closed for much of the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022
school years, MEHE has suspended mandatory end-of-year examinations and allowed all students through to the
next grades. As a result, the publications of the official exam results, which were supposed to be a source of
verification for the achievement of the educational quality targets, are not available. For its part, UNICEF has not
developed indicators to gather evidence in the absence or low quality of government data.
“As far as quality education is concerned, we have never received an assessment of such interventions.
In general, it is practically impossible to assess this, given the lack of data on school outcomes shared by
MEHE.” (IDI 10, Donor)

The main data on which an assessment of the quality of teaching under LCO may be based come from the TIMSS
educational study.116 The data indicates a decline in academic achievement among Lebanese children
between 2015 and 2019, with a decrease in average scores in both mathematics and science. Specifically,
the average score in mathematics dropped from 442 points in 2015 to 429 points in 2019, and the average score
in science decreased from 398 points in 2015 to 377 points in 2019.117 The variations in students' performance are
evident in particular subject areas and cognitive domains. Lebanese students perform more poorly compared to
their peers from other countries, particularly in the subdomains of data and probability as well as algebra in
mathematics. Concerning math cognitive domains, Lebanese students achieved lower results in each category
compared to the international average and other MENA countries, except for the category of knowledge. The most
significant disparities were observed in the domains of reasoning and applying. When it comes to science content,
Lebanese students obtained the lowest scores in Earth Science and Biology in comparison to the international
average. The smallest disparities are observed in Chemistry and Physics. Similar to mathematics, students face
challenges in the science domain, particularly in Applying and Reasoning. Additionally, they encounter difficulties
in the Knowing subdomain.118
Similarly, the PISA tests,119 which also include reading, do not indicate any progress of Lebanese students
compared to 2015.120 The PISA 2018 report indicates that Lebanese students also performed considerably
poorly in reading, scoring 58 points below the MENA average and 134 points below the OECD average. In
particular, in Lebanon, only 32% of students achieved a proficiency level of at least Level 2 in reading, whereas
the OECD average stands at 77%. At the very least, these students can grasp the main idea in a moderately
lengthy text, locate information based on explicit, though sometimes complex, criteria, and can contemplate the
purpose and structure of texts when specifically instructed to do so. Approximately 40% of students in Lebanon
achieved a proficiency Level 2 or higher in mathematics, while the OECD average is 76%. These students can
independently interpret and recognize how a simple situation can be represented mathematically. For instance,
they can compare the total distance between two alternative routes or convert prices into a different currency
without requiring direct instructions. Approximately 38% of Lebanese students reached a proficiency Level 2 or
above in science, compared to the OECD average of 78%. At a minimum, these students are capable of providing
potential explanations in familiar contexts or making conclusions based on straightforward investigations.121
On the one hand, it should be noted that these alarming results were recorded prior to the prolonged closures of
schools, which began in 2019. On the other hand, the sector-specific interventions conducted by MEHE-UNICEF,
which prioritize sustainable solutions, such as teacher training (see below), may not produce immediately visible
outcomes.
116 TIMSS – Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. It is a large-scale international assessment of student achievement in
mathematics and science that has been conducted every four years since 1995. TIMSS assesses the knowledge and skills of fourth and
eighth-grade students in participating countries around the world. The study provides valuable data on educational outcomes, allowing
countries to compare their educational systems with those of other nations and identify areas of strengths and weaknesses in their
educational systems. The data from TIMSS is widely used by policymakers, educators, and researchers to make informed decisions about
education policies and practices. See: https://timss.bc.edu/.

119 PISA – Programme for International Student Assessment. It is a worldwide study conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) every three years that evaluates educational systems by assessing 15-year-old students' knowledge and
skills in reading, mathematics, and science. The PISA test is designed to measure how well students are prepared for real-life situations and
future challenges. The assessment also includes surveys of students, teachers, and school principals to gather information on the students'
backgrounds, schools, and learning environments.

RACE II also includes completion and retention rates by cycle as indicators to assess the quality of education.
Currently available information, covering the period up to the year 2020, indicates a continuous decline in
completion rates, especially in the later stages of education.122
According to UNICEF’s work plans and key stakeholder interviews, the primary method of UNICEF's
involvement in improving the quality of education was through teacher training. This approach was coherent
with MEHE's RACE II strategy. In particular, in 2017-2021 UNICEF supported CERD in creating the Teacher
Training Curriculum Model (TTCM). The five training modules available within TTCM were: (1) Teaching With
Technology, (2) Literacy Across Content, (3) Child Protection, (4) Inclusive Education and (5) Gender
Mainstreaming. The 2022 independent evaluation of TTCM confirmed the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency
of the adopted approach. Overall, 20,316 persons attended teacher training sessions and 1,386 persons attended
training sessions. The beneficiaries were mainly public school teachers (93%).123
Teacher Training Curriculum Model (TTCM)
“The TTCM was meant to provide a national theoretical backbone and a common framework for the planning of
training modules in all training centres under the Pre-service and In-service Training Bureau (PITB) in Lebanon.
The design process allowed to clearly link each module, face-to-face or online and self-paced, to a teacher
competency or competency component of the 2017 framework. A Training Management System (TMS) was also
developed for data-sharing among relevant education stakeholders (inspectors, coaches, administrators) that
supports efforts to build a coherent and uniform teachers’ professional development structure at the national level.
In its preface, the TTCM Teacher Training Handbook, describes the objectives of the TTCM project as follows: i)
to improve the quality of the training design to target the competency framework for teachers and transfer to
classroom practices, to respond to the specific needs of teachers and address attitude towards cross-cutting
themes in education; ii) to improve the capacity of the PITB to track and disseminate attainment of competency
building per teacher and attitude change towards cross cutting educational themes; iii) to improve the quality of
teacher training to address the specific needs of new teachers in the public schools system; iv) to improve the
competencies of trainers; and v) to improve the quality of training within the training centres.”

learning and practice in public schools”. UNICEF Lebanon Country Office, Lebanon
Due to the issues with access to electricity and resulting internet disruptions, it was not possible to train
teachers in all of the planned areas. In addition, electricity outages have hindered the development and
operation of the TMS, which may have significant long-term consequences for the effectiveness of the intervention.
Indeed, the participants of the trainings emphasized that re-training and regular follow-ups from the trainers are
necessary for them to maintain the acquired skills.124
The achieved outputs deserve recognition, considering the adverse external circumstances in which the
TTCM was developed and implemented. However, as pointed out by one respondent, the numerical data on the
number of trained teachers may not be an optimal indicator of improved teaching quality. In order to determine
how the acquired knowledge affects teaching practices and ultimately student knowledge, a more comprehensive
monitoring framework would be necessary, including regular school observations. However, this remains a
challenge. As highlighted in a conversation with a UNICEF respondent, the current mandate of CERD, which was

responsible for training, does not allow its staff to conduct monitoring of the effectiveness of training and teaching
performance in schools.
“We have trained many teachers. But the problem is that there are no feedback loops. The system in
Lebanon is extremely centralized. Everything happens at a central level in Beirut. So the training was
delivered by CERD in MEHE. But people in CERD don't have access to the classrooms, so it wasn't clear
how the teachers were putting the skills into practice. So, it is impossible to say whether we were
successful [in improving the quality of education].” (IDI 26)
Given the generally low qualifications of teachers in the country,125 focusing on teacher training to improve
the quality of education is generally considered a good choice. Nevertheless, it remains an open question
whether it is possible to substantially improve the quality of education without comprehensive changes in the
curriculum and teacher recruitment and retention procedures. In addition, interviews revealed that some
stakeholders expected a more evidence-based approach to the selection of interventions with regard to teachers
training.126
“In general, there is also a problem in defining what quality education was supposed to be. So far we have
no scientific evidence, no data, which interventions lead to an improvement in the quality of education.
There was teacher training, student training, there were catch-up materials distributed. And we don't know
what of it actually worked. And perhaps there are some low-hanging fruit. And I think many donors feel
that this is a black box. And Covid has added to it. For me, such an indicator as 4000 teachers overtrained,
for me it means nothing. (…) In my opinion, the main effect of teacher training is that they get paid for it
and it is some source of income for them. And that is ok, but you would have to be clear about that. And
not to claim that this has a big impact on learning improvements.” (IDI 02, Donor)
An additional issue to consider is the standardization of qualifications between tenured and contractual teachers.
According to the data, there are statistically significant disparities in the presence of educational teaching diplomas
between tenured and contractual teachers. Specifically, 25.5% of tenured teachers had the required diplomas,
while only 21.1% of contractual teachers met the same criteria.127 At the same time, tenured teachers, who are
statistically older, are perceived by some stakeholders as less receptive to modern pedagogical approaches, which
limits the effectiveness of their teaching.
“Good teachers left, politically affiliated teachers will stay, and you have the fixed term teachers – it is
impossible to fire them or to hold them accountable, most of them are old-schools, not aware of modern
pedagogies, it is affecting the education system” (IDI 29).

Teachers training*
The assessment of the training provided for teachers, as reported by principals and teachers
themselves, yielded rather positive results, although responses in this area may have been influenced by
social desirability bias more than in other research areas.128 Most principals have seen the training’s
effectiveness as dependent on the teacher's willingness to implement the new approaches in the classroom. The
majority of teachers expressed positive feedback, mentioning that the training helped them become more skilled
and competent in handling their classes and interacting with students. However, there were also concerns raised

128 Since teachers often receive allowances and other incentives related to their participation in training, it can be suspected that they have
an interest in describing the pieces of training as extremely useful and emphasize the need for their continuation.

about the effectiveness of some training, with a few teachers refusing to attend, while others felt that the training
was not valuable enough or lacked practical hands-on elements. Particularly criticized were the organization of
some trainings on days off from work and the timing of the trainings not aligning with the school year schedule.
“UNICEF program was by itself a motivation for teachers to improve and upgrade their performance.” (principal)
With bullying being a key push-out factor driving vulnerable students towards school drop-out129 (see also Sections
1.2.1 and 3.1.), it is particularly significant that the Child Protection training module was developed as the
first component of TTCM and was completed by the largest number of participating teachers (4,591
teachers).130 Furthermore, classroom observations and KIIs conducted as part of the TTCM evaluation indicated
that teachers were applying the knowledge gained from the module in their interactions with students.131
From the Field:
Peer violence
The issue of violence in Lebanese schools is a matter of concern, as highlighted by various
parental, teacher and local authorities’ accounts. While some parents believe the school to be a safe place for
their children, instances of bullying and violence have been reported. The level of violence in the second shift is
particularly alarming, as reported by school staff, with frequent fights resulting in even severe health damage.
Children with learning difficulties are believed to be more vulnerable to violent behaviors than their peers. The
presence of PSS counsellors and teacher support has contributed to some positive changes, but incidents of
violence and theft continue to occur during classes. Additionally, external factors such, as safety concerns in the
community, restrict children's activities beyond school hours, especially in border regions. One respondent
suggested that a lack of playing spaces and recreational activities increases the level of aggression in children.
Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach, involving teachers, parents, and the wider community to
create a safe learning environment.
“My daughter is constantly bullied by her peers because she has speech problems. Although her teachers support
her, but this is not enough.” (parent)
“The psychological effects of moving a student from a private school to a public school should not be
underestimated, since those children are being bullied by their peers.” (local authority representative)
“In the second shift, students bring daggers with them to the classroom because they fight with each other after
the school. Every year, we collect a box with daggers and knives. There is violence in the second shift.” (principal)
In May 2018, MEHE and UNICEF jointly launched the Policy for the Protection of Students in the School
Environment, building on a successful pilot programme that was implemented in 20 public schools. In the
following years, UNICEF provided ongoing support to MEHE in implementing the Action Plan for the roll-out of the
Child Protection Policy (however, work on the document has been suspended and deprioritized by MEHE) and
guidelines for mainstreaming GBV in public schools.132 The aim was to expand the coverage of the Child Protection
Policy to 600 schools. As a result of political instability and school closures resulting from COVID-19, interventions
were implemented in a total of 435 schools throughout the country by the end of 2020, as opposed to the planned
735 schools in RACE II.133 Other notable achievements include the development of internal and external referral
pathways, the establishment of a special unit dedicated to addressing child protection violations identified in
129 R4R 2021.

schools, and the release of Guidelines for School Counsellors on Basic Skills for Psycho-Social Support. However,
data is missing on the percentage of cases of violence involving students in need of case management who have
been safely referred to the appropriate services – one of key UNICEF targets in the domain of child protection.
From the Field:
Child protection
The evaluation of child protection awareness in the schools revealed significant gaps in
knowledge and implementation. In most schools, respondents appeared completely unaware of the concept
and only had a vague understanding of it after it was explained to them. The schools, in general, lack a structured
child protection mechanism, and staff members expressed uncertainty about the appropriate channels to address
child protection issues. Only in one school, was the principal aware of a teacher who attended child protection
training and knew about the hotline for reporting relevant cases. Particularly concerning was the lack of awareness
demonstrated by school principals regarding child protection mechanisms, underscoring the critical need for
comprehensive training and guidance in this essential area.
“We don’t even know with whom we should talk in case there was a child protection issue.” (principal)
“There is a referral in place – it is an email to the MEHE to refer the violent cases. It’s like a Bermuda triangle.
Nobody will ever receive the feedback.”134
3.2.1.3 System strengthening
The UNICEF’s focus on access to education, combined with the significant increase in demand for support in this
area due to the deepening financial crisis and the mass flow of students from the private to the public sector, led
to the reduction of activities in other intervention areas, including capacity-building. The decision was also
influenced by transient challenges in cooperation with MEHE and the very high turnover of ministry staff, including
frequent changes in the position of the Minister of Education.
“In terms of institutional development, a lot of the benefits may have been lost as people left [MEHE]
massively.” (IDI 10)
The lack of progress in strengthening the system is consistently mentioned by both UNICEF and MEHE staff. The
latter specifically emphasized the absence of even basic skills among ministry personnel, including digital skills.135
“We didn't do anything in the system setting. I mean the things kept coming in our annual working plan
and kept being written, but nothing was done. From our side, we didn't achieve much.” (IDI 27)
Having said this, it needs to be pointed out that UNICEF has provided MEHE with valuable insights regarding
crucial areas in the education sector to enhance evidence-based decision-making. The partnership between
UNICEF and MEHE has resulted in the development of critical policy frameworks and actionable plans aimed at
creating inclusive, effective, and safe educational environments for all children. It is now largely up to MEHE to
breathe life into the formulated policies and take action accordingly.
Although UNICEF's actions in the area of system strengthening did not yield expected results, it is important to
consider the factors that contributed to the lack of relevant outcomes. The Lebanese government has long

struggled with irregularities in the allocation of resources and ineffective governance.136 Creating a parallel system
consisting of external staff (PMU) who would efficiently manage the crisis response may have seemed a rational
choice for an intervention that initially had a mainly humanitarian and short-term character. However, as the crisis
progressed, this approach should have been re-evaluated in favor of handing over the management duties to
MEHE, with UNICEF experts working as shadows rather than main programme managers.
Based on the information provided, there is a widespread agreement among the respondents regarding the
effectiveness of TREF in accurately defining the challenges encountered and suggesting suitable solutions to
address them. There is a strong belief that TREF holds significant potential for enhancing the overall
education system and fostering improved collaboration between MEHE and UNICEF. The research team
appreciates UNICEF’s proactive approach in this regard, as a vast number of recommendations voiced by various
stakeholders during the evaluation interviews have already been anticipated and incorporated into TREF.
TREF: Clear priorities
TREF represents a step forward in acknowledging that limited resources and the growing needs of the local
population and refugees in Lebanon prevent effective intervention in all desired areas. Consequently, TREF
incorporates a well-considered task prioritization and communicates it effectively.
Out of the six priority areas outlined in the 5-year plan, TREF will primarily focus on two priority areas during the
periods of 2021-2022 and 2022-2023. These priority areas include improving enrollment and retention of
vulnerable groups and supporting programs towards a positive and safe educational ecosystem. These priority
areas involve enhancing enrollment and retention of vulnerable groups, as well as supporting programs aimed at
establishing a positive and secure educational ecosystem, which broadly corresponds to the areas of access and
system strengthening within the RACE II framework. Simultaneously, actions in the field of quality education are
deprioritized.
The interviews conducted indicate that TREF has accurately diagnosed the most important capacity-building
needs of MEHE. For example, one of the specific deliverables of TREF is the Transition Plan from a project-based
IT function to a fully institutionalized IT department, which is one of the needs identified by the research team
through discussions with ministry staff.
3.2.2 Was the UNICEF programme implemented as originally planned in
the Programme Strategy Notes (PSN)? To what extent the initial
assumptions were followed?
During the evaluation period, UNICEF undertook a significant part of the planned activities as per the
Programme Strategy Notes. While a detailed description of outputs and outcomes of particular initiatives was
provided under the previous question, the table below presents an overview of the key anticipated interventions

3.2.3 What unintended consequences or effects did UNICEF support to
the education programme have, both positive and negative?
In order to ensure access to as many Lebanese residents as possible, UNICEF had to make many difficult strategic
decisions. One of those was determining the scope of cooperation with the Lebanese government. UNICEF chose
to collaborate closely with the Lebanese MEHE in order to avoid creating a parallel and unsustainable education
sector. The decision, however, involved certain trade-offs. This section will discuss two unintended consequences
of implementing the LCO-EP according to the conditions set by the government in the country. This includes, first,
the reinforcement of segregation due to directing the majority of Syrian students to second shift classes and second
the exclusion of many out-of-school children from the NFE system due to strict admission criteria.
The second shift schools in Lebanese public schools were established by MEHE in 2013 in response to the
growing number of Syrian refugees who had fled to Lebanon due to the Syrian civil war and limited capacity of the
education system to absorb new students. These second shift schools are regular schools that offer classes to
Syrian refugees in the afternoon or evening, after the regular classes for Lebanese students are finished.
Three key differences between the first and second shift schools are as follows:
• While in first shift schools the teaching day averages 6 hours, it is a maximum of 4 hours in second shift
schools.
• The majority of teachers in first shift schools have permanent contracts whereas in the second shift schools
they are hired on a contractual/temporary basis.
• Slight curriculum adaptations were made in second shift schools, including removal of some extra-
curricular activities, such as sports and music.152

“The Lebanese Ministry of Education and Higher Education separated Syrian students from their Lebanese peers
in school by introducing the evening education system, which played a major role in reinforcing racist ideas and
imposing greater difficulties on Syrian students trying to integrate into countries of asylum.
This system also deprived many students of education, as most Syrians prefer to enroll their children in the morning
shift, considering the teachers in the evening shift as “contractors,” that is, they do not possess educational skills.
The evening teaching shift extends for four hours, from two in the afternoon until six in the evening, without rest
times for students, which weakens the quality of education and the ability of students to receive information”.
Source: Jana al-Issa, Hassan Ibrahim, Lujain Mourad, Syrian children subject to “discriminatory” education in
Lebanon, 21 December 2022, Enab Balabi (one of the most prominent Syrian nonprofit media organization)
The interviewed stakeholders expressed mixed opinions about the inclusion of Syrian refugees in the
second shift schools, with the majority acknowledging it as a necessary trade-off to provide them with
access to education. It has also been noted that teaching in the second shift schools may still be a positive
development compared to the in-camp education provided to Palestinian refugees.153
“We did secure an agreement from the Government of Lebanon for Syrian children to receive education
in public education facilities, even if it is the second shift. Of course, this is a bit sectarian. But it still got
the job done.” (IDI 10)
Several interviewees noted the presence of strong (and growing) anti-refugee rhetoric and the resistance
of the government to integrate refugees. In this light they considered the existence of the second shift schools
a success.154 Still, UNICEF should pay special attention to further investigating the social consequences of this
segregation of the sector.
“They have no intention to integrate the refugees. The government of Lebanon is very much against the
integration of Syrians. They are closing every possible door. So what we have in education is actually a
huge success; that we still have children in the first shift; that they are going to the second shift; that they
are taught by the Lebanese; that, you know, they go through a curriculum that is recognized. […] So that’s
a huge success if you look at the general policy.” (IDI 13)
The percentage of immigrants, including displaced and refugee populations, in the PISA sample was relatively
small, accounting for only 6%. These immigrant students scored 51 points lower than non-immigrant students in
reading, indicating a significant difference in their academic performance. It is worth noting that first-shift students
consistently outperformed second-shift students across all grades and subjects, except for math in English,
suggesting that the learning environment for non-Lebanese students is far from optimal.155
Nevertheless, as one of the respondents highlighted, excessive pressure on the government regarding the
inclusion of Syrian children in mainstream education could potentially lead to an adverse outcome, such as
increasing hostility from the government and the Lebanese population towards refugees.
“The political question is prevalent - how much you can push for integration in Lebanon – public education
is an example of how we achieved local integration in a way, but pushing things further would be risky.
We need to be practical and realistic about what we can push for and what we can achieve.” (IDI 11)

National tensions
The issue of national tensions is evident in the community, with numerous respondents at
various levels expressing frustration and resentment towards UNICEF's support for the school, which they
believe is primarily directed towards Syrian students. There are concerns about unequal treatment and
discriminatory practices, as some parents and teachers feel that Syrian students receive more support and
resources compared to their Lebanese counterparts. The sense of discrimination against the Lebanese population
is also widespread among local authorities. This perception has led to high level of animosity among community
members who question the reasons behind the preferential treatment. On the other hand, one principal interviewed
highlighted that UNICEF's support has been crucial in ensuring the smooth functioning of both shifts and providing
necessary resources for the students. Another respondent admitted that she was facing challenges in the initial
behaviour of Syrian students, but now she can see examples of successful integration and acceptance among
students from different backgrounds. However, the issue of national tensions remains sensitive and requires
careful attention to promote inclusivity and equality in the school community.
“UNICEF provided 20 $ for the Lebanese students in the first grade only, however, they supported all the grades
for the Syrian students. Why this discrimination! Syrians live on our lands. Why they are being treated better. We
are the hosts!” (principal)
““UNICEF will never consider supporting a Lebanese school if it has no Syrians learning in it.” (local civil society)
“You are stupid people. You don’t think. This is what my son hears from the teachers.” (parent)
“Syrian children were receiving all the support during the strike and the school closures, Save the children, URDA,
LOST... We’re providing Syrian children with lessons and excluding the Lebanese children.” (parent)
“The perception of the teachers had changed. They became more aware that not all Syrians are illiterate and live
in a tent.” (parent)
“We are demanding now from NGOs to target 50% Lebanese and 50% Syrians in any of their project to avoid
conflicts and reinforce peaceful coexistence.” (local authority representative)
A visit to one school points to possible mistreatment of Syrian students by second-shift teachers, which the
evaluation team communicated to UNICEF.
Despite the efforts to facilitate access to FE for all children in Lebanon, the number of out-of-school children
remains high. For UNICEF, supporting this group was of utmost importance and the agency has devoted a lot of
attention and resources to supporting NFE interventions in the country. In this area as well, UNICEF and MEHE
established cooperation. As a consequence, it was necessary to adjust some of the NFE programme rules to meet
the Ministry's demands. On the one hand, this resulted in the standardization of NFE programs and, in some
cases, an increase in their quality. On the other hand, the reviewed approach limited the grassroots activities of
NGOs in this area, depriving many children of access to new interventions that were subject to stricter entry
requirements and, in some cases, further impeded access to FE for non-Lebanese students.156 In particular, one
interviewee pointed out that if NFE were not "formalized," more children could participate in relevant activities,
even if they were conducted under challenging conditions (in tents, overcrowded spaces, etc.).157
“The access [to NFE] was more successful than the impact but not successful 100% because it left a lot
of children behind. The number of children that were accepted in this programme was very little because
of the rigidity. So maybe if this programme was not there, more children would have been in a safe
environment”. (IDI 27)

In addition, it should be noted that NFE programs are exclusively available to children who are not Lebanese
nationals. Although there is the increasing number of Lebanese children who are experiencing challenges in
obtaining education, they are not eligible for relevant opportunities, despite being theoretically covered by the NFE
National Strategy.158
Tough route to NFE
“The [NFE] policy was launched to sustain increased and equitable access to quality education for all children
aged 3 to 18 in Lebanon. Unfortunately, there are many children who are not able to access these programmes
as there are very rigid entry requirements and children have to fit a tightly defined profile. Vulnerable Lebanese
children who are out of school do not have access to NFE programmes. Children need to have been out of learning
for two years before entering the NFE system. Since 2019 when the last ALP was offered, there has been no way
to access NFE if a child is aged between 7.5 – 10 years with no prior learning. Additionally, although this is not
part of the RACE strategy, a child cannot enter FE after successfully completing a BLN level unless they have also
completed a round of the government’s defined ALP.”
Source: “Alawi, R., Gebara, J., Wallace, C., Abillama, F. (2021) Non-Formal Education Assessment in Lebanon:
Final Report, PROMAN, 13 October 2021.
A regularly cited example of such problematic development was the introduction of the ALP by the PMU as a
school-based, informal program that BLN graduates had to complete as an additional requirement before
accessing formal education. However, since there were not enough places available in the ALP, a significant
number of children who could have enrolled in schools after completing BLN were ultimately deprived of this
opportunity due to not obtaining the ALP certificate. It is possible that political factors and the government's
reluctance to facilitate Syrian children's access to and integration into educational opportunities in the country may
have also played a role in such a structured NFE system.159 This observation is also confirmed by the NFE
assessment.160
3.2.4 In what ways and to what extent has the UNICEF education
programming integrated an equity-based approach into the
design and implementation during the implementation?
UNICEF LCO-EP was established with the aim of increasing learning opportunities for all children in Lebanon, with
a special focus on populations at risk of social and economic exclusion. This group includes in particular non-
Lebanese children, of whom approximately 90% are Syrian.161 The programme was designed to be well-aligned
with the LCRP,162 whose aim was to provide a coordinated and effective response to the humanitarian crisis in
Lebanon, particularly in relation to the influx of Syrian refugees and the impact of the Syrian conflict on the
Lebanese population.
Due to subsequent crises that increasingly affected Lebanese citizens, the programme’s scope expanded to cover
the growing number of Lebanese children who were facing serious challenges in continuing their education. In
addition to the obvious benefit of facilitating access to learning opportunities for more children, this widening focus
may also have had a positive result in terms of reducing tension between the Lebanese population and refugees

who were perceived as unfairly privileged in receiving international support.163 It should be acknowledged that
UNICEF's flexibility in this case made the programme more equitable.
Another group that was given particular attention in LCO-EP was children with disabilities (CWD). Before 2016,
Lebanon did not have effective inclusive education policies and infrastructure that could support the needs and
ensure equal access to education of these children. Moreover, there was a lack of awareness and understanding
of the needs of CWD in the broader community, which led to systemic discrimination.164 To ensure that CWD have
full access to learning opportunities, UNICEF developed and supported the implementation of the Inclusive School
Pilot in partnership with MEHE. The student body in Inclusive Schools was to include 10% of children with
disabilities. In addition, students with special needs were also to be equipped with assistive devices and learning
supplies that would enable them to learn and take exams. Besides, UNICEF aimed to support MEHE in the
development of disability-inclusive policies, in close cooperation with selected Lebanese municipalities.165
Overall, the programme approach recognized that different groups of children may have different needs,
capacities, and barriers to accessing learning opportunities, and sought to ensure that every child has an equal
chance to develop and reach their full potential. Within the programme, the needs and rights of marginalized or
socially disadvantaged groups were given priority, and efforts were made to reduce or eliminate existing disparities.
3.2.5 Does the UNICEF education programming actively contribute to
the promotion of the right to education, especially for the most
vulnerable?
Successes and challenges regarding the inclusion of non-Lebanese children in education were discussed in
previous sections (see especially Section 3.2.1). The answer to this research question will thus focus primarily on
promoting the right to education for children with disabilities.
The inclusion of children with disabilities (CWD) in public education and the transformation of teachers'
attitudes towards CWD are among the most notable achievements of UNICEF's work in Lebanon. Although
access to education for CWD in Lebanon remains a challenge, many improvements have been made over the
period under evaluation. Stakeholders interviewed noted that the right to education for CWD has been successfully
mainstreamed in the MEHE agenda.166 In particular, the Inclusive Education Policy draft and the National Action
Plan on Inclusion were developed. Additionally, the training programs, including the TTCM, took into account
developing teachers’ capacities to become qualified to work with CWD.
A key step towards promoting the right to education for CWD was the design and launch of the Inclusive
Schools Pilot in 2018. The pilot programme focuses on enhancing the capacity of teachers, school staff, and
education professionals to provide quality education to CWD in regular classrooms. It also aims to raise awareness
and change attitudes towards disability and inclusion in society. As of scholastic year 2022/2023, the programme
is operational in 88 schools, which is almost in line with the earlier targets (90 schools).
In 2021, UNICEF commissioned an evaluation of the Inclusive Schools Pilot. The following findings deserve special
attention:
 Students with disabilities are well-received in schools, and the prevailing atmosphere is conducive to their
development. Despite initial concerns, school communities acknowledged benefits of the inclusion of CWD in

educational settings. Parents expressed a high level of satisfaction with the services provided by the schools
and the interviewed children felt safe and accepted by peers and teachers.
 Teachers received extensive training; however, supporting students with disabilities remained a challenge for
many. In particular, there was a widespread belief among teachers that CWD were not making significant
progress in their learning. It seems that much more effort is needed to adequately prepare school staff to
accompany CWD. Special attention should also be paid to developing a shared understanding of inclusive
education and its goals.
 Management: There is no uniform practice in schools regarding the coordination of efforts aimed at supporting
students with disabilities and evaluating teachers. The level of awareness and engagement of school principals
in implementing the inclusive education agenda also varies.
 Recommendations for improvement include increasing the number of special educators, reducing class sizes,
making curricular and examination adaptations, increasing arts and sports sessions, and providing
psychological orientation and group counseling.
“As a positive practice, we form a class with both children with learning difficulties and children without
learning difficulties because those with difficulties have the right to live through the same learning
experience and get integrated in a class.” (IDI 11)
Due to limited data, it is more challenging to assess the effectiveness of inclusive policies in mainstream schools,
however the fieldwork suggests that achievements in this area are more limited, yet still appreciated by school
communities.
“In general, there is now more talk about including children with disabilities in schools. Our funds are
constantly being used to remove barriers, but as schools are closed most of the time, it is difficult to talk
about results.” (IDI 10)
From the Field:
Inclusive education for children with disabilities
The launch of the Inclusive Schools programme with UNICEF support has resulted in an
increase in the number of students with special needs attending public schools, and the interventions
designed to support them have been highly praised by school staff and parents. Teachers reported being
trained to implement individualized plans and adapt exams to cater to different learning challenges. According to
testimonies from parents, children with special needs are treated equally by teachers and receive better attention
and support compared to before the programme was introduced. Overall, the inclusive approach of the schools
has led to improvements in students' academic performance and emotional well-being, fostering a supportive and
encouraging learning environment.
In schools that were not part of the program, positive changes have also been observed in teachers' attitudes
towards students with educational difficulties. However, in terms of physical infrastructure, these schools remain
largely inaccessible to students with disabilities.
“The presence of the remedial therapist was extremely important as she designs individual plans with students.
Also, she trained teachers on how to implement activities that allow students to better obtain a skill.” (principal)
“I had a student who was not able to vocalize a complete word, now he is the best performer in the class. Teachers
and the psychologist provided him with self-confidence.” (principal)
“My son was bullied in his previous private school because he misspells the words. He hated the school. Here,
and since it is an inclusive school, his situation improved. He received support and encouragement from all his
teachers.” (parent)

3.2.6 In what ways and to what extent has the UNICEF education
programme been gender responsive or transformative?
In Lebanon, girls and boys have essentially equal access to educational opportunities. Available data and
stakeholders’ observations indicate that a similar number of girls and boys attend the first grades. The enrolment
rates in NFE are also at a similar level for both genders.167 Minor differences in access to education emerge at
later stages of education and are to the detriment of boys, who are often compelled to work to contribute to their
family's livelihood.168
Data suggests that boys tend to drop out of school earlier than girls, particularly boys from the most
impoverished families, who may start seeking employment as early as the age of 13.169 In kindergarten and
primary education up until grade 6, there is a slightly higher enrolment of boys compared to girls, regardless of the
students' nationality. However, starting from grade 7, there is a shift with more girls enrolled than boys. Overall,
there is a slightly higher enrolment of girls than boys, with girls making up 51.2% of the total enrolment from
kindergarten to grade 12 in the 2020/21 academic year. At the upper secondary level, girls constitute 60.4% of the
student body.
This disparity is also pronounced among Syrian children. In the age group of 6 to 14 years, 49% of Syrian
boys and 56% of Syrian girls were attending school.170 Among the reasons cited by caregivers of Syrian children
for not attending school, the predominant factors were the high costs of education in case of girls and the need for
a child to work in case of boys.171 In 2021, the share of Syrian girls attending primary school was higher than for
Syrian boys, while in the previous two years, it was closer to parity. For lower secondary, and particularly for upper
secondary, Syrian girls attended in larger shares than Syrian boys. For upper secondary, the share of Syrian girls
attending compared to Syrian boys (1.31 Gender Parity Index - GPI172) was higher than in 2020 and 2019 at 1.2
GPI and 0.95 GPI respectively.173
UNICEF has dedicated special attention to interventions aimed at reducing the costs of children's
education, contributing to the equalization of educational opportunities for girls and boys. These
interventions include subsidizing enrolment fees, providing cash transfers for transportation, and the provision of
free educational materials, including textbooks. This response seems to address the difficulties experienced by
both Lebanese and non-Lebanese families in ensuring education for their children of both genders. At the same
time, respondent statements suggest that due to the perceived lack of pronounced gender discrimination in access
to education, the gender aspect of the access-focused interventions was not particularly emphasized.174 As
highlighted, however, by a UNICEF representative one systemic issue which is still unsolved and requires attention
is hindered access to school for children of Lebanese mothers who do not have the Lebanese nationality. This is
due to a discriminatory nationality law which requires that the ministry each year issues a decision for this group
to be enrolled in schools. UNICEF advocated with the ministry to issue this decision, but there is a need for a more
systemic solution which would not require annual decision-making.175

From the Field:
Gender equality
All parents interviewed unanimously agreed that in Lebanon, their daughters have equal access
to educational opportunities as their sons. However, one interview revealed only that girls are afraid to attend
second shift schools because of the late time to go home and the related darkness.176 It is important to continue
monitoring and addressing any potential disparities to foster an environment where all children can thrive and
reach their full potential through quality education.
In comparison, significant attention has been given to gender-related aspects in the context of child
protection, particularly in combating violence against women and girls. In particular, UNICEF provided
ongoing support to MEHE in implementing the Action Plan for the rollout of the Child Protection Policy in public
schools. This support included the development and implementation of guidelines for mainstreaming GBV
prevention and response. In addition, a separate module in TTCM was developed on gender mainstreaming in
2019,177 which covered mitigation of GBV risks.
3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 To what extent were UNICEF activities delivered in a timely
manner, within the planned monetary resources allocated?
The implementation of the Education programme was significantly impacted by the multiple crises in
Lebanon, which limited possible progress in the sector, impacted implementation timeliness and strained
the available resources.
Nevertheless, the monetary resources allocated to the education programme were substantial, with the bulk of
funding disbursed in cooperation with MEHE. From 2018 to 2022 the funding amounted to 787.3 Mn USD, with
most of the funds allocated to Pillar I: Improved access to education opportunities – 728.9 Mn USD in total.178 The

Looking at the relative year-on-year differences in the funded amount for the three pillars, a few changes are
visible. Comparing 2019 to 2018, the funded amount decreased in each area: in Pillar I (Improved access to
education opportunities) by 16% (-26.7 Mn USD), in Pillar II (Improved quality of education services) by 15% (-1.3
Mn USD) and 5% in Pillar III (Improved education systems) (-0.14 Mn USD). 2020 brought increased allocations
for Pillar I (Improved access to education opportunities) – by 14% (+20 Mn USD) and Pillar II (Improved quality of
education services) – 18% (+1.3 Mn USD). That year the allocation for Pillar III (Improved education systems)
further decreased by 32% (-0.94 Mn USD). Allocations for each pillar decreased again in 2021: in Pillar I (Improved
access to education opportunities) by 25% (-41.2 Mn USD), in Pillar II (Improved quality of education services) by
46% (-3.9 Mn USD) and in Pillar III (Improved education systems) by 30% (-0.58 Mn USD) as compared to 2020.
Perhaps the most notable changes in allocations are visible when comparing 2022 and 2021. In the case
of Pillar III (Improved education systems) funding, which was consistently dropping from 2018 to 2021, the
allocation increased by 576%. This 7.9 Mn USD increase is still small when compared to the nominal amount
allocated to Pillar I (Improved access to education opportunities), but marks the reframing of priorities in TREF.
To a lesser – but still notable – extent, funding allocated to Pillar II (Improved quality of education services) also
increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 by 138% (+6.4 Mn USD). In the same timeframe, the allocation for
Pillar I (Improved access to education opportunities) increased by 14% (+16.5 Mn USD).

allowed more and more children to be reached and the number of out of school children decreased.179 However,
since 2019 there have been considerable disruptions in schooling, with teachers going on strike and schools being
closed. The crashing economy caused teachers to be unable to afford fuel necessary to physically get to the
schools, which negatively affected the programme activities, despite the available funding.180
This evaluation identified stakeholder concerns about the funding model used until 2021, which was based
on unit cost and relied on data that could not be verified. The difficulty in assessing the baseline values for
indicators and unit cost became particularly problematic as the economic crisis began and became more severe.
Interviewees highlighted that the model lacked in transparency, control and accountability, leading to doubts about
the efficiency of support and perceived mismatch between the size of funding and effects. In the words of one
interviewee:
“You had 707,000 children, mostly Syrians, who are out of school and not learning. So either they dropped
out or never had seen inside the classroom. So really on that basis alone, the programme isn't fit for
purpose because you have quite a large number proportionate to the population who are out of school
and in particular like having 400 and some thousand Syrian children out of school and not learning when
the international community had invested hundreds of millions in the system. That is the biggest indicator
of something not being right.” (IDI 17)
However, it should be noted that the TREF modality includes development of a new costing methodology,
and interviewees have voiced optimism with regard to its transparency and reliability.
3.3.2 Did UNICEF have appropriate structures, and adequate resources
(technical and financial) to deliver its education programme? If
there were any lack/problem in resources/capacity, how was this
addressed?
Support to education of Syrian refugees under RACE II was managed by the Programme Management Unit
(PMU), which functioned within MEHE. The interventions related to the Lebanese children were, in turn, managed
by the MEHE’s Directorate General. While the adoption of this model was agreed with the Donors, this evaluation
found that it was not working optimally for all stakeholders because of issues linked to duplication of
structures and centralization of functions.
“It’s not only a responsibility of UNICEF but also partners, we’ve been having a system from 2013 to
2021 which has been very biased and weak in terms of controls, accountability. The (education) system
in place until 2021 had several deficiencies and weaknesses in terms of governance, monitoring, data
collection, financial monitoring, transparency, cost efficiency.” (IDI 01)
In terms of UNICEF’s human resources, interviewees noted that a high turnover in positions hindered efficient
delivery of the education programme.181 In fact, this issue proved a limitation to this evaluation, hindering access
to information about the early years of LCO-EP implementation.
In response to challenges, in 2020 UNICEF, MEHE and Donors created the Assurance Working Group as a
platform that would conceptualize an improved modality supporting education. The resulting TREF was
formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2022. Aside from changes in the programmatic
structure, the modality represents a shift in UNICEF’s resource management and the model of fund
distribution aimed at increasing efficiency.

Within the LCO, the response involved restructuring the section responsible for education, and a stabilization
of human resources. In the current setup, the education section is headed by the Chief of Education, with 22 full-
time employees as well as consultants based in Beirut and eight field offices.182 Under TREF, UNICEF aims to
work more directly with MEHE, strengthening the latter’s capacity to manage and implement education
interventions. This approach was positively evaluated by interviewees, however, there are several challenges
related to such “hands-on” cooperation.
In the current framework, finances are managed directly by UNICEF and delivered directly to recipients – the
schools and teachers. While such management diverges from the model that UNICEF usually adopts, i.e.
transferring funds to responsible governmental institutions, it has been viewed as more flexible and adequate in
face of the economic crisis in Lebanon.183 By design, this model allows stakeholders to have a clear
understanding of where the funding goes. However, it creates additional administrative burden on UNICEF in
programme implementation.
Interviewees have also noted challenges related to the quality of data, which serves as basis for financing, and
delays in implementing a unified database system (SIMS) (see Section 3.5.5. below). The limited resources of
MEHE, primarily in staff size, constrain the extent to which relevant capacity can be built, and in turn, tasks
transferred. As a result, the practical data management requires significant engagement of the LCO’s staff to
solve problems with data errors and inconsistencies.
3.3.3 To what extent was UNICEF able to effectively collaborate and
coordinate externally with key stakeholders, and leverage existing
partnerships?
UNICEF coordinated its activities within the Education programme with external partners. Some of that
coordination was done through the UN Education Sector Working Group in which UNICEF serves as Sector
Coordinator. The TREF Strategic Management Board (SMB) meetings were also assessed as useful platforms for
collaboration and coordination.
Overall, the evidence collected in the evaluation suggests that UNICEF has effectively collaborated with
key stakeholders to implement the education programme. In fact, UNICEF’s initial presence in Lebanon was
facilitated by a working-level cooperation with the UNHCR, which acted as a coordinator of the international
sector’s support in the early stages of the Syrian war crisis. UNHCR remained an important partner throughout the
years of LCO-EP implementation, cooperating with UNICEF in selecting the second-shift schools, assessing
access and out-of-school children issues, as well as in implementing initiatives such as back-to-school campaigns.
At the strategic level, UNICEF cooperates with a number of international institutions, such as UNHCR,
UNESCO, and the World Bank (see Section 3.4 as well). In practice, this cooperation takes place informally, on a
daily basis, as well as in technical settings in the context of policy discussions or coordinating the support provided
to the Lebanese government.
UNICEF has maintained regular communication with MEHE, through the Director General’s Office, which
has been a key partner during the implementation of the Education programme. The ministry played a crucial
role in supporting the education of refugee children, also assuming responsibility for the NFE, despite it being
outside its original mandate. The relationship with MEHE has been complex, with difficulties under RACE II linked
to resource monitoring and data correctness. To a large degree, the qualitative data collected depicts the PMU as
a “black box”, functioning with limited transparency, which raised questions about accountability. However, under

interviews, several donor representatives expressed satisfaction with the close partnership between the EU,
Germany, UNICEF and MEHE under TREF. The resulting approach to the education programming meets
requirements in terms of data collection, reporting and financial accountability. The first gains from cooperation
have already been observed, notably in reforms at the school level, coordination with stakeholders, and improved
data system.184 UNICEF’s other national partners with an important role in implementing the Education programme
are the Guidance and Counseling Directorate and the Center of Educational Research and Development.
UNICEF has been the lead agency with regard to the NFE and formed a group of national and international
NGOs working to address sector challenges and advocate for common goals.185 To standardize the efforts,
NGOs were required to apply for an expression of interest and join the sector group to participate in the NFE. This
standardized curriculum and operating procedures attracted more partners to collaborate with MEHE, leading to
increased coordination and alignment. Many new partners joined the table, working together under the same
curriculum and standards of operation, while some partners continued their own independent initiatives in non-
certified centers or their own premises.
3.3.4 Were there any inefficiencies because UNICEF did not work with
certain partners (or if UNICEF only worked with the same set of
partners)?
Research conducted for this evaluation did not indicate that significant inefficiencies occurred due to UNICEF’s
lack of work with certain partners. In fact, as described above, the scope of collaborations was conductive to the
extent that the planned results have been achieved.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that closer collaboration in the field of education between UNICEF and the World
Bank under the TREF framework connects efforts that have previously been separate, and so synergy and
efficiency can be expected to improve as TREF progresses.
Additionally, interviews conducted at the local and field levels highlight the importance of building local-level
partnerships to improve the effectiveness of UNICEF’s support to education and the effects it has in schools and
children’s experiences (be it in interpersonal relations, teaching materials, teaching quality, or infrastructure
quality). Such partnerships also contribute to the visibility of UNICEF’s support and inform the communities’
perceptions of who benefits from the support and why. While the LCO’s work at the systemic (national) level
remains a key vehicle for change in the education sector, work at the local level should not be omitted. This is
particularly important in the face of contemporary challenges that the Lebanese society (including migrant groups)
experience, given the significance of community-level resilience to overcoming such challenges.
3.3.5 Were appropriate monitoring and financial accountability
mechanisms in place?
As noted above, data collected in this evaluation suggests issues with the transparency and accountability
mechanisms in place during the period of support to the RACE II modality. The independence of the PMU
in Lebanon was described as more significant than that of the similar units in other countries, with the PMU having
a separate information system, field operators and significant decision-making power, in effect functioning in
parallel to the DGE.186 The lack of transparency around the use of resources and the lack of access to the fund

185 According to LCO annual reporting, partnerships with NGOs included inter alia: Humanity and Inclusion, Mouvement Social, Youth
Association of the Blind, Association of Volunteers in International Service (AVSI), Al Fayhaa, LOST, War Child Holland, World Vision
International, as well as local Education Community Liaison volunteers.

distribution system limited UNICEF’s and donors’ ability to monitor transfers and to ‘see what happens with the
funding’.
In contrast, interviewees viewed the solutions adopted in TREF as better suited for timely monitoring of
results and financial transfers, as well as overall accountability.
“Now, as far as TREF is concerned, the commitment is completely different than it was under RACE. Before,
it was a black box. There were no formal agreements between UNICEF and MEHE. No sanctions.
The situation between donors and UNICEF was clear – if you don't deliver, you don't pay. But this did not
translate to the level of UNICEF and MEHE. It seems to me that all of these have now been dealt with very
well under TREF.” (IDI 02)
The overall assessment of TREF’s improved accountability was voiced despite respondents noting that not all
issues with data quality have been resolved yet. It is expected that, once all mechanisms are implemented, it will
be easier for the LCO to monitor progress and communicate results to donors.
Currently, efforts are made to develop one information system that would integrate the multiple databases relevant
to the education programme – the CERD database, the SIMS and the Compiler, which produce independent
datasets of varying credibility. The efforts are aimed at resolving data-related challenges that appear to be twofold.
First, there is a lack of data at the structural level. Throughout the RACE II implementation period, this lack
particularly manifested in insufficient and/or untimely information on indicators, such as attendance of students
and teachers, or completion rates. The second challenge is related to the parallel functioning of the AM and PM
shifts, with specific solutions for teacher contracting and different funding sources. This results in multiple problems
in data such as duplicated entries, spelling or translation errors, etc., which “means a lot of manual, artisanal work,
to split different information” (IDI 16).
The integration of databases and development of a uniform, clear and (to the extent possible) error-free
information system should be highlighted as a key prerequisite for efficient implementation of the LCO-
EP, as envisaged in TREF.
Despite commitments outlined in the S2R2 programme, MEHE has not yet been able to develop an Information
Management Strategy that would address these challenges. It has been unable to structure or enforce a national
data management and analysis framework that predictably reports on the health of the public education system,
its teaching corps, or its students.187 Insufficient data on efficiency, quality and achievement is a constraint for
evidence-based policy as well as programme implementation. UNICEF documents note that these issues have in
fact negatively impacted the pace and capacity of payments, and stress the need to increase MEHE’s ability to
produce informative analyses on education indicators that rely on a unified data source.188
UNICEF supports data collection and works directly with the MEHE’s IT team to ensure good-quality data.
Nevertheless, the issues do not seem to be solely related to IT systems and competencies – as one of the
interviewees stated: “It is just a symptom. It’s all about the way people usually operate and how it changes” (IDI 16).
3.3.6 To what extent are social and gender disaggregated data
collected and monitored during the programming? How efficiently
did UNICEF respond to equity-based challenges?
A number of challenges related to data collection and monitoring have occurred during the implementation
of the Education programme, as described above in section 3.3.5 and 3.2. As highlighted when discussing
187 EU PROPOSAL 2020, internal document provided to Ecorys by UNICEF.

effectiveness, the programme’s result framework relied primarily on government-sourced data, which were not
considered unequivocally reliable. The result framework shows that, in the absence or low quality of government
data, alternative indicators to gather evidence have not been conceptualized, while some of the monitoring tools
designed by UNICEF were not sufficiently accurate.
On the other hand, UNICEF, together with UNHCR and WFP, issues the annual Vulnerability Assessment of
Syrian Refugees in Lebanon (VASyR) analysis, and contributes to the online Inter-agency education sector
dashboard.189 Both of these information sources provide evidence that social- and gender-disaggregated data are
collected, with themes such as gender, age, disability and conflict-sensitivity/social stability considered as
dimensions or topics of analyses.190
3.4 Coherence
3.4.1 How does UNICEF’s work fit with the work of external partners
(global partners, regional partners, government, partner
programs/interventions)?
Desk research and interviews show that UNICEF’s work fits well with the priorities of external partners.
Within the education sector, the priorities have been expressed in the major policy frameworks, such as RACE or
the MEHE 5-year plan (for more on these see Sections 1.1.5 and 1.2.1). As the interviews consistently confirmed,
external partners have been working within this common broader policy framework, encompassing three pillars of
access, quality and system strengthening, with an initial emphasis on Syrian refugees shifting somewhat post-
2019 to accommodate the growing needs of Lebanese children and their parents.
Some differences in the main priorities between external partners have been identified during the
evaluation, yet they still fit well within the overall LCO-EP. These differences are largely along the lines of
beneficiary nationality or specific vulnerabilities, the supported pillar or type of education (the FE or the NFE, all
education or only public education). Some donors have consistently prioritized support to Syrian refugees, while
also acknowledging the changing context and increasing vulnerabilities of Lebanese children.191 There are also
preferences among donors towards supporting either the FE or the NFE. For instance, through its QITABI
programme the USAID has exclusively focused on formal education. Conversely, some donors choose to focus
on the NFE, including due to the mistrust towards the formal education sector, while others are focused on specific
aspects of education such as inclusion.192
The wide scope of UNICEF LCO-EP enabled both UNICEF and its external partners to find areas of
alignment. Donors, in particular, were able to pick those components which they wanted to support, although
some also chose not to earmark their support for specific interventions.193 In this manner, LCO-EP has functioned
as a platform integrating different donors and their priorities around education and as a vehicle for channeling
resources into the education system.
However, regarding more recent developments, some interviews with donors show that it is not yet clear
for them how TREF’s window II would or could align with their priorities because the conceptualization of

this component is still lacking. The interviewees expressed a desire to learn more about the details in order to
be able to support this aspect of LCO-EP.194
During programme implementation, UNICEF involved some external actors in its activities. Many INGOs and
NGOs working with children in Lebanon were involved in the programme’s NFE activities as implementing
partners. They are thus not strictly external. UNICEF was able to tap into the non-governmental sector’s potential,
stemming e.g. from specialist knowledge (work with children with SEND) or stronger embeddedness in local
communities.
However, some of those INGOs and/or NGOs also implemented NFE activities independently of LCO-EP,
but with the support from the same donors. One interviewed donor argued that such a scheme helps them as
a donor to reduce middle-man costs that UNICEF would generate. While this is a valid argument and donors are
free to choose their grantees, the practice has its downsides. It fragments resources, decreasing the coherence
of NFE activities across the country; increases the need for coordination, diverting resources from implementation;
creates a risk of double-financing and increases the reporting burden. The interviewee themselves noticed the
downsides of this arrangement in practice:
„Sometimes those partners are also supported by UNICEF, which creates some issues. There are different
guidelines, requests, implementation principles. We would like to have some control, or alignment, or
homogenized approach between UNICEF and us. There are improvements to be done, when you have
partners implementing activities funded by different donors.” (IDI 01)
Beyond alignment on priorities, UNICEF’s work under LCO-EP complemented and synergized with the
work of external partners in the field.
In particular, UNICEF and UNHCR appear to have found complementarities and synergies in their work.
Given the organization’s mandate, the UNHCR’s work on education falls under the umbrella of international
protection. The UNHCR has collaborated with UNICEF since the beginning of the refugee crisis based on a global
agreement that allowed the two agencies to divide their respective niches. In the first days of the refugee crisis,
the agencies collaborated on ensuring enrolment of refugee children. The UNHCR would pay tuitions, while
UNICEF would do capacity building. In 2013/14, the two agencies together with MEHE adopted the second shift
approach and gradually developed the network of schools with PM classes for refugee children. With the
development of RACE I and RACE II, the collaboration between the agencies continued through capacity building,
rehabilitation, school boxes, training of teachers with strong coordination nationally and locally to avoid duplication.
Around 2015, the agencies started deploying experts to MEHE, using harmonized salary scales and coherent
terms of reference.
Over time, with the reduction of some overlaps, the work of both agencies seems to have become even
more complementary. The UNHCR discontinued institutional support to MEHE, relying on UNICEF to deliver
system strengthening activities. The UNHCR does not work on the quality pillar due to the lack of expertise in
curriculum development, but e.g. uses the BLN curriculum developed by UNICEF, multiplying the effects and
impact of UNICEF’s work. The UNHCR focuses on access to education for Syrian refugees, which is also the main
focus of the UNICEF’s Education programme. But, while UNICEF’s approach has been largely centralized and
focused on subsidizing and supporting enrolment in public education, the UNHCR concentrates on NFE
community-based initiatives, using its links to the refugee population. It also does awareness raising on the
importance of education. These activities also feed into LCO-EP. The evaluation thus shows that the UNHCR is
an important ally that can facilitate implementation of UNICEF’s work and increase its impact in the access
pillar. It also provides evidence of how both agencies have been able to use their mandates, expertise and specific
194 IDIs 06, 02.

projects to further the same overarching objectives. Table 7 below describes examples of cooperation and
interventions which directly or indirectly supported or could support UNICEF’s work in the Education programme.
Table 7 Example of UNHCR interventions
The UNHCR created a network of Education Community Liaisons (ECLs). In 2021, it supported 347 ECLs in
320 schools.195 ECLs are UNHCR volunteers at community and school level who received capacity building and
operate in second shift schools. The ECLs are Syrians with a certain academic level. Their tasks include e.g.:
• following up on absenteeism,
• mediating between students and education personnel, as well as between parents and education
personnel, and
• identifying violence, bullying, and pupils with learning difficulties.196
This network has been used to support LCO-EP. In the past three years, UNICEF developed the Cash for
Education intervention to support school attendance. The ECLs were able to facilitate that work by identifying
absenteeism.197
The UNHCR also works with UNICEF on the Blueprint Joint Action for Refugee Children. UNHCR aims at
enhancing access for refugee children and youth to essential services in the key areas of education.198
The complementarities can also be mentioned with the Quality Instruction Towards Access and Basic
Education Improvement (QITABI) programme implemented by World Learning and funded by the USAID.199
QITABI focuses on substantive work on the quality of education in public schools, developing curricula and
conducting teacher training. Due to USAID financing rules, QITABI cannot finance certain costs. As noted by an
interviewee, UNICEF was able to support QITABI work within its Learning Recovery Plan by covering those costs
(e.g. compensation for teacher trainers, operational costs), enabling delivery of training to many teachers.
Table 8 Basic information about QITABI
There have so far been three rounds of QITABI. QITABI 1 was completed in 2019 ($45M); QITABI 2 started in
2019 and will last until 2023 ($90M), while QITABI 3 will be implemented from 2023 to 2028 ($97M). The
overarching objective of QITABI is to improve learning outcomes for grades 1 to 6 in terms of literacy, numeracy
and social and emotion skills. QITABI works with 883 primary public schools within the system. It designs
curricula and training for teachers. The training is implemented as a cascade (training of trainers). QITABI has
trained over 20,000 teachers within the 2022-2023 academic year. It developed classroom observation tools
and trained DOPS on how to use these to capture how many teachers implement the content/lessons of the
QITABI training.
UNESCO is another actors working on education in Lebanon in a manner potentially complementary and
synergetic to UNICEF, although our evidence suggests a need for stronger coordination to achieve this.

EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 82
Unlike UNICEF for which access has been the leading area of engagement, UNESCO does not work much on
this pillar. It focuses on various aspects of quality and system strengthening. This includes directly supporting
MEHE education programs, e.g. on the subjects such as gender, higher education, and VET. It involves work on
policy issues and instruments, sectoral strategies, as well as monitoring and evaluation of these strategies. In this
respect, there is potential for overlap and work duplication between the two agencies. While there are platforms
for coordination (e.g. the UN Education Working Group) and bilateral meetings with efforts to avoid duplication,
the two institutions have separate plans and agendas, and some interviewees indicated a need for more joint work
between UNICEF and UNESCO. While UNICEF’s added value was seen particularly in the strategic work and
system change, UNESCO’s strengths were perceived in particular in the area of quality.
Under the LCO-EP, UNICEF worked on quality. However, its contribution in this respect experienced some
limitations (see Section 3.2.1.2 on effectiveness) warranting a critical assessment of its involvement in
this respect. For one, the volume of this work as compared to the access-focused interventions (and system
strengthening under TREF) is much smaller200 and less visible for stakeholders, e.g. donors;201 UNICEF’s
contribution has strongly focused on providing financial resources, while the major substantive responsibilities lied
with MEHE and CERD, which both shape the content of the interventions, such as teacher training. Some
interviewees expressed doubts regarding UNICEF’s capacity to work on the quality pillar in a more substantive
manner.202 Finally, there are other strong actors working systemically on the quality pillar, such as QITABI,
UNESCO or the World Bank. Yet these considerations should not be seen as criticism; in an intervention as
extensive as LCO-EP, trade-offs are inevitable and spreading resources thin is a risk. The evaluators do not see
this necessarily as a call for UNICEF to get more substantively engaged in the quality pillar (e.g. development /
renewal of the country’s curricula), although stakeholders do perceive quality as an area demanding stronger focus
in the future.203 This should, however, be taken as an opportunity for UNICEF to join forces with specialized actors
working on quality, such as QITABI and UNESCO. This was also suggested by one of the interviewed donors.
„As a partner, I am not against having other agencies being part of TREF to implement some activities
that UNICEF cannot implement. I would not oppose that.” (IDI 01)
These actors could lead on curricula development and content of teacher training. UNICEF, in turn, could continue
operational support, but would also be able to focus stronger on quality education issues such as child protection
and inclusion where it noted considerable achievements and which are part of its mandate. The agency could shift
the remaining resources to areas of its comparative advantage, i.e. access to education and system strengthening,
including pushing for broader education system reforms. This is were it could leverage its leading role in the
education sector, the relations with donors and MEHE. Stakeholders see UNICEF’s potential in this respect. The
evaluation found that UNICEF is able to coordinate and implement advocacy activities with and on behalf
of external stakeholders. This includes voicing concerns of the refugees, advocating for reducing barriers to
access and participation. UNICEF’s relationship with MEHE is noticed and perceived as a powerful resource.204
“We count on [UNICEF] […] For example, if [our organization] is not around the table of discussion, we
coordinate with UNICEF to voice refugees’ concerns. We cannot be also on all discussion tables.” (IDI 13)
Looking into the future, in its strategic and reform-focused work, UNICEF should cooperate strongly with
the World Bank. Since 2016, the World Bank has operated one of the biggest interventions aside from the LCO-
EP, namely the Support to Race II (S2R2).205 Its aim has been to “continue to help expand access to schools for

all children in Lebanon, with an increased focus on improving the quality and inclusiveness of the teaching and
learning environment, and on strengthening the national education system, its policies, planning and monitoring
capacities.”206 Mirroring the structure of RACE, S2R2 deals with the three pillars, thus also overlapping with LCO-
EP. Despite this overlap, stakeholders noted that the coordination between UNICEF and the World Bank had been
difficult to establish until recently.207 TREF has brought some change, with UNICEF and the World Bank currently
working together on the productivity allowance.208 Beyond that, the World Bank has developed a path for an
education reform for Lebanon,209 which could become a stronger part of the work implemented under TREF.
3.4.2 How does UNICEF Education programme align with/fit with other
interventions being carried out by UNICEF?
The LCO-EP is an integral part of the Agency’s broader programming, as captured by the UNICEF country
programme documents. The latter spell out multi-sectoral and multi-faceted visions for UNICEF’s responses to the
country’s increasingly complex political, economic and social situation.210 In the 2017-2020 Country Programme
Document (CPD), education falls within the Child Development component, the remaining four being Child
Survival, Child Protection, Social Inclusion and Youth Development.211 The mid-term review of the 2017-2020 CPD
led to a shift towards “an integrated, inter-sectoral approach to address multiple drivers of child vulnerability [...]
accompanied by joint advocacy for national policies on gender-based violence, child protection in schools,
inclusive education in schools, and strategies on child marriage.”212 Given the interconnections and
interdependencies between interventions in different sectors, the approach has to be viewed positively. As the
situation in Lebanon increasingly shows, the fulfilment of the child’s right to education depends on the family’s
economic situation, and its capacity to avoid negative coping mechanisms, e.g. child labor. The family’s economic
situation can be positively affected by appropriate social protection interventions. The interventions in the
education sector can, in turn, influence other dimensions of children’s lives, e.g. by increasing child safety or health.
Indeed, as noted in previous sections, the LCO-EP supported intersectoral interventions, especially those
at the cross-section of education and child protection and social inclusion. This has been done, for example,
through the development and rollout in schools of the Child Protection Policy as part of the Education Programme,
and support to the government’s Inclusive Schools Pilot project, as explained in previous sections.
On the other hand, UNICEF’s interventions in other sectors have the potential to contribute to the LCO-
EP’s results, as they are well-aligned with identified population needs and address some key problems
affecting enrolment and retention. Given the deteriorating economic situation bringing about negative coping
mechanisms, this includes interventions in the social protection sector which respond to the increasing population
poverty and vulnerability. For example, to reach households living in extreme poverty, in June 2021 UNICEF in
collaboration with the Ministry of Social Affairs introduced the Haddi programme. 213 The programme is a national
social assistance intervention that provides a child grant in the form of a cash transfer paid through a money
transfer agency. Families with one child identified receive US $40 per month, US $60 for two and US $80 for three
or more children identified.214 The programme also links beneficiaries to complementary services, as part of its

integrated approach. As of July 2022, Haddi benefited 85,000 Lebanese and non-Lebanese families, with 130,000
vulnerable people registered in the programme.215 The vulnerable individuals reached by Haddi are identified by
UNICEF partners and include children involved in child labor, at risk of child marriage, excluded from school, CWD,
or poorly nourished.216
Further still, UNICEF Lebanon and the Mental Health Programme of the Ministry of Public Health are currently
starting a social media initiative called “Unmute Mental Health,”217 aimed at tackling the mental health issues linked
to the ongoing crisis and its effects on youth. Whereas the programme does not constitute a part of UNICEF LCO-
EP, it addresses issues that are directly relevant to education of children and young people. UNICEF is thus
increasing its efforts at responding to the challenges of the country context both within and outside of the evaluated
programme.
Aside from its own Education programme, UNICEF Lebanon is also one of the three grantees, alongside Save the
Children and UNESCO, under the Education Cannot Wait (ECW) programme.218 While Save the Children
focuses on service delivery and UNESCO on teacher training, UNICEF's emphasis is on the system-level aspects.
The ECW concentrates on the NFE.219 It is not clear to the evaluation team what specific interventions are
implemented by UNICEF under ECW and therefore how they align with LCO-EP. However, the overall aspirations,
such as creating frameworks for multiple flexible pathways, establishing a certification process, and implementing
school improvement plans,220 appear in line with the Education programme. Similarly, discussions with MEHE
around the ECW seem to revolve around the same issues of relevance to the Lebanese education sector.
From the Field:
Awareness of UNICEF’s activities
The school communities' awareness of UNICEF activities, both in the school and the education
sector in general, appears to be limited based on the responses. Some respondents mentioned that they
were aware of UNICEF activities implemented in their school, with QITABI project being mentioned most frequently
(sic!), but had no knowledge of any other educational initiatives or collaborations with MEHE or other stakeholders.
The lack of clarity on whether certain projects are UNICEF-funded or not was also noted. Nevertheless, teachers
who attended training sessions expressed appreciation for the incentives provided, acknowledging that UNICEF's
support demonstrated a higher level of care and concern compared to the government's. The discussions with the
Lebanese population revealed a particular lack of awareness regarding UNICEF's contributions to the school and
public education system. Among parents, the level of awareness is generally higher among Syrian parents than
Lebanese parents. These findings underscore the importance of improving communication channels and
promoting a better understanding of UNICEF's initiatives to ensure maximum impact and effective collaboration
within the education sector.
“Despite being the head of the educational committee, I do not have a full knowledge on the project, and this is
something to be considered by relevant stakeholders.” (local authority representative)
3.4.3 How does UNICEF Education programme support coordination at
MEHE to ensure complementarity and reduce duplication?
Beyond what has already been reported under previous sections, the collected evidence shows that UNICEF
provides substantial support to MEHE, e.g. in policy-making, programming, human resources, coordination with

other actors, infrastructure, etc. While it is not clear to what extent this is directly aimed at ensuring complementarity
and reducing duplication, it is likely that UNICEF’s support contributes to these goals, especially given UNICEF’s
deep familiarity and engagement in the education sector. At the same time, some overlaps have been identified in
between the work of various actors, suggesting that there may be room for improvement.
3.5 Impact
3.5.1 What has been so far the impact of the UNICEF Education to the
overall education sector in Lebanon? Has UNICEF been able to
leverage its impact e.g., by attracting other partners (private,
public, or other donors)?
The intended impact of LCO-EP was to support the structuring of an inclusive and equitable public education
system in Lebanon by 2020 that promotes effective teaching environments, relevant learning outcomes, and
opportunities for lifelong learning for all children between 3-18 years of age.221 The evidence suggests that LCO-
EP has contributed to progress in this respect.
On the one hand, thanks to UNICEF's efforts, the system has indeed become more inclusive and equitable. During
the evaluation period, a significant number of non-Lebanese children were included for the first time in the FE in
the country or engaged in adapted NFE activities. The MEHE-UNICEF sector partnership has also managed to
lay the foundations for an inclusive education system for CWD and mainstream this issue onto the Ministry's
agenda. Although the retention rate among the most vulnerable students remains far from satisfactory, it should
be acknowledged that any time spent by a child in safe and stimulating environment is likely to have a positive
impact on their well-being and future prospects.
On the other hand, implementing structural changes in the education system was highly challenging due to the
exceptionally unstable political and economic situation in the country and the transient hardships in collaboration
with MEHE. Consequently, the overall structure of the education system did not undergo significant changes.
The impact of the LCO-EP on the quality of education remains open to discussion. From one perspective, existing
data indicates a deterioration in educational outcomes for children in Lebanon between 2016 and 2019, and more
recent data is not available. From another perspective, UNICEF in collaboration with CERD implemented the
TTCM, an innovative teacher training system whose impact may only become visible in the future. As noted by
one interviewee, the effects of this collaboration are likely to continue because the joint activities have focused on
reforms in applied approaches.222 However, the trained teachers indicate that without continuous retraining, their
skills are likely to diminish over time. Among key stakeholders, there is also the opinion that without a
comprehensive reform of teacher recruitment and retention systems, significant improvement in the quality of
education in the country is not possible.
From the analysis conducted, it appears that the programme achieved the most limited impact in the area of system
strengthening. Due to the high turnover of staff at MEHE and frequent changes in the position of the Minister itself,
UNICEF largely managed LCO-EP independently, without strengthening the internal capacities of MEHE. Given
the difficulties in financial management on the government side, financial operations were also taken over by
UNICEF. On the one hand, this allowed for improved control over fund expenditure, but on the other hand, led to
the reinforcement of a parallel management structure, not conducive to sustaining the effects of the programme in
the long-term.

3.5.2 What approaches have the potential for further upscaling through
work of UNICEF and its partners?
Available data and respondents' statements indicate that the greatest strength of LCO-EP is its ability to provide
access to education for the most vulnerable populations, including Syrian refugees. It seems that a
multidimensional approach to this objective has proven successful. On the one hand, UNICEF worked with the
government to develop appropriate pathways to education for non-Lebanese children. On the other hand, it
persistently reached out to refugee families to properly identify barriers hindering their participation in schooling
(such as high enrolments fees, transportation, and educational materials) and made effective efforts to address
them. It can be presumed that, had it not been for successive crises, these efforts would have resulted in a
sustained increase in the enrolment of Syrian children in schools in Lebanon. Respondents also positively
assessed UNICEF's efforts in the development of child protection policies and programs, suggesting that they
should be upscaled to all schools in the country.
The research team has carefully observed the latest innovative developments of the LCO-EP, including
administrative measure implemented in TREF and several initiatives piloted in 2022, such as remote learning
hotlines and summer schools. The initial outcomes of those activities are encouraging, but further monitoring is
necessary to assess their potential for upscaling.
3.6 Sustainability
3.6.1 What are the key barriers and bottlenecks towards achieving
sustainability of UNICEF education programming? What are
contributing factors and constraints that require attention to
improve prospects of sustainability of results?
Overall, the sustainability of the programme – understood as the plausibility of continued activities and results in
the future without UNICEF’s further involvement – cannot be assessed positively. As highlighted multiple times
above, the programme operates in a very difficult and changing country context. Many barriers to achieving
sustainability are external to the programme itself. However, the preliminary findings suggest that some parts of
the programme could be tailored or modified to increase sustainability.
The education programme operates in an extremely difficult country context. Multiple crises affect and
impoverish large parts of the country population. This is interlinked with high political instability. Several
interviewees highlighted that with political changes occurring at a very high pace, any system strengthening effort
is very difficult.223 In the course of programme implementation, there have been several changes of the ministers
of education, undermining continuity of the efforts.224 The findings also point towards the challenges in the
government system itself, with reports of mismanagement and corruption scandals, undermining the reform
potential at the central level.225
There are also structural issues in the Lebanese education sector that render it difficult to reform. The
sector itself is resource-intensive, e.g., due to the high teacher to student ratio. The latter is, in turn, caused by the
very high number of teachers in the system. With the list of teachers not accurately updated, stakeholders report
that salaries may be paid to “ghost” teachers – people that no longer work in the system because they passed
away or for other reasons.226 However, there are families and communities that likely depend on this income.

Attempts at reform would entail massive layoffs, creating tensions and discontent in the country. At the same time,
the system is facing a “brain drain”, with many qualified teachers and other professionals having left the country,
further limiting the system’s capacity.227
In fact, the problems run even deeper. The crises left the national education system without sufficient resources
to ensure the functioning of schools, e.g. to pay salaries to teachers and school staff. The capacity of schools to
accommodate refugees (in terms of facilities as well as staff availability) was limited at the onset, and the inflow of
refugee children has put additional pressure. The public education system is “on and off”, with months-long school
closures due to teachers’ strikes. UNICEF has largely filled in those gaps, providing additional capacity to the
government to support the crisis response in the education sector. In the evaluated period, the scale of the crises
was such that several respondents indicated the crucial role of UNICEF in sustaining the education sector in
Lebanon. They assessed that without the LCO-EP intervention, the system would likely have collapsed.228
This puts the sustainability assessment further into perspective.
In the crisis context, the distinction between the humanitarian and development aspects of international
interventions became blurred. This is also true for LCO-EP whose activities have largely effectively fallen under
the humanitarian umbrella. In the words of one interviewee, “we are in a state of emergency where we can no
longer draw a line between emergency and development”. Such concerns were expressed by multiple
respondents. The programme in large part was directed towards helping the refugee children access education,
including support to the strained Lebanese education system to accommodate the refugee influx.229 Without
humanitarian assistance, any access to school would indeed be impossible for these children. With the lack of
resources for covering even the basic needs, for many families education of their children was unaffordable. This
became increasingly true also for the many Lebanese families impoverished by the subsequent crises. The
versatility and comprehensive approach of UNICEF encompassing humanitarian elements (cash assistance,
transport fees, etc.) was instrumental in enabling some form of education participation to children, as was
UNICEF’s flexibility in addressing subsequent crises and adjusting the programme interventions to respond to
emerging problems.230 On the flip side, however, the more long-term oriented interventions at a systemic level
were not pursued to a sufficient extent.231 Two aspects are further related to that – the insufficient focus on systemic
issues and limited leverage regarding country-level reform.
Regarding the insufficient system-orientation of the LCO-EP implementation, the picture is quite complex as
well. According to several respondents, UNICEF’s comparative advantage lies in systemic work, such as designing
or informing national strategies and policies, data collection and analysis, as well as reporting. As one interviewee
put it, “UNICEF is not about people, it’s about the system”.232 UNICEF plays such a role in Lebanon as well, setting
the strategy for the education sector, including coordination with donors and other actors.233 Moreover, the
Education programme is implemented in partnership with MEHE, both RACE II and TREF being interventions
under the government auspices.234 This is part of a broader approach whereby interventions are government-led
and the international partners rely on national strategies and policies in programme implementation.235 This
approach does, in fact, carry a promise of sustainability. Nevertheless, the opportunities for UNICEF to participate
or contribute to system reform were very limited, especially in the RACE II implementation period. The most often
referred reason for this situation is the internal organization and politics within MEHE at the time, with little

234 The role of this partnership for the effectiveness of the programme, as well as the differences between RACE II and TREF, have been
discussed in Section 3 above.
235 IDI 15.

transparency and limited access for UNICEF (and other partners) into its work. One interviewee described it as
the coordination structure within MEHE “having its own life”.236 Related to it is the unsuccessful capacity building
within MEHE – the goals related to building financial and management competencies within MEHE, or handing
over some parts of RACE programme operations to MEHE, were not achieved. The technical assistance provided
by UNICEF was often going beyond support and into providing the services.237 This does not improve the
sustainability prospects either.
Nevertheless, despite the government’s reluctance to introduce broader reforms, some changes at the
systemic level have been achieved. Examples include embedding the right to education for CWD in national
policies (see section 3.6.2 below). Significant organizational changes have been introduced with TREF, also with
the intention of “strengthen[ing] policymaking and implementation”.238 It is too early to assess whether those result
in shifts at the systemic level. The preoccupation remains strong among stakeholders. At the same time, they
underline the need to continue work with the central level government while shifting the approach to more reform-
oriented.239
This is, in turn, related to the limited opportunities to tie funding to reforms at the country level. There have
been discussions around attaching a conditionality to funding, including for LCO-EP, as the donors have been
growing reluctant to finance the sector without seeing expected results. Even though the funding responds to vital
needs, multiple respondents worry that without any obligations attached, the government will not be sufficiently
determined to reform the system. In words of one interviewee „[the education sector is] reaching a level of
dependency from international donors, which is unsustainable, that’s why you need to put stricter guidelines
because of the tendency to rely too much on the international community support.”240 Another interviewee
expressed the related dilemma – without the continued support from donors, the education sector in the country
will not be able to provide education: “we are doomed if we do [provide funding] and we are doomed if we don’t”.241
Indeed, multiple donor representatives are in favor of introducing some sort of conditionality, tying the
future funding to systemic reforms at the national level, or achievement of performance objectives.242 However,
one needs to delineate between the humanitarian and development elements of the nexus.
Humanitarian support is still very much needed in the country, and should not be subject to any conditionality
rules. The acute challenge in the Lebanese education system – approx. 700,000 out-of-school children – persists,
and the national system lacks the capacity to address it. Therefore, in the short and medium term, the humanitarian
leg is vital from the perspective of ensuring access to education: addressing the most basic material needs at the
family level preconditions children’s participation in education.243 However, from the sustainability perspective, the
changes at the systemic level are crucial in order to build this capacity. The remaining question is how to delineate
these activities under LCO-EP and “find that balance between humanitarian assistance and sustainable
responsibility or accountability from the government side”.244
In terms of enhancing the sustainability of the programme, future changes should entail two elements: a greater
focus of LCO-EP on the development aspect of the programme, and a form of conditionality and/or strategic
leverage to ensure systemic reforms. Based on the input from respondents, the possible approach may include
several elements:

• Focus on priorities: Narrowing down the scope of the programme around priorities in the Lebanese
education sector, as well as based on UNICEF’s competence and comparative advantage. An interviewee
indicated outreach and provision of minimum education to as many children as possible as such a priority,
as well as the focus on the most vulnerable children.245
• Strategic partnerships to increase pressure for reform: Another interviewee highlighted that “it [a push
for reform] is beyond what UNICEF alone can achieve… the overall reform agenda should be promoted”.246
A more coordinated donor approach could be a way to incentivize systemic changes, with the World Bank
and the IMF mentioned among potential partners. The World Bank conditionality mechanism – where
money transfers were delivered only after the achievement of indicators – was highlighted as a potential
example to be followed by UNICEF.247 Another interviewee underlined that joint programs with other UN
agencies could be an approach to accommodate humanitarian and development aspects in a more
comprehensive way.248
• More regional approach: Some interviewees highlighted that shifting focus to the regional level – both
by empowering the regional offices in terms of financial management and data collection, as well as
investments and activities in the regions and at a school level – could bring about more sustainable
results.249
Moreover, while the emphasis on long-term planning is more pronounced under TREF, no actions were
implemented to date. UNICEF does not have an exit strategy either.
3.6.2 To what extent have UNICEF support programs been embedded in
government programs? What are the interventions which were
costed and advocated with the government?
The LCO-EP has been embedded in government programs insofar as it has formed part of RACE I, RACE
II and the 5YP, which are all governmental programs. While the evaluation established that the overlap between
RACE or the 5YP and LCO-EP is significant but not full, stakeholders tend to perceive them as largely the same
interventions. Throughout the evaluation itself, it has been challenging to distinguish their scopes and pinpoint the
exact differences. While this may be easier on paper, the overlap is overwhelming when looking at the practice. It
does not surprise, considering the involvement of UNICEF in developing these governmental interventions.
Because of this relationship between governmental programs and the LCO-EP, it is challenging to pin
down how the former changed as a result of implementing the latter. Even in the absence of a specific
contract between UNICEF and MEHE under RACE, the relationship has been close and based on negotiating
subsequent steps. At this point, evidence shows that it is LCO-EP that was shaped in response to the governmental
priorities and country needs identified by MEHE, as discussed in previous sections.
Looking beyond crisis response programming, the UNICEF LCO-EP was able to affect governmental
programming related to child protection and inclusive education, creating potential for greater
sustainability of activities in these domains in the future. Regarding child protection, in 2018 UNICEF and
MEHE launched the Policy for the Protection of Students in the School Environment as part of the work under
LCO-EP. This was followed by UNICEF providing support to MEHE in implementing the Action Plan for the roll-
out of the Child Protection Policy and other guidelines.250 But the work on child protection within the programme

did not stop at the policy level. It was rolled out across hundreds of schools in Lebanon; included development of
practical mechanisms, such as referral pathways, establishing institutional support and providing training and
guidance materials to educational staff (see more details in Section 3.2). However, it is not yet clear how all these
elements will work together to bring systemic changes. Foundations appear to have been created for sustainable
development in this respect, but as one of the interviewees highlighted, the policies need to be implemented,
noting shortcomings referring to follow-up on complaints and feedback.251
Regarding inclusive education, UNICEF implemented the Inclusive Education Pilot project reaching 88 schools
(see more details in Section 3.2). As in the case of child protection, the pilot project was accompanied by the
creation of a policy foundation, namely the Inclusive Education Policy draft and the National Action Plan on
Inclusion. Inclusive education has also been part of the training programs, including the TTCM, implemented by
UNICEF under LCO-EP.
The intervention mix implemented by UNICEF under LCO-EP in relation to child protection and inclusive
education can be seen as a good practice from the perspective of sustainability. While resources will need
to be found in the government’s budget to continue the work, a foundation exists in terms of policies, institutions,
procedures and substantive know-how to roll them out, and these have already been tested in practice under LCO-
EP.

4.0 Lessons learned, conclusions and
recommendations
4.1 Lessons learned
Based on the findings, including in particular stakeholder consultations, some initial lessons can be drawn for
future interventions.
Regardless of the emergency situation, when granting substantial funds such as in LCO-EP, a degree of
skepticism appears necessary when the political contexts is difficult and the counterpart government has
a dubious track record in financial management. As a donor representative observed, the information that
MEHE provided for RACE, e.g. on the costs of enrolment per student (i.e. 600 USD), was taken for granted at the
time.252 For years, the Lebanese education system has not been able to generate reliable data which could support
this cost calculation. As a result, a massive intervention was rolled out without cost verification, potentially resulting
in high inefficiencies.
The externalization of fund management may be a better option in the context where the confidence in
government’s data and institutional capacity are lacking, and significant funds are at stake. While this is a
solution that may be de-empowering for the national government, this trade-off may be necessary to protect the
resources, but also to protect the actual results, since disbursement of funds can be tied to achievements.
Whichever mechanism is selected for the management of resources and interventions, it should be
reassessed at a clearly established points in time and revised/remodeled following assessment, if needed.
In the case of the mechanism selected for LCO-EP, the mechanism existed for a long time, it has lacked
transparency and accountability and bred frustrations. Most importantly, it caused donor frustration and skepticism,
leading to shrinking resources.
Finally, for education interventions, especially of such magnitude and importance, robust and advance
planning is necessary. In fact, a planning routine is desirable. Within the education sector, the planning needs
to start sufficiently early before the start of the school year. It may require some flexibility on the part of donors.
4.2 Conclusions
4.2.1 Overarching conclusions
The evaluation showed that LCO-EP was well-aligned with international human rights standards, UNICEF’s
mandate, the global priorities of UN agencies more broadly and the government priorities as expressed in
the main policy documents. LCO-EP was so well-aligned with such programs as RACE I and RACE II that it has
sometimes been difficult for interviewees to practically separate their judgements about these programs. The
understanding of the relations between the programs was not uniform among the consulted UNICEF staff either.
This signals a need for better external and internal communication around UNICEF’s education
programming.
The programme was highly relevant to the country context, addressing serious challenges around access
to education, education quality and system-strengthening. The country context has been repeatedly
highlighted by the interviewed stakeholders as crucial for understanding the program’s mixed effects and different
252 IDI 02.
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 92
aspects of its implementation covered under all evaluation criteria. LCO-EP 2016-2021 was shaped by the
dynamics of emergency, initially related to the refugee influx but sustained by the multiple subsequent crises. The
consecutive emergencies enfolded against a complex political background in which historical
compromises have affected the government’s willingness and ability to execute structural reforms. As a
result, the crises put additional pressure on the already strained state systems, including the education system
with its neglected public schools that cater to the most vulnerable populations. The consecutive emergencies
demanded continuous adaptations, consuming a lot of operational capacity. The evaluation shows that
UNICEF’s approach, marked by flexibility and adaptability, allowed for responding to various emerging
challenges, but perhaps to a greater extent than to systemic problems. There is now, however, a clear
expectation among the interviewed stakeholders of a stronger focus on the latter, given the very limited
sustainability of the approach so far.
There is a fair share of ambivalence in opinions on LCO-EP’s effectiveness. Perceptions of effectiveness
depend on the pillar and correspond to the allocated funding. Stakeholders recognize the influence of the context
on effects and see limitations as to what UNICEF can do without government’s engagement in a system change.
But, they had and have much higher expectations as to results, given the level of funding, so they often tend to
take a pessimistic view of achievements overall. Stakeholders clearly acknowledge UNICEF’s significant efforts,
but donors, for example, seem to lack knowledge or be confused about UNICEF’s work in some areas, which
again underlies the importance of communication.
Deficiencies in the LCO-EP’s monitoring and results framework, as well as problems of data availability
and quality affect the programme’s evaluability. Some indicators are suboptimal to measure progress, either
in view of the pursued results or dynamic context changes. Other indicators rely on government statistics, which
are either not available or not reliable. The findings point to the need to develop better indicators which would be
more independent of government data. In this context, solutions adopted in TREF are viewed as better suited for
timely monitoring of results and financial transfers, as well as overall accountability.
4.2.2 Conclusions on access to education
Access was rightly prioritized when it comes to resources, given the overwhelming needs. It is still valid
as a major focus, considering the high vulnerability and dependence of the system on international aid.
Measured primarily by the level of enrolment of children in schools, LCO-EP has been effective in achieving many
of its access-related targets, despite highly adverse circumstances. There is a widespread perception that UNICEF
played an instrumental role in ensuring access to education for Syrian refugee children.
There remain, however, questions around the relevance of support in the access pillar, given a large
number of out-of-school children (OOSC). While subsidization as a modality was appreciated, enrolment
as its basis was seen as suboptimal. Stakeholders considered attendance as a more relevant indicator in view
of the pursued objectives of not only enrolling children but also retaining them in education. The lesson has already
been learnt and implemented in the development of TREF. Support for transportation was also considered
instrumental in ensuring access. Beyond subsidization, provision of in-kind support, such as delivery of handbooks
and stationary, strongly contributes to children’s ability to benefit from education and should be continued. In-kind
support could also be used as a vehicle for communicating about UNICEF’s actions, thus helping parents and
children see the Agency’s contribution.
UNICEF’s engagement in the provision of the NFE as part of its access pillar is highly relevant to the
Lebanese context. In fact, it could be increased in view of stakeholder feedback. Regarding NFE modalities
so far, there have been issues such as prohibitive entry requirements, but given a large number of remaining
OOSC thought could also be given to better targeting and outreach strategies. Bridging the NFE to the FE is
another challenge for which solutions have not been found. They would likely necessitate a stronger stance in
/ 93
THIS IS A RUNNING HEADER
advocacy vis-à-vis MEHE, considering the latter’s role in the process and position on refugee integration. While
some children have been able to cross the path from the NFE to the FE, the programme’s success in bridging this
gap has been lower than expected. Again, TREF goes in the right direction, since it aims to bring dispersed NFE
initiatives under one roof in the so-called Window II. However, donor feedback shows that, as opposed to Window
I, Window II is still underdeveloped, which limits possibilities to commit funding. Donor interviewees expect
UNICEF to propose an appropriately concrete solution for donors to fund, and there has been some sense of
urgency around seeing a clear vision of the NFE in UNICEF’s current programming.
In light of stakeholder feedback, an aspect that has not been tackled either, but should, is the humanitarian nature
of many access interventions in the programme. These interventions rely on massive financial transfers. The view
among the interviewed stakeholders is that there should be more strategic thinking about emergency interventions.
While the latter are still needed, the balance should tip more towards development work to achieve better
sustainability in the long run.
4.2.3 Conclusions on the quality of education
UNICEF Lebanon’s education programme aimed at supporting the quality of education, a valid objective
considering the context and needs. However, its contribution in the quality pillar has been much lower financially
than in the access pillar. The joint efforts of UNICEF and CERD in teacher training have resulted in the
strengthening of teachers' competencies. However, gaps in official data and a lack of access to classrooms for
UNICEF and CERD make it impossible to assess the extent to which teacher training has translated into student
learning outcomes. In this respect, the evaluation revealed a need for program indicators that would be
independent of government data and could allow to better measure higher-level results under the quality
pillar.
The evaluation confirms the systemic need to work on the quality of education, including curricula reforms
and increasing teacher competences. UNICEF’s work responded to this demands in part by developing the
TTCM. The fieldwork suggests that teachers and principals could benefit from more emphasis within the program.
The productivity allowance under TREF responds to a significant need for financial support. However, there is also
a need to develop non-financial interventions to build teachers’ child rights-based attitudes, as well as maintain
their motivation and engagement. These could also serve to ensure teacher well-being in the face of multiple
pressures.
Fostering inclusive education, UNICEF has attempted to address the needs of the most vulnerable groups.
Beyond catering to Syrian refugees, the program rolled out a complex intervention targeting CWD, whose
embeddedness in national policies shows potential for sustainability. This work could further be developed with an
added focus on children with speech difficulties. The data does not reveal much consideration of intersectionality
within the program, which suggests that improvements could be sought in this respect.
UNICEF’s contribution on quality focused mostly on horizontal themes, such as inclusion and equality, as
well as safety. This represents a specific aspect of quality. It is relevant in view of the context, yet the broad
framing of UNICEF’s work on quality – at least at a theoretical level – appears to be misleading in light of this
specific focus. What UNICEF does and what results it achieves in this area are not clear to at least some
stakeholders. UNICEF’s work would thus benefit from better external communication. It could perhaps be
reframed directly as work on equality, inclusion and safety in education, rather than quality of education.
The latter appears to imply, at least to some stakeholders, work on curricula for school subjects such as math or
Arabic, etc. The evaluation does not necessarily point to a conclusion that UNICEF should or should not go in this
direction. While UNICEF has implemented quality-related, classroom level interventions, the evidence suggests
that quality of education is not associated with UNICEF, nor seen as its strength. In addition to CERD, there are
international and national actors, such as UNESCO or QITABI, well-placed to work on new curricula. On the other
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 94
hand, the work on horizontal aspects of quality, such as inclusion, equality or safety, is well-linked to UNICEF’s
other sectoral expertise and work. This is where UNICEF has comparative advantage and can work in an
integrated, multidisciplinary and multisectoral manner. The research, including results of fieldwork at schools, also
confirms a need to continue developing interventions to tackle these matters, as discriminatory attitudes among
teachers and bullying at schools were highlighted among problems.
4.2.4 Conclusions on system-strengthening
As for strengthening the education system, most of the planned activities were not carried out, which precludes an
assessment of effectiveness in this area. While LCO-EP foresaw such interventions, they were rather limited.
Although some successes can be seen in the adoption of policies on inclusion and child protection. There is also
an indication that the time may now be right for pursuing a stronger reform agenda.
“It’s a golden opportunity now. The MEHE needs the international community and UN support. We can
enforce some policies. We can bridge the gap in policies.”253
The evaluation confirmed many systemic issues within the education sector and an overwhelming need
for reforms. The system-strengthening work has been energized with the launch of TREF, yet appears to largely
focus on education data. This is of course relevant, as the lack of accurate data poses a serious challenge which,
if solved, could open the way to tackling other systemic problems. Yet, as stakeholders observe, there are also
other pressing systemic problems independent of data which could be tackled in UNICEF’s advocacy for
specific policies and legal developments. There is a sense of frustration among donor stakeholders especially
that well-known systemic issues are not tackled. These include, for example, reducing the requirements for
refugees’ access to the NFE, or lowering the numbers of schools and teachers and thus increasing system
efficiency.
Related to this is the observed stakeholder perception that UNICEF is particularly well-placed to work with
the government at the system level. A good relationship with the main donors, but especially with MEHE, is
seen as the Agency’s comparative strength, which potentially creates greater expectations. With donor support,
UNICEF can leverage its massive access interventions in discussions with the government. The stakeholders
consider these funds to be a strong argument in negotiations, one that possibly allows UNICEF to maintain a firmer
stance on certain issues. Interviewees have called for more pressure, possibly conditionality, toward MEHE whilst
stating that UNICEF is the adequate stakeholder to exercise this pressure. The donors and the World Bank are
seen as important partners for cooperation in this area.

4.3 Recommendations
The evaluation findings and conclusions lead to a number of recommendations which have been divided below
into two main groups – system-level recommendations and program-level recommendations. The former, while
they are directed largely at UNICEF, depend for success on cooperation with all relevant actors, such as donors,
INGOs and the Lebanese government. The latter will mainly require a management response from UNICEF and
donors.
4.3.1 System-level recommendations
UNICEF should strongly engage in advocacy for and implementation of broader education system
reforms. This recommendation is supported by analysis under all evaluation criteria and with respect to all pillars.
UNICEF is seen as particularly well-placed for this role due to: (i) the scale of its interventions, (ii) donor trust, (iii)
depth of its relationship with MEHE and (iv) system-level know-how.
Based on the findings from the national- and local-level research, following up on this recommendation would
include:
1. a stronger push for policy and legislative reforms (accompanied by efforts to change related practices) to:
a. remove barriers to refugee participation in education, e.g. by ensuring smooth pathways from the
NFE to the FE for all children;
b. find a systemic solution to ensure timely access to education for children of Lebanese mothers
who do not have the Lebanese nationality;
c. reduce systemic inefficiencies in the education sector, e.g. by:
i. reforming the teacher employment and contracting arrangements to simplify the system,
and
ii. decreasing the high teacher-to-student ratio in Lebanese schools and the number of
schools;
iii. removing ghost teachers from pay-roll;
d. increase the quality of education, e.g. through pushing for:
i. changes in curricula to modernize teaching and set ambitious learning targets, especially
for Cycle 3 which is perceived as neglected by parents and teachers;
ii. consistent and robust teacher recruitment policy, and
iii. strengthened teacher competence framework and professional development pathway,
linked to performance assessment and incentives;
e. promote the public school system and to ensure that MEHE’s financial commitments to this system
systematically increase over time, including through increases in and paying teacher salaries.
Specifically, UNICEF could encourage MEHE to develop fundraising activities towards that aim,
e.g. among the Lebanese diaspora.
2. continuation of current system-strengthening efforts to increase MEHE’s capacity regarding education
data collection and analysis, including supporting MEHE in producing an Information Management
EVALUATION OF THE UNICEF LEBANON EDUCATION PROGRAMME 2016-2021
/ 96
Strategy. MEHE committed itself to producing an Information Management Strategy 2019-2021 as an
effort for a clear way forward on quality data collection and analysis, but this commitment has not been
fulfilled as of the submission of this report;
3. pushing for stronger coordination within MEHE to benefit further work on the quality of education,
especially between MEHE’s DG, CERD and DOPS to ensure clarity in and complementarity of mandates
and effective communication between these units. Communication between MEHE units could be
strengthened by consistent inclusion of relevant MEHE staff (beyond DG which is a core member) in the
work of the SMB;
4. encouraging MEHE to improve communication with schools. Currently, school directors and teachers feel
unsupported, as they have low awareness of MEHE’s plans and priorities, or the roles of key education
bodies, such as CERD and DOPS. Improving communication channels and disseminating relevant
information could help boost collaboration and cooperation within the education system;
5. attracting men to the teaching profession to broaden the talent pool. Currently, the profession is heavily
feminized, with some visited schools having no male teachers;
6. aiming for a sustainable approach to achieving inclusion and relevance of education services for refugees.
Many of those reforms will be a mid- to long-term effort, but the initiation of this work is urgent in view of
decreasing donor patience and funds.
UNICEF needs to strongly coordinate and cooperate with donors, the World Bank and other UN agencies
on the advocacy and implementation of the reform agenda. It should build on the existing previous plans to
avoid reinventing the wheel. Such plans have been put forward before, e.g. by the World Bank.254 Given the
magnitude of their respective interventions, UNICEF and the World Bank need to join forces and speak in one
voice on systemic reforms.
There needs to be more assertiveness vis-à-vis MEHE among the international community to ensure that
the push for reforms is effective. Introduction of conditionality related to specific reforms should be considered.
4.3.2 Program-level recommendations
The table below presents the main recommendations related specifically to LCO-EP. These are directed at
UNICEF, although the involvement of different actors may be necessary.
Priority: H – high, M – medium, L - low

revealed that transportation unavailability or danger remains a
primary barrier to school attendance for students and school
staff.
Relevance Address other types of in-kind support expected by school M Short-, mid-
communities, including further renovation works, solar panels, to long-
heating systems, alternative electricity production systems, food term
packages, drinking water and computers. However, regarding
computers, it is essential to note that fieldwork revealed some
locations where digital equipment is underutilized due to the lack
of necessary skills among school staff and electricity access
limitations.
Relevance Introduce outdoor activities and recreational activities for H Mid-term
children. These activities not only provide an opportunity for
physical exercise but also contribute to children’s social,
emotional, and cognitive development and reduce stress and
anxiety levels. During the interviews, parents particularly
emphasized the importance of including outdoor and art
activities in the school curriculum, hoping that this would
improve the well-being of their children.
Relevance Implement PSS programs during the first shift and increase M Mid-term
school staff awareness of the role of PSS counsellors. PSS
is essential for addressing the emotional and mental health
needs of students. In the face of crises affecting the Lebanese
population as well, limiting the provision of PSS to the second
shift does not seem justified. Moreover, such a distinction may
create a sense of unfair privilege for non-Lebanese students and
exacerbate hostilities between different nationality groups.
Relevance Improve communication regarding the programme, e.g. by H Short- to
developing stories about the programme’s aspirations, specific mid-term
Effectiveness
work and how it benefits different stakeholders. Improved
communication should target a wide range of stakeholders,
including donors, the Lebanese public, and stakeholders at
school level (principals, teachers and parents):
• Provide clearer communication to donors on what the H
programme does under the quality pillar.
• Enhance the communication plan with school principals, H
especially during onboarding, after a change in school
leadership. The communication plan should include
clear information about UNICEF's and the international
community's efforts to support the Lebanese community
and the education sector in general. It should also
provide transparency regarding the calculation of school

funding to address any existing ambiguities that might
lead to resentment in this area.
• Develop and implement an analogous communication H
plan with the Lebanese population, showcasing the
support that UNICEF provides to the first shift in schools
and the education sector as a whole.
• Provide advance notice about UNICEF's planned M
activities, such as summer schools. Currently, some
participating schools still have not received detailed
information on this matter. Ensuring timely
communication and sharing upcoming initiatives would
help schools prepare and participate effectively in
UNICEF's programmes.
Relevance Develop a clear vision of TREF window II and specific H Short-term
proposals for donors to facilitate funding decisions and
fund allocation.
Donors see the need to increase engagement on the NFE, but
they expect clear communication and initiative from UNICEF.
Relevance Develop further interventions which address the needs of H Short- to
teachers and principals to increase/maintain their motivation mid-term
and engagement, as well as address well-being.
• Develop methods to recognize and appreciate the H
efforts of individual principals and teachers through
positive acknowledgement. Currently, they feel
underappreciated by MEHE, and many schools
continue to function solely due to their heroic efforts.
Recognizing their hard work and dedication can foster a
sense of value and motivation among the education
professionals.
• Consider involving school principals in training sessions M
targeted at teachers. This approach can foster better
collaboration between school staff at different levels,
align the understanding of educational goals, and
ensure consistent implementation of the acquired
knowledge throughout the school.
• Rethink the timing of training sessions. Avoid M
conducting training on public holidays and better align
the training calendar with the school year to enable
teachers to start the new academic year equipped with
the necessary knowledge and skills.
Relevance Continue efforts to improve teachers' approach towards H Short- to

in several visited schools. By promoting a positive and respectful
teacher-student relationship, students are more likely to feel
safe, supported, and motivated to learn. Ensuring easy access
to toilets for children during class time is essential for their
comfort, health, and dignity.
Relevance Continue supporting inclusive education by strengthening M Short- to
the offer for children with learning difficulties, including mid-term
specifically speech difficulties, and increasing accessibility of
school infrastructure.
Consider strengthening the intersectional perspective
within the programme. It is crucial to identify and address the
specific groups at risk of exclusion from education, such as
Syrian Kurds and refugees with disabilities, among others.

Section: PRIME/Education Date: Oct 17th, 2022
Title: Evaluation of UNICEF Lebanon Education Duty station: Beirut, Lebanon
Programme (2016-2021).
Reporting to: Evaluation Specialist (PRIME) Contract type: LTA
Duration: 75 days Start date: November 2022
Section Content
Background
(1) UNICEF Lebanon’s Education Programme is planned in synergy with the overall vision of the
Lebanon Country Office, in that it advocates for the right to quality education in protected environments
for all children as principal and inherent in its interventions and partnerships. The Education Programme
is strongly linked to Lebanon’s National Priorities for Education, which, for the period covered by the
evaluation, were articulated in the RACE II Plan (Reaching All Children with Education 2017-2021) and
more recently in the MEHE’s Education 5-Year Plan (2021-2025). These Plans envision furthering the
agenda of inclusive education for the most vulnerable children in Lebanon and their priorities are in
alignment w the goals of the UN system in Lebanon as articulated in the UNSF (United Nations Strategic
Framework: 2017-2021; Outcome 3.2), which in turn is tied to SDG Goal 4; “Supporting quality
education and life-long learning”.
(2) Couched within these strategic frameworks, the Education Programme’s overarching goal is to
support the strengthening of national and local education systems to be more inclusive and equitable in
the delivery of quality, inclusive education services to the most vulnerable children, irrespective of their
nationality, physical/intellectual abilities, or socio-economic status. Equally important for the Education
programme, is the improvement of the quality-of-service delivery so that the educational experience of
children is more child-centered and inclusive to produce meaningful learning. The Education
Programme also invests beyond supply-sides variables; and addresses demand-side variables like
parent-engagement, safe accessibility of learning environments, food poverty, secure living spaces, and
disposable family income that impact a child’s education pathway and learning outcomes.
(3) However, the environment in which the Education Programme is required to operate is chronically
prone to increasing political, social, and economic pressures in Lebanon. Noting this, the Education
Programme key target population will be the inclusion of excluded children; with a commensurate shift
toward a more strongly integrated, inter-sectoral approach to address multiple drivers of child-
vulnerability in cooperation with other Programmes of the Lebanon Country Office. This includes:
• engaging the most vulnerable children and families in sustainable behavior change intervention
that results in more protective environments for children and the retention of children in learning
opportunities
• ensuring adaptive, child-centered teaching practices and functional learning packages are
offered to working, married, or stateless children that results in providing them with some social
protection and potentially leads to improved employment potential,
• engaging at different levels of policy and practice -both with the government and in
communities-to securing safe protective learning spaces for children
• involving relevant government authorities in meaningful, evidence-based advocacy to improve
child rights-based governance and policies at the national and sub-national levels
• impacting national systems to improve teaching methodology, protected environments, and
community engagement in schools.
• jointly advocating for national policies on gender-based violence, child protection in schools,
inclusive education in schools, and strategies on child marriage.
(4) UNICEF supports efforts of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) in improving
the quality of equitable service delivery of education opportunities to the most vulnerable and
marginalized children in Lebanon. UNICEF does this by providing several forms of financial subsidies
to vulnerable families and enhancing existing (technical, physical, and managerial) capacities of the
MEHE towards a more child-centered public education system. The support to formal education includes
ensuring enhanced access and retention in education, increased capacity of the public-school teachers
and improved governance.
UNICEF also supports non-formal education programmes, as part of the multiple flexible pathways, with
the support of implementing partners. These programmes target out-of-school children aged 3 to 14. In
Page 1 of 12
line with MEHE’s 5 year-plan, UNICEF is currently piloting a school bridging programme in private
schools.
UNICEF Lebanon’s overarching vision for education programming, based on the assessed situation
and premised on three main programmatic axes:
1. Contribute to increasing demand and reducing financial barriers for enrolment into formal and non-
formal education and early development opportunities for children between 03 to 18 years of age.
2.Contribute to increasing capacity of the education sector (formal and non-formal) to deliver quality
and inclusive education services, teaching, and learning environments.
3.Contribute to enhancing governance and managerial capacity of the MEHE and institutions to
effectively plan, coordinate, implement, and monitor public education sector (formal and non-formal).
These key programme axes anchor the mandate, advocacy, programming, partnerships of UNICEF
Lebanon’s Education Programme to support integrated programming, with a focus on providing meaningful
education, to the most marginalized children in Lebanon. UNICEF measures its success by ensuring that
the most disadvantaged children between 03-18 years of age benefit from equitable access to quality,
relevant, and inclusive learning, and early development.
Figure 1. Results structure of the UNICEF education programme
(5) The Education Programme’s main external counterparts are the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MEHE), the Centre for Educational Research and Development/CERD), and the Department
d’Orientation Pédagogique et Scolaire (DOPS), UN agencies (UNDP, UNESCO, and UNHCR), the
World Bank, and legally recognized international and national NGO partners, within the Education
Sector Working Group.
Purpose and Purpose
Objectives (6) The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the results (Outputs, outcomes, and impacts) achieved
by the education programme between 2016 and 20221. Within this framework, the evaluation will:
i. Provide an independent assessment of the UNICEF Lebanon education programme in terms of
design, implementation, and results achievement with a particular emphasis on its contribution to
Lebanon Education sector results on access, inclusion, equity, and efficiency.
ii. Critically assess adaptability, flexibility of UNICEF and its partners in the implementation of the
education interventions in a complex and multiple crisis environment with COVID 19 and socio-
economic and financial crisis, including facilitating and hindering factors.
i. Critically assess the overall relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of
the UNICEF Education programming.
ii. Critically analyze the factors that affected progress towards results and identify the extent to which
the UNICEF education program objectives are contributing to the Lebanon’s education sector
results; and
Page 2 of 12
iii. Provide strategic learning and actionable recommendations aimed at informing future education
programme design and implementation in UNICEF Lebanon. Learning should focus on providing
more information on what has worked or not and why,
iv. Identify and document implementation strategies that have proved to be effective in increasing
access and improving quality learning notably with regards to most vulnerable children (out-of-
school children, children with disability, and Syrian refugees).
v. Programmatically, this evaluation should also assess whether the education programme has
contributed to system strengthening, particularly regarding the production, utilization and
generalization of data and evidence, service delivery, awareness and advocacy and demand
creation interventions.
Objectives
(7) The specific objectives of the evaluation are:
i. Reconstruct the Theory of Change (ToC) for UNICEF education programme as it was
implemented in Lebanon and note the elements that enhanced or hindered achieving positive
impacts. This will serve as a basis to develop more focused Evaluation Questions and design.
ii. Recommend how the programme’s focus and ToC could be enhanced to have a positive impact
in the rapidly changing country context.
iii. Examine the extent to which UNICEF support to the education sector has been relevant, efficient,
and agile according to the context and changing/growing needs.
iv. Examine to what extent the program’s outputs contributed to the expected results. The areas of
attention will include:
a. Measuring the extent to which vulnerable children (including children with disabilities)
have been able to access (enroll, retain, and complete) the various education
opportunities supported by UNICEF
b. Functioning of data and information systems supported by UNICEF
c. Change in capacity of MEHE and related personnel (teachers and school personnel)
and organizations that UNICEF has supported.
d. Evidence of sustainability of results achieved by UNICEF and partners.
e. Evidence of strong partnerships and coordination mechanisms with Donors, sister UN
agencies and the education sector.
f. Evidence of internal coherence of the education programme and integrated
programming with Child Protection, WASH and YAD.
g. Evidence of how UNICEF education program is complementary (or not) with other
programs in the education sector by other actors (UNESCO, WB, UNHCR, etc.) with
clear division of labor, coordination, and minimal risk of duplication.
v. Identify good practices and gaps in the current interventions and recommend improvements or
strategic shifts needed.
Scope
(8) Programmatic Scope: This evaluation seeks to assess UNICEF Lebanon’s education
programme against the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development
Assistance Committee (OECD DAC) evaluation criteria, i.e., relevance, coherence, effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability of the education programme as per programme strategy document in terms
of major interventions, strategies, and results. This evaluation will examine the progress in all focus
areas of the education programmes, strategies implemented in both humanitarian and development
contexts. Further, it would examine the challenges and barriers encountered during the implementation
of the programme outputs and activities and understand the partnerships and collaborations/actors
employed in achieving the targets.
(9) Geographic Scope: The evaluation will be designed to assess UNICEF’s support to the education
programme and will focus on entire Lebanon, with visit to selected sites, schools, and municipalities.
(10) Timeline: This evaluation will examine the support provided by UNICEF through its education
programme from 2016 to 2021 (covering pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 contexts).
(11) What is not within the scope of this evaluation: The evaluation is not expected to make causal
attribution claims as UNICEF support is only one of the contributors to achieving the intended education
outcomes. A theory-based contribution analysis will be used as an approach to assess questions.
(12) Programmatic Risks, Challenges, and Limitations: Internal programmatic understanding
anticipates that the following risks and limitations may affect the evaluation or its outcomes.
1. Given the impact of COVID-19 on the programme, we are anticipating several challenges during
this evaluation:
• Disruption of ongoing programme due to COVID-19 related prevention measures may result
in the evaluation team observing disruption in programming, which is not a result or
Page 3 of 12
consequence of UNICEF programming. Whenever possible, pre-pandemic and pandemic
disaggregation should be considered.
• Due to the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evaluation team must consider
contingency plan for remote data collection in case face-to-face interactions become
unfeasible.
2. Rapidly deteriorating socio-economic situation in the country, and Beirut blast in 2020, have
affected staff turnover and morale of teachers and staff in government ministries. The evaluators
might have to interpret findings in the prevailing context and that programmatic results that were
achieved should not be clouded by current situations.
Use of findings
(13) This evaluation seeks to capture learning and recommendations for UNICEF’s support to
education in Lebanon in the upcoming country programme. The evaluation will help in understanding
the programme focus, approaches, strategies, and effectiveness of current modalities of
implementation. In addition to identifying bottlenecks and challenges in UNICEF’s approach, the findings
will also point to examples of good strategies/practices that can be further replicated or scaled up in the
next country programme.
Evaluation
(14) This evaluation will be assessed using criteria of relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency,
criteria and key
impact, and sustainability. These criteria are prioritized because they respond best to the evaluation
evaluation purpose and objectives. In addition, the evaluation will incorporate equity and gender equality
questions considerations as cross-cutting issues. Key evaluation questions (and sub-questions) are clustered
according to the evaluation criteria provided. This initial list of questions will be further refined and
unfolded by the evaluators and included in the Inception Report following desk review of key documents
and interview of evaluation users. Below is what should be under each criterion as per OECD/DAC.
(15) Relevance
o How aligned is UNICEF’s education programme with global priorities (UNICEF strategic plan, SDGs,
and core commitments to children)?
o How relevant is the UNICEF education programme and its interventions to the country context?
o How relevant is the UNICEF education programme to government priorities?
o What other mechanisms and approaches could UNICEF have used to achieve its programme
objectives, i.e., working differently and working on different things?
o How relevant is UNICEF’s programme in addressing inherent equity gaps – taking into consideration
any disparities
o To what extent has UNICEF been able to adapt its education strategies to changes in needs and
priorities caused by changing in country context, Covid-19, and socio economic and financial crisis?
(16) Effectiveness
o To what extent was UNICEF support effective in achieving its intended results, on the following levels:
▪ The overall expected outcome of UNICEF Education programme
▪ The contribution to the broader education goals
▪ Results at national and municipality levels, in all areas of focus
o To what extent has the Theory of Change (ToC) been followed in implementation of programmes to
achieve results identified in the Programme Strategy Notes (PSN)?
o What unintended consequences or effects did UNICEF support to the education programme have,
both positive and negative?
o In what ways and to what extent has the UNICEF education programming integrated an equity-based
approach into the design and implementation during the implementation? And how adequate is this
approach in addressing inherent equity gaps and taking into consideration the disparities?
o Does the UNICEF education programming actively contribute to the promotion of the right to
education, especially for the most vulnerable?
o In what ways and to what extent has the UNICEF education programme been gender responsive or
transformative?
(17) Efficiency

stakeholders’ expectations?
Page 4 of 12
o Did UNICEF have appropriate structures, and adequate resources (technical and financial) to deliver
its education programme? If there were any lack/problem in resources/capacity, how was this
addressed?
o To what extent was UNICEF able to effectively collaborate and coordinate externally with key
stakeholders, and leverage existing partnerships, to:
▪ be as efficient as possible for programme strengthening and improvement?
▪ ensure efficient use of existing platforms (service, community, and media delivery
platforms) and resources for educational activities?
▪ Advocate for policies and contributing to system strengthening?
o Were there any inefficiencies because UNICEF did not work with certain partners (or if UNICEF only
worked with the same set of partners)?
o Were appropriate monitoring and financial accountability mechanisms in place?
o How efficiently did UNICEF respond to equity-based challenges?
o To what extent are social and gender disaggregated data collected and monitored during the
programming?
(18) Coherence
o How does UNICEF’s work fit with the work of external partners (global partners, regional partners,
government, partner programmes/interventions)?
o How does UNICEF Education programme align with/fit with other interventions being carried out by
UNICEF?
o Are UNICEF interventions part of a coherent approach that is likely to have positive results, or are
there critical gaps?
o How does UNICEF Education programme support coordination at MEHE to ensure complementarity
and reduce duplication?
(19) Impact:
o What has been so far the impact of the UNICEF Education to the overall education sector in
Lebanon? Has UNICEF been able to leverage its impact e.g., by attracting other partners (private,
public, or other donors)?
o What approaches have the potential for further upscaling through work of UNICEF and its partners?
o What strategic shift is needed to maximize the impact of UNICEF support to education programming?
Are there choices to be made to focus more / scale up on specific areas and downsize / drop others
that might appear less essential or with less impact under the crisis, given the magnitude of the needs
and difficulties of schools to operate, teachers to teach, system to function, and limited learning
outcomes? What should be the utmost priority with the resources available?
(20) Sustainability
o What are the key barriers and bottlenecks towards achieving sustainability of UNICEF education
programming?
o To what extent have UNICEF support programmes been embedded in government programmes?
What are the interventions which were costed and advocated with the government?
o What are contributing factors and constraints that require attention to improve prospects of
sustainability of results?
o What are the critical lessons learned from the implementation of programme especially, related to
system strengthening, strategic partnerships, evidence generation and advocacy?
Evaluation
(21) Design: Overall study design for the evaluation will be theory-based contribution analysis. A
approach and
theory-based equity focused evaluation using contribution analysis will enable: 1). analysis of inputs
Methods leading to outputs and outcomes, and 2) analysis to focus on whether UNICEF’s approach is
appropriate to country context and effectively reaching the most marginalized. The evaluation team will
elaborate on the design or propose a more appropriate design and methodology to conduct the
evaluation during the inception phase. The evaluation design will be primarily based on a review of the
existing documents, monitoring data, field work and reconstruction of the programme theory with
appropriate indicators, borrowing from the programme documents.
The programme theory will be empirically tested through the collection and review of quantitative and
qualitative data. The programme theory will establish a logical model of cause-effect linkages by
exploring the delivery of results. Reconstructing the programme theory will be a critical first part of the
evaluation prior to conducting review of data and fieldwork and will be done through a combination of
documentary review and interviews with UNICEF programme staff and key stakeholders.
Page 5 of 12
(22) Methodology: The evaluation will employ a mixed-methodological approach to ensure that data
can be sufficiently triangulated to deliver aggregate quantitative and qualitative judgments. The
methodology should also apply a gender-response evaluation lens; equity and gender aspects will also
be present in the implementation phases of the qualitative component.
(23) Quantitative
o Secondary data analysis: using a data from Education Management Information System (EMIS)
and available raw datasets from studies, research, and evaluations. UNICEF Lebanon will
facilitate access to these datasets.
(24) Qualitative
o Key informant interviews (KIIs) with representatives from Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MEHE) and its technical agencies, municipal level officials and other relevant
government institutions, and representatives from key partners.
o Interview/ discussions with UNICEF programme specialists/Chiefs of Field Offices, and
implementing partners
o Focus group discussions (FGDs) with programme partners and beneficiaries.
o Observations during field visits to schools and implementing partners.
o Deep dive assessments at selected schools to understand governance, policy and structural
issues.
(25) Desk review
o Desk review of background documents related to government and UNICEF programming- RACE
documents, CPD, strategy notes, UNICEF Global Education strategy, UNICEFs Annual Reports,
RAM reports, Sitreps and reports and documentation etc.
o Review of good practices or case studies of focus areas
o Review and analysis of documentation on key lesson learning or areas /strategies not working
well.
(26) Sampling
Purposive sampling will be done for identification of key informants, partners, programme sites
and schools. The evaluators should ensure sufficient representation of key stakeholders for
interviews and focus groups.
(27) The following Gender considerations will be taken into account:
o Key informant Sex and age disaggregated indicators will be incorporated to monitor progress on
WASH.
o The evaluation team, involved in data collection should be gender balanced, with the division of
responsibilities as equally divided as possible.
o The evaluation team will ensure that locations for FGDs are easily accessible for female
participants and individuals with disabilities and that the date and time for FGDs will be set so as
not to interfere with women/girls, men/boys’ routines. Same-sex focus group discussions are
generally more valuable as women/girls may feel more comfortable speaking about certain topics
without the presence of men. Female moderators will be assigned to female participants in the
FGDs.
o Disclosure of incidents might occur during the field work; thus, the evaluators will undergo a
training held by UNICEF on handling disclosure and safe referrals to mitigate for such incidents.
o The evaluation team is expected to abide by the protocols provided by UNICEF through the
training.
o The final report should include a clear gender analysis of the impact of gender roles and norms
on the drivers of the intended behaviours.
(28) Data availability and information sources
The evaluation team is expected to assess evaluability and identify data gaps during
the inception phase and whether data needed to answer all evaluation questions can
be obtained. The evaluation matrix is expected to provide details of data and
information sources to answer each question. Information regarding UNICEF
interventions in the education sector is readily available and will be shared with the
evaluation team. However, evaluators will be expected to gather any other needed
information through interviews and observations during the data collection phase.
Potential Information Sources include, but are not limited to:
• Document Review that includes:
• UNICEF documents

Principles and
(33) The evaluation shall be carried out in accordance with the ethical principles and standards
Ethical Conduct
defined by the United Nations Evaluation Group:
of Evaluation
1. Confidentiality: The assessment must respect the rights of the persons providing information,
guaranteeing their anonymity and confidentiality.
2. Accountability: The report should identify any conflicts or differences of opinion that may have arisen
between the consultants and/or between the consultant and those responsible for the programme
component regarding the findings and/or recommendations of the evaluation. The entire team must
confirm the results presented, with any disagreements to be indicated.
3. Integrity: The evaluator will need to highlight issues not specifically identified in the Terms of Reference,
in order to obtain a more complete analysis of the program component.
4. Independence: The evaluation team must ensure that it remains independent of the program under
evaluation, and should not be associated with its management, implementation or any other element of
it.
5. Incidents: If problems arise during fieldwork, or at any other time during the evaluation, they should be
reported immediately to the Evaluation Manager. If this is not done, the existence of such problems can
in no way be used to justify the impossibility of achieving the results foreseen by UNICEF in these terms
of reference.
Validity of information: The consultant must ensure the accuracy of the information collected during
the preparation of the reports and will be responsible for the information presented in the final report.
Intellectual property: Using the different sources of information, the consultant must respect the
intellectual property rights of the institutions and communities consulted.
Submission of reports: If the submission of reports is postponed, or in the event that the quality of the
reports submitted is significantly lower than what has been agreed, the sanctions provided for in these
terms of reference will apply
(34) The evaluation consulting firm should adhere to the following UN and UNICEF norms and
standards and is expected to clearly identify any potential ethical issues and approaches, as well as
the processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation process in their proposal. Copies of all
these documents will be provided upon request:
• United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Standards for Evaluation in the UN System
• United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms for Evaluation in the UN System, including
impartiality, independence, quality, transparency, consultative process
• Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations and the UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in research,
evaluation, data collection and analysis will guide the overall process
• UNICEF adapted evaluation report standards and GEROS
• The evaluation should incorporate the human rights-based and gender perspective and be based
on results based management principles and logical framework analysis, in compliance with UNEG
guidelines on gender and human rights.

(35) The evaluation team is required to clearly identify any potential ethical issues and approaches,
as well as the processes for ethical review and oversight of the evaluation process in their proposal.
Owing to the envisaged participation of human subjects in the evaluation, the evaluation team should
seek ethical review board approval either from a recognized Institutional Review Board in Lebanon or
via UNICEF’s LTA for ethical approval.

Annex 6: Ethical protocol
Ethical protocol
For “Evaluation of UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme (2016-2022)”
The following document discusses ethical issues involved in the “Evaluation of UNICEF Lebanon
Education Programme (2016-2022)”. It presents procedures which enable the implementation of the
research in a manner consistent with the highest standards of ethics and with best practice for research
with human subjects. The team members are required to familiarize themselves with this document and
follow the procedures it outlines while conducting research activities. Further relevant procedures form
part of the overall quality assurance process set up in the project.
Involvement of stakeholders in research
The “Evaluation of UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme (2016-2022)” will involve human subjects.
Therefore, it has to comply with the highest standards of ethics, including in particular UNICEF
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis and UNEG
Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation.
During the evaluation, we will consult eight groups of people:
Category 1: UNICEF staff;
Category 2: Government actors;
Category 3: Donor representatives;
Category 4: UN agencies representatives;
Category 5: Implementing Partners/CSOs/NGOs (both at national and sub-national level);
Category 6: Local level government actors;
Category 7: Schools’ managers, teachers and other personnel;
Category 8: Parents/caregivers of the children.
Even though children will not be among our respondents, other participants may display vulnerabilities.
We expect that this could in particular be the case of parents from vulnerable groups, including parents
of children with disabilities, refugee families, minority groups, or persons who are economically and
educationally disadvantaged, and whom the research may potentially expose to psychological and
social risks. Moreover, within the evaluation, we will seek insight and opinions from government and
school personnel of different level, which may potentially involve sensitive or critical opinions of higher-
level organizational hierarchies, which may put those individuals in employment risk. Additionally,
multiple crises context puts government officials, implementing organizations’ and schools’ personnel,
as well as parents/caregivers in a challenging and less comfortable position to participate in research.
This should also be accounted for while conducting research with their involvement.
We will use three main data collection methods – individual interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs)
and Ripple Effects Mapping (REM). The researchers will collect various types of data, including personal
data, from the above mentioned participants. The extent of personal data collection will depend on the
specific cooperation with UNICEF and its implementing partners as our gatekeepers. The exact shape
of that cooperation will be decided in the course of data collection, so for the purpose of this protocol,
we assume the widest possible data collection and, consequently, the highest standards. In the course
of the evaluation, we will collect the following types of data:
For the purpose of arranging data collection – respondents’ name and surname, email and/or phone
number, if relevant in conjunction with information on the service that they offer or use. This can take the
form of lists of potential respondents provided by gatekeepers.
Interview/FGDs recordings, if consent to recording was explicitly provided;
Interview, FGDs and REM notes/reports and/or transcripts, depending on the need.
Personal data will thus be collected for the purpose of organizing data collection. We foresee
pseudonymization of interview, FGDs and REM recordings and notes/transcripts, as part of our
procedures (see below); however, it cannot be excluded that some of the information contained therein,
even if not explicitly referring to a specific person, will be easily traceable to such a person. Further care
will, therefore, need to be taken at the stage of analysis and reporting so as not to accidentally disclose
such information.
Basic personal information of participants of the group-based data collection methods envisaged, FGDs
and REM, including name and surname and role/affiliation information, will be disclosed to the other
meeting participants. In the course of research, we will ensure that a safe space for sharing the views
in presence of others is created at all times. We will also make sure that the participants share only a
minimum level of personal information that they are comfortable with. We will also offer an opportunity
to participate in individual interviews to those respondents who do not feel comfortable with proposed
group formats.
Moreover, limited secondary data on children beneficiaries, regarding participation in programme
activities and education data (enrolment, performance), will be included in the study. The data will be
anonymized for the purposes of analysis, and results of analysis at an aggregate level will be reported.
Discussion of the benefits and harms of participation
The research should carry clear benefits for its participants and these benefits should outweigh any
possible harms. Participants should understand both those aspects to make an informed choice about
their participation.
We see the following three main benefits for participants:
Participation in the evaluation is an opportunity for all parties to have their voice heard in
relation to the programme assessed. Their voice will be taken into account while developing
reporting documents, conclusions and recommendations.
The research can give rise to specific actions in line with respondents’ feedback. This, in
turn, can lead to better services and support provided.
School level beneficiaries who will take part in REM method will also have an opportunity to
summarize the results achieved, learn from each other and gain motivation for further work.
With substantial benefits that participants can draw from this research, there are possible harms which
could materialize. We assess those as unlikely, both in view of the research team’s experience and the
evaluation’s overall design, yet they are still possible and have to be taken into consideration. These
harms could include, for example:
The fact that, in some cases, participation may trigger memories of painful experiences.
This could potentially relate to data collection involving parents/caregivers of children from
vulnerable groups, e.g. including parents of children with disabilities, refugee families,
minority groups, or persons who are economically and educationally disadvantaged. This
risk cannot be excluded also for the research participants from the Beirut area, with relation
to the Beirut blast that occurred during the evaluated period and may be related to in the
context of the study.
Data breaches, even if adequate procedures are put in place. They could still occur as a
result of a mistake or accident, etc.
Situations when, in the course of research, respondents report instances of abuse or
another serious concern which would require immediate reaction or attention from UNICEF
or its implementing partners. Such instances would constitute a limitation on privacy and
confidentiality and could trigger reporting from Ecorys to a relevant entity, so the respondent
could be involved in a resulting process.
Apart from that, we are aware that, in all cases, we will be asking for individuals’ time. While not a harm,
it may be an inconvenience, so it should be factored into the work on data collection, e.g. through
minimization of the data collection to data that cannot be collected otherwise.
The evaluation, including in particular its data collection component, was designed with ethical
considerations in mind. In order to more comprehensively address these considerations, maximize the
benefits of participation and prevent or minimize the possible harms, we also developed this ethical
protocol. Some of the safeguards that we applied and will continue to apply in the course of research
include:
Meticulous team selection and preparation;
Cooperation with UNICEF and other gatekeepers;
Minimization of data collection, in particular with respect to personal data collection;
Informed consent procedure;
Creation of a safe environment for interactions with participants;
Response procedures for safety concerns and grievances;
Procedures for protection of privacy and confidentiality, including:
o de-identification of data through pseudonymization or anonymization,
o minimization of access to data, and other physical and procedural data protection
measures;
Removal of data following acceptance of the service.
Specific requirements and procedures
1. Preparation of team members
a. Team members are required to abide by the laws, regulations and other binding legal standards of
the countries in which they conduct research activities.
b. Team members are required to familiarize themselves with and abide by the UNICEF Procedure for
Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis which is easily available at:
www.unicef-irc.org/research-facilitation.html. All procedures applied and followed in this evaluation are
without prejudice to the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data
Collection and Analysis.
c. Team members are also required to follow the procedures as described in Ecorys’ offer and revised
in the Inception report, in particular ethical principles which have also been included below in pt. 2 of
this protocol.
d. If in the course of the evaluation a question of an ethical nature arises, it is to be resolved in
consultation with the Team Leader and Deputy Team Leader, and when it cannot be resolved
independently by Ecorys—also with UNICEF.
e. Team members are required to take part in training related to ethical standards organized by Ecorys.
The current protocol should be shared with all evaluation team members prior to the training.
2. Research principles
As noted in the Inception report, the evaluation is conducted in accordance with the following principles:
Principle 1. Safety
Principle 2. Transparency
Principle 3. Voluntary participation
Principle 4. Privacy
Principle 5. Confidentiality of data
Principle 6. Reciprocity
3. Cooperation with UNICEF and other gatekeepers
a. In accessing respondents, team members are required to closely cooperate with UNICEF, UNICEF’s
partners implementing specific services or other gatekeepers, among others, (1) to minimize the extent
of collection and sharing of respondents’ personal data, and (2) to create a safer environment for
respondents to engage with the evaluation team.
b. Sharing of potential respondents’ personal data between the evaluation team and UNICEF, UNICEF’s
partners implementing specific services or other gatekeepers should be minimized. This means, for
example, that such data should be shared in bulk (in one round) rather than over multiple exchanges.
This will facilitate its protection and, eventually, removal.
4. Informed consent procedure
a. Informed consent has to be obtained from all research participants before they engage in research.
While a written consent is not required if it is explicitly provided orally, it is preferrable. Alternative
consent procedures (such as clicking on a link to confirm consent) will also be employed for online
interviews, where needed. In any event, the consent has to be explicit and active.
b. Team members who carry out interviews and group discussions are required to obtain the
interviewee’s informed consent prior to the interview. The informed consent forms have been provided
in the Inception report as Annex 5.2-5.4. The informed consent forms will be shared with all team
members prior to the training on ethical issues to be organized by Ecorys. Interviewers will carry with
them printed informed consent forms for in-person interviews.
c. The steps involved in obtaining the informed consent include:
1. Providing the interviewee with the Informed Consent Form prior to the interview (e.g. a
printed copy for in-person interviews, or via email or over a communicator used for online
meetings),
2. Providing the interviewee with enough time to familiarize themselves with the Informed
Consent Form,
3. Researcher’s presentation of themselves and Ecorys,
4. Presentation of the evaluation, including the reason why a particular activity is undertaken,
5. Presentation of what will happen during the interview, possible risks and benefits of
participation,
6. Clear information that if information concerning abuse is revealed, the researcher will report
this fact to the evaluation Team Leader and Deputy Team Leader, and possibly also to
UNICEF,
7. Clear information that participation is voluntary,
8. Clear information that the interviewee can refuse to participate or resign at any point, and
that neither refusal nor resignation carry any negative consequences,
9. Taking questions from the respondent,
10. Information that if a person agrees then they should sign the form (alternatively oral
confirmation whether the interviewee agrees or not to take part in an interview),
11. Information that if a person agrees to recording they should explicitly express that by oral
confirmation at the beginning of the recording.
d. The information listed under pt. c. above has to be clearly enunciated in addition to being provided in
writing as part of the Informed Consent Form. If prior provision of the Informed Consent Form to the
interviewee was not possible, it is the more important to take time to go through steps 3-11 above.
e. The interviewer can record the interview only for the purpose of internal reporting. If the interviewer
would like to record the interview, they need to obtain a separate explicit consent for recording. The
purpose of recording, i.e. to facilitate internal reporting, should be clearly articulated prior to the initiation
of recording. To the extent possible, no personal data of the interviewee should be recorded.
f. If a written consent cannot be provided, the team member should make sure that it is explicitly given
orally or via other methods which ensure that consent is explicit and actively provided.
5. Creating a safe environment for interviewees
a. Prior and during the interviews, the interviewer needs to make sure that the conditions in which the
interview is taking place offer safety. In particular any risks (physical, psychological, social and
economic) have to be considered beforehand and mitigation strategies prepared. The interviewer should
weigh the risks against benefits. If the former outweigh the latter, they should resign from interviewing a
given person. These considerations relate both to in-person and online interviews.
b. Interviewees should be treated with utmost respect.
c. The interviewee should be given a choice when it comes to:
The medium of communication (e.g. MS Teams, Webex, Zoom, Skype, phone, in person etc.),
Interview date,
Interview time and duration, as well as breaks,
Any follow up, e.g. they should be asked whether they would like to receive any further
information about research results, whether they would be open to further contact, if questions
arise.
d. In setting up and conducting the interview, the interviewer should respect the interviewees’
commitments, in particular work obligations or duties of care towards children or other family members,
etc.
e. Prior to the interview, the interviewer is required to familiarize themselves with all background
information to understand the interviewee’s position in relation to the evaluation.
f. If, during the interview, the interviewee declines to answer a question, this should be respected.
g. If, during the interview, the interviewee would like to take a break or reschedule, this should be
respected.
h. If, during the interview, the interviewee wants to resign from participation, they should not be solicited
to continue; although the interviewer may confirm whether the participant truly would like to resign.
i. Once the interview is concluded, participants should be thanked for their participation and should
receive feedback on how the information they shared will be used further and when and where, if
possible, they could see the results.
6. Procedures in cases assistance or referrals are needed
a. In case abuse or any other serious concern pertaining to UNICEF-related services is revealed, the
interviewer is obliged to report this to the evaluation Team Leader and Deputy Team Leader. If deemed
needed, the Team Leader will further report such cases to UNICEF. The interviewee should be informed
about this during the Informed Consent Procedure.
b. Should any unexpected need for assistance occur, especially lifesaving, or incidents related to any
form of violence, there is an ethical obligation to provide respondents with information about services
that could help their situation. If referrals are needed, the following procedure is engaged:
• The interviewer asks the respondent if they would like support from a referral service by
saying “Would you like me to give you the contact information of an organization that may
be able to provide you with support?”
• If respondent says YES, interviewer notifies UNICEF Child Protection unit and provides
respondent with contact information for a social service agency.
• Interviewer reassures respondent that the information they have given is confidential, and
that they can use the contact information to seek help if they wish.
• Upon consent to receive referral information, the interviewer must inform the participant
that they are required to notify their supervisor, but that this is confidential.
• Where a respondent refuses referral information, the interviewer will remind them that all
information given is confidential, and that they can change their mind at any time about
receiving the information. The interviewer will not force anyone to receive information.
• The respondent will be reminded that if they have any additional questions or complaints
about the study, they can use the contact information provided in the Informed Consent
Form.
• Interviewers will not give any advice or encourage respondents to contact the referral
service.
• Interviewers will not make any statements or promises about the kind of services that may
be received or requirements from the referral organisation.
7. Protecting privacy and confidentiality
a. The researchers should minimize collection of data, in particular any personal data. Only that data
which is indispensable should be gathered.
b. Data collected during the evaluation can only be processed in connection to this evaluation and to
fulfil its explicit objectives.
c. Only evaluation team members or, upon explicit request, UNICEF staff can have access to data
collected during the evaluation. Team members have access to data to the extent that it is required to
fulfil their roles within the evaluation.
d. Team members are prohibited from disclosing personal data of interviewees to anyone apart from
other evaluation team members and, upon explicit request, UNICEF staff.
e. When personal data of research participants needs to be shared, such exchanges should be
minimized, i.e. data should be shared once, rather than over multiple exchanges. Any personal data can
only be shared in password protected files.
f. The names of all interview recordings, interview notes/reports and transcripts produced during the
evaluation should be coded so as to de-identify the interviewees. The list of interviewees with
corresponding codes which allows for tracing of a given recording, note/report or transcript to a specific
interviewee should be stored separately and should be password protected. Access to such a list should
be strictly limited.
g. To the extent possible, as stated above, interview recordings should not contain the interviewee’s
personal data. The interview notes/reports and transcripts should be written in a way which does not
reveal personal data. If there is a risk that interview notes/reports and transcripts may contain personal
data, they should be shared in password protected files.
h. Since it is impossible to control what the interviewee discloses, sharing of interview recordings even
between evaluation team members should be minimized to instances when it is absolutely necessary.
This can happen e.g. when it would not be possible to report on an interview otherwise. When recordings
are shared, the files need to be password protected.
i. In all reports from the evaluation, the findings should be summarized to an appropriate level of
aggregation, particularly in the instance of clear negative impacts such as stigma and reprisals. The
implications of the findings and any potential negative repercussions for particular groups should be
considered and measures should be taken to frame the findings in such a way so as to avoid these
consequences. Where findings significantly impact (negatively) on the well-being of groups or
individuals, public disclosure and, where relevant, disclosure to specific stakeholders should be
reconsidered.
j. During the evaluation, data should be processed in an electronic format as much as possible. Unless
more practical given the context (e.g. during local fieldwork), no hard copies of documents should be
required and stored, in particular no hard copies of filled out Informed Consent Forms should be kept.
In case such documents are provided in hard-copy form, they should be scanned to an electronic format
and processed in line with standards outlined above, in particular, their sharing should be minimized
and files containing filled-out consent forms need to be password-protected. Any hard copies should
therefore be destroyed in an irreversible way, using dedicated shredding devices.
k. Evaluation team members are obliged to protect data collected during the evaluation, in particular
they have to make sure that access to such data on their devices is limited and password protected.
Evaluation team members are obliged to regularly change the password that protects data collected
during the evaluation.
l. Once the tasks of a given team member are successfully completed, the Team Leader will request a
given team member to remove all data related to the evaluation from their devices. The team member
is required to immediately proceed with data removal.
m. Ecorys will store all data necessary for reporting to UNICEF on its secure internal server. All files
containing personal data collected during the evaluation will be additionally password protected. Only
Ecorys staff directly involved in the evaluation will access the personal data collected during the
evaluation.
n. Ecorys will remove all personal data related to the evaluation upon successful completion of the
project confirmed by UNICEF in writing. Once confirmation is received, the data will be removed from
the Ecorys server by the Team Leader with the assistance of the Ecorys’ IT expert to make sure that it
was removed in its entirety without possible restoration. The Team Leader will also make sure that all
team members have removed all data related to the evaluation from their devices.
Annex 7: Data collection instruments
7.1. Informed consent form or in-depth interviews
UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme Evaluation
Interview Participant Informed Consent Form
In December 2022, Ecorys Poland based in Warsaw was commissioned by UNICEF Lebanon to carry out the “Evaluation
of UNICEF Lebanon Education Programme (2016-2022)”.
The purpose is to provide UNICEF Lebanon with an assessment of UNICEF’s efforts in the field of education in Lebanon.
We will assess the extent to which the Education Programme activities are being implemented. We will also look at how
these activities are meeting the needs of children at school age, their families, and education sector stakeholders. Finally,

impact mapping evaluation project will help us better understand the various and complex
effects of the programme, on individual participants, groups, schools and communities
involved. This mapping evaluation provides a method of visually illustrating the impact of the
programme to acknowledge what has been achieved and identify what could still be improved.
Introduction 5 min
Please, introduce yourself briefly and your role within the school.
Peer-to-peer interviews 15 min
A. Find a partner (not a good friend)
B. Share a brief story about how the programme activities made a difference in your school.
Please take notes on your stories and share them with the moderator.
Mapping 75 min
A. Explain the three levels of ripples and that the purpose of this tool is to better understand
the impact of our work by thinking about it as a pebble or boulder in the school/ learning space
pond. Think about the whole school/local community and avoid overlooking some aspects. (5
minutes)
B. Begin mapping the first ripple by asking, “What is different now than it was in 2016? How
has the school/ learning space changed? What are people (authorities, school management,
teachers, educators, parents, students) doing differently?” Put the items generated during the
first ripple discussion on the map. Continue until all stories have been captured and rippled
Probe for more ideas by asking about changes/activities not yet mentioned:
• Has anything changed in the way teachers/educators are recruited?
• Has anything changed in the way teachers/educators are evaluated?
• Has anything changed in the way teachers/educators are paid and rewarded?
• Has anything changed in the workload of teachers/educators?
• Has anything changed in the way the school/learning space is managed?
• Has anything changed in the way students are educated/approached?
• Has anything changed in the way students relate to each other?
• Did the participants [teachers/educators] attended any training? What kind? What
effects do participants see from these trainings?
• Has anything changed in terms of access to new technologies for
students/teachers/educators/school management? (Prompt: Has an online learning
platform been introduced for students, teachers, educators?)
• Has anything changed in access to school/learning space or specific educational
activities for girls/students with disabilities/non-Lebanese students? Has there been a
change in the number of female students, students with disabilities and non-Lebanese
students?
• Has anything changed regarding child protection mechanisms at school/learning
space?
• Have renovations been carried out at the school? What these are exactly? How have
these affected the accessibility of the school/learning space?
• Has anything changed with regard to the provision of clean water, toilets, cleaning
products and hygiene items in schools/learning space?
• Has anything changed in terms of art, music, sport and science equipment at the
school/learning space?
• Has anything changed in the school's/learning space’s financial situation? Has the
school received additional funding for any types of (educational) expenditure?
• Has anything changed in terms of languages of instruction in schools/learning spaces?
(40 minutes)
C. Begin mapping the second ripple by focusing on items in the first ripple and using questions
like “Who is benefitting from the change and how?” “How is the fact that people are doing
things differently affecting others?” “What resulted from the change?” “Are these changes
sustainable?” (15 minutes)
▪ Use a different colour, so the ripples are evident in the colour scheme.
▪ Draw an arrow from the item in the first ripple to the item in the second. Sometimes
there are multiple arrows. The arrows will show the process by which change was
accomplished, which can inform new efforts.
D. Begin mapping the third ripple by asking the question, “What changes are you seeing in the
whole community? Are everyday ways of thinking and doing changing? How?” (10 minutes)
▪ Use a new colour so the ripples are evident in the colour scheme.
▪ Use an arrow to link items in the second ripple to those in the third ripple.
E. Finally, ask, “What do you think is the most significant change on the map? Why?” Use red
to star those items. (5 minutes)
Reflection and closing 20 min
Initiate a brief discussion on how this reflection process could provide insights into next steps.
“What have we learned from the mapping”? “Could anything have been done better?” “Is there
a change that should have happened and didn't?” “What should we do next, what are the
critical steps? You may use the map to identify impact concentration and gaps.
Thank the participants for engaging in the Ripple Effects Mapping exercise and discuss the
next steps: the map will be photographed, digitised and encoded by research team. The
original map may remain in the school/learning space as evidence of the change achieved.
The results of the REM discussion will be presented using mind mapping software - XMind. The data
produced in the mapping process will be then downloaded into a spreadsheet program and coded by
the research team. No other reporting is required.

7. A drinking water station with safe drinking
water is available at school/learning space
1 A place can be considered to meet the needs of people with reduced mobility if it meets the following conditions: can be accessed without stairs or steps, in case of toilets: handrails for support are
attached either to the floor or sidewalls, the door is at least 80 cm wide, the toilet has a raised seat (between 40–48 cm from the floor), a backrest and the cubicle has space for circulation/
manoeuvring (150 x 150 cm). The sink, tap and water outside should also be accessible and the top of the sink 75 cm from the floor (with knee clearance). Switches for lights, where relevant, should
also be at an accessible height (max 120 cm).
8. Facility has a sufficient number of improved
toilets for students and teachers/educators2
9. All toilets are available and usable3
10. All toilets have a functioning handwashing
station within 5 metres4
