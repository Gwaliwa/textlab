1 Country Context and Jordan-
UNICEF Country Programme (2018-
2022)
1.1. Country Context
Demographic context
1. The population of Jordan is 10.8 million, with 51% of people under the age of 30 and 32%
children.1 This offers a vast demographic window of opportunity to better engage the country’s
youth economically, socially, and civically, yet, 37% of Jordanians aged 15 to 24 are unemployed
(76.2% male and 23.8% female).2 A mismatch between the skills of recent high school graduates
and the need of the economy continues to constrain youth from realizing their potential and
hampers economic growth.3
2. The results of the last census show that the population of Jordan reaching 9,531,712 people in
2015. Of these, 6.6 million were Jordanians, or about 69%, and about 31% non-Jordanians. Jordan
hosts nearly 3 million non-Jordanians, including 1.3 million Syrians4, of whom 656,000 were
registered as refugees as of February 2017.5 The population is unequally distributed, with 75% of
the population living in three governorates (out of 12), and 42% in the Amman governorate
alone.6
Socio-economic context
3. In Jordan, the incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas, with one third of the poor living in
those areas and the remaining two thirds living in urban areas.7 People living in hard-to-reach
areas, including the 5.9% of Syrians currently living in ‘informal tented settlements’8, are
particularly vulnerable.
4. There exist complexities around the children of the 140,000 Palestinian refugees from Gaza, who
are classified in a different category than prior Palestinian refugees and face specific legal
challenges to gain citizenship.9

Covid-19 context
5. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the existing socio-economic challenges in Jordan exposing
the fragility of SMEs which form the core of the economy, vulnerable households and the
challenges facing youth entering the labour market.
6. Jordan's unemployment rate went down by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2022 to 22.8%, compared
with the same quarter of 2021, according to the Department of Statistics (DoS - June 20, 2022);
while the unemployment rate for men dropped by 3.7%, it grew by 3% for women.
Unemployment rates differ by educational level and gender - 24.6% of unemployed males hold a
bachelor's degree or higher compared to 78.7% of unemployed females. At the governorate level,
Mafraq has the highest unemployment rate of 28.7%, while Zarqa has the lowest rate of 19.2%.10
1.2. Government response to development challenges
7. In response to the above issues, the Government of Jordan (GoJ) adopted the National Vision and
Strategy (2025), which renews its focus on integrated social and economic development,
capitalizing on the demographic transition as the country’s large generation of young people
move into working age.
8. The Jordan Poverty Reduction Strategy 2013–2020 was developed before the refugee crisis, but
the Government and its partners have leveraged international support to respond to the impact
of the influx of refugees. Other GoJ’s responses include the adoption of the National Social
Protection Strategy (2019-2025), the expansion of the National Aid Fund (NAF), and the response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
9. To address the health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, the GoJ developed a series of
plans and programmes to support vulnerable households and workers, and implemented
measures designed to support businesses, including delayed tax payments, partial payments of
salaries, and special loan programmes for small- and medium-sized enterprises. It launched its
COVID-19 vaccination programme in January 2021, which includes equitable access to vaccines
for anyone residing in Jordan (including refugees).

1.3. The Jordan-UNICEF Country Programme
Programme objectives and focus
10. The Jordan Country Programme 2018-2022 (CP) supports the GoJ’s National Vision and Strategy
2025 and the Jordan Response Plan and is rooted in the overall UNICEF 2018-2021 Strategic Plan.
The CP focuses on the most vulnerable children, in policy engagement and advocacy as well in
programme management and service delivery, to reduce the growing disparities in the country.
11. In bolstering national capacity systems and resilience of national systems, UNICEF has placed
emphasis on strengthening government systems at all levels, from policy level to the planning,
monitoring and overall management of services within communities, in order to improve the
quality, accessibility and inclusivity of basic services for all children.
12. UNICEF’s approach and support aimed to contribute to the establishment of a comprehensive
national social protection system that reaches all children in Jordan. This meant addressing the
structural and intergenerational dimensions of inequity – targeting vulnerable children from all
nationalities, including those involved in labour, living with disabilities and those from
marginalized minority groups.
13. UNICEF maintains that its work in systems strengthening is based on the belief that it is essential
to build the resilience of national institutions and communities against the protracted regional
crisis as well as any future acute shocks. It is further argued that a medium to longer-term
perspective is required to enable effective policy engagement and comprehensive capacity
development at all levels that will result in more cost-efficient and sustainable actions.
Programme budget
14. The CP-funded budget is USD 755 million for the 2018-2022 period. Budget allocation per
Component is shown in Figure 1.1. Considering the scope of the challenge, the CP budget is large
and reflects the supplemental resources which are much larger than the regular CP budget funds.

Expected Programme Results
15. The expected overall outcome of the Programme is that all vulnerable children in Jordan are
healthy, educated, resilient, tolerant, innovative, critical thinkers and agents of positive change in
their communities (see Figure 1.2). At the next layer, the Country Programme has six specific
expected outcomes which align with UNICEF’s 2018-2021 Global Strategic Plan five goal areas.
The Expected Outcomes are outlined in the Results and Resources Framework (RRF) 2018-2022
from the Country Programme Document (CPD), which has been revised following the COVID-19
outbreak.11 Each one of these outcomes is associated with a particular section of work.

Programme Implementation Approach: The Vulnerability Approach
16. A Geographic Multidimensional Vulnerability12 Analysis was executed to support the programme
implementation.13 Recognizing the protracted nature of the Syrian crisis, the UNICEF 2018-2022
CP shifted from the narrower focus on refugee children to a broader vulnerability-based approach
that aims ultimately at reaching all vulnerable children in the country, regardless of status, ability,
or nationality. UNICEF’s vulnerability approach in Jordan argues that it enables the organization
to promote social cohesion among children of various nationalities and backgrounds, between
boys and girls and through the life cycle of interventions.
Programme Components
17. The Programme has six components which are briefly described below. For more information
regarding the Programme components, refer to Appendix XII.
Health and Nutrition
18. The health and nutrition component involves interventions aimed at responding to Jordan’s
humanitarian and developmental priority needs. To achieve equitable access to quality health and
nutrition services for every child, UNICEF works to strengthen the capacity of national health
systems and prioritises actions that have the greatest impact on vulnerable children. Key
stakeholders include the Ministry of Health, Health Accreditation Council, Jordan University of
Science and Technology (JUST), International Medical Corps and HumaniTerra International. Key
initiatives include:
▪ Supporting quality maternal and newborn care through the 'Mother-Baby Friendly
Hospital' network with newborn intensive care, pediatric units and breastfeeding
promotion;
▪ Scaling up nutrition interventions that reduce micronutrient deficiencies and obesity
among children;
▪ Reaching the most vulnerable children with mobile integrated services, including health,
nutrition and early detection and early intervention services;
▪ Rolling out the School Health Initiative to access the growth and health status of
children, and to educate them on healthy behaviours;
▪ Providing mobile vaccination to reach children missed by routine immunization services;
▪ Improving the reach of primary health care services to reach the most marginalized
children and strengthening the cold chain.14
Education
19. The education component involves interventions aimed at the humanitarian and developmental
needs of Jordan by providing quality education for all vulnerable children of school age, including
12 UNICEF defines vulnerability as follows: “Vulnerability is the interaction between both exposure to risk and one’s capacity to respond
and cope. The focus on economic and social vulnerability in UNICEF’s definition is based on an understanding of poverty and deprivation
as multi-dimensional and dynamic. Social protection programmes and policies must address both social and economic vulnerabilities
together, along with their underlying drivers.”

Syrian refugees in camps. This includes ensuring access to all levels of education, improving quality
and outcomes, creating a safe learning environment, and providing alternative non-formal
education programmes. Key stakeholders include the Ministry of Education, Mercy Corps, MECI,
Quest Scope, Madrasati, Islamic Charity Society and East Amman Charity. UNICEF's evidence-
based education interventions for children include:
▪ Supporting the Government to build a more inclusive and accessible education system
for all children, including making all public schools inclusive by 2028.
▪ Supporting quality preschool education and stimulating caregiving services for all
children. This includes supporting the Government to achieve the universalization of
Kindergarten (KG) 2 by 2025 through:
- Opening new KG classrooms in refugee camps and in community-based centres
across Jordan and mainstreaming play-based and child-centred learning in the
curriculum and teacher training;
- Strengthening the system for KG provision through a one-stop shop for licensing,
quality assurance and capacity building of teachers and service providers;
- Implementing an innovative cash-transfer programme for families in the most
vulnerable districts to enable them to enroll their children in KG 2.
▪ Supporting the provision of non-formal education, certified by the Ministry of Education
and available for children and adolescents aged 9-20 years who are outside of formal
education.
▪ Bringing together education, youth engagement and child protection programmes to
help create a better learning environment for children and youth in Jordan, including:
- Support scaling the capacity of the Ministry of Education to improve teacher
performance and motivation to improve student learning;
- Supporting safe learning environments, including for children with disabilities;
- Enhancing social cohesion for all young people;
- Stepping up prevention, reporting and response to violence against children.15
Child Protection
20. The child protection component contributions support a robust legislative environment and
strong national capacity to plan, budget for and implement projects that prevent and respond to
violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect of children. The key stakeholders include National
Commission for Family Affairs, Ministry of Social Development, Makani, Family and Juvenile
Protection Department and Ministry of Justice. Key initiatives include:
▪ Reaching boys, girls and women at risk for violence and exploitation with an integrated
package of quality child protection and gender-based violence prevention and
responsive services;
▪ Providing children with psychosocial support through Makani centres (over 110,000);
▪ Equipping children, families and communities with the knowledge and skills they need
to protect themselves and reduce violence - including bullying;
▪ Improving the conditions of shelters and providing quality services for survivors of
violence;

▪ Promoting positive parenting skills to parents and caregivers to create violence-free
homes;
▪ Advocating for legislative and policy reform for children, including the Childhood Law
and Juvenile Law.16.
Adolescents and Youth
21. The adolescent and youth section works closely with the government, civil society, and the private
sector to empower young people to positively and actively engage in society - and to ensure that
every young person is in education, learning, training or employment by 2030. Considering the
scope of the challenge, a key focus is on using UNICEF’s investment to leverage partnerships and
encourage wider investment involving key stakeholders such as Ministry of Youth, Luminus, GFP
and Makani. Key initiatives include:
▪ Providing education, life skills and training to effectively support young people in their
transition from school to work, and support youth to access meaningful employment
and self-employment;
▪ Supporting young people to become future ready through Innovation Lab programmes;
▪ Providing meaningful opportunities for young people to engage in their community
through volunteering;
▪ Scaling up innovative partnerships with private sector and civil society organizations.17
Social Policy and Social Protection
22. UNICEF provides an integrated package of support for the most vulnerable children and youth in
Jordan, while also supporting the GoJ to develop and implement social protection and poverty
reduction strategies. Key stakeholders are the Ministry of Social Development and National Aid
Fund. These interventions include:
▪ Spearheading the network of 151 Makani "My Space" centres supporting over 177,000
children, youth and parents, with access to safe learning opportunities - as well as
integrated community-based child protection, early childhood development, life skills
and social innovation training;
▪ The Hajati cash transfer programme - a monthly child grant to allow vulnerable girls and
boys to enroll, and stay, in school;
▪ Providing technical support to strengthen national systems, including National Aid
Fund, to more effectively reach the most vulnerable children and their families;
▪ Supporting the development of a child-friendly and equity-focused national social
protection and poverty reduction strategy;
▪ Generating evidence to inform policy, including the development of a national
Multidimensional Poverty Index, and undertaking frequent monitoring of children,
youth and women in Jordan to better understand the impact of the changing economic
situation on families.18.

Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
23. The WASH component is focused on interventions aimed at responding to the country’s
humanitarian and development priority needs. UNICEF supports immediate, sustainable, and high
impact projects, with a focus on water and environmental conservation, to increase access to
safely managed water and sanitation services for the most vulnerable children and their families.
Working closely with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and key stakeholders, UNICEF
interventions support policies and strategies that improve the water supply and sanitation
infrastructure in cities, schools, refugee camps and at community and household levels. The
interventions also promote social cohesion and equitable access to water and sanitation for the
most vulnerable children, including:
▪ Supporting vulnerable families in host communities with improved water systems and
wastewater infrastructure that are sustainable and climate resilient and expanding
coverage to unreached areas;
▪ Improving WASH facilities and improving hygiene behaviours in host community
schools;
▪ Providing Syrian refugees in camps and hard-to-reach areas with access to an adequate
quantity of safe water (tankering and water infrastructure) and appropriate sanitation
facilities;
▪ Building and operating of cost-effective and sustainable water and wastewater networks
in Azraq and Za'atari refugee camps, improving both the quality of the water supply and
its equitable distribution and improving the lives of over 100,000 refugee children and
their families;
▪ Scaling up alternative water technologies, including water saving and reuse, and
engaging children as agents of change on water conservation, in communities and
through school Environment Clubs.19
COVID-19 Response
24. Cognizant of the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic was unprecedented and would hit the most
vulnerable families in Jordan the hardest, the Jordan Country Programme 2018-2022 contributed
to the country’s response to COVID-19. UNICEF mobilized resources urgently to address COVID-
related emergency needs – including water, sanitation, social protection, and education, among
others. UNICEF Jordan’s COVID-19 response aimed to keep families safe, while minimizing the
impact of secondary shocks caused by the outbreak and related control measures such as school
closures, overburdened local health systems, increased protection risks in the home and
economic pressures. The activities supported by UNICEF to deal with the COVID-19 and their
results are further analysed in section 4.4.1.

2 Evaluation Purpose, Objectives,
and Scope
2.1 Purpose
25. In line with the UNICEF Evaluation Policy, country programme evaluations are mandatory for
every second programming cycle. The Jordan Country Office (JCO) did not have a country
programme evaluation during its last programming cycle and is therefore mandated to conduct a
country programme evaluation at this point in time.
26. It is within this context that the GoJ and UNICEF JCO have begun discussions about the priorities,
strategies, and resource requirements of the next CP for the period 2023-2027.
27. The purpose of the evaluation is to provide impartial and independent evidence to assist the JCO,
Jordan authorities and decision-makers to inform the next programming cycle as well as to
contribute to the UN system joint programming in Jordan. The evaluation is also expected to
ensure that the programme was both relevant and effective in meeting the needs of children and
their families in Jordan, to enable better programming for UNICEF and the GoJ on the way
forward.
28. The primary users of the evaluation are the UNICEF JCO and the GoJ programming. Through
publication in the GEROS system, the evaluation will provide a transparent demonstration of the
country programme over the period under review.
2.2 Objectives
29. The JCO sought to ascertain how effective the UNICEF programme and action has been in: (i)
system enhancement; (ii) social inclusion; (iii) transitioning or overlap between the delivery of
humanitarian assistance and the provision of long-term development assistance; and (iv) COVID-
19 responsiveness in terms of planning, partnership, fundraising and programme implementation.
30. The evaluation has a focus on how UNICEF has been able to advance equity issues. Besides the
assessment of the expected results, the evaluation also aimed at identifying potential unintended
effects.
2.3 Scope
31. The Country Programme Evaluation examined the overall country programme 2018-2022,
including the period during the evaluation. This included the COVID-19 response and the
© UNIVERSALIA
10
accelerators mentioned above as well as the management of the programme and the monitoring
and reporting system.
32. Following consultations with the Country Office, including the Representative, Deputy
Representatives and Section Chiefs, it was agreed to have a specific focus on the Education,
Health, and Social Policy / Social Protection sectors. Considering the importance of WASH in light
of COVID-19 and limiting the spread of the disease, a distinct case study was also undertaken to
support the analysis. Youth and Adolescent Development and Child Protection, and PME
programming were considered within the context of the overall Country Programme and through
Outcome Harvesting of completed evaluations, reports, and interviews and other key documents.
33. The evaluation covered all the OECD-DAC evaluation criteria of Relevance, Coherence, Efficiency,
Effectiveness, Impact and Sustainability. The humanitarian evaluation criterion of Connectedness
was also considered as the programme is covering implementation in a nexus environment where
the humanitarian response has significant impact on development work. It also had a special focus
on gender and the commitment of UNICEF towards the promotion of human rights and gender
issues.

3 Evaluation Approach and
Methodology
3.1 Evaluation Approach
34. The evaluation team used a combined summative and formative approach to conduct the
evaluation. Summative approaches were used to assess the performance of the programme
towards achieving planned and unplanned results and identifying conditions of success. The
formative approach was used to identify lessons learned and recommendations to contribute to
the ongoing work on the development of the next CPD.
35. The team used participatory and utilization-focused approaches, engaging with key evaluation
users at each stage of the evaluation process to support ownership of and use of the evaluation
and outputs (findings, conclusions, recommendations, and lessons learned).20 The evaluation paid
particular attention to gender as a cross-cutting theme, mainstreaming gender, equity and human
rights across the evaluation questions and integrating these dimensions into the data collection
tools and analysis, while reflecting a gender analysis in the evaluation findings, conclusions, and
recommendations.
36. The evaluation team adopted a mixed-methods approach to evaluation which triangulated
sources of information and perspectives using quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure
a comprehensive, robust, and evidence-based understanding of the programme under
evaluation, which in turn allowed for the development of insightful findings, reliable conclusions,
relevant lessons learned and targeted recommendations.
37. The evaluation team utilized a range of qualitative data collection tools, and both qualitative and
quantitative data analysis methods to assess each criterion, key question, sub-question, and
indicator. Overall, emphasis was placed on the qualitative analysis of primary sources collected
by the evaluation team and on the qualitative and quantitative secondary sources provided by
UNICEF, its partners, and other key stakeholders, and identified sources through their own
research activities.
3.2 Evaluation Criteria and Questions
38. The evaluation team used the evaluation matrix (Appendix II) as a backbone to contextualize its
work and organize the findings. The evaluation matrix linked the evaluation criteria with the key
evaluation questions and developed sub-questions with indicators, data collections methods, and

3.3 Data Sources, Collection, and Analysis Methods
39. The evaluation used qualitative as well as quantitative data collection methods. Information from
the different lines of inquiry was triangulated to improve the reliability of the findings and to
ensure that the recommendations are grounded in the reality. The following methods of data
collection were used: (a) document review; (b) stakeholder interviews and focus group
discussions (FGD); (c) and case studies.
3.3.1 Document Review
40. An initial review of selected key documents took place during the inception phase as documents
were made available by the Regional Evaluation Advisor and the Country Office in Amman. The
evaluation team conducted a thorough second round of document review from a repository
provided by the UNICEF JCO. Relevant data and information were coded and organized according
to the evaluation criteria and corresponding questions which facilitated the systematic sorting,
analysis, and triangulation of data. This approach was also used to organize the evaluation data
and information collected from other sources.
41. A significant number of documents were reviewed, including UNICEF corporate documents,
various UNICEF JCO programme management reports (annual, progress), UNICEF strategic
documents, evaluations and reports produced by JCO, monitoring and progress reports
concerning the different elements of the CP, as well as relevant external reports produced by
other actors relating to Jordan and internationally. The list of
documents consulted can be found in Appendix IV.

3.3.2 Stakeholder Interviews and Focus Group Discussions
42. In collaboration with the Country Office, the evaluation team identified a list of key stakeholders
for consultation to participate in Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), which was validated with UNICEF
Section Chiefs in the Country Office. Due to COVID-19 travel limitations, the evaluation team
combined direct and remote semi-structured (group or individual) interviews that were guided by
interview protocols organized around the main evaluation questions (See Appendix V).
43. Table 3.2 below describes the major categories of stakeholders who were consulted during the
desk and field phases. (See Appendix III for completed KIIs).

3.3.3 Case Studies
45. As part of the Evaluation process, it was determined to conduct case studies on the largest
investment components of the 2018-2022 CP, namely (1) Social Policy and Social Protection (2)
Education (3) WASH and (4) the Health and Nutrition Section, considering its importance due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Case Studies are attached as part III of the Evaluation and have
served to inform the Evaluation Report in detail.
3.3.4 Limitations
46. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire team was unable to conduct a field visit in Jordan.
Interviews were conducted virtually, and triangulation was conducted via documentation to help
fill this gap. However, this proved to take significantly more time as fewer interviews could be
conducted daily. A team member based in Jordan who spoke Arabic conducted interviews in
Arabic and supported those where translation was needed.
47. Some potential interviewees did not respond to requests for interviews. People were contacted
numerous times to try to ensure participation. In the health sector, there were limited interviews
conducted with those outside of UNICEF or government, which may impact the perspectives
provided in the report.
48. While interviewees did offer areas for improvement as well as noting what was working well,
considering there is a high turnover of staff, in particular in government, this may have had an
impact on what information the interviewees had to offer during the interviews. Interviewees
were guided to offer responses to the questions that indicated they had knowledge of the work
with UNICEF.
49. There were few formal evaluations conducted for specific projects within the health portfolio
which limited the availability of information on what works well and what does not, as well as
limited the outcome and impacted data available for interventions. There was a lack of
disaggregated data to better understand inequalities across groups, which limited the ability to
understand these inequalities in more detail.
50. The sheer (high) number of evaluation questions was also a limitation – as this can lead to
repetition for interview respondents in some cases, and in other cases it can result in questions
that interviewees cannot answer in detail (e.g., some people did not know about the vulnerability
approach so could not answer questions related to this). Ensuring interviewees focused on the
time scope of the project, and ensuring documentation also fell into this time scope, was a
challenge. For example, documentation was provided from 2016, which is far outside of the scope
of this evaluation. In addition, in multi-sectoral evaluations, which include many partners, it can
be a challenge to tease out contributions from one specific partner, or in one specific sector.
Finally, data is constantly changing and being updated; hence, output data can be outdated a
short time after it is reported on, meaning some of the data in the report must be interpreted as
reflecting a moment in time. This was particularly the case with respect to the impact of COVID-
19 which was evolving as the evaluation proceeded.

3.3.5 Ethical Considerations
51. The evaluation team adhered to UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation,
Data Collection and Analysis (2015), the United Nations Evaluation Group norms and standards
as well as the revised UNICEF Evaluation Policy of 2018. As such, the evaluation team upheld the
appropriate obligations of evaluators, including maintaining the independence, impartiality,
credibility and accountability of the individual team members and the evaluation process as a
whole.
52. As stipulated in the Terms of Reference and the Agreement with UNICEF, specific material was
required to be submitted for Ethical Review. HML conducts ethical reviews for UNICEF under
UNICEF LTAS 42107154. MENARO requested the Ethics Review Board conduct a conduct a
research ethics review (#446JORD21) of all relevant materials for this Country.
53. Following its review, the HML ERB issued the Ethical Review Letter of Approval for the Project
which is contained in Appendix X.

4 Findings
4.1 Relevance
Finding 1: UNICEF CP is well aligned with the humanitarian and development situation
of Jordan and responds to priority needs of vulnerable children in the
country, regardless of status, ability, or nationality, thus promoting social
cohesion. It has been flexible in developing programming which quickly
reacted to critical needs caused by the COVID -19 pandemic.
54. UNICEF Jordan designed a CP that was relevant to the needs of vulnerable populations in the
country, aligned with government priorities and plans, supportive of UNICEF change strategies
and emerging priorities. As discussed in section 1.2., the CP Components are focused on serving
vulnerable children in Jordan, ensuring their healthy development, safeguarding their welfare,
access to education, access to emergency needs, engagement, and inclusion.
55. In its purpose and design, UNICEF’s CP aligns with the key objectives of the Jordan Response Plan
(JRP): (1) Strengthening program design and implementation to be more relevant to the needs of,
and to reach, the most vulnerable and contribute to the enhancement of the resilience of both
beneficiaries and systems; (2) Ensure meeting the protection needs of Syrian refugees and
meeting the needs of vulnerable Jordanians impacted by the Syrian crisis and (3) supporting
national systems to maintain providing quality services. The JRP is the only plan that serves both
Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians impacted by Syria crisis based on their needs and
vulnerabilities, and in their specific geographical locations.21

56. UNICEF’s work is supportive of and considers other key national plans and strategies, supporting
the continued evolution and implementation of these (see Table 4.1).
Table 4.1: The JRP and National Plans
Source: Jordan Response Plan (unicef.org)
57. By aligning with national and sectoral priorities, UNICEF’s support targets the areas where it can
have the greatest impact. Taken together, UNICEF programmes in Jordan were designed to
address the humanitarian and development situation in Jordan, and the priority needs of the
population, especially the most vulnerable children.
58. Programmatically, the relevance of the CP stems from the use of the vulnerability-based approach
across the different CP components. Since 2018, and following the key lessons learned from the
previous country program, UNICEF Jordan has focused on shifting from an almost exclusively
refugee-related response to a broader vulnerability approach. This more comprehensive and
systems strengthening-based approach has enabled the country office to reach more children
based on their vulnerabilities, rather than nationality, through sustainable national systems. In
the education sector, for example, UNICEF has supported and expanded the possibilities of
inclusive education for all, including children with disabilities. Through its WASH component, the
CP pursues a two-pronged strategy providing humanitarian assistance and strengthen sector
institutions and, in so doing, contributes to ensuring provision of emergency WASH supplies for
those in dire need and appropriate functional water and wastewater systems, thereby
contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable environment for children and achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
59. In a similar way, Social Policy and Social Protection (SPSP) interventions transitioned from
programming based on nationality (regular programming for Jordanians principally) and status
(i.e., refugee or displaced person), to one focused on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable

19
in Jordan. The national protection strategy (launched in 2019), which the CP provided support for,
served as the entry point for UNICEF’s shift in interventions.
60. Finally, with the vulnerability approach, the CP recognized the potential for increased tension and
societal challenges caused by prolonged settlement of refugees and has, therefore, promoted
social cohesion in all interventions. Stakeholders, UNICEF, implementing partners and
government representatives confirmed that this approach has helped to mitigate the risk of
growing tensions within communities, and thereby has supported the objective of improving
social cohesion in communities.
61. The strengthening of the capacity of the National Aid Fund (NAF) to provide the most vulnerable
children with access to the resources needed for children to have equal chances in life (e.g., Hajati
Cash Transfer Programme), the development of innovative after-school programs, and youth and
adolescent programming through partnerships which promote positive engagements and
pathways, illustrate that UNICEF’s work has improved social cohesion.
62. In 2020, UNICEF was able to identify key trends and needs in the socio-economic situation of
households with children and youth through the study “Socio-Economic Assessment of Children
and Youth in the time of COVID-19 – Jordan”22 and the Inter-Agency Rapid Needs Assessment
(RNA) conducted jointly with UNHCR and WHO.23
63. The potential devastating impact of COVID-19 on the vulnerable population24 mobilized UNICEF
and other UN agencies to respond to emergency challenges.
64. The Country Programme undertook rapid adjustment of its activities, refocusing and re-orienting
towards COVID-19 response where it could have a substantial impact, and quickly took into
account limitations imposed to contain the virus. Programme adjustments made to react and
adapt to circumstances imposed by COVID-19 were integrated into the CP budget and monitoring
system. UNICEF sections adapted programs individually and the prevailing humanitarian aspects
of the CP left them well placed for action, alongside using rapid tools to identify key entry points.
65. By adjusting its programming to support the implementation of the National COVID-19
Preparedness and Response Plan, UNICEF responded to the critical needs of the country in the
times of a global health pandemic. The CP provided essential technical and material support,
including Personal Protective Equipment procurement, COVID-19 commodities (needles) and
assistance with COVAX (securing COVID-19 vaccine supplies); collaborated in communication,
prevention, awareness, and risk reduction; supported the shift to online learning and training, and
so on.
66. In a critical period, UNICEF’s ability to shift focus, collaborate, react, communicate, and mobilize
resources and partnership to deliver critical needs should be seen as a key success in Jordan. It’s

to lack of money. An increase in the price of food commodities and fuel had created difficulties, exacerbated by the loss of livelihoods

effort to focus on preparedness, left it well suited for the following “waves” that occurred and
provided vital support for the GoJ at a critical juncture.
Finding 2: Progress has been made on integration of cross cutting issues but enriching
this requires more resources and determination. A gender, climate,
disability lens (not just responsive but preferably robust programming) has
not been observed in planning.
67. Cross-cutting issues are mainstreamed in UNICEF programming, with a minimum budget
allocation of 5%. By embracing the vulnerability approach, the WASH program integrated, cross-
cutting issues such as gender and equity, child rights, climate change, humanitarian principles,
and social inclusion. For example, in 2018, UNICEF and the Ministry of Water and Irrigation
worked together to update the national water and wastewater vulnerability maps. These maps
provided the basis for prioritization of the most vulnerable communities in the provision of
wastewater services. To integrate climate change more directly in its WASH programs, UNICEF
supported various initiatives, including the development of Environmental Awareness clubs in
schools and the integration of climate adaptation into programs such as rainwater harvesting,
decentralized wastewater treatment and greywater reuse within schools.
68. Integration of children with disabilities into programming has occurred and demonstrable
progress in expanding support for Persons with Disabilities in some areas has been notable, for
example in the form of the National Registry for Children with Hearing Disabilities.
69. Efforts have been made to integrate the cross-cutting issue of gender in UNICEF interventions,
however achieving transformational change will necessitate continued and expanded efforts. A
continued perception remains that gender equality efforts are not substantial and dedicated
enough.
70. It should be noted that the JCO is engaged in a deeper analysis of its work in Gender Equality. In
line with the new UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025, an emphasis needs to be placed on developing
gender transformative programming.
4.2 Coherence
Finding 3: The UNICEF-Jordan Country Programme is coherent, supportive, and
complementary to the Government of Jordan and in line with the strategies
of other stakeholders in Jordan.
71. During the design and implementation of the CP, UNICEF has engaged in consultation and
coordination with stakeholders in the development of its programs, with the aim to avoid
duplications in all its programs, while ensuring complementarity with other actors’ interventions.
72. Regular coordination with donors and civil society organisations is reflected in the mechanisms
and programs of the JRP. UNICEF also maintains bilateral arrangements with the GoJ ministries
on certain program initiatives, directly with individual donors and on multi-stakeholder
collaborative arrangements which involve civil society organizations (CSO), Royal Societies,

21
Academic organizations, and the private sector. Collectively, these efforts are aimed to ensure
that UNICEF programme strategies are in line with those of stakeholders.
73. Through Sector Working groups, UNICEF as Sector
lead, collaborates with other partners to ensure Box 5.1: Involvement of UNICEF Jordan in
investments are non-duplicative but coordination mechanisms
complementary and coherent. For example, UNICEF “Aligning expectations and building consensus with

acknowledging that UNICEF has contributed to
organizing stakeholders around WASH issues in
Jordan, some of the stakeholders consulted indicated that UNICEF’s leadership role could be
improved. They expressed concerns relating to weak levels of participation by government
entities. Other stakeholders were of the view that UNICEF has not been able to mobilize WASH
stakeholders outside UNICEF group and even questioned the leadership of UNICEF, wondering
whether UNICEF is the right actor to act as Lead for the WASH sector.26
74. The collaboration with the Ministry of Education and sector partners in the formulation of the
2020-2022 JRP education programme further illustrates how UNICEF ensured complementarity
with other actors. The education sector aimed to support systems strengthening to improve
education access, equity, and quality for all children. Towards this aim, UN agencies, NGOs, and
the education donor group support the Ministry of Education in advancing national education
reforms and implementation of both ESP and JRP for greater coherence and result delivery. Based
on lessons learned from the shift to national NGOs, UNICEF Jordan focused its capacity building
efforts to enable partner Ministries to bring programmes to scale across the country.27
75. UNICEF’s involvement in other coordination mechanisms has equally promoted coherence of its
programmes. For instance, its involvement in the NAF steering committee seeks to ensure
interventions, roles and responsibilities amongst stakeholders are clear, and avoid organizational
overlap, conflict and repetition while promoting coordination. In these fora, key social protection
actors discuss their priorities and interventions in a platform, driven by donors with rotational
leadership and where UNICEF often helps to map out all the activities from the different actors.
Government stakeholders and donors have indicated that the coordination between the NAF,
UNICEF and WFP worked well, and that this model should be replicated with other actors. A trend
25 Ibid.
26 The UNICEF WASH strategy’s close program alignment with the GoJ’s Water Strategy 2016 – 2025 is exemplified in the focus on
host communities and on community-level water supply interventions. These have upgraded water networks, boreholes and water
tanks, particularly in the northern governorates and which are supported as well by the donor community.

22
noted in interviews with stakeholders, however, is that there could be improved information
sharing at earlier stages, to enable greater input.
76. UNICEF is also a member of the Health Development Partners Forum, where priorities are aligned
and coordinated. UNICEF uses various mechanisms (e.g., national level steering committee for the
neonatal death audit and surveillance system) to ensure buy-in and support among partners
including the GoJ. Programs are implemented in a consultative way, through dialogues and
building consensus, which can take time and results in delays (e.g., delays in approvals).28
77. While programming is coherent, there remains overlap in the projects of international donors,
GoJ participation could be more vigorous in some program areas, and there remains a concern if
the CP resources are better served by placing coordination function ahead of advocacy in some
areas (i.e., providing services for the government instead of advocating for change with the
government).
4.3 Efficiency
Finding 4: Although limited data exists to conduct a detailed cost-effectiveness
analysis of the CP, there is evidence of UNICEF’s Programmes
demonstrating economical/financial efficiency. However, delays in
programming have reduced gains.
78. It is notable that the JCO has demonstrated improved contracting approaches and consolidation
of work in refugee camps through local contracting which has enhanced cost-efficiency and
reduced administrative costs. The approach has freed staff resources to work in other aspects of
the programming, allowing for improved use of human resources.
79. In managing the camp centres, UNICEF relies on the services of an independent contractor (the
BDC) which has many advantages. In particular, the contractor takes care of human resources and
daily maintenance of Makani centres (e.g., cleaning, provision of equipment, supplies, etc.), which
enables a more efficient use of UNICEF’s own resources. UNICEF staff and stakeholders generally
agreed that the procurement approach using national contractors has improved programme’s
financial efficiency and the use of technology in refugee camps has improved management of
facilities, reduced duplication, enhanced security, and reduced slippage. Technology solutions
used in the TAKAFUL programme, including electronic registration, payment, and money transfer,
enabled NAF to cover all 12 governorates in a cost-effective way.

80. UNICEF’s strategies to increase the financial
efficiency of its interventions include so-called Box 5.2: Efficiency gains from direct
“direct implementation and rationalization” (see implementation and rationalization of UNICEF
programmes
Box 5.2). The evaluation of the Makani
programme found that, thanks to the use of these

partnerships with some NGOs and INGOs were

implementing partners whose performance was weaker was terminated. Besides, some centres
in less vulnerable areas or in overserved districts were closed. These measures it was assumed
created opportunities for substantial savings but also better distribution of resources. However,
the rationalization strategy also entailed an inherent risk that some populations would be
deprived of close access to Makani centres and negatively impacted.
81. Limited information or evaluations on cost analyses, value for money assessments, or cost-
efficient options/alternatives were found in documents, making efficiency difficult to assess. The
CP Report 2020 notes that: “Despite financial constraints, UNICEF Jordan successfully continued
the emergency response for refugees by adopting cost-saving strategies and leveraging strategic
alliances and partnerships with UN agencies and international non-government organizations.”30
The CP Report 2021 reports that costs have been further reduced and cut.31
82. UNICEF’s KAP study (2020) reveals that UNICEF Jordan efficiently made many joint efforts in
communicating to residents in the Za’atari Camp, including on WASH issues and during the
pandemic. The study confirms that UNICEF and its partners’ response to COVID-19 was felt by
most Za’atari residents surveyed as effective, as 71% mentioned receiving up to five messages per
week regarding the pandemic, mainly through WhatsApp. Additionally, with the WASH hotline,
UNICEF has been very active in getting in touch with Za’atari residents to solve their problems. In
fact, 86% of Za’atari residents who called the hotline mentioned that the response time was
satisfactory.32

83. The evaluation found that some of the UNICEF-supported WASH infrastructures have resulted in
financial efficiencies in the provision of WASH services. This is notably the case of the Za’atari
water and wastewater networks which became operational in 2018. According to UNICEF 2018
report, the value-for-money of these large-scale infrastructure investments was positive, with
operating costs reduced by two-thirds. There was also an improvement in the quality of the
service, with safe water delivered directly to caravans in Za’atari camp, reducing the child safety
risks and service interruptions related to water trucking and desludging.33
84. Delays in program implementation have been observed due to government approval
requirements, increased security measures, health regulations system of COVID-19. In addition,
some programs have been delayed due to financial limitations of the Government and changes in
Cabinet.
85. Public education is free and compulsory for the basic cycle, with minimal funds raised from fees
at other education levels. Budgeting for the Ministry of Education has been completed based on
historical trends, which limits the ability to develop a result-oriented budget that is responsive to
the needs of students. With regards to external support, USD $2.4 billion were endorsed as the
fund required by the JFP for the Syria Crisis for the year 2019. However, only 21% of the fund was
secured, with the largest share given to the education sector. Off-budget support by partners
contributing to the education sector plan is not recorded as part of public spending. Recent donor
support in 2019 amounted to USD $1.6 billion committed to the education sector for the years
2014–2023, including grants, loans, and technical assistance. Given the lack of detailed data
available through GoJ sources, it is difficult to compare and assess gaps in terms of efforts, to
determine duplication or areas where there are inadequate resources.34
86. While education makes up 13.3% of the national budget, only 7% of expenditure was on capital
expenses and this was insufficient national budgetary allocations for adequate investment in new
schools and equipment. Centralized funding decisions limited resources invested in operating and
maintaining facilities,35 while construction and rehabilitation are supplemented by international
donors. UNICEF’s contributions fill critical gaps in the budget and are aimed at those who are most
vulnerable, whose needs are not being addressed and have limited government services or quality
facilities.
87. With regard to timely implementation of the Country Programme, the lens must be viewed pre-
and post-COVID period. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the program was implemented in a
timely manner. Delays were principally beyond UNICEF’s control, due to the security measures,
the health regulation system of COVID-19, and due to GoJ procedures. For example, the
implementation of Early Childhood Education was delayed due to a lack of funding at the Ministry
of Education despite planning completed by UNICEF, including training workshops for the new
Parenting Awareness programme.
88. With regard to Social Policy and Social Protection, 86% of the allocation is dedicated to Item 6.2
the National System is Strengthened for vulnerable children to access, while Item 6.1 Improved

policy and environment and systems for disadvantage and excluded children, the UNICEF
Utilization Cube indicates has the lowest level of allocation utilization (68%), and item 6.3 Children
and adolescent girls and boys, and women are empowered and motivated, shows zero allocation
and no expenditure. Considering the latter two items of importance, a question remains why 6.3
was cut, whether the objective has been achieved, or are served through other programming, or
in the latter case, whether this has been deemed to not be with the SPSP area of focus.
Finding 5: The Country Programme has employed a broad-based strategy to address
child and youth issues, communicating critical needs, raising awareness,
supporting strategy development and implementation, while working with
others to mobilize additional resources to address needs beyond its budget
and capacity.
89. National partnerships have been key to progress in achieving planned outcomes ensuring broad
support in Jordan, facilitating coordination, avoiding duplication, and expanding the reach of
programs to the most vulnerable in Jordan. The CP has been innovative in using its resources to
stimulate contributions from others, such as investments in Adolescent and Youth Programming,
Child Protection and in SPSP.
90. The use of partnerships with local organisations as an approach has paid off. Throughout its Syria
crisis response, the country office developed a network of national NGOs and community-based
organization partners, working alongside INGO partners. This approach aimed to transfer
knowledge and skills from international to national NGOs, increasing cost-effectiveness,
sustainability, and responsiveness to local needs. By the end of 2018, this shift was nearly
complete as only five INGOs were working with UNICEF Jordan outside of refugee camps (down
from 10 the year before); they were working alongside 13 national NGOs. UNICEF Jordan
acknowledges that undertaking this shift without disrupting services required substantial staff
time and resources.
91. UNICEF Jordan maintains a close partnership with relevant governmental ministries (e.g., Ministry
of Social Development) and agencies (e.g., NAF), which enables UNICEF’s sharing of technical
expertise and fosters large-scale capacity development. UNICEF also collaborates with other
development partners in several regards, which improves the efficiency of its interventions. For
example, UNICEF co-chairs with UNHCR the Common Cash Facility (CCF), a platform used by UN
agencies, NGOs and some municipalities of the Jordanian government to deliver cash assistance
to the most vulnerable refugee and Jordanian households.
92. UNICEF advocacy and support contributed to the new Ministry of Education policy for the
universalization of KG2. The education stakeholders supported the Ministry of Education to
develop the strategy, drafted new KG2 by laws and regulations, and supported a 15% increase in
KG2 enrolment in refugee camps. UN agencies and the Ministry of Education played a key role in
advocating for the exemption of Syrian children from documentation requirements when
registering for formal education in 2019.36

93. National advocacy by UNICEF and partners resulted in providing an account of child allocations
which has almost the entire Ministry of Education’s budget allocation. However, this does not
necessarily mean it is responsive to the needs of children. To maximize benefits for children,
UNICEF advised that budgets should be targeted to improve equity, inclusion, and students’
learning outcomes. Consequently, UNICEF and partners initiated the “Child Friendly Budgeting”
programme with a key purpose to review budget law performance information and to accentuate
the visibility of results for children. This process revealed the need for additional capacity building
in results-oriented monitoring and evaluation.37 This is a strong example of communicating critical
needs, raising awareness, supporting strategy development and implementation.
94. Implementation of the WASH program relied on partnerships with various stakeholders. These
partnerships were effective and leveraged, to the maximum extent, other stakeholders active in
the WASH sector, be it in the camps and informal settlements, schools, host communities, and
other vulnerable communities, which allowed achievement of expected results. Implementing the
National WASH in Schools Standards developed by UNICEF in partnership with Ministry of
Education, UNICEF worked with Yarmouk Water Company to connect various schools and their
surrounding communities to the water network. In the same vein, by leveraging partnerships with
UNHCR and UNFPA, UNICEF ensured the provision of life-saving WASH services to a highly
vulnerable yet inaccessible population, for example through implementation of hygiene and solid
waste management campaigns.38
95. As noted earlier, in April-May 2020, UNICEF produced in collaboration with WFP and UNHCR the
Inter-Agency Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA), focused on the household level and using a multi-
sectoral approach covering a broad array of sectors, including WASH, and Protection. This
assessment was critical to generate evidence on the immediate impact of the COVID-19
emergency to better inform the planning and programming of responses in the humanitarian and
development sectors.39 In 2018, the CO developed new partnerships with UNDP, Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), United Nations Human Settlements
Programme (UN-HABITAT), WHO and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) to move forward with water safety planning and the climate change
agenda.40
Finding 6: The change in approach to a Vulnerability Approach has expanded UNICEF’s
coverage to address the most vulnerable children and their families needs
more broadly. However, limitations in financial resources and in GoJ’s laws
still constrain the application of the approach.
96. As indicated previously, since 2018, and following the key lessons learned from the previous
country program, UNICEF Jordan has focused on shifting from an almost exclusively refugee-
related response to a broader vulnerability approach.

97. The new approach allowed UNICEF to focus on sector institutions, enabling the sector to address
children’s needs across the country. The change in approach has required diagnostic study,
surveys and upgrading technical data. For example, updating the national water and wastewater
vulnerability maps has providing the basis for prioritization of interventions, focusing on more
vulnerable communities.
98. A key challenge to the vulnerability approach is that the resources do not allow for helping all the
vulnerable population and choices must be made. A second challenge relates to limitations in GoJ
laws which constrain its application of the approach where certain programs are only available to
Jordanians. For example, the NAF is only accessible for Jordanian beneficiaries, which contextually
means even with UNICEF`s contribution, it can only offer coverage to vulnerable Jordanians.
99. Universal health care is critical to equitable health, but not everyone has access to health
insurance in Jordan. There is free health insurance by the Jordanian government for those under
6 years of age.41 More than half of men (58%) and half of women (50%) have “some type of health
insurance coverage”.42 The Vulnerability Assessment in 2020 cites that 73% of the population has
health insurance, with non-Jordanians being more likely to not be insured (80% of the population
in Amman, Bala, Madaba, Tafilah, and Aqaba).43 Additional DHS analysis from 2017-2018 shows
that “uninsured in Jordan are disproportionately urban, live in Amman, and are non-Jordanian
(Syrian and other nationalities).”44 In addition, in 2018, the GoJ cut subsidies for health, and Syrian
refugees living in urban areas had to “pay the same rates as other foreigners at public hospitals”,
resulting in refugees resorting to “negative coping mechanisms to deal with this lack of access”.45
100. To surmount barriers to delivery (UNICEF does not view the GoJ regulations as an impediment),
UNICEF has supported multiple mechanisms to provide coverage through other programming,
while supporting the NAF to increase coverage through the use of mobile registration centres
ensuring that beneficiaries of the program were registered in 12 governorates.
101. Some programming has had its challenges, when flexibility and implementation modalities have
not been accepted by the GoJ. For example, the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship
was not satisfied with the implementation of the educational loss compensation programme
supported by UNICEF. This programme was implemented for students at knowledge stations
owned by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship and teaching is conducted by the
trainers who are not qualified teachers and held during the weekends which incurs additional
transportation costs for poor families. The Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship’s
suggestion was to implement the program at the same schools of the students during the
weekday - either early morning or at the end of school day - and should be done by the teachers
of the students themselves.

102. A long-term shift in beneficiary composition has been observed. Under the previous approach,
Syrian refugees were the principal beneficiaries. The present composition is now 70% Syrian and
other refugees/30% Jordanian. However, there is a challenge in covering the most vulnerable
groups in certain areas due to non-availability (or closure) of government offices (i.e., remote
areas, nomadic communities), which are the key interlocuters delivering services.46
4.4 Effectiveness
Finding 7: Significant progress has been made in terms of supporting Jordan’s
government, and systems, overall resulting in improvements in, and
increasing the supply of, services in all targeted communities.
103. UNICEF Jordan has strengthened the capacity of government institutions and civil society
organizations, notably through the development of sector planning documents, strategies, and
policies opening pathways for system strengthening. This is evident in the work of the Education,
WASH, SPSP and Child Protection sections.
104. In 2019, with UNICEF support, the Government of Jordan launched the National Social Protection
Strategy 2019-2025, which was developed based on the Government’s Priorities 2019-2020. The
aim was to establish a comprehensive social protection mechanism to serve all Jordanians. This
mechanism was focused on translating the government’s commitment to break the cycle of
poverty in the Kingdom, and UNICEF’s support focused on children and youth and their families.
UNICEF subsequently supported the Ministry of Social Development to establish a Unit to support
the implementation of this strategy; combined, this approach was crucial to elaborate social
protection systemwide analysis and monitoring and reporting.47
105. To ensure implementation of this strategy, UNICEF equally supported the Ministry of Social
Development and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation to finalize a three-year
work plan, and to initiate an Implementation Support Unit to oversee the coordination and
implementation of the strategy. UNICEF also supported the development of a country-specific
computable general equilibrium model for policy development and evaluation, with a capacity-
building component on the utilization of the model.48 The National Youth Strategy 2019–2025 and
the National Employment Charter were equally identified as key milestones achieved by the
Government of Jordan in the area of social protection. UNICEF advocated for, and technically
supported, the development and operationalization of these national strategies, including
building the capacity of the ministry.49
106. Together, these instruments have helped to strategically reposition the country in terms of social
protection. In particular, they have strengthened the GoJ and other children’s rights duty bearers’
capacities to move a step from improved policies to actual policy implementation. In doing so,

UNICEF interventions have helped to bridge an important gap in the public policy cycle, allowing
to change the conditions of children in the country.
107. The UNICEF multifaceted approach has allowed for engaging national institutions and supporting
a comprehensive set of interventions in the most disadvantaged districts which has strengthened
the GoJ delivery systems. In that regard, the Makani programme provided a package of integrated
social protection services in three main areas: learning support services, community-based child
protection and life skills training. In all three service areas, UNICEF ensured outreach and
appropriate referral services, thus guaranteeing involvement of all relevant stakeholders, and
enhancing access of vulnerable children and youth to solutions and systems available outside the
Makani program.
108. Other UNICEF capacity strengthening examples which enabled relevant institutions to move from
improved policies to actual implementation, include the technical support to the NAF, allowing
the latter to enhance its eligibility and targeting criteria, from the previously categorical targeting
approach, where inclusion and exclusion errors were present, into an eligibility criterion based on
45+ multidimensional poverty indicators.
109. Through a joint effort with the World Bank, UNICEF also provided technical assistance to Ministry
of Social Development and government stakeholders to develop the Shock Responsive Social
Protection System for the country starting with the development of a Shock Responsive Social
Protection chapter to include in the National Social Protection Strategy. The shock responsive
component is built under the premise that the national social protection system can be highly
effective implementing mechanisms for emergency response and reflecting the responsibility of
the State in times of emergency as well as development contexts.
110. UNICEF has promoted social protection in Jordan by contributing to the establishment of
improved information systems that enable situation monitoring and research on children’s issues.
This has enabled the Government and other actors to develop evidence informed policies and
strategies. As noted earlier, UNICEF supported the NAF with the development and maintenance
of a management information system, including a two-way SMS platform to facilitate registration
and communication with beneficiaries, opening of mobile wallets, and processing of grievances.50
UNICEF coordinated with NAF to develop a baseline report on the socio-economic conditions of
the families applying for the NAF cash assistance program Takaful, with specific focus on the
multiple deprivations faced by children of those families. This report has served to increase the
level of accountability of social programming by the Government of Jordan, while providing
evidence to better inform policies and amendments.51
111. UNICEF has supported activities aimed at generating evidence and knowledge on issues relating
to the rights of children and adolescents in the country. Most stakeholders consulted recognized
that this evidence is likely to be used by various national and regional partners to inform relevant
social protection measures. The Geographic Multidimensional Vulnerability Analysis is one such
activity. This longitudinal socio-economic study helped create a harmonized and standardized tool
that allows an in-depth understanding of the determinants of children’s vulnerability and poverty
50 UNICEF (2020). Country Office Annual Report (COAR) 2020; UNICEF (2021). Country Programme Full Approved Report RAM 2020.

in Jordan.52 Other evidence generation activities include two studies on the impact of COVID-19
on vulnerable populations which aimed at informing the country’s advocacy efforts and COVID-
19 response planning. 53 Finally, UNICEF completed three Public Finance for Children (PF4C)
studies which were utilized to support office advocacy efforts in different areas, including costing
of the draft Childhood Law, expanding foster care as an alternative to institutional care (costing
study/investment case), and budget review of the Ministry of Youth.54
112. A number of successful approaches used by UNICEF have been identified which have contributed
to health and nutrition system strengthening, and in some cases new enhanced systems,
including:
▪ Models - such as the Family and Community Medicine Team (FCMT) model, community
health volunteer model, Rukban volunteer mechanism55
▪ Capacity building for service providers
▪ Support for data systems (e.g., surveillance system on neonatal deaths)
▪ Programs such as Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), immunization, newborn
screening, and emergency health response
▪ Providing funding and technical assistance to understand cost and evidence for various
health and nutrition areas (e.g., study on economic burden of B-thalassemia, Jordan
National Micronutrient Study).
113. UNICEF has successfully contributed to the strengthening of WASH sector institutions as well as
improving the efficiency of existing WASH systems, notably through development and
implementation of innovative solutions to water problems in Jordan. UNICEF contributed to the
development of WASH innovative solutions within the framework of the WASH Strategy,
strengthening the connectivity systems for informing on issues and planting the seeds of
creativity, within the context of water. As explained below, these innovative solutions are
expected to contribute to solving water and sanitation challenges in the country, thus ensuring
the realization of the rights of children and adolescents in Jordan.
114. To address the problem of high rates of non-revenue water,56 UNICEF supported the Ministry, the
Water Authority of Jordan and three semi-government utility companies to develop a mobile
phone application, the “Water App”. The application allows the public to report any water
network leakages or issues with the water and wastewater systems directly to the managing
water utility maintenance crews, and digitalizes services provided by water utilities companies in
Jordan (Aqaba, Miyahuna and Yarmouk). The objective is to integrate the app into the water utility
maintenance response systems, reducing response times and the volume of water lost due to

56 Water leakage is a significant problem in Jordan, with non-revenue water estimated to be more than 50% of water (meaning half
of the water in the network is lost or not paid for). The mobile application brings together water utilities and customers in a common

leaks.57 The application provides water users with ready access to a complaint tracking system
and allows the Ministry’s maintenance teams to be alerted quickly and able to respond
immediately to leakages, reducing water loss. The application also acts as a platform to
disseminate messages through nationwide campaigns. Finally, the application contributes to
improved customer satisfaction and trust between customers and service providers.58
115. Within the framework of a cooperation agreement (in 2018)59 with the Jordan University of
Science and Technology, UNICEF has supported the establishment of a “WASH Innovation Hub”
incubator based at the University. The Hub serves as a laboratory for the design of innovative
solutions to Jordan’s water and wastewater challenges. Through such hubs, UNICEF Jordan also
aims to build capacities in the surrounding communities through better understanding of water
utilities, and Integrated Water Resources Management. As of 2020, UNICEF had successfully
supported three pre-incubated start-ups (two were female groups). The incubated start-ups
included: a recycling application, a household water control device that connects to smartphones,
and a smart system to measure the quality and quantity of drinkable water in the Small-scale
Water Desalination Stations. These start-ups received training on innovation and
entrepreneurship to finalize their business plans in the first round. They were then supported with
registration, legal and administrative services, up to 20,000 USD financial support as well as 12
months of technical and one-on-one business coaching to support the establishment of the start-
up.60
116. As the WASH sector in Jordan continues to face increasing pressures, especially due to the impacts
of climate change, innovation and technology have a vital role to play in addressing issues of
scarcity and safety, water efficiency, utility operations, and water monitoring and treatment in
the country. Helping the government and utilities to test and adopt promising WASH innovations
and to establish a WASH innovation incubator are important contributions to solving water
problems in the country. UNICEF’s work in this area is planting seeds and contributing to greater
willingness by utilities and business to test and adopt more promising technologies in the future
such as the remote sensing of water, which can help with water accounting and much more; the
internet of things, which enables smart irrigation, water quality control, and allows us to develop
complex models for water management. Working with start-up companies that offer the latest
technological innovations in the sector can help advance such efforts.
117. In supporting the rollout of WASH in School Standards, UNICEF strengthened systems by assisting
in connecting schools to water networks, rehabilitating or constructing new water and sanitation
facilities, and promoting sustainable hygiene and healthy behavior. This included 13 schools and
their surrounding communities connected to the water network in 2018, benefiting 1,924
students and 3,864 people in surrounding households.

118. The ability to plan, prepare and implement through rapid action was demonstrated as UNICEF
swiftly constructed WASH infrastructure in quarantine, isolation and COVID-19 treatment
facilities.
119. UNICEF work has strengthened the capacity of national education systems to be inclusive in the
delivery of quality education services to the most disadvantaged children. UNICEF’s technical
assistance to the Ministry of Education strengthened service delivery systems for children by
implementing programmes such as Learning Bridges and other online education platforms. The
Takaful program in partnership with Ministry of Social Development was notably developed and
implemented with innovative solutions through digitization of existing systems to ensure target
groups are served.
120. UNICEF support for planning and monitoring capacity enhancement has made the education
system more accountable for providing services to all children and strengthening capacities within
the education system. This has promoted stronger accountability for results, enhanced
leadership, supportive supervision and monitoring at the education directorate level, and
engagement with communities such as Parent-Teacher Associations to ensure effective
participation of the community in children’s learning.61
121. The UNICEF Better Parenting Programme automated tracking system for Handling Family Violence
Cases has enabled providing improved technical support to all ministries, institutions, and
stakeholders involved. This has promoted the pathway to an integrated response, to develop
periodic reports on service providers, and to identify gaps in the system.62
122. UNICEF support for Jordan’s plans to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change,
appreciating the direct relationship between population migration and the effect on the
environment. It is making efforts to include Youth in these initiatives and to make them part of
the change process. This is an example of cross-sectoral work that will strengthen Jordan’s long-
term ability to address a key issue impacting the entire population.
123. UNICEF support for data systems at the Ministry of Social Development now provided information
on the number of families who received support from the Ministry of Social Development and the
services that were provided to the beneficiaries and contributes to ensuring targeted groups
received support. UNICEF has further enabled the Ministry of Social Development to monitor the
Takaful program with 57 indicators, which is essential since the program received NAF aid under
the Noor platform. Through the system platform, services that were provided to the beneficiaries
were identified and provided information as to determine inclusive nature national social
protection. UNICEF had a major role in selecting the vulnerable citizen system and assisting in the
development of monitoring and evaluation system, working with the NAF through all stages,
conducting an evaluation of each stage of the program and providing TA for continuous
improvement purposes.

124. Finally, in response to the COVID-19 lockdown period, NAF had an electronic registration system
program that was established in cooperation with UNICEF, beneficiaries were able to register
through their mobile phones to enter the program. The operability of NAF depended on SMS and
UNICEF provided an electronic platform named Rapid Pro, a bi-directional tool for Q&A. People
were able to access this new platform through the application or through the electronic portal.
Even though all this support was available, some families were unable to register as they were
not eligible to get funding and other families, particularly in remote areas, who were eligible for
funding still did not register as they were unaware of the program.
125. As noted, in 2020, mobile centers were set up by NAF to reach all vulnerable people in remote
areas. Brochures were distributed about the program, and as a result; the number of beneficiaries
has gradually increased. A questionnaire has been sent to the target groups in light of some
modifications made.
126. Importantly, it can be observed that national system strengthening, engaging with CBOs as well
as the national partner, has provided UNICEF with greater access to the most vulnerable.
Finding 8: Delivery of programmes focuses on short-term/intermediate results where
reporting indicates progress at all levels. Analysis and enhanced reporting
on longer-term outcomes would improve appreciation of UNICEF’s longer-
term efforts and mobilization of contributions.
127. UNICEF reporting indicates that nearly all programmes are on track or have met expectations and
are contributing towards stated programme outcomes (as outlined in Table 4.2). Some
programmes have been delayed due to COVID-19 response activities.

Outcome 1 - Health & Nutrition: The most vulnerable children and their families
access improved quality and equitable health, nutrition, and early intervention
services

sector. This has been done by targeting the most vulnerable in some programming (e.g.,
emergency response), and across populations in other cases (immunization, newborn screening).
129. Specific outcome examples include the immunization work (see this section for more data),
newborn screening, the FCMT pilot, and the work of the BFHI. Some outcomes have been
impacted negatively by COVID-19 (e.g., immunization) because of lockdowns, competing
resources (including staffing), and even competing equipment (e.g., cold chain). On the other
hand, the newborn screening service was one of the first to reopen after lockdown, providing
critical services for newborns. Table 4.3 outlines in more detail the progress in vaccination rates.

# of children (0-59 months) vaccinated for polio 20,000 14,732
Outcome 2 – Education: Increased number of children aged 5-18 access quality inclusive
early and basic education in a child-friendly and protective environment
130. Jordan has achieved substantial progress in promoting access to education with an estimated 1.37
million students enrolled in the formal cycle (KG2 to Grade 12) as of 2017/2018. The net
enrolment rate for Basic Education was nearly universal at 94.7% compared to 71.2% for
secondary education. Overall, these rates are lower for Syrian refugees and lower for boys,
especially at the secondary level.64 As demonstrated below, UNICEF CP has contributed to
addressing the issue, notably by establishing new school infrastructure and expanding non-formal
education to more children.
131. The Education Programme established 26 schools in Za’atari by 2017. Also, 12 schools were
established in Azraq camp and 4 schools in Emirati Jordanian Camp (EJC) camp. Meanwhile, to
address the education needs in the host communities, schools operated beyond regulatory
capacity to provide twice as many seats for students. There were nearly 200 double-shifted
schools with 125,000 Syrian children enrolled.65 UNRWA provided elementary and preparatory
education (Grades 1-10) to 119,747 children through 172 schools. Between 2015 and 2017, the
Drop-Out programme reached 2,500 vulnerable youth of all nationalities. Meanwhile, the Catch-
Up Programme reached 1,600 children. More than 66,000 children in Jordan aged 5 to 17 were
enrolled in some form of informal education.66

132. Non-formal education (NFE) has contributed to the learning of nearly 300,000 Syrian and host-
community school-age children of whom more than 160,000 were out-of-school children.67 The
reach for the NFE programmes was diverse and inclusive on many levels. In terms of location, 70%
were enrolled in host community centres with 20% in Za’atari camp and 10% in Azraq camp. With
respect to nationality, 57% were Syrian, 34% Jordanian, and 9% of other nationalities. Of the 200
enrollees, 13% reported having disabilities, including sight impairment (44%), learning difficulties
(28%), physical disabilities (20%), and hearing impairment (8%).68
133. The Ma’An Programme covered all public schools run by the Ministry of Education for Jordanians
and Syrian refugees. As of 2017, out of the 3,241 of the public schools run by the Ministry of
Education, 115 schools were double shift schools for Syrian children, 40 Military Education, and
168 UNRWA schools located in host communities and designated refugee camps were
participating in the Programme.69
Outcome 3 – Child Protection: Improved and equitable prevention of and response to
violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect of children
134. The Child Protection Component has focused on ending violence against children, all forms of
violence, abuse, neglect, among other areas. The Component achieved the following results
across three pillars as follows:
135. Working with and support GoJ with legislative review, developing policy standards, alignment
with international standards, UNICEF has supported finalizing new Child Rights Law and Juvenile
Law (to be completed by 2022) and supported the National Commission for Family Affairs, an
inter-ministerial body, coordinating all family affairs including children, support in developing
SOP.
136. Working with GoJ, NGO and humanitarian agencies to address children and women at risk of
violence and exploitation, it has improved access and quality of services for most vulnerable
(women and children), using case management as an approach, ensure the number of children in
need of specialized child services receive adequate support/services, strengthened GoJ
institutions to deliver services and worked with Jordanian and Syrian populations (camps),
improve access to day-to-day services through case assessments.
137. To ensure children, families and communities have increased capacities for Prevention, it has
targeted social norm and behavioural change, worked with Makani centre and partners to
promote positive parenting, positive discipline, and targeted communities to prevent child rights
violations at different level (community, school, institution).
138. Key progress towards Outcome achievement has been demonstrated as UNICEF interventions in
Syrian and non-Syrian (camps and vulnerable areas in the Kingdom) have improved in terms of
scale, standards, reaching the vulnerable.

139. Quality has improved through various national frameworks, institutions, etc. through UNICEF
support, training of social/case workers using SOPs, partnership with IMC to target children in
camps including specific issues (child marriage, etc.)
140. The Case management approach has identified the multi-dimensional vulnerable to provide
services. Gaps have been identified in terms of reaching most vulnerable (with a focus for next
Country Program). The Component has advocated with donors for funding to strengthen
institutional capacity to strengthen nexus approach.
Outcome 4 – Youth & Adolescent: Young people (girls and boys) increasingly practice
positive behaviours and actively engage in society
141. The section has worked diligently to position UNICEF as a leader in Adolescent and Youth
Programming in Jordan, leading on the national self-employment and graduation agenda together
with the national government, while fostering partnerships with networks of CBOs, reaching the
most vulnerable
142. Investments have been made to leverage UNICEF’s work into wider programming, with enhanced
cross- agencies partnership to amplify results (WFP, UNHCR, ILO, UNDP, UNV) and working
towards institutionalizing programmes within Ministries and demonstrating to the government
solutions that work for future replication and systematizing meaningful volunteering at the
national level. This demonstrates medium term progress towards outcome achievement. Gender
responsive programming in the most vulnerable areas has been pursued, working towards the
wider goal of inclusivity.
Outcome 5 – WASH: Vulnerable people have access to safe drinking water, clean
environment, and key hygiene/water conservation practices
143. UNICEF ensured schoolchildren have access to proper sanitation and hygiene facilities.
Throughout the implementation of the country program, UNICEF has worked closely with the
Ministry of Education to roll out the WASH in School standards. This has involved connecting
schools to water networks, rehabilitating, or constructing new water and sanitation facilities, and
promoting sustainable hygiene and healthy behaviors. For example, in 2018, 13 schools and their
surrounding communities were connected to the water network by UNICEF and Yarmouk Water
Company, benefiting 1,924 students and 3,864 people in surrounding households. With that,
100% of schools in Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun and Mafraq governorates were connected to a water
network, reducing dependency on trucked water.7071
144. As documented, UNICEF has achieved full coverage in WASH for refugees and supported access
for vulnerable Jordanians in host communities.
145. UNICEF’s WASH interventions in schools have allowed many children students to have access to
WASH facilities and reduced the incidence of water and sanitation-related diseases. These
interventions also prevented children, especially girls, from missing school because of inadequate
70 According to the Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Schools Global Baseline Report 2018, only one-third of schools in
Jordan had adequate basic sanitation services.

39
facilities. However, major nationwide investments are required to meet the needs of all students
across the country and achieve SDG6.
4.4.1 Key Results by Section during COVID-19 2020 Operational
Period
146. The first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 3 March 2020, and on 14 March the country
introduced several measures including school closures to stop the transmission of the virus.
147. To address the health and socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, the GoJ developed a series of
plans and programmes to support vulnerable households and workers, and implemented
measures designed to support businesses, including delayed tax payments, partial payments of
salaries, and special loan programmes for small- and medium-sized enterprises. It launched its
COVID-19 vaccination programme in January 2021, which includes equitable access to vaccines
for anyone residing in Jordan (including refugees).
148. Jordan increased the coverage of the social security safety net, while facilitating the formalization
of informal workers and enterprises.72 The adoption of the National Social Protection Strategy
(2019-2025), expansion of the NAF, operationalization of the national unified registry, and the
innovation of digital payments have strengthened the social protection sector, which enabled a
more rapid and better coordinated shock-response. The Social Protection Response Committee
was set up to manage, organize and monitor the sector’s response to COVID-19.
149. It is important to note that the Result Resources Framework which the program has planned
against did not include allocations or targets for dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. However,
UNICEF worked closely with the Government of Jordan and other partners to contribute to the
country’s response to the emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. UNICEF COVID-19
related activities included both preparedness and response activities, in
the following three major areas: (1) limit human-to-human transmission and protect individuals
from exposure to COVID-19; (2) prevent and address the secondary impact of the outbreak –
minimize the human consequences for children and their communities; and (3) enhance risk
reduction and in-country preparedness including coordination.
150. Considering the challenges the CO faced during the period, it is important to recognize the
achievements of UNICEF Jordan. These achievements are summarized below for each of the CP
Components.

and better parenting services.
151. It is worth noting that the activities planned in the UNICEF Jordan’s response to the COVID-19
pandemic were all relevant. In fact, they aligned with the 2020 WHO global Strategic Response
Plan (SRP), and the 2020 UNICEF COVID-2019 Humanitarian Action for Children appeal. Together,
the results created by these activities have contributed to stopping the transmission of COVID-19
and keeping children and their families safe and healthy, as well as aiding to minimize the
secondary impacts of the outbreak and related control measures on children, including school
closures, the burden on local health systems for the delivery of primary care, as well as protection
risks and economic pressures felt by the most vulnerable in Jordan.
Finding 9: There is evidence of increasing effectiveness in outreach to different
groups, including the most marginalized. This is a key objective of the
JCO’s approach of targeting programme clients through a two-step
multidimensional vulnerability assessment.
152. As outlined in Section 2, UNICEF targets its programme clients through a multidimensional
vulnerability assessment. By interfacing geographic targeting with household targeting (in a two-
step process), it has been able to focus on a portion of those most in need and ensure access to
educational opportunities regardless of their nationality or refugee status.
153. An example of this is the characteristics that define the focus for the Hajati programme, which
include districts with high multidimensional vulnerability, high pressure on public services
(measured by the presence of double shift schools) and the availability of complementary services
- for example, the presence of UNICEF-supported Makani child protection centre). Household
targeting, based on a separate survey, allows UNICEF to rapidly assess the needs of crisis-affected

42
populations. Having previously developed this approach, the JCO was well placed to apply this
approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
154. In the case of Hajati, the programme uses a two-fold approach to identify and target households:
the first step is geographical targeting, where districts with high multidimensional vulnerability,
high pressure on public services (measured by the presence of double shift schools) and the
availability of complementary services (for example, the presence of UNICEF-supported Makani
child protection centres) are identified. The geographic targeting is then followed by household
targeting, based on a separate survey. This approach was also used in 2020 amidst the COVID-19
pandemic to rapidly assess the need of crisis-affected populations.
155. In response to COVID-19, UNICEF adopted new modalities for delivery of ECD activities and
remote case management. These efforts focused on extending support to the most vulnerable
(defined as children and women, as well as multi-dimensional poverty among Jordanians and non-
Jordanians, including Syrian refugees).
156. In a similar vein, UNICEF social protection programmes rapidly shifted modalities and expanded
coverage to respond to the implications of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable groups nationwide.
In 2020, for example, 9,118 unique households (29,699 children) received at least one cash
transfer to support their basic needs with an average monthly amount of 98.2 USD per household.
After two weeks of lockdown announcement UNICEF supported 4,323 (including 15,097 children)
vulnerable households to cover their basic needs. These households included those identified in
the cash assistance database as vulnerable or urgently referred from partner organizations and
UNICEF field staff. During June 2020, UNICEF expanded to cover additional vulnerable households
living in informal settlements (1,123 households).73
157. In the year 2020 alone, the expansion of the
social protection safety net with the support

158. Through the successful Takaful programme (see Box 5.3) and with the new targeting criteria and
the MIS-supported UNICEF, NAF coverage was expanded, almost doubling the number of
vulnerable households supported, mainly through cash assistance. For example, launched in early
2020, the second phase of Takaful expanded coverage to an additional 25,000 households,
reaching a total of 54,500 households (over 180,000 children) in two years. The innovative Za’atari

water and wastewater networks project, now delivering safe water directly to households,
benefiting over 79,000 residents (44,420 children). Marginalized and vulnerable groups also
benefited from the knowledge station services of the “Educational Loss Compensation Program”.
159. Provision of WASH services in informal settlements in 2018 alone, UNICEF and its partners
installed water storage tanks and latrines and provided hygiene and cleaning supplies, including
for menstrual hygiene management, in 103 informal tented settlement sites. These efforts have
led to reaching 14,590 people (59% children, 48% females), or 60% of the target for the year.75,76
UNICEF WASH staff confirmed that such interventions are critical given the terrible conditions in
informal settlements, with high rates of open defecation and limited access to drinking water.
160. In the area of Emergency WASH services, UNICEF supported projects that provide Syrian refugees
in camps with access to an adequate quantity of safe water (tankering and water infrastructure)
and appropriate sanitation facilities. For instance, in 2018, UNICEF-constructed water networks
delivered 20 liters per person per day of safe water for approximately 50,000 people (80% of them
women and children) sheltering at Rukban. In the same year, WASH services were provided daily
for all 127,308 people living in Za’atari, Azraq and King Abdullah Park Syrian refugee camps. This
allowed camp residents to earn a living in a safer environment. The UNICEF WASH program
activities in the camps also included community mobilization and hygiene promotion activities.77
WASH services now have been provided daily for all 127,308 people living in Za’atari, Azraq and
King Abdullah Park Syrian refugee camps.
161. Ensuring WASH services in refugee camps during the COVID-19 pandemic became even more
critical. Hence, from the year 2020, UNICEF provided necessary support to prevent, respond to
and mitigate the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable populations. UNICEF’s
response focused first on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), with camp-wide awareness
campaigns focusing on hygiene promotion and health information, supported by monthly
distributions of hygiene and cleaning supplies and increased volumes of water. WASH
infrastructure was urgently constructed in quarantine, isolation and COVID-19 treatment
facilities, and training on IPC was provided to over 2,000 refugees working with UNICEF in schools
and Makani Centers, key education personnel and members of the UNICEF-supported community
disinfection teams.78
162. UNICEF achieved important results in the refugee camps, even though the Government of Jordan
was not fully supportive of interventions that bring permanent infrastructure in the camps. In fact,
the Government of Jordan had political concerns, arguing that permanent infrastructure provided
by UNICEF and other partners in the camps would send a message that the Government was
making a permanent home for refugees in the country. Some stakeholders also emphasized that,
initially, UNICEF was not focusing interventions on strengthening community engagement in the
camps. It was when OXAM commissioned a study79 that showed relevance of community
75 In 2018, the estimated 18,000 people living in informal tented settlements were among the most vulnerable in Jordan.

engagement that UNICEF started acknowledging the importance of this aspect in ensuring
sustainability of WASH interventions in the camps.
Finding 10: Political, economic and the COVID-19 crises have been major factors
influencing the timely achievement of Country Programme outputs (and
thereby effecting outcomes), the continuity between social policy work
and implementation (due to changing cabinet priorities) and in some cases
the level of investments in some areas.
163. The UNICEF programme in Jordan must wrestle with numerous external factors in pursuing the
achievement of its outputs. These include government and system challenges (staffing,
bureaucracy, lack of awareness and prioritization of primary care, lack of availability and
fragmentation of data (particularly in health), human resources, key health, and nutrition issues
(COVID-19 and related determinants of health, non-communicable diseases, nutrition, family
planning and sexual and reproductive health and rights) affecting the long-term health and
welfare of children.
164. Frequent changes within Ministries have forced UNICEF to often repeatedly re-engage with new
personnel who may take new positions on initiatives. This is an inefficient approach, but certainly
not one within the control of UNICEF unless the initiative is dropped or downgraded.
165. The Geographic Multidimensional Vulnerability Analysis provides information and data regarding
the major factors influencing the achievement of Country Programme outputs but is still in its
infancy in use, presenting challenges in defining who is “the most vulnerable.” This analysis shows
that Jordan’s economy reduced 0.2% year over year to 1.9% in 2018, below the 2.6% average
between 2010 and 2016. It also indicates that absolute poverty rate was 15.7% in 2018 and that
more than 0.6 million children are multidimensionally poor and 0.004 million are acutely poor.
These contextual factors limit what UNICEF can achieve as an organisation in terms of impact.
Nevertheless, the Country programme has proven effective in delivering support to many of those
who are most vulnerable.
166. Despite efforts to expand coverage in education, the COVID pandemic has limited continued
progress (principally due to school closures). Challenges remain in the ability of children to engage
with distance education due to limitations of data, connectivity, compatible devices, and IT skills.
Girls and children with disabilities face challenges and need targeted support.
167. Having very small schools in rural areas and overcrowded classrooms in urban settings are the
two main challenges in providing access to education, especially after integrating Syrian refugees
into schools and the significant transfer of students from private to public schools for socio-
economic reasons. Approaches such as clustering schools with a low student population and
double shifting in congested schools were adopted to increase efficiency.
168. Critical needs have been addressed (WASH, health, education), while other efforts have been
delayed (Early Childhood Education, youth and adolescent work) due to re-prioritization.

169. The closures of the border and restrictions on movement hampered operations, made it more
difficult to reach those in need; Jordan faced a difficult balance between restricting the spread of
the disease while limiting socio-economic impacts on the country.
170. Challenges remain in the ability of children to engage with distance education due to limitations
of data, connectivity, compatible devices, IT skills, high costs, and restrictions in movement. These
challenges have led to a digital divide which further excluded the most vulnerable children from
accessing education.80
171. There are many economic and social factors influencing the education sector and its
achievements. Some examples include the higher dropout rate among boys due to poor academic
achievements, violence, bullying, and labour. Meanwhile, girls are more likely to be kept at home
due to protection concerns, household responsibilities, and early marriage. These discriminatory
social norms, gender bias, and stereotypes effect the education of girls.81
172. Internal factors that influence the impact of the achievement of the Country Programme outputs
in health and nutrition include a lack of focus on health and nutrition including a lack of resources,
and opportunities for increased communication, integration across sectors, and evaluations of
interventions.
173. Lack of focus on health and nutrition and lack of resources: Health is not a major focus for UNICEF
in Jordan, given that Jordan is an upper middle-income country.82 Yet as Jordan has a chronic
emergency response requirement (in terms of the Syrian refugees), an economy under pressure,
a resulting health systems gap has been evidenced and demonstrates a need for support. The lack
of funding was evidenced when confronted with the challenges of COVID-19 as was the
corresponding need for CP Sections to collaboratively work together for maximum effectiveness.
174. The overall economic situation in Jordan is not ideal following the COVID-19 pandemic, the
unemployment rate is high and job opportunities are scarce. There are some sectors which are
closed for Syrian refugees and their working permits are being revoked. These conditions are
influencing the recruitment of the graduates and NAF programs, both Jordanian and Syrians.
175. How UNICEF interventions in Jordan are financed explains, to some extent, why it is difficult for
the Agency to develop and implement long-term interventions. For example, during the
implementation of the country program, the funding received for WASH sector was generally
short-term, intermittent, and from UNICEF traditional donors. Tackling WASH challenges such as
non-revenue water, and water-related complex issues such as climate change and sustainable
management of ground water resources requires long-term financing. In the same vein, UNICEF
2018 report acknowledges that implementation of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation policies,

46
standards and legislation was constrained by the economic downturn and limited public
resources, among other key factors.83
Finding 11: A review of achieved results corresponds to the stated objectives of
UNICEF and the CP, which explicitly state the focus on gender equality,
programming for youth with the Child Rights Convention and
humanitarian principles are at the core of the UNICEF Jordan program.
Some effort has been made in reference to the human rights agenda,
however, direct attribution to this as a portion of programming is closely
equated with the commitment to humanitarian action to serve refugees’
needs.
176. In 2019 the Government of Jordan launched with the support of UNICEF, UNFPA and UNHCR the
National SOPs for the prevention and response to Gender Based Violence, Child Protection and
Family Violence.
177. The services were provided in safe spaces (free from abuse, violence, harm) operated in
partnership with the Jordanian government, UN agencies, and civil society organizations (CSOs)
to strengthen the protection response for survivors of violence in camps and host communities.
Safe spaces include women and girls’ safe spaces, community centres, youth and child protection
services but not shelters.
178. The Ministry of Education has advanced initiatives to strengthen the role of women in the
Education sector, including promotions to leadership and supervisory positions. The Ministry of
Education’s goal is increasing equity of gender, addressing gender issues in the education sector,
making quality education available to all students a fundamental human right, teaching methods
being gender-responsive, and teaching materials being free from gender stereotypes and biases.84
These initiatives can be attributed to the involvement of UNICEF programs that are been
implemented by the Ministry of Education and have advanced gender-related issues and gender
equality in the overall and sectoral workplan.
179. The needs of children with disabilities were addressed by ensuring schools have the needed
infrastructure such as ramps and other facilities, developing policies and frameworks to promote
inclusivity in schools, and having special resources and trained teachers who provide care for
children with disabilities and aid their learning process.
180. In 2019 UNICEF continued the delivery of safe water, supplying 158,000 people residing in the
three large camps and the north-eastern border, including over 80,000 women and girls and
10,000 people affected by disability. Access to appropriate and safely managed sanitation systems
was also provided to the 115,000 people living in these camps while WASH services were
expanded in the north-eastern border to include solid waste campaigns and hygiene promotion,
reaching 45,000 people, 35,700 of whom are children and women.
181. The UNICEF WASH program was guided by the principle of humanity, in the sense that WASH
interventions attempted to reach all those who needed at least basic WASH services (in schools,
83 UNICEF (2018). Country Office Annual Report (COAR) 2018.
84 Ministry of Education (2018). Education Strategic Plan 2018-2022.

47
refugee camps, informal settlements, vulnerable communities across the country), thus saving
lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. The shift to the
vulnerability approach enabled WASH interventions to address WASH needs in an impartial way
– based on needs alone – with no discrimination on any basis — nationality, race, gender, religion,
political opinion, or class. Finally, the program has allowed UNICEF to ensure the right of refugees
to receive WASH humanitarian assistance.
4.5 Impact
Finding 12: Social Cohesion: Innovative initiatives have been identified at community
level and executed which have helped to diminish potential conflicts and
promote greater social cohesion, while others contribute to addressing
data gaps.
182. Dislocation between camps and host communities, limits social cohesion. To mitigate the effect
of dislocation, workshops can be organized to connect all groups of the community and foster
stronger bonds between camp residents and host communities.
183. At a higher level, universities and institutions have integrated Syrian refugee students into the
higher education system. For example, LTUC targets Syrian students from the refugee camps and
other refugee nationalities with the support of UNICEF to obtain the necessary documents. In
addition, LTUC provided training to youth who dropped out of schools early in their lives due to
child labour and equipped them with the needed skills to align them with proper job
opportunities.
184. Social cohesion has been strengthened using media to promote awareness on the importance of
integrating all parts of community of all ages and nationalities without any discrimination, as it
benefits everyone in achieving a better quality of life on all levels.
185. There are indications that overall acceptance, cooperation, and social cohesion at the community
level between the host community and the refugees has increased. Amongst children and youth,
UNICEF reports a 35% increase in willingness to play and work with other students of different
ages and nationalities.
186. Social cohesion was promoted and leveraged in all WASH interventions. In particular, the WASH
program’s shift to a vulnerability approach enabled UNICEF Jordan to further promote social
cohesion among children of various nationalities and backgrounds, and between boys and girls.
By strengthening the water sector institutional capacities and systems (policies and strategies),
UNICEF created conditions that enabled the improvement of the water supply and sanitation
infrastructure and services in cities, schools, refugee camps and at community and household
levels. By implementing the new approach, UNICEF addressed an important underlying cause of
vulnerabilities, thereby promoting social cohesion and inclusion. In fact, the program addressed
multiple overlapping disparities, including between boys and girls, geographic areas, disability
status and other dimensions.

48
187. On the other hand, by expanding WASH services to the most vulnerable people in Jordan (e.g.,
through rehabilitation of WASH systems in highly vulnerable areas), and by empowering people
(e.g., through WASH sensitization campaigns aimed at raising people’s awareness of the
importance of hygiene or water conservation), the WASH component of the country program
contributed to the protection of human rights and social cohesion in communities.
188. Through sector coordination mechanisms and coordination efforts at the camp and informal
settlement levels, the UNICEF WASH program ensured the needs of those in camps, host
communities and in the settlements were addressed in a coherent manner. These mechanisms
allowed to design activities that targeted the most vulnerable, notably in the camps, host
communities and informal settlements.
189. There is some indication that social cohesion may have improved through a vulnerability approach
to the provision of services for Jordanians and Syrian refugees, but the lack of detailed
data/information precludes an accurate assessment of the vulnerability approach’s contribution
to higher social cohesion at the community level. There is no additional evidence (e.g., survey,
interviews with beneficiaries) showing any changed social cohesion at the community level as a
result of a vulnerability approach in health and nutrition in Jordan. However, it has been well
documented the level of discontent which existed in hosting communities where the previous
focus of efforts was on refugees, and that providing services for both Jordanians and Syrians (e.g.,
new-born screening) has helped improve this.
190. Despite a broader vulnerability approach which enabled UNICEF to focus on strengthening a
comprehensive national social protection system that reaches specific population groups
affected, including youth and women, interviewed stakeholders consistently indicated that one
of the remaining challenges in Jordan is limited participation of women in the labour force as
compared to men. These views are consistent with the most recent statistics on women
employment in Jordan. The labour force survey85 conducted by the Department of Statistics in
Jordan86 indicates that the unemployment rate for males has decreased by 1.5 percentage points
and has decreased for females by 2.3 percentage points. However, women unemployment rates
remain high, and the trend as noted in Section 2, has continued in 2022.
Finding 13: With child and youth issues at the core of its mandate, the UNICEF Jordan
CP has developed strong links with the government, other UN agencies,
CSOs, and donors and consequently is recognized as a champion of child
rights. This commitment is evident from its work ranging from ECE, child
education to youth training, ensuring no child is left behind.
191. UNICEF plays a critical advocacy role vis-à-vis its interaction with the GoJ and through the JRP.
This emerged clearly with the onset of COVID-19, when UNICEF took vigorous action on a range
of fronts.
85 Department of Statistics (2021). Labor Force Survey - 2021.
86 The labour force survey includes a sample size of about 16,000 families distributed over all governorates of the Kingdom, and is
representative of urban, rural and governorates. The labour force survey is carried out in the middle of each quarter of the year and
provides data that reflects the reality of the entire quarter (July, August, September), and the individual is asked whether he/she
searched for work during the four weeks preceding the day of the interview, according to the international recommendations
adopted in Jordan.

192. In its range of work which includes care for families and their children, ensuring much-needed
cash support, in its work in health and WASH, in its public awareness campaigns and, importantly,
in taking leadership and supporting social policy development, in Social Protection and Child
Protection UNICEF has delivered leadership.
193. As the Education Sector Working Group Lead Coordinator, UNICEF assumes a leadership role in
shaping and influencing the direction of the education program design and implementation to
strengthen the Education sector in the long term.87 The added value of UNICEF’s work is evidenced
in their follow-up on policy work, support for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
programmes, support for scaling up and technical support for ensuring the impact for the
implemented programs is both observed and identified for other working group members and
donors to collaborate with.
194. UNICEF’s champions of child and youth issues and strengthening the education system is
anchored in SDG 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning
opportunities for all). UNICEF advocacy and support for the ESP and its six key domains - early
childhood education (ECE), access and equity, quality, teachers’ development, system
strengthening, and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) – has been effective
and has taken advantage of its position as a thought leader, advocate, partner and provider.
195. Some of the results generated through the implementation of the WASH program contribute to
the positioning and readiness of UNICEF Jordan to champion children’s rights in Jordan. To start
with, UNICEF supported the WASH assessment in schools,88 targeting WASH facilities in 3,681
public schools nationwide. The results of the assessment offer a powerful entry point to highlight
the key WASH in schools’ priorities and needs and influence policy and decision makers. In fact,
the assessment report formulated a series of recommendations that could help UNICEF and other
WASH stakeholders to conceive and implement sound interventions, with results that could be
sustained. These recommendations concern different WASH areas, including latrine facilities,
water systems in schools, water quality, waste disposal and sewerage system and hygiene
practices promotion. Based on this assessment, UNICEF is particularly well positioned and
equipped to influence decision making on WASH issues in Jordan’s schools. The Government of
Jordan and other stakeholders also got a better understanding of the issues; so, they can design
school WASH interventions that address the real issues and in the right places.
196. The national water and wastewater vulnerability maps produced by UNICEF and the Ministry of
Water and Irrigation constitute another output that enables UNICEF to position itself in
championing national efforts in favour of children’s rights related to WASH services. As indicated
previously, these maps have already provided UNICEF with a solid basis for prioritization of its
interventions.
197. The work UNICEF has undertaken in health and nutrition, including funding reports, building the
evidence base, developing systems and models in a variety of areas, and providing technical
capacity has helped to position it as a champion of child issues in Jordan related to health and
nutrition.

198. UNICEF Jordan has provided technical capacity and funding to produce numerous reports and
build an evidence base to help understand issues and identify recommendations for moving
forward. It funded a report on B-Thalassemia in Jordan (2019) to estimate the economic burden
in Jordan, and identify policy levers for addressing this burden,89 and provided financial support
for the Jordan National Micronutrient and Nutrition Survey (JNMNS) (2019) (draft 2020, awaiting
government approval).90
199. UNICEF has also provided funding for models in primary health care and community volunteer
models. The FCMT model was implemented with support from UNICEF, focusing on vulnerable
populations including both vulnerable Jordanians and Syrian refugees in Mafraq and Irbid
governorates. 91 A baseline assessment for this FCMT pilot was completed in 2018.92 UNICEF has
helped to strengthen data systems in Jordan, including supporting the development and piloting
of a neonatal death audit and surveillance system. 93 94 In addition, UNICEF has provided funding
and support for programs such as the BFHI, immunization, school health, emergency health
response, and newborn screening. This work has played an important role in positioning and
equipping UNICEF to champion child issues in Jordan.
200. Consulted stakeholders acknowledge that the activities implemented by the Social Protection
section have positioned UNICEF as leading agency of the sector. The national protection strategy
adopted in 2019, the many studies and assessments conducted, and the financial and technical
support provided by UNICEF were consistently highlighted as key factors contributing to this
positioning. Through its involvement in programs such as Hajati, Makani, and Takaful, UNICEF is
well positioned within the community of national actors and development partners, including UN
agencies, to champion child and women issues in Jordan.
201. Most respondents in this evaluation also emphasized that, by adopting a data-driven approach
and by pushing for important policy changes, UNICEF continued to position itself as the country’s
knowledge hub advocacy lead for children. As analysed in this report, UNICEF capitalized on its
established relationship with the Government and accelerated its support for national data
systems, ensuring monitoring of the situation of vulnerable children in the whole country.

4.6 Sustainability
Finding 14: UNICEF Jordan has made substantial efforts to work with a wide
spectrum of stakeholders to develop lasting partnerships, which can be
maintained beyond donor programs. There are several situations where
this is exemplified, including co-financing, program development,
stimulating volunteerism and mobilizing the private sector to contribute,
which engaged the GoJ to adopt and embed successful programs in its
long-term plans.
202. UNICEF has made a significant contribution to offset the suffering of children and their families
through a strategic partnership for the National Aid Fund (i.e., Takaful Programs) ensuring
thousands have received critical support. The changes to the NAF are structural and long term
and will be sustainable through commitments of GoJ.
203. The Nashatati Model of education programming is aligned with the vision of the Life Skills and
Citizenship Education (LSCE) Initiative agenda and aims to foster life skills and social cohesion. The
Ministry of Education has embraced this model and has now embedded it in its programming,
after two years of pilots. Leveraging the partnership, this has increased access for all vulnerable
children to quality after-school activities, increased participation and greater psycho-social
wellbeing of children and youth. In terms of sustainability, it mobilizes volunteers and the
communities, with the objective of ultimately leading to greater tolerance and appreciation of
diversity, inter-personal acceptance, team-work, and shared sense of belonging.
204. Partnering with the Jordan Strategy Forum, UNICEF collaborated to produce a report on the
national social protection system response during the first six months of the COVID-19 crisis. The
report highlighted the challenges of mitigating the negative socio-economic consequences of
COVID-19, the measures taken to increase the coverage of the social protection and support of
the most vulnerable, and the lessons learned to support a shock-responsive national system. The
report covers the three pillars of the National Social Protection System including social assistance,
social services, and social security. This worked contributed to the GoJ downstream planning and
preparedness for the next wave of the pandemic, which ultimately came, producing an effective
response.
205. As noted earlier, the collaboration with other UN agencies led to important research which
contributed to better targeting of the most vulnerable and those impacted the greatest by the
COVID lockdown. UNICEF’s collaboration with Luminus and BDC has mobilized sustainable and
important commitments from the private sector. And collaboration with communities to
improving Jordanians in need has mobilized them to support their own development in a range
of areas, while improving social cohesion.
206. UNICEF programmes and the outcomes that were achieved have strengthened the national
system and supported national ownership to a high degree. A key reason was their efforts were
integrated within the existing operating system through partnership models, including Takaful,
NAF, ECE, MAAN, Learning Bridges, with the Ministry of Education. In addition, the
communication and coordination between UNICEF and the stakeholders created a greater
© UNIVERSALIA
52
foundation for their ownership. Finally, UNICEF’s respect for the technical expertise of their
partners allowed for best practices and decision making to be decided by the partners.
207. The Takaful programs, NAF, ECE, Learning Bridges, and MAAN campaign are led by the Ministry
of Education or the Ministry of Social Development. These programmes were initially designed in
partnership with UNICEF with the aim of eventually institutionalizing these programs. These
programs have become institutionalized, including in the Ministry’s budget lines and capacity
development through trained staff members. UNRWA’s work on the Ma’An’s programme relies
on technical and financial assistance from UNICEF in the long term and demonstrates the probable
situation for the future.95
208. At the Ministry of Social Development, UNICEF trained staff have improved systems at the
Ministry, including provision of credible information for planning. Increasing national ownership
processes have resulted in the UNICEF trained staff subsequently being supported by the NAF.
209. In the WASH component, UNICEF increasingly worked with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation
and other sector entities (e.g., water utilities and local water authorities) to develop and
implement in partnership with them a whole range of initiatives. By involving these national and
local institutions in its WASH interventions, UNICEF Jordan contributed to their ownership and
sustainability.
210. However, the evaluation found that, for some interventions, ownership of results is unlikely or
not fully guaranteed. Stakeholders consulted indicated that the temporary nature of the camps
makes the sustainability of UNICEF-supported WASH infrastructure and associated services
challenging. The GoJ is not in favour of making camp infrastructure permanent, and it is not always
clear what the fate of the water and wastewater systems developed with the support of UNICEF
in the camps will be, should the camps get closed.
211. Similarly, the study by OXFAM96 on Community engagement in WASH service delivery in Za’atari
camp revealed that there is a lack of ownership of the WASH infrastructure among many refugee
households. This threatens sustainability of the infrastructure and related services, calling for
more work on community engagement. According to this study, the lack of ownership and
sustainability is mainly associated with the type of water governance arrangements and
frameworks regulating water and sanitation provision in the refugee camps in Jordan as well as
the status of users of WASH services in the camps (refugee status).
212. In the SPSP Section, the design and implementation of programmes such as Makani and Hajati
emerged through collaborative processes between UNICEF Jordan and key government
institutions, as well as development partners operating in the social protection sector. For
example, linking Makani with the overall Jordan Refugee Response Plan was crucial to the
programme’s success and sustainability.
213. By embedding these social protection programmes and concepts within a planning mechanism
that is both multi-sectoral and inter-agency, the programmes were not just perceived as UNICEF’s
programmes, but were appreciated and owned by all involved actors. Evidence collected in this
evaluation shows that UNICEF Jordan has worked with government partners, and other
95 Aan Associates (2017). Evaluation of The Ma’An (Together) towards a Safe School Environment Programme 2009-2016 – Jordan.

53
stakeholders to turn social protection concepts into action, making them real, with observable
and lasting results. UNICEF’s stakeholders admitted that through integration and collaboration,
UNICEF social protection programmes are better owned and are likely to address poverty and
social vulnerability issues if sustained. Sustaining these programmes is perceived as having the
potential to help break the cycle of poverty and ensuring better futures for children, their
communities, and the Jordanian society as a whole.
Finding 15: UNICEF efforts in education, WASH, Youth and Adolescent
Development, and Child Protection combined have contributed to the
sustainability of results. Efforts in Health and Nutrition have ensured
improved practice on care for newborns and children and positive
parenting. Importantly, UNICEF has supported longer term reflection on
child and youth development which has led to system enhancements
and supports effecting change which is enduring and integrated into the
GoJ policies, plans and programs.
214. In Education efforts, reform of learning contents and teaching methods, curriculum, delivery, and
assessment systems, as well as the institutional environment in
which learning takes place, contributes directly to lasting quality

sustainability of the service.”97
215. Efforts in the Health and Nutrition sector have increased
knowledge and improved practice on care for newborns and
children, early stimulation, positive parenting, and protection. COVID-19 health initiatives and
immunizations efforts have contributed to the safety, long-term healthy development of
vulnerable children.
216. UNICEF Jordan’s health and nutrition work was done together with the GoJ, and embedded in the
government, to ensure the handovers were successful, and that many aspects of the projects have
been sustained. This includes the building of the perinatal and neonatal audit and surveillance
system, which had buy-in from the Ministry of Health to implement in all hospitals. Immunization
in camps has been successfully handed over to the Ministry, while UNICEF continues to pay a small
transport allowance for the Ministry of Health to do these. National ownership is high and
evidenced by comments from a number of KIIs.
217. However, some UNICEF and GoJ staff noted challenges in sustainability, and more time is needed
to ensure the government can take over the work given the challenges in the health and nutrition
sector with the Syrian refugee crisis, followed by COVID-19. While there may be ownership from
the Ministry of Health, it has been noted that challenges may arise if UNICEF support does not
continue (e.g., newborn screening) given the budget implications for the Ministry of Health,

resulting in reduced reach of programs. It was noted that a system approach requires investment
from the Ministry in terms of financial and technical support, and this is not always possible.
Human resources need ongoing training, and commodities and supplies are also needed to ensure
sustainability over the long-term, and this remains a challenge.
218. Despite the ambiguity about how long the GoJ will host the Syrian refugee camps, the water
systems built in these camps with UNICEF support were designed to provide long-term
functionality, even if UNICEF were to leave. The quality of the equipment is high, which adds to
the longevity of the systems. Although supporting the construction of WASH infrastructures with
materials and supplies of high quality is not a priori directly a guarantor of sustainability, such
materials are an essential element of sustainability. In addition, the WASH committees
established as part of the WASH interventions to oversee water access and hygiene promotion
contribute to sustainability of systems.98
219. Other measures taken by UNICEF Jordan that are likely to contribute to the sustainability of the
results achieved relate to UNICEF’s focus on interventions that strengthen systems and build the
capacity of relevant actors. Policy development and implementation and related outcomes are
evident in all sections, and they have the potential to sustain created benefits.
220. For example, to help the government achieve the ambitious WASH in Schools standards and
support those with limited resources, UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Education to develop
an accompanying support system building on the global Three Star Approach.99 Using this
approach, schools can aim for and achieve several smaller but sustainable milestones on their
way to reaching the National Standards. The establishment of climate action clubs also constitutes
an important factor of sustainability.
221. The Country Programme’s efforts have placed UNICEF in a strong position in priority areas for
future interventions, in Child Protection, which has been identified as a priority area, of key
importance due to the deteriorating environment children have been exposed to.
▪ Evidence generation, policy dialogue and advocacy for children remain critical issues
where work has been advanced.
▪ The National Council for Family Affairs has indicated the urgent need for the endorsement
of the Child’s Rights Law, while both the government and UNICEF have indicated the
importance of making ending the prevalence of violence against children a whole of
Government and whole of society priority. This has been underpinned by the National
Study on Violence Against Children in Jordan. The importance of this was reinforced
during the December 2021 Jordan visit of the Special Representative for the SG.
222. Upstream system strengthening work, including health information system strengthening and
programs like the BFHI that are integrated into the Government of Jordan’s work, help to ensure
sustainability of some health and nutrition systems in Jordan. UNICEF and GoJ KIIs noted that the
work on the primary care system and work such as the BFHI is integrated from the start into the
98 International Solutions Group (2019). Evaluation of UNICEF's response to the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Needs in Jordan as a
result of the Syrian refugee crisis (July 2012 to July 2017).
99 The first level ensures that minimal, but useable WASH facilities are available and daily group hygiene activities are practiced. The
next levels bring further enhancements of infrastructure and practices for keeping facilities clean and functional and providing
essential supplies depending on available resources and management capacities of schools.

accreditation program, and that the health information work is developed with the government
through a national unified reporting system. UNICEF works in close consultation with the
government on these interventions. In immunization, much of the funding is already provided by
the GoJ and the cost for PKU milk formula is now under multi-donor costing. It was noted that,
UNICEF, through working with various partners, and advocating and delivering evidence, helped
find lasting solutions.
223. On the other hand, the clinic at Rukban already closed in March 2020, and hence was not
sustained despite 12,500 people remaining in the area. It was identified in UNICEF interviews that
further work needs to focus on ensuring that the systems are sustainable, and that these are
serving the most vulnerable.
224. UNICEF developed a communication strategy amongst stakeholders at the Ministry of Education
and employed a variety of monitoring tools to ensure sustainability in the program, including
regular progress reports submitted by partners, validated by programme visits, and by the use of
the Integrated Monitoring and Evaluation Plan.100 To ensure institutional memory and long-term
sustainability, professional development initiatives by qualified human resource staff was
provided to promote staff retention.101
225. To ensure sustainability of MAKANI project for example, the Ministry of Social Development will
hand over the activities to the local NGOs while the Ministry’s role is to supervise the
implementation. The Ministry will provide a modest fund annually for sustaining the project.
226. Social protection programmes supported by UNICEF Jordan included upstream work that is crucial
for ensuring the sustainability of the whole country programme, enabling the country to give
every child an equitable chance in life. The support of UNICEF to develop appropriate information
systems and/or structures has enabled the Government and other key stakeholders to monitor
the situation of children’s rights, as well as the degree to which duty bearers fulfil their duties.
These systems allow actors to base their interventions on sound knowledge and to check if social
protection services are provided to the right beneficiaries, while ensuring that the services are
provided in a sustainable manner.
227. Similarly, UNICEF-supported studies on children’s rights issues constitute an important building
block for ensuring sustainability of social protection programmes. As seen before, these studies
have helped the Government and other actors develop evidence-informed policies and strategies,
thus tackling issues in a sound and sustainable manner. Finally, an important aspect of UNICEF’s
upstream work which contributes to the sustainability of social protection programmes is the
institutional capacity strengthening dimension of its interventions. This study has described many
instances where UNICEF strengthened the capacities of relevant government institutions (e.g.,
NAF, Ministry of Social Development), helping them to move from policies to actual policy
implementation.

4.7 Connectedness
Finding 16: Importantly, in the areas of Education and WASH, the humanitarian
interventions have supported progress towards the humanitarian
development shift or contributed to development interventions (Nexus).
However, achieving a fully developed nexus approach in the Jordan
requires high-level political commitment, a clear vision and long-term
resources going forward.
228. UNICEF-supported programmes have allowed the GoJ to deal with the emergency needs of
families and children, while at the same time providing a solution to developmental issues such
as fighting child labour and preparing the youth for labour market. The program also strove to
transition from emergency interventions to a more nexus-oriented approach.
229. In the WASH sector, UNICEF Jordan has dedicated a great deal of its interventions to WASH
emergencies, notably by supporting the humanitarian response in Syrian refugees’ camps. After
the emergency phase, the WASH infrastructure established by UNICEF in the camps was designed
and constructed to ensure long-term, sustained functionality. It can therefore be argued that the
WASH humanitarian interventions supported by UNICEF have contributed to a relatively lasting
improvement in the living conditions of the refugees. UNICEF interventions have equally
supported policies and strategies that improve the water supply and sanitation infrastructure in
other vulnerable communities across the country. More specifically, the WASH component has
supported vulnerable families in host communities with improved water systems and wastewater
infrastructure that are sustainable and climate resilient and expanding coverage to unreached
areas.
230. The Hajati programme provides an interesting example of how UNICEF considered the
humanitarian and development dimensions. By prioritizing the poorest and most vulnerable
children – irrespective of their nationality or legal status – Hajati provides crucial support and
ensures that no child is left behind. Hajati, however, is not simply a cash transfer programme that
responds to humanitarian needs; it also supports the development of a sustainable social
protection system in Jordan, through the NAF.
231. UNICEF interventions interwoven with the Education Strategic Plan 2018-2022 have been
effective in contributing to humanitarian needs, while evolving progressively as development
interventions in nature and composition, as well as being sustainable.
232. While UNICEF’s health and nutrition work included a transition to development interventions, this
shift was hampered by budget constraints, the ongoing chronic emergency of Syrian refugees,
suggesting the need for a high-level political commitment.
© UNIVERSALIA
57
233. Challenges in the transition to development from humanitarian assistance include budget
constraints, as well as non-budget challenges.102 UNICEF is changing its advocacy approach to
ensure donors understand the need to provide resources for the development-humanitarian
nexus.103 104 It was noted by UNICEF Jordan staff that the emergency is really a chronic emergency
(rather than a short-term emergency), and further investment in the nexus approach is needed,
as is a high level of political commitment. By strengthening overall systems (e.g., data systems,
PHC, screening), UNICEF and GoJ staff noted that this is strengthening systems for Jordanians as
well as refugees. This is also noted in documents consulted.105
234. Consulted stakeholders generally indicated that humanitarian funding is decreasing, while
development funding is slightly increasing. However, they voiced the concern that the
development funding is not benefiting all agencies because it is channeled through ministries.
Notwithstanding, some of the donors consulted emphasized that Jordan is a good example where
they are learning that more and more can be (and should) done through the national systems. In
their views, Jordan being a middle-income country that can provide services directly to its citizens,
development partners should strive to provide direct support to Government. While it is still not
easy for every Government to integrate refugees inside their systems that provide services to
their citizens initially, these stakeholders argued that, to the extent possible, the role of UNICEF
and other development partners, especially the UN Agencies, should be more of technical
advisors in their specific sector areas.
235. UNICEF Jordan recognizes that the nexus approach requires funding commitments that are not
aligned with the current program cooperation agreement which is only one year and is perceived
as not being enough. In this regard, the analysis found that during the implementation of the
country program, UNICEF has started exploring alternative financing to implement interventions
that allow to effectively address humanitarian needs while at the same time addressing the
resilience of Jordanian communities.
236. One such example is the new regional project launched in November 2021 and funded by the
Adaptation Fund. This 14 million USD project is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of
Environment and Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Jordan, among other partners. It seeks to
increase the capacity of local authorities, refugees, and host communities in Jordan to better
address climate change-related water scarcity. The cities of Irbid and Mafraq were selected as the
project’s target location due to recurrent droughts, extreme heat and a shift in rainfall patterns
which have recently become major concerns for these areas. The priority adaptation measures
selected for this project include rainwater harvesting, greywater treatment and reuse systems,
wastewater treatment, and irrigation.
237. Finally, there is a lack of collective and coordinated effort, as implementing the nexus requires a
shared vision, strategy, and planning beyond one development entity. Although there are sectoral
working groups, the humanitarian and development working groups do not necessarily speak with
each other. This was emphasized by several members of working groups and CSOs as a key

58
structural constraint to the work of UN system agencies. Despite GOJ efforts to ensure
coordination, the reality is that humanitarian stakeholders do not always attend meetings; there
are still some humanitarian stakeholders who continue to have meetings by themselves without
involving the Government.
238. Overall, it remains challenging to achieve a fully developed nexus approach in the Jordan context
because of varied factors: the lack of high-level political commitment and limited funding.

5 Conclusions
239. Generally, the UNICEF CP was designed and implemented with the aim of “leaving no one behind”
and has adequately adapted to evolving global priorities and context, including in the time of
COVID-19 emergency. Over the past two years WASH, Education and Health and Nutrition, the
Youth and Adolescent, Child Protection and Social Inclusion/Protection Sections provided critical
contributions and support for the vulnerable population in Jordan, especially the most vulnerable
children, and strengthened the GoJ system through multiple approaches, methods, implementing
partners and institutions.
240. The range of work within the country programme context all represent key priorities of Jordan,
the UNSF and UNICEF. The priority needs of the vulnerable in Jordan continue to be the focus for
UNICEF ensuring opportunities for quality education reachable for all, including developing new
programs to address new challenges and maintaining continuity in the delivery of educational
services. The evaluation found that, as of 2021, UNICEF CP was on track towards achieving the
targets of output-level indicators across all CP components. The CP activities have made a
significant contribution to the improvement of key policies and strategies. Several of the CP
activities also helped GoJ’s institutions to move from policy to implementation and to provide
direct services to children and their families, thus creating changes in their living conditions.
241. UNICEF Jordan has put in place mechanisms to ensure that many interventions are sustainable,
and that the Government of Jordan owns these. This includes working in concert with the
government, and ensuring interventions are integrated within the government’s work. The
UNICEF Jordan Country Office has been at the forefront of building the capacity of the GoJ. With
the onset of COVID-19, it ensured the delivery of vital services to children and young people, as
well as supporting the population in continuing their long-term positive development through
access in a variety of ways.106
242. UNICEF’s shift to a vulnerability approach has played an important role in achieving the CP results.
The approach involves support for the establishment of a comprehensive national social
protection system that reaches all children in Jordan. This has meant addressing the structural
and intergenerational dimensions of inequity – targeting vulnerable children from all nationalities,
including those involved in labour, living with disabilities and those from marginalized minority
groups. This is a long-term process that the building blocks are now in place for.
243. In sectors such as WASH, UNICEF program is working on the transition between emergency and
development. Transitioning from a predominantly humanitarian response towards a more system
strengthening, and vulnerability approach has enabled UNICEF to continue the nexus-based
program journey with increased system-based and upstream-level approaches. However,
achieving a fully developed nexus approach in the Jordan requires high-level political
commitment, a clear vision and long-term resources going forward.

244. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF has operated in a flexible manner to adapt
quickly to the changing context, including designing and implementing new programs and
modalities to response to the impact of school closures nationwide.
245. The health of a child and addressing nutrition is integral to all areas of UNICEF’s work. COVID-19
has further illustrated that health needs to be a focus for UNICEF given its direct link to child
development.
246. There is an opportunity for increased communications and decreased competitiveness within the
Country Office. The need to work across sections was well noted by the UNICEF team as some of
the work (e.g., with adolescents) is very vertical. While some of this cross-sectoral work is being
done, there is further opportunity to ensure that work is integrated.
247. There have been suggestions that UNICEF’s requirement of implementing partners to contribute
15% minimum of project financing should be revisited. Some INGO believe the percentage
contribution should vary, depending on the degree of risk on the implementation. KIIs raised that
this gatekeeper contribution amount may prevent some organizations from working with UNICEF
as it is considered an inhibiting factor.
248. Due to the declining budget trend which can be observed in Figure 5.1 and 5.2 below, the Country
Programme must make choices for UNICEF’s investments in Jordan. A prioritization exercise has
been conducted and reflection on the future programme within the Jordan Response Plan and
regional context taken place. To ensure a comprehensive approach that considers the most
essential aspects of the work, and to be done in the most effective, relevant, and coherent
manner, close coordination, and consultation with the government of Jordan, stakeholders and
donors is essential.

6 Lessons Learned
249. An early start of planning and partner engagement delivers better understanding of objectives,
coordination, and collaboration. The findings of this evaluation show that UNICEF CP
programming developed solid partnerships with Government institutions as well as other UN
agencies, implementing organizations, institutions, including donors and NGOs, which promoted
positive engagements and ensured broad support in Jordan, thus facilitating coordination,
avoiding duplication, and stimulating investments and contributions from others; thus, expanding
the reach of programs to the most vulnerable in Jordan.
250. Flexibility and agility are key to effective programming in a complex and ever-changing context;
these characteristics allow programmes to adapt to different shocks, in particular, for the most
vulnerable. The CP was implemented in the context of COVID-19; yet UNICEF was able to respond
flexibly to the emergencies caused by the pandemic, adjusting its programming and flexibly
deploying relevant and innovative approaches to service delivery.
251. Cash Plus approaches may have a more powerful and long-lasting effects than cash transfer
alone. However, according to case studies examined, “Cash Plus” components need to be fit-for-
purpose. “Interventions should be tailored to the unique needs of each context, with an
elaborated theory of change that is realistic about what “Cash Plus” can and cannot achieve.”109
252. A more inclusive and targeting approach with more relaxed targeting thresholds is beneficial
for addressing economic and social vulnerabilities of children and families. The CP successfully
deployed an approach that aimed to reach all children in Jordan, irrespective of their status, but
targeting vulnerable children from all nationalities, including those involved in labour, living with
disabilities and those from marginalized minority groups. Localizing work has proved effective for
targeting those most in need and to deliver services and resources to them.

7 Recommendations
253. Recommendation 1: New planned programming of UNICEF should be based on the most current
situation building on the data provided by the vulnerability analysis considering the regional
context and impact of COVID-19. Early evidence points to an increasing number of vulnerable
persons in Jordan, and a corresponding decline in the vulnerable populations’ economic and social
situational context and environment. A potential implication of this is increased tension between
camps and host communities which limit social cohesion. To mitigate the effect of dislocation,
workshops can be organized to connect all groups of the community and foster stronger bonds
between camp residents and host communities. Priority: High, Stakeholder: UNICEF Jordan
254. Recommendation 2: ICT is clearly a key area of intervention in education, and there is potential
sector for growth at national level, with long-term shift in education training using ICT related,
particularly in the area of skills development, where Jordan has been challenged to move the
needle forward. The next UNICEF CP 5-year strategy needs to include and focus on digital literacy
access to technology and access to internet for learning. Not only does this enable accessibility in
times of crisis but serves to address remote communities who need support and improved access.
As can been seen during COVID-19 closure, this system change work enable UNICEF to support
the Government of Jordan to enhance social protection coverage and coordination of social
protection programmes (work which should also be built upon). Priority: Medium, Stakeholder:
UNICEF, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, and
Ministry of Social Development.
255. Recommendation 3: The Jordan Country Office should continue its efforts towards (and advocacy
for) a full application of the humanitarian-development (nexus) approach to ensure that UNCIEF’s
humanitarian interventions create benefits for the developmental interventions and have a
lasting impact on the living conditions of the Jordanian populations. As part of the change strategy
advanced by the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025 this includes systematically linking analysis,
planning and monitoring of results and financing. Reflecting on pasts efforts and work in what
has been considered as Nexus programming, identifying and monitoring results will enable
improved identification of what the approach has yield and progress achieved along the
humanitarian to development continuum. Priority: High, Stakeholder: UNICEF Jordan
256. Recommendation 4: In the next programming cycle, the UNICEF Jordan Country Office should
apply a gender, climate, and disability lens in a targeted way with an eye on achieving measurable
substantial results. This is of critical importance as UNICEF has elevated programming on gender,
disability rights and ensuring a sustainable climate and environment within its Strategic Plan 2022-
2025. The next CP should increase efforts to integrate identifiable gender-equality programming
for transformative results., working across all country programs in pursuit of the UNICEF
objectives of redressing gender inequalities, removing structural barriers, working to change
harmful gender norms, and empowering girls, women and disadvantaged people from diverse
population groups.
257. Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on Jordan, most likely leading to increased
temperatures, variation in precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, and flash flooding.
UNICEF Jordan has implemented some interventions aimed to contribute to creating climate
resilient institutions and communities in the country, thus indirectly strengthening Jordan’s
capacity to deal with climate change. It should continue and build upon with support safe and

sustainable climate and environment for children, maintaining WASH programming and
continuing the involvement of youth as engines for leading awareness on the importance of
addressing climate issues.
258. Its efforts in promoting and protecting the rights of children with disabilities could be
supplemented with enhanced commitments to capacity building for teachers and support for
service delivery for communities in remote areas with vulnerable children. Priority: High,
Stakeholder: UNICEF, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Water &
Irrigation
259. Recommendation 5: Careful consideration of priorities and presentation of the new Country
Program through string engagement with stakeholders is important. UNICEF should present
programming adjustment and changes as a reflection of addressing the needs of the most
vulnerable; the increased demands being placed on UNICEF to ensure there is a sound
understanding of the approach and the reduced resources available for the Jordan CP, to ensure
there is misunderstanding that this is an indication of reduced UNICEF interest or needs of
Jordan’s children. Priority: Medium Stakeholder: UNICEF
