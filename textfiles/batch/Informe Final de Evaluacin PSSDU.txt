Executive summary
General description of the intervention
The urban decentralized sustainable sanitation program (PSSDU) has been executed by UNICEF as a
Project exclusively from Wash (from March 2018 to April 2021), and subsequently as a comprehensive program with
the incorporation of the components of protection and climate change (from April 2021 to December 2022); in
This second phase the program is implemented by UNICEF and its local partners: Fundación SEPA in the municipality of
Montero and Social Pastoral Cáritas and Universidad Nur in the municipality of Cobija.
The PSSDU has been implemented in the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood in the municipality of Montero, and, from the management
2022, in the friendship neighborhood of the municipality of Cobija, as a replica of the model. It is worth mentioning that the intervention of the
UNICEF WASH component in the municipality of Montero includes other neighborhoods (Cofadena and Nuevo Dawn, and
Also, in District 1: Santa Cecilia, Santa Ana, Buena Vista and Santa Rosita; In District 4: The Barrios 3 de Julio, 16 of
November and the antenna; In district 5: Jesus of Nazareth, Leny Rivero and German).
The objective and impact of the program focus on promoting decentralized sanitation models, strengthening the
same time the fulfillment of the rights of girls, boys and adolescents to sanitation, protection and medium
healthy environment. In addition to the promotion of a holistic model at the local level, scalability and replica of the
National model.
To do this, the program has implemented the following four strategies:
1. Strengthen the resilience of families, in aspects of health, protection and adaptation to climate change, improving, by
one side, sustainable access to comprehensive ecological decentralized sanitation services (which does not require use of
water), and, on the other hand, strengthening the abilities and skills of families to respond to situations of violence
and vulnerability.
2. Develop a protective and healthy environment for NNA, in a position to respond to the purposes of climate change, to
through the implementation of school promotion programs, menstrual hygiene management and
Adaptation to climate change, the provision of services and programs for prevention and comprehensive response to situations
of violence and/or vulnerability, and the strengthening of adaptation to climate change and
Self -management of community/ neighborhood organizations.
3. Strengthen capacities of municipal, departmental governments and other subnational instances for the
fulfillment of their functions in Aseh, protection and climate change, through the strengthening of
Planning and Management Capabilities - with Children's Protection Perspective, Climate Change and Risk Management -
of the GAM, GAD and service operators, of the strengthening of competencies of the protection and justice services
to prevent and respond to cases of violence against NNA and against women, and the design and implementation of a model
of closing of the nutrient cycle, which contributes to the circular economy model of the municipality.
4. influence national public policies and regulations seeking to promote the sustainability and scalability of the model, to
through the implementation and systematization of pilot projects that apply the sustainable sanitation model
Urban decentralized (MSSDU), of the generation of evidence that supports the replica and scalability of the model
(Preparation of laws of law and coordination of dialogue spaces), of the strengthening of technical capacities
for the management of ASEH services and the design and promotion of a public policy of protection and strengthening of
Families with integral approach.
Evaluation purpose
This evaluation is both summative and formative, in addition to prospective for the analysis of related potentialities
to the scalability and replica of the program. For the summative part, it has sought to achieve a better understanding of the
results derived from the decentralized sanitation model implemented by the program, its sustainability and its
Scalability In this sense, what is exposed in this document constitutes a tool for the surrender of
accounts to several interested parties and for decision -making based on how to ensure the
Sustainability, scaling and/or replication of the model or certain components. The evaluation identifies the results
At the program level, and, more generally, the contribution of the MSSDU to the achievement of the SDGs in the country (especially the SDG
6.2).

EVALUATION OBJECTIVE
Evaluate the progress of the PSSDU in the fulfillment of its objectives and results, as well as establish the needs of
adjustment and recommendations to optimize developed models and analyze potentials related to
Sustainability, replica and scalability. In addition, the way in which the program has integrated the issues was taken into account
Transversal of Human Rights, Gender, Equity, Interculturality and Response to Emergency by Pandemia
COVID-19.
Uses and users
Primary users: The UNICEF Country Office is considered in Bolivia, both programmatic and
the management of the office and monitoring and evaluation equipment; and to the Embassy of Sweden. The results of the evaluation
They are relevant to adjust and improve the implementation processes in the municipality of Cobija and in view of possible
future interventions.
Secondary users: This group of users identifies as the UNICEF counterparts within the implementation,
that is: the GAM de Montero and Cobija, the entities providing water and sanitation services (cosmol in
Montero and EPSA in Cobija), the Ombudsmen of Children and Adolescents (DNA) in Montero and Cobija, the Santa Cruz sedepos
for being a member of the implementation of the Child Development Center (CDI) in the Guadalupe II neighborhood, and the special force of
Fight against violence (Felcv). Within this group of secondary users, institutions are also considered
Program implementing partners, represented by the SEPA Foundation in Montero and the Social Pastoral Cáritas (PSC)
In Pando, as well as the universities Nur and Autonomous Gabriel René Moreno (UAGRM).
Nationally, it is important to share the results with the Ministry of Environment and Water (Mmaya) through
of the Vice Ministry of Drinking Water and Basic Sanitation (VAPSB), Water Control and Social Control Authority
Potable and Basic Sanitation (AAPS), National Service for the Sustainability of Basic Services (Senas), APMT
And the Potable Water and Sanitation Service Entities (EPSA) in different cities that can analyze
The experience of the implemented model.
In general, evaluation results can also be shared with international audiences such as
UNICEF Regional Office (Lacro), country offices and other regional offices, so that the stock of
Evidence generated on models implemented in decentralized urban sanitation programs.
Evaluation methodology
The evaluation criteria that were used to assess the implementation of the PSSDU are the following: (i) impact;
(ii) effectiveness; (iii) coherence; (iv) sustainability and scalability; (v) efficiency; (vi) relevance; and (VII) Gender and Equity.
Through the evaluation matrix (MDE), the methodology and sources of information were identified to respond to a
Total fourteen evaluation questions, and through the analysis plan matrix (MPA) the 37
Indicators of the Logical Framework Matrix (MML) of the program, structuring the indicators compliance matrix
(MCI).
A non -experimental methodological design was used, of formative and summative, oriented to the identification of
Lessons learned and recommendations focused on scalability and replicability of the program; The evaluation combines
mixed methods, which implied a work of lifting qualitative and quantitative information, with their respective
Methods of systematization and analysis, and finally the combination and triangulation of such information to obtain
of conclusions and recommendations. The MML has been used as a framework for results and expected objectives for
Evaluation of the effectiveness criteria, and the theory of change (TDC) as a specific evaluation framework for criteria
impact; For this, the TDC has been rebuilt in the planning phase, and subsequently, through the collection of
evidence, resorting to the sources and applying the techniques detailed in the evaluation matrix (review
documentary, semi -structured interviews with key informants and allocation population, field visit and survey to
allocation population), the expected changes in the short term have been achieved to what extent.
Conclusions
Important and favorable changes in the short term are observed, both at the individual/family level and at the level
neighborhood/community, attributable to the implementation of the program: the adoption of healthy hygiene habits, the
acceptance of the system and the waste collection service provided by the EPSA by the majority of users and the
favorable perception regarding a significant improvement in the quality of life of the recipients; level
7

neighborhood/neighborhood, it is observed that the program has managed to strengthen and reorient the organization of the neighborhood, generating
a share capital that favors the sustainability of the effects achieved with the implementation.
Changes attributable to the implementation of Family Development Plans (PDF) such as reduction are also observed
of girls under 10 years of age who remain alone at home, an improvement in perception with respect to the services of
protection and on the decrease in insecurity in the neighborhood; In this same sense, a better perception is observed
of the adolescent population regarding the family and school environment, and a better relationship with their parents, with their
teachers and with their peers. Likewise, the Guadalupe II neighborhood has protection equipment (such as a center of
Child development and a district advocate) and adaptation to climate change (such as drainage, family gardens and
schoolchildren, among others), as a result of the implementation, and attitudinal changes oriented to a better
Garbage management, water savings and environmental care.
Aspects in which the need to continue working has to do have to achieve a higher level of
satisfaction by the recipient families regarding the waste collection service provided by the EPSA, position
That a third of families are dissatisfied, as well as minimizing the proportion of families that do not use
adequate of the modules, which currently corresponds to a fifth of the benefited population; It is also
important to work more to reduce physical and verbal punishments as disciplinary measures against girls and boys to
Interior of families, since these practices show an increase in the recipient population during the last
year and a half.
Of a total of 37 indicators presented by the MML, 28 (76%) have been reached or exceeded and 9 (24%) have reached a
partial compliance, reaching a level of global effectiveness of 90% in terms of compliance with the established goals
in the logical framework; This level of effectiveness is considered very good, taking into account the difficult context - of
Health emergency by Pandemia of COVID-19, political and social conflict of the following 2019 and years and current scenario of
economic slowdown, and change of authorities and technical personnel at all levels of government - in which
implemented the program.
The implementation of the three components in a combined manner has allowed to make available, both of the families,
as of the community/neighborhood, the municipal government and the municipal technical instances, benefits packages and
Tools that allow, at the same time addressing several problems that families and institutions are going through.
At the operational level, it has facilitated the entry of executing teams to territory and addressing in unique instances, issues that
They involve aspects of health, hygiene, protection and environment at the same time.
Important elements of technical sustainability (waste collection service by the EPSA) and
Environmental sustainability (Bes technology and nutrient cycle closure); As for financial sustainability, it is
likely that the system continues to operate in the Guadalupe II neighborhood in the short term, but under conditions of
subsidiarity (greater than 90%), since by itself, the model is not sustainable, and expanding coverage could expand the
financial gap and make the system even less sustainable for the service provider, since there is no
evidence on economies of scales in the system or on the availability to pay greater rates for the service of
sanitation by the population.
The integral model is potentially scalable and replicable, however, specific aspects that
allow building a viable public policy at the national level: (i) in the first instance, it is observed that there is no
Natural demand by the population to settle modules with Bes technology on their own, (ii) also,
The financial sustainability model requires a disproportionate operational subsidy by the entity
service provider and, compared to other traditional sanitation alternative solutions, Bes technology
It is little competitive1.
A third aspect to consider is that (iii) Bes technology alone and as an autonomous sanitation program
Decentralized is not scalable at the public policy level (it is difficult to think about a national sanitation program
decentralized based exclusively on Bes technology), in this regard it is important to look for the combination and
Bes technology complementation with other technologies, in order to raise a public policy that responds to
the real needs of territories, populations and subnational governments.
1 A kiss system that works with Bs. 13 per month per family, but with a subsidy of 90%, has a real operational cost of Bs. 130
monthly, that is Bs. 1,560 per year per family, in front of ETRL technologies that represent an operational cost between Bs. 300 and Bs. 1,200 to
year per family (without considering investment).

Lessons learned
The most relevant learning identified within the framework of the evaluation is presented below:
• The incorporation of the waste collection service by the EPSA is the main added value that it proposes
The model and provides technical sustainability to the system.
• The accompaniment provided by the EPSA team to the recipient families (together with the service of
collection of waste) represents an important added value of the model, since, beyond the service
purely health and technical, a greater closeness of the EPSA has been developed with the population, which allows
address aspects of social nature.
• The multisectoral and multilevel articulation capacity that UNICEF has, with three sectors participation
different in the same territory and with articulations from territorial to national, it has allowed the
Implementation Achieve a very comprehensive dimension with potential to climb to national public policy.
• The political incidence generated from the program at different levels of government has been effective, must
rescue the strategies adopted, such as Wash Bat meetings, which have been important instances to
the positioning of the model and its strategic lines at different levels of government.
• The program and its technical teams have had the ability to adapt to the context of Covid-19 pandemic and
health emergency, generating an important experience of transformation of a negative situation in
An opportunity to generate greater coverage and scope with the intervention.
• The formation of a coordination network from the implementation of the program has provided a
very solid institutional and organizational basis for the implementation and for the sustainability of results and
effects achieved.
• The appropriation of program strategies and actions by the neighborhood organization has been
fundamental for the success of the implementation.
• The psychological assistance office that was implemented in the neighborhood as part of the component of
protection is a practice that has been very well valued by youth leaders, has allowed to make visible the
Importance of mental and emotional health especially in the adolescence stage.
• The involvement of neighborhood organizations and leaders in planning the strategies and actions of
Response to the effects of climate change, has provided an important level of relevance and adaptation to
CC component, optimizing the allocated resources, provided tangible and high impact solutions at the level
neighborhood and community.
Main recommendations
1. It is advisable to strengthen the implementation M&E system (particularly the mechanisms of
monitoring and reporting of the logical framework); In this framework, an evaluation is recommended
of PSSDU impact on the Guadalupe II neighborhoods of Montero and Cobija's friendship, as well as developing studies
About: (i) the impact of the Public Health program; and (ii) the environmental impact of the program.
2. Provide technical assistance to Cosmol to review and adjust the model and projections of financial equilibrium
System operation, specifically linked to the Bes waste collection service; In this same line,
It is advisable to provide technical assistance to EPSA to evaluate and reorient your sustainability plans.
3. Developing a study on the feasibility of implementing the sanitation system in a modular way is
say with more basic mosaafa variations whose implementation requires a lower investment of resources;
Within this framework, it is recommended to conduct costing studies for the implementation of the model with orientation to
the GAM, considering at least three types of GAM (small, medium and large) calculating the volume of
resources that would demand each case.
4. It is recommended to carry out a study on the availability to be paid (DAP) for the collection service rate of
solid waste, in order to technically establish the demand for the service; In this same line, it is
recommended to strengthen the communication component of the program, in order to inform and sensitize
to the population regarding the importance of supporting the service through the payment of a rate by all
Users.

5. It is advisable to make periodic diagnoses on the use of mosaf
population served, and reinforce communicational aspects oriented to social changes and
behavior.
6. It is recommended to continue working to diagnose the problem of citizen insecurity in the neighborhood
deepening its nature, with the aim of designing an action plan to face and reduce it.
7. It is recommended to continue working the development of skills and change of adultocentrist behaviors,
by positive parenting guidelines, in order to reduce the prevalence of physical punishments as corrective measures
In nna.
8. It is advisable to continue investigating the processes for obtaining a perfectly fertilizer
innocuous, as well as design a business plan for commercialization.
9. It is recommended to strengthen the socialization processes of the model to municipal levels, departmental and
National
10. With a view to the scalability of the Public Policy model, it is advisable to continue generating links and synergies
with strategic guidelines at the central government level and subnational governments, as well as with others
institutions and organizations that work basic sanitation issues in territory.
11. Establish a priori parameters between direct and indirect expenses could improve programs efficiency
financed through UNICEF, focusing on the highest proportion of resources effectively reaches
DECINIARY POPULATIONS.
12. It is advisable to incorporate in the design of the mosafa and in the intervention strategies of the model,
elements of inclusion of people with disabilities, mainly physical, although it is also desirable to include
People with sensory, mental, psychosocial disabilities, among others.

to the scalability and replica of the program. For the summative part, it has sought to achieve a better understanding of the
results derived from the decentralized sanitation model implemented by the program, its sustainability and its
Scalability In this sense, what is exposed in this document constitutes a tool for the surrender of
accounts to several interested parties and for decision -making based on how to ensure the
Sustainability, scaling and/or replication of the model or certain components. The evaluation identifies the results
At the program level, and, more generally, the contribution of the urban decentralized sustainable sanitation model
(MSSDU) to the achievement of the SDGs in the country, especially the SDGs 6, 10 and 13.
For the formative and prospective part, learned lessons and central work areas for design have been identified
and future implementation of the MSSDU, particularly to improve relevance, coherence, efficacy, sustainability and
Holistic approach

2.4 EVALUATION OBJECTIVES
The general objective of the consulting has been to evaluate the progress of the decentralized sustainable sanitation program
Urban (PSSDU) in compliance with its objectives and results, as well as establishing adjustment and
Recommendations to optimize developed models and analyze potentials related to sustainability,
Replica and scalability. In addition, the way in which the program has integrated the transverse issues was taken into account
of human rights, gender, equity, interculturality and response to the emergency by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The specific objectives of the evaluation have been:
• Evaluate the relevance, effectiveness, coherence and sustainability of the PSSDU and its strategies in each of the
components (at the local and national level), in addition to the scalability in the localities of Montero and Cobija, and the
Development of public policies at local and national level.
• Evaluate the effectiveness of the intersectoral approach of the urban sanitation program with the components of
Protection and climate change, analyzing compliance with the objectives and their relationship with this approach.
• Rebuild the PSSDU change theory at two key moments of evaluation: (i) in the planning phase
initial as input for the definition of methodological design and evaluation guide; and (ii) in the evaluation phase
from the information collected that identifies the causal relationships between the components of the
program, the assumptions used and the logic of intervention to obtain results.

2.5 Evaluation scope
THEMATIC SCOPE: The evaluation covers the three components of the program: (i) Wash; (ii) protection; and (iii) change
Climatic; and the different action strategies executed at the family, community, municipality, departmental government
and national government. In terms of results, the evaluation focused on assessing the results presented in the framework
Logical and in the theory of change (TDC) of the program. In addition, the unforeseen results were examined. At the impact level,
The contribution of the program to the changes observed in the beneficiary families was evaluated qualitatively.
Temporary scope: The evaluation has covered the period since the beginning of the program in 2018 until the time
Start the evaluation in the field work phase (November 2022).
Geographic scope: PSSDU has activities both locally and nationally, but with local/municipal emphasis
covering the municipalities of Montero and Cobija3. At the supramunicipal level, the evaluation covered work with entities
departmental and national to strengthen capacities and influence national public policies and regulations.
3 context and object of the evaluation
3.1 Context
3.1.1 political-institutional and normative context
With regard to the Wash component, the sector head nationwide is the Ministry of Environment and Water
(Mmaya), through the Vice Ministry of Potable Water and Basic Sanitation (VAPSB) that has the powers of
Promote and execute public policy (regulations, programs and projects), in favor of the expansion of coverage and/or
Improvement of drinking water and sanitation services, as well as contributing to its formulation and managing your
financing; Promote technical standards, regulatory and instructions for good use and
regulation of drinking water and basic sanitation services, coordinate with competent subnational entities the
Design and implementation of local public policy in the sector, among several others. (Mmaya, 2023)
The National Service for the Sustainability of Basic Sanitation Services (Senasba) is a public entity
decentralized, with autonomy of administrative, financial, legal and technical management, under tuition of Mmaya, which
implements capacities development processes through technical assistance and institutional strengthening to
Basic sanitation service operators throughout the country; So, there is the inspection authority and
3 The evaluation was specifically carried out in the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood defined from the TDR and start report as scope

Social control of drinking water and sanitation (AAPS), responsible for regulating and controlling the provision of the services of
drinking water and basic sanitation and the management and sustainable use of water resources, seeking
guarantee the right of access users to these services.
The Environment and Water Executing Entity (EMAGUA) dependent on the MMAYA, the Productive Investment Fund and
Social (FPS) and the Coordinating Units of Programs and Projects of the ETAs execute investments in drinking water and
sanitation, depending on their competences.
The right to water and sanitation is recognized in Bolivia since its constituent norms and of greater hierarchy, it is
So it is recognized as a human right in the Political Constitution of the State (CPE), the Magna Carta together with the law
Autonomies framework establish the powers and powers of the different levels of government in regard
to the formulation and execution of public policy oriented to the provision of basic services, and the mother's frame law
Earth establishes the bases and guidance of "living well", and in this context it promotes sustainable consumption habits
for integral development, which implies the rational and efficient use of water; Supreme Decree 29894 of February 2009,
relative to the reorganization of the Executive Power, establishes that it is up to the Mmaya to formulate, execute, evaluate and control
Potable water and basic sanitation policies and plans.
At the operational level, there is the Law on Potable Water and Sanitary Sewerage (Law 2066), which establishes
the competencies of the VAPSB and the ETA regarding the provision of basic services, always online of the provisions
in the Environment Law No. 1333; The National Regulation for the Provision of Water Services is also counted
Drinking and Sewerage for Urban Centers and with the National Regulations of HOME SANITARY FACILITIES,
as the most relevant regulations within the framework of this description of the evaluation context.
On the other hand, it is counted, at the country level, with a developed sectoral public policy, the patriotic agenda, which raises,
In the second of his thirteen pillars, the universalization of basic services as a goal to the year 2025. and the program of
Government 2015 - 2020, within the framework of this pillar, had raised the “Universal Access to Water and Sanitation” dimension
with three axes that sought the universalization of the provision of basic services; the economic development plan and
Social (PDES) 2021 - 2025, in its goal 1.3, result 1.3.3, it has been proposed to reach 89.4% of the population with access to
improved sanitation in urban areas and 52.2% in rural areas. (MPD, 2021)
Among the main public policy instruments with which they are available at the sector level, they are mentioned: politics
Public for efficient use of drinking water and adaptation to climate change, and policy for the implementation of the
Human right to water and sanitation in Bolivia, both establish institutional guidelines and responsibilities
to optimize the rational use of drinking water and to seek to guarantee the human right of access to water and
basic sanitation.
It is also worth mentioning the basic sanitation development plan (PSD-SB), the water program,
Sanitation, solid waste and storm drainage (Proasred), the investment mechanism for coverage in the sector
of APYS (MICSA) and the most investment for water (my water) program. These policies seek to improve coverage and
Quality of drinking water and sanitation services, promoting integrated basin management, strengthening capacity
institutional and community, and mobilize financial resources for infrastructure investment.
Bolivian regulations establish that basic sanitation programs and projects are of concurrent competition
between the central level and the departmental and municipal levels; At the departmental level, the governorates have
different instances to execute programs and projects for the provision of basic services; The autonomous government
Pando departmental (GAD) has the departmental service of rural water and electrification (Sedae), while
That GAD Santa Cruz has an Environment Unit, and has recently formed the Technical Commission
Metropolitan of Sanitation, with the aim of generating coordination spaces and synergies between the different actors
of the sector belonging to the municipalities that make up the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz.
As an important context fact, which allows you to dimension the priorities and efforts of the GAD that interest
To this evaluation, it is worth mentioning that the GAD Pando has budgeted Bs. 2.1 million for development of
basic sanitation in management 2023, equivalent to 0.72% of its annual budget, and GAD Santa Cruz has
Budget Bs. 7.8 million equivalent to 0.36% of its annual budget, for the same management. (SIGEP, 2023)
Regarding the protection component, in Bolivia the Plurinational Comprehensive Protection System is in force
of the girl, boy and adolescent (sipproina) composed at the central level by the Vice Ministry of Equal Opportunities
(as a governing body), the Public Court of Children and Adolescents, the Special Force to Fight Violence (FELCV)

and the Ombudsman; At the departmental level it consists of the technical instances executing social policy
which are the ITDPS (Technical Social Policy Instances) such as Sedeos (Departmental Service of Social Policies) in
Santa Cruz, and at the municipal level, is made up of the defenders of Children and Adolescents (DNA) with a presence in 276
of the 376 municipalities of the national territory, which are responsible for the psychosociojuridic defense of rights
of childhood and adolescence. (Siteal, 2021)
In the normative field: the Political Constitution of the State establishes that every girl, child and adolescent has as
inalienable human right to have a family, if your family of origin could not comply with the role of comprehensive protection,
The State as a guarantor of rights, must promote a safe, legal and timely meeting between a girl, boy or
teenagers I expect and an ideal family that looks for them; In its articles 60 and 61 it establishes “higher interest” and the
Prohibition of all kinds of violence against girls, boys and adolescents.
The main norm in terms of NNA protection in Bolivia, is the code of the child and adolescent or law 548, which
Its purpose is to recognize, develop and regulate the exercise of children's rights, through co -responsibility
of the State, the family and society, thus, establishes sipproin as “the articulated set of organs,
instances, institutions, organizations, entities and services that work at all levels of the State (central,
departmental and municipal) through intersectoral actions of public interest developed by public sector entities
and private, guaranteeing that girls, boys and adolescents fully exercise their rights ”(Siteal, 2021)
With regard to the protection of women, at the national level there is Law 348, to guarantee women a
life free of violence among several other norms; Municipal governments have comprehensive legal services
Municipal (Slim), but also, the inter -institutional critical protocol and route for the attention and protection of victims in
The framework of said law establishes all instances that must provide primary care and protection in a first
phase, assistance and processing of the complaint in a second phase and comprehensive reparation services of the damage in a
Third phase to victims of violence, and these are both specific protection instances and the Slim, DNA,
Sedeges, Felcv and Public Ministry, as intersectoral instances, for example, health services, services
educational, community authorities, civil society organizations, that is, from this protocol and critical route
Comprehensive attention is sought to victims of violence.
In addition to these important documents, there are other specific laws that protect NNA and women in Bolivia,
For example, Law 054 of November 2010 on Legal Protection of NNA, Law 263 against trafficking and traffic of persons,
Law 2033 of protection of victims of crimes against sexual freedom, Law 264 of the National Security System
Citizen, Law 243 Against Harassment and Political Violence in Reason for Gender, Law 1768 Criminal Code, Law 260 of the Ministry
Public, among others.
As for public policy, Bolivia has the multinational plan of the girl, boy and adolescent approved in 2017, which
establishes strategic objectives, guidelines and coordination mechanisms between the agencies responsible for the
Public policy aimed at guaranteeing NNA rights; Also, the “Early Child Development Program
Grow well to live well ”of the Ministry of Health, came into operation between 2013 and 2019, seeking to contribute to
improve sustainably and with cultural relevance, cognitive, socio -emotional and physical development of children
under 4 years, through the creation of early stimulation rooms, children's centers, and mobile brigades,
where the Ministry of Health and the municipalities worked together for operability. (Johansen, Martínez,
Vidal, & Yarygina, 2019), therefore, the PSSDU protection component has also been aligned with politics
in force, both with the NNA Plurianual Plan and with the DIT program “Grow well to live well”, with the
Installation of the Luceérnaga CDI as an important contribution in the municipality of Montero.
With regard to the environment sector, Mmaya is also taken as the sector's head, and the authority
Plurinational Mother Earth (APMT) as an autarkic entity, under the tuition of Mmaya, in charge of operating the
Joint mechanisms of mitigation and adaptation for the integral and sustainable management of forests and mother earth,
Mitigation mechanism to live well, mechanism of adaptation to live well and the mother's plurinational background
Land.
As for public policy, the 2025 patriotic agenda approach in relation to climate change is based on the
Respect for the rights of Mother Earth in the framework of the construction of environmental sovereignty with development
comprehensive; The National Plan for Economic and Social Development (PDES) 2021 - 2025 emerges from the Patriotic Agenda 2025
and describes the actions and results to achieve the goals defined in that agenda. Likewise, the PDES is done under
the vision of the construction and strengthening of the life systems defined in Law 300 Frame of Mother Earth, of
17

This mode, the PDES constitutes the specific orientation for the formulation of intersectoral actions in relation to the
mitigation and adaptation to climate change. (Ontiveros Mollinedo, 2020)
Likewise, the Plurinational Climate Change Policy (approved by RM No. 60 of the MMAYA of May 15, 2016)
defines the guidelines of joint actions at the national and subnational levels, for adaptation, resilience and mitigation
For the purposes of climate change throughout the national territory within the framework of integral development to live well, under the
following foundations: (i) Integral development in harmony with mother earth and sustainable patterns of production and
consumption; (ii) Comprehensive management of life zones and life systems; (iii) vulnerability and resilience management management;
and (iv) sustained and progressive reduction of emissions. (Mmaya - APMT, 2016)
The State Political Constitution, from its article 373 to 377, defines water as a right
"Very fundamental" for life, and points out that the State must protect the country's water resources and its ecosystems, and
In this sense, you must promote public policies for the proper use and preservation of these resources, and in your article
342 points out that it is also a duty of the population conserving and protecting natural resources and biodiversity.
The most important laws regarding climate change issues in Bolivia are Law 071 of the rights of the
Mother Earth, of December 21, 2010; Law 300, Mother Earth frame and integral development to live well, from 15
October 2012 and its respective regulation of August 14, 2013, approved by DS 1696 and the Regulation
for registration and assignment of initiatives, projects and programs in climate change before the plurinational authority of the
Mother Earth.
Finally, it is worth mentioning the NDC (nationally determined contribution to the reduction of gase emissions of
greenhouse effect). Bolivia presented its first NDC in 2015, and updated it in April 2021; In its updated NDC, Bolivia
it undertakes to reduce its emissions by 10% by 2030 compared to the base scenario, and to reach the neutrality of
Carbon by 2050. In addition, Bolivia raises a series of adaptation to climate change in sectors such as the
Agriculture, health, water, biodiversity and forests. In this essential programmatic document, the component
influenced with a childhood approach.
3.1.2 Municipal Context: Montero and Cobija
The city of Montero is characterized by its important agroindustrial and commercial activity, it was consolidated as a region
Rice and sugar cane producer has a large number of rice mills and sugar mill Guabirá, which
use a large number of people; It is one of the cities with the highest demographic growth, not only at the level
Departmental but at the national level, the INE has projected a growth of 21.9% of its population in ten years (from the
2012 to 2022), which implies that it currently exceeds 147 thousand inhabitants (INE, 2020); This growth is a
consequence, mainly, migratory flows that settle in a disorderly way, more frequently, in
The north and east areas of the city (Patzi, 2021).
This little planned growth causes different difficulties, especially related to the coverage of
Basic services, for this case, specifically basic sanitation4; 2012 census data indicate that, to
Then, the population with a lack of sanitary sewerage in the city of Montero reached 46.9% (Info Spie, 2016);
subsequent data that the Municipal Autonomous Government (GAM) of Montero indicate that, far from shortened this
coverage gap, by 2020 the sanitary sewer network reached only 34.7% of the population, the
which implies that the lack of sanitation by Red reached 65.3% of the population that year. (AAPS, 2020)
4 The sanitation definition includes both human behaviors, as health facilities, both favor having an environment
hygienically habitable and disease -free; In this way, sanitation includes the disposition or hygienic management of the excreta
human and animals, as well as garbage, wastewater, and also includes drinking water supply systems
Safe for human consumption (Dinesbvi-Sei Esr, 2012). Sanitation, therefore, is a system that includes: (i) collection, transport,
treatment and management of human excreta; (ii) the treatment and reuse of gray waters; (iii) the separation of solid waste; (iv) the
industrial wastewater management; (v) the use and runoff of rainwater; and (vi) the participation of the users of the
system. In addition, it is considered a safe and efficient sanitation system, when it meets the following criteria: (i) it protects and promotes the
human health; (ii) does not contribute to environmental degradation or exhaustion of resources; (iii) is technical and institutionally appropriate to
context; and (IV) is economically viable and socially accepted (Dinesbvi-Sei Esr, 2012)

Specifically in the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood of the municipality of Montero5, where the PSSDU was implemented as a
Demonstrative project, the population presents even more severe conditions of vulnerability and multidimensional poverty:
“The inhabitants of the Guadalupe II neighborhood are a vulnerable population with high levels of exclusion and stigmatization for their
Cultural ethnic condition, being poor migrants of Quechuas regions of the West of Bolivia. The neighborhood has
Approximately 870 families with 4,000 migrant inhabitants of Quechua regions; A third of the population are children,
girls and adolescents ”(SEPA Foundation, 2021).
The sugarcane harvest is an important economic activity for families in the municipality of Montero and, by
Ende, from the Guadalupe II neighborhood. As mentioned, the sugar mill Guabirá is the closest and most important for
The families of this municipality. This activity is done approximately for 175 days a year, usually starting
May or June, during this period there is an important migratory movement, of a seasonal nature, from the
Municipality of Montero to the nearest sugar mills.
This neighborhood is created from the illegal occupation of land belonging to the Armed Forces in January 2011, to
From then on it has been the same population and the neighborhood that they have been building and urbanizing the area, they have
achieved, from processes of political incidence, the installation of electricity and drinking water, schools, centers
cultural and a third level hospital near the area.
The neighborhood organization inside Guadalupe II Cofadena is quite strong, due, to a large extent, that through
The years, have been the families who have taken in their hands the defense of their neighborhood and of the occupied land that,
Often, they were threatened to be retaken by the military, in 2018 there was an attempt to evolve to which the
Population resisted, after which a negotiation between the leadership of the neighborhood and the armed forces to
establish the limits of the neighborhood; The organizational structure of the neighborhood is not conventional such as other OTB, in this
Barrio are representatives by Manzano, who in turn respond to a main leadership, in this way
Permanent monitoring of the entire territory is maintained.
There is not much information about the protection sector in the municipality of Montero, in 2021 the GAMM promulgated
His municipal childhood and adolescence law 2021 - 2025, whose elaboration had the technical assistance of UNICEF and
SEPA Foundation, this plan covers four programs: (i) Comprehensive Survival and Infection Development Program,
childhood and adolescence; (ii) Child development program strengthening responsible paternity and prevention of
families at risk; (iii) Protection, prevention and restitution program of threatened or violated rights; and (IV)
Participation, leadership, recreation and prevention of risk situations, prioritizing knowledge
and recognition of girls, boys and adolescents as subjects of law; For its implementation, a
Quinquenal Budget of 320 million Bs. (El duty, 2021)
On the other hand, the "life without violence" platform developed by Solidar Switzerland is the source from which
You can obtain more updated information regarding the Slim; The year 2021 Slim Montero registered 21 cases of
Violence against women and 1 feminicide (community life without violence, 2021).
Cobija is one of the most important emerging cities in Bolivia, as it is the capital of the department of
Pando, has the highest intercensal growth index of all the capital cities of the country; Between 2001 and 2012 his
Population grew 107.3%, from 22,324 inhabitants, it went to 46,267 inhabitants in 11 years; It is currently calculated that around
of 90 thousand people live in this city (INE, 2021). Its demographic growth is not proportional to the resolution of its
needs, for example, it is estimated that a quarter of its urban population does not yet have drinking water service
(Spie, 2016).
The demographic growth, the spatial occupation of the city and the expansion of its territorial margin, has made the
Sanitation coverage in this city is very low; Until 2012 the sanitary sewer system barely reached
to 26.2% of the urban population (SPIE, 2016), being that only the part of the Casco Viejo de la Ciudad benefited from this
service, while the neighborhoods around the Casco Viejo remained without service, and even more the peripheral neighborhoods
and periurban.
5 As mentioned in terms of the scope of this evaluation, it has been specifically carried out in the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood
defined from the TDR and start report as the geographical scope of the program and evaluation, however, the intervention of the
UNICEF WASH component in the municipality of Montero includes other neighborhoods: Cofadena and Nuevo Dawn, and also, in District 1:
Santa Cecilia, Santa Ana, Buena Vista and Santa Rosita; in District 4: The neighborhoods July 3, November 16 and the Antena; In district 5: Jesus of
Nazareth, Leny Rivero and German.

Climate events are another factor that has limited the development of efficient sanitation systems and has hindered
Generate better service coverage, since floods disable sanitary sewerage systems
and other types of sanitation: the year 2015, product of the overflow of the acre river, there was a flood of magnitude that
It affected several neighborhoods of the city, this year 2023 floods were also recorded during the month of March.
From the 2020 management to date, work is being done on the expansion of drinking water and sewerage networks
Sanitary In this city with resources from the central government, 2021 has delivered an extension of the network of
Sanitary sewer of the municipality, including the construction of a treatment plant.
According to the information provided by AAPS, the shelter EPSA crosses many difficulties in reaching levels
efficient provision of drinking water and sanitation services, in addition to being one of the EPSA with the highest index of
debt at the national level (within the framework of regulated EPSA), which is why there is no reliable data or
updated regarding sanitation coverage levels (performance reports published annually
AAPS do not have these data for Cobija) and, according to informants interviewed within the framework of this evaluation, the EPSA
Cobija does not have an updated cadastre, therefore it is not possible to determine at this time the proportion of
Population to which the sanitation service by sanitary sewerage.
There is no information online, complete or updated, regarding the protection sector in the municipality of Cobija,
In the "lifeless life" platform it has been verified that the year 2021 the Slim Cobija registered 57
Cases of violence against women and 2 femicides. (Life community without violence, 2021)
3.1.3 Context of the Covid-19 pandemic and political-social-economic crisis
In October 2019, a political and social crisis broke out in Bolivia due to failed national elections, starting a
period of political, social and institutional instability that lasts for one year, to the presidential elections of
October 2020; Some months later, in March 2021, subnational elections are given, which generates changes
substantial in municipal and departmental administrative structures, therefore, this period has been
marked by a high rotation of authorities and officials in the public sector at all levels and conflicts
politicians and social that have caused damages in the execution of all types of policies, programs, projects and
shares in general in the country.
The generalized conflict of October and November 2019 also reached the municipalities of Cobija and Montero,
especially to the latter where, on the night of October 30, the first 2 of the 35 deaths left
This national conflict, and on November 13, one more death was recorded in the midst of violent clashes
(Opinion, 2019); Particularly the Guadalupe II neighborhood became a resistance center in favor of the Government
outgoing at that time, in front of opposition groups; Subsequently, in October and November 2022, Montero
He participated in the 36 -day civic unemployment convened by the Santa Cruz Interinstitutional Committee, demanding the advancement of the
National Population and Housing Census.
To this scenario it must be added that, in the first quarter of 2020, because of the global Covid-19 pandemic
Start of mobility and quarantine restrictions, first and then dynamic rigid, implemented by the Government
National for a period of twelve months; Already in the first quarter of the year 2021 the activities were restored and an arduous
Road of recovery of social and economic stability. Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact
negative in economic and social. Economic, many companies closed and jobs were lost. Was
Government efforts and measures to extend the payment of credits, this was insufficient to avoid this loss.
Informal workers of the Bolivian economy were severely affected.
In the municipality of Montero La Quarantana began in April 2020. Because of its proximity to the capital of department and to form
Part of the largest metropolitan area in the country, was a municipality very affected by the pandemic; In July 2020, when
In the department of Santa Cruz there was more than a thousand infected daily, Montero always appeared
in second place with about 28% of the total departmental cases (La Razón, 2020). In April 2021, with more than
4,800 infected and 250 deaths, Pando for the first time the national report in terms of number of deaths,
Most of these in their capital Cobija (South Correo, 2021). In this city the main problem was the slowness with the
that advanced in the immunization of the population through the administration of the vaccine. (Page Seven, 2021)
While the growth of the Bolivian economy had been reducing since years ago (since 2015
approximately), due to the downward trend in international hydrocarbons and resources production and prices

public as for financial transfers to subnational governments, resources from activity
Hydrocarbon. This resource cut has still affected (and still affects the majority of subnational governments,
municipal and departmental, which lack significant income and, therefore, have a high dependency
of transfers of the central level, to manage and execute all kinds of projects.
In the cases of Gam Montero and Gam Cobija, the amount of resources from TGN was considerably reduced,
Because of the economic deceleration product of the Covid-19 pandemic. The year 2020 the GAM budget
Montero was reduced by 12.3% compared to the previous management, and 2021 reduced 30.4% compared to 2020; In the gam shelters the
Reduction of municipal resources was less deep, but there was still a 7.7% drop in 2020 compared to
2019, and in management 2022 there was a 17.1% reduction compared to 2021 (SIGEP, 2019 - 2023). This situation limits the
possibility by the GAM to make municipal investment.
Socially, the effect was even more negative; The women and children were the most affected, due to the increase
of domestic violence in the confinement period, it was added that the protection services were maintained
closed or functioning very limited during the emergency, so the victims had no mechanisms
To set complaints or to receive attention: “In a month of almost total quarantine in Bolivia, there were 867 cases of violence
Family and four women have died victims of sexist violence, with a total of 34 femicides so far this year,
According to information from the State Attorney General ... although apparently the figures would be minor in the quarantine,
Novillo [director of the Women's Coordinator] alerted a possible "sub -registration" of cases "that are not being able to
Report given the conditions of confinement "in the country." (Bolivia.com, 2020)
In the middle of the pandemic several rights of NNA, such as the right to education, to recreation and to live a free life
Of violence, they were lour: “Children and adolescents are undoubtedly a group strongly affected by the loss
of their usual rhythm of life that is altered by quarantine: they do not attend classes, they cannot go to parks and places of
recreation, they do not play sports, and visiting their family and friends is not only difficult but foolish… ”(Ramírez R.,
2020)
Public and private educational centers suspended classes for months; the instances of public administration and
Justice remained closed and the potential complaints, abuses and violations of
human rights and lives of people. The educational establishments, mostly, achieved after
months, restore education via virtual systems; But rural areas were marginalized from this possibility,
to the relative and partial improvement of the geographical coverage of the rural areas. The recurrence of the waves of covid-
19 Since 2020, he has affected the regular performance of the educational system; There have been improvements and advances in the
Virtual teaching, but insufficient.
The public and private health system was strongly affected, trying to face a health crisis of dimensions
Not seen before, lacking resources to respond to the emergency; Even in cities with third
Level, it was delayed to enable the care services required by the pandemic. The different cooperation agencies
and friends governments supported the provision and/or initial acquisition of medical supplies, equipment and other requirements for
face pandemic.
Part of the indicated characterization, socially and, particularly, in educational, it has been part of the context in which
The PSSDU has been executed; At present (June 2023), the end of the Covid-19 Pandemic has officially declared
However, the effects at the psychological level and, especially, at the economic level they remain latent.
3.2 Object of the evaluation
Next, the object of the evaluation is described in detail, that is, the sustainable sanitation program
Urban decentralized (PSSDU).
3.2.1 Expected objectives and results

General objective of the program:
Promote decentralized sanitation models, at the same time strengthening compliance with the rights of
Children to sanitation, protection and the healthy environment. In addition to promoting a holistic model to
Local level seeks scalability and replication of the model nationwide.
Specific objectives:
The program has focused on the implementation of actions through the following specific objectives:
1. Strengthen families resilience to improve health, protection and adaptation to climate change.
2. Develop a protective and healthy environment for NNA and conditions to face change impacts
climatic.
3. Strengthen capacities of municipal, departmental and other subnational instances for
fulfilling its functions regarding Wash, protection and climate change.
4. influence public policies and national regulations through the implementation of pilot projects for
Promote the sustainability and scalability of the model.
3.2.2 Cost/Budget
The programmed budget for the implementation of the urban decentralized sustainable sanitation program
(PSSDU) 2018 - 2022 is shown in the following table:
Table 1. Summary of the programmed budget. UNICEF Bolivia. 2018 - 2022
Budget program components in USD Budget
Wash 36.4 million sek 3.4 million USD
3.5 million SEK 0.3 million USD
Climate change 2.2 million SEK 0.2 million USD
Total 42.1 million SEK 3.9 million USD
Source: TDR
UNICEF received a contribution of 15 million SEK from the Sweden Embassy in Bolivia in 2018 for the implementation
of the first phase of the program ("project" at that time). In September 2018, I adend 1 for a total
of 22.5 million SEK (an increase of 50.0% to the original amount), in which the transfer of shares was incorporated
from sumaj Huasi to Epsas in the high and the increase of actions in Montero. In March 2020 the addendum 2 for a total was signed
of 39 million SEK (an additional 73.3% respect for the amount of addendum 1), in which the shares of
Climate change and childhood protection. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the severity of fires in
The Chiquitanía signed the addendum 3 for a total of 42.1 million SEK (a 7.9% increase compared to the amount of the
Previous addendum) including mitigation actions for both emergencies.
The amount of the original contribution has increased 180.7%, since the 15 million SEK committed in 2018
up to 42.1 million committed on 2020; 86.5% of the budget has been allocated to Wash the first component
of the program, the protection component has been assigned 8.3% of the resources and the climate change component
5.2% of the total budget.
3.2.3 The model and its intervention strategies
The socio -ecological model shows the integration of the different sectors: water, sanitation and hygiene, protection of
Childhood and climate change, in the different areas: the family, the neighborhood, the municipality (municipal government), the
department (departmental government) and national level; The common factor to Wash and Protection interventions
They are the families that have received the family sanitation modules (mosaafa), the protection actions are also
They have implemented at the neighborhood, community, municipal level, reaching a proposal of national law; the actions of
Climate change (CC) have been implemented at the level of apple trees, neighborhood and educational units, and promotional

Hygiene (pH) and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) at the level of educational units and also with recipients
of mosafa.
Program components
However, the program did not start with the three components, at the beginning it was a sanitation project
decentralized (Wash), which, over time, and the identification of different needs, was modified and
complementing on the march.
1. Wash: For the first component, UNICEF contributes to the implementation of the model, that is, the MSSDU. He
Mosafa is the central element of the model, it is a sanitation solution designed for peri -urban areas
where there is no sanitary sewer and where this afternoon to arrive; The modules can be built in
The patio or inside the house, they have a dry bath (the toilets do not require water), they also have
With a shower, a laundry and an ecological garden (shower and laundry they do require water connection for
Its operation and the ecological or bio-garden garden take advantage of the gray waters of the module).
However, the innovative solution of the model is not the mosafa itself, but to integrate the entity
Water and sanitation services provider (EPSA) to collect the feces in exchange for the payment of
A rate, in this way users have the same service as users of another type of solution of
conventional sanitation. In this model, community development work (DESCOM), in
which refers to the generation of an effective demand by families, training, guidance and
monitoring for the use of bathrooms, both before and after construction, since there are some
Dry bath particularities that are different from the use of conventional toilet.
There are six pillars that guarantee the development, implementation and replica of the sustainable sanitation model
Decentralized: The first four are the management fields: institutional, technical, social and control
environmental; The fifth Pilar is institutional and capacities strengthening in national administrations
and subnationals; And the sixth pillar is the investigation and implementation of infrastructure focused on the reef of the
treated material. These pillars are promoted from the technical assistance team of the Wash component.
To guarantee a successful and sustainable implementation of the MSSDU, certain preconditions must be fulfilled6: (i)
The participation, co -responsibility and coordination of state actors, urban community and
Potable Water and Sanitation Services, at the central, departmental, municipal and community level,
The involvement of NGOs, foundations and/or international cooperation is also desirable, each of these
actors with well -defined competitions; (ii) You must choose areas where, either due to distance or
Population density, or topographic characteristics, the late sanitary sewer coverage to arrive
(at least one five -year period); (iii) there must be drinking water coverage and there must be an EPSA; (iv) must exist
political and social governance at the local level and a fluid relationship between the GAM and the operator; (v) There must be interest
and commitment (better if it is formally and in writing) by the Executive and Legislative of the
Gam, the operator and the neighborhood leadership; and (vi) there must be a high effective demand, a high commitment
and active participation by the recipients.
In the same sense, to guarantee the implementation and sustainability of the model, there must be a
adequate interrelation between its technological, social and financial components, which can be observed
schematically in Annex 3.
The central element of the model's technological component, as already mentioned, is mosafa,
Composed of dry ecological bath (BES), a shower, a laundry and bio-jardin, there are technical criteria
defined in terms of location, orientation, leveling, rethinking and construction characteristics for the
construction and installation of mosafa7; Another important element of this component is the plant of
Treatment of dry feats, urine and fertilizer processor, fundamental for the closure of cycle of

nutrients, also has defined technical aspects for its construction and installation8; Finally, the
provision of waste collection services by the operator, is one of the innovative elements
of the MSSDU, and processes of planning, monitoring and awareness have been defined, collection and transportation,
Storage, treatment of dry fecal waste, urine treatment and final disposal.
For its part, the social component is implemented in two areas: (i) neighborhood and families; and (ii) educational community;
At the neighborhood and families, the implementation of community development activities (DESCOM)
They constitute the central element, in three phases: (i) demand generation; (ii) Constructive Active; and (III)
monitoring, essentially on the topics: (i) proper use of kiss and excreta disposal; (ii) washing
hands; (iii) safe water; and (iv) menstrual hygiene management; while with educational communities
implements the school hygiene program, for which the selection processes of units have been defined
educational, design of school hygiene plans, selection and training of facilitators, production of
Materials and resources, implementation of the designed plans and monitoring and monitoring.
The financial component of the model is fundamental for the sustainability and scalability of the intervention,
It begins with the realization of a study of prices and rates, which must include a financial diagnosis and
administrative of the operator and the services it provides, projections of income, costs and investments,
Considering all aspects required by current regulations, demand growth projections, the
Calculation of the equilibrium rate, financial profitability indicators and sensitivity analysis, also, this
Component considers an analysis of financing alternatives.
A fourth component, which appears in Annex 3 transversely, is the awareness and development
of capacities, and is implemented from institutional strengthening actions, oriented both to
Service providing entities, as well as the articulation with users and other allies, both in the normative area
(Regarding regulation, regulation and specific regulations), as in the operational area of provision of
services (referred to HR, technical and institutional capacities, planning, budget execution,
Equipment, infrastructure and knowledge management).
2. Protection of childhood against violence: This component focuses on ensuring compliance with the
right to live free of violence and enjoy comprehensive protection. UNICEF contributes through
Implementation of this component on three levels: (i) at a family level, it contributes to strengthening capacities of
Families to reduce and prevent violence, that mothers and fathers adopt affectionate care models
and sensitive with their daughters and sons, that men adopt a non -violent and more respectful attitude towards
Women and girls, at home and in the community; For this, a baseline was raised shortly after
Incorporating this component the program, vulnerability indicators was identified and designed, it was launched
a participatory methodology for the elaboration of family development plans and a manual of
parental competences, as well as a positive male course.
(ii) At the community level, it is intervened looking for leaders to openly encourage members of the
community to reject all forms of violence and that facilitate spaces for community dialogue, for
which was designed and carried out leadership courses, conflict resolution and organizational functioning,
formed a protection committee, composed of community leaders, friends of the friends of the
childhood and a child development center; finally;
(iii) at the level of municipal services, this component sought that victims of violence (particularly
sexual violence) seek support and denounce their aggressors before justice, for which the
local protection system, particularly the GAM Human Development Directorate, in terms of
Technical skills of attention to vulnerable families and victims of violence, the mechanism has been optimized
of reference and counter -reference of violence, an evaluation process was implemented and
Strengthening of capacities and knowledge of personnel in protection and prevention of violence and
promoted access to protection services, through decentralization of services, installing a
8 to date (May 2023) PSSDU's pilot implementation in Montero and Cobija has failed to produce a fertilizer that meets the
optimal safety conditions, so it is recommended to use it only for high stem crops, and manipulate it with measures
of biosafety.

3. Climate change: This component has been implemented with the main purpose of developing a
Climate change management tool for communal resilience (neighborhood); focuses on ensuring that
communities can identify the causes, consequences and impacts of climate change, and its main
Territorialized threats articulating at different levels:
(i) At the national level, NNAJ training and articulation has been promoted for action and governance
climatic, in order to schedule a work agenda with the Vice Ministry of Environment9, and
It has also been influenced in the update of the NDC with an approach to childhood rights;
(ii) at the subnational level, several incidence actions have been developed in departmental policies and
municipal, influencing the elaboration of public policy documents such as the Plan
Municipal climate change with focus on children's rights, calculation of the risk index and
NNAJ vulnerability to climate change and departmental climate change policy
of Gad Santa Cruz; and
(iii) at the neighborhood level, the Resilient Schools program has been implemented, which included the improvement of the
Nursery and educational units with climate change adaptation facilities; And he has
Designed the community resilience strategy, within the framework of which 12 plans have been implemented
of action by apple trees, which include several actions, from the installation of drains to prevent
waterlogging until the installation of communal orchards, garbage dumps and luminaries with solar panels
among others, social organizations have been strengthened through training processes and
constitution of an environmental committee and the strengthening of the infant-juvenile organization called
The stars.
Integrated model
With the incorporation of the protection and CC components to the original model of Wash, an intervention was sought
sustainable holistic, which contributes to the decrease in multidimensional poverty in the territory and population
recipient, based on capacities development, technical assistance, institutional strengthening and incidence
Politics, and a multilevel work, from the central level of government, through the departmental, municipal levels,
communal and also at a family and individual level. (See

3.2.5 Geographic scope and implementation phases
The PSSDU has been implemented in two municipalities: (i) Montero; and (ii) blanket, which have low coverage rates
of sanitation, especially in its rural and peri -urban areas; Initially, it had been planned to intervene in the
Municipality of El Alto but the implementation could not be specified in that city, however some were developed
monitoring actions at the collection of waste from dry bathrooms already installed, service carried out by the
Sumaj Huasi Foundation, and complementary consulting for the transition of said service to the social public company of
Water and sanitation of peace and high (EPSAS), transfer of functions that occurred in coordination with the embassy
of Sweden.
In Montero the implementation has completed in December 2022, while in Cobija the entire phase of
diagnosis, identification of the “Friendship” neighborhood for the model replica, as well as the recipient families and the
institutional strengthening, with local actors and decomponent sub-components, pH, MHM; The mosafa are found
in construction phase.
In order to expose the development and evolution of the PSSDU in its four years of implementation in a way
summarized and with specific data (mainly in terms of activities carried out), a summary table has been developed,
where the important milestones and the advances of each component in its three phases of execution are appreciated; said picture
It can be reviewed in Annex 6.

3.2.6 change theory (TDC) and expected results
TDC reconstruction process
The TDC reconstruction process was carried out in three steps: (i) the first was to investigate the interviews
preliminary, both with the technical supervision of the evaluation, and with the UNICEF sectors involved in the
Execution of the program, the progress of work regarding the construction of TDC and the expectations that were
regarding its reconstruction within the framework of the evaluation; (ii) Subsequently, a documentary review work was done
And a section in which a semi -structured scheme of the TDC was identified in the third report, in the third report
of the program (see Annex 7); Finally (iii) a reconstruction cabinet work of the TDC was done identifying the
causal relationships based on the logical framework of the program (see Annex 8) and the information contained in the
documentation provided, with the objective of having a methodological tool to assess the criteria of
Effectiveness and coherence of the intervention (as proposed in the evaluation matrix).
The approach of the socio-ecological model in which the formulation of the program is based; This one raises
Expected changes in four spheres or levels: (i) at the individual/ family level; (ii) at the community/ neighborhood level; (iii) at level
Municipal Local Institutional; and (iv) at the departmental or national political level, therefore, the TDC must be considered for these
four levels; On the other hand, the strategies are formulated from the three components of the programs: (i) Wash; (II)
protection; and (iii) climate change.
Being part of the general objective of the Search Scalability and Replication of the MSSDU at the national level,
considers pertinent to raise TDC with a scalable approach, identifying the expected changes in the four levels
as preconditions to achieve a permanent and sustainable change at the departmental or national level. With this
intention, a picture has been developed where the desired changes are identified according to the level and component of the MSSDU,
same that is suggested to review in Annex 9.
From the logical framework, four strategies implemented by the PSSDU were identified, aimed at reaching the
proposed objectives and contribute to the greater end, these are:
1. Strengthen the resilience of families, in aspects of health, protection and adaptation to climate change,
improving, on the one hand, sustainable access to comprehensive ecological decentralized sanitation services
(which does not require water use), and, on the other hand, strengthening the abilities and skills of families to
Respond to situations of violence and vulnerability.
2. Develop a protective and healthy environment for NNA, in a position to respond to change purposes
Climate, through the implementation of school promotion programs for hygiene habits, management
of menstrual hygiene and adaptation to climate change, the provision of services and prevention programs and
comprehensive response to situations of violence and/or vulnerability, and the strengthening of the capacities of
Adaptation to climate change and self -management of community/ neighborhood organizations.
3. Strengthen capacities of municipal, departmental governments and other subnational instances for
the fulfillment of its functions regarding ASEH, protection and climate change, through the
Strengthening of planning and management capabilities - with child protection perspective, change
Climate and Risk Management - GAM, GAD and Service Operators, Strengthening Competencies
of protection and justice services to prevent and respond to cases of violence against NNA and against
women, and the design and implementation of a closing model of the nutrient cycle, which contributes to the model
of circular economy of the municipality.
4. influence national public policies and regulations seeking to promote the sustainability and scalability of the
model, through the implementation and systematization of pilot projects that apply the MSSDU, of the
generation of evidence that supports the replica and scalability of the model (elaboration of pieces of law and
coordination of dialogue spaces), of the strengthening of technical capacities for the management of services of
ASEH and the design and promotion of a public policy for the protection and strengthening of families with focus
comprehensive.
TDC narrative summary
The reconstructed TDC of the MSSDU, part of the strategies raised by the three components (Wash, protection and
climate change), these have been implemented to: (i) strengthen the resilience of families in health aspects,
27
Final Report

protection and adaptation to climate change, also seek (ii) develop a protective, healthy and in
Conditions to respond to climate change for NNA, as well as (iii) strengthen governments capacities
municipal, departmental and other subnational instances for the fulfillment of its functions in Aseh,
climate protection and change and, finally, (iv) seek to influence public policies and regulations at the national level with the
In order to promote the sustainability and scalability of the model.
The implementation of these strategies aims to generate changes in four levels: (i) at the individual and family level, it is
expects to generate changes in habits and behaviors regarding hygiene and health, a high level of appropriation is expected
of mosafa, as well as changes in behaviors within families, in terms of roles of
Gender prevention of violence, parental care and conflict resolution, a change of
behaviors referring to environmental care and greater economic empowerment; (ii) at the level
neighborhood community, it is expected to achieve changes in the social norm regarding health, protection and care of the environment
environment, it is expected to achieve a high level of appropriation of community prevention and approach mechanisms
violence in the neighborhood and schools, and care of the environment in the neighborhood, as well as getting conditions
of governance and social stability, strengthened leaderships and a broad, active and committed leadership are also expected
participation of the community and its leaders in the implementation of the model.
Likewise, (iii) at the municipal local institutional level, it is expected to achieve changes related to the municipal policies of
sanitation, protection, adaptation and mitigation of climate change, a greater political will on the part of
subnational authorities and officials, greater and better technical capacities, as well as regulations and
favorable strategic planning, it is expected to achieve/leverage a greater volume of resources, all this with a
Orientation to meet the objectives of each component, that is, the implementation of a sanitation system
Decentralized sustainable, the proper implementation of the prevention and attention protocols of violence and
adaptation and mitigation of climate change and risk management; Finally (IV) at a political level
departmental and national, it is expected to achieve greater political will by authorities at the level
Departmental and National, adequate regulations and allocation of resources in favor of the implementation of the model
as public policy.
The expected changes in the four levels of the socio-ecological model are the preconditions required to
achieve the desired change, which is a greater exercise of the rights of childhood and adolescence to sanitation, to the
protection and healthy environment, but, above all, the socio-ecological model and the integration of the three components,
as well as their respective strategies, it seeks that this change is not passenger, but that it is lasting and sustainable in the
time.

4 Methodological Framework
4.1 Evaluation criteria and questions
The evaluation criteria that were used to assess the implementation of the PSSDU are the following: (i) impact; (II)
effectiveness; (iii) coherence; (iv) sustainability and scalability; (v) efficiency; (vi) relevance; and (VII) Gender and Equity. TO
Continue, the interpretation of each of these criteria in the framework of this evaluation is briefly presented:
IMPACT: The contribution of the program to the possible changes observed in the short term, both in relation to
sanitation, hygiene and health, as in regards to issues of protection and adaptation to climate change,
considering the framework of expected changes in the short term raised in the TDC; It also includes the most
significant perceived by the different system actors and how the program could contribute to these.
Relevance: the extent to which the program has taken into account the needs and requests of the recipient population,
in which it responds properly to current challenges and needs and that the objectives, strategic approaches and
Implementation models have adapted to the national, subnational and local context.
Effectiveness: the extent to which the expected results have been achieved, and in which strategies, approaches and methods
Operations have contributed to the achievement of these results; also considers the identification of the factors that have
influenced in obtaining (or not) of the results and an assessment of the difference in the effectiveness of each of the

three components of the model; For the evaluation of the effectiveness of the program, the compliance analysis of
The results of the TDC.
Coherence: the extent to which the strategies and activities of the model components are related to the
expected results and objectives, and in which the different activities are complemented and integrate during the
Implementation with an intersectoral approach; Thus also considers the identification of the added value of working on
Intersectoral way, jointly implementing Wash models, protection and climate change.
Sustainability and scalability: the probability that the results achieved by the program continue after
Finish interventions, includes an assessment of installed capacity at the institutional and family level that allows
continuity of the results achieved, and the extent to which the program has contributed to strengthening this capacity; in
As for scalability, it refers to the most important factors that must be considered to replicate the
Model, both at the subnational and national level, and to the ability of the model to become public policy.
Efficiency: the characteristics of the program and the availability of information has allowed to perform a descriptive analysis
of the use of inputs in the implementation of the program. A thorough evaluation of the efficiency of the
Program, but a descriptive approach for the evaluation of this dimension that complements and contextualizes the
other dimensions.
Gender and equity: the extent to which the benefits generated by the program have reached the most girls and boys
vulnerable, identifying the categories of vulnerable girls to whom these benefits have not arrived; includes
also an assessment of the way the intervention incorporated gender approaches, interculturality, equity
and of rights.
Some changes have been made to the evaluation questions, which arise from the reconstruction process of the TDC and
the need to adapt these questions to this framework of results; In the following table the questions of
evaluation for each of the detailed criteria:

4.2 Methodological design11
For this evaluation, a non -experimental, formative and summative methodological design was used, it is
say that it was oriented to the identification of lessons learned and recommendations focused on scalability and
program replicability; On the other hand, the evaluation combines mixed methods, which implied a job of
Lifting qualitative and quantitative information, with their respective methods of systematization and analysis, and
Finally, the combination and triangulation of such information to obtain conclusions and recommendations.
The MML has been used as a framework of expected results and objectives for the evaluation of the effectiveness criteria, and
TDC as a specific evaluation framework for the impact criteria; For this, the TDC has been rebuilt in the phase of
planning (as explained in subtitle 3.2.6), and subsequently, through evidence collection, resorting
to the sources and applying the techniques detailed in the evaluation matrix (documentary review, interviews
Semi -structured to key informants and allocation population, field visit and survey to the recipient population),
It has valued to what extent the expected changes have been reached in the short term. (Evaluation matrix in Annex 11)
The guiding questions to establish/analyze the causal relationships between activities/products of the program and
The effects/results in the TDC have been: (i) What actions were carried out to achieve the results?; (ii) What
Changes were needed to reach those results?; (iii) What was expected to achieve with the program?; (iv) Which ones
Are the data on the expected and achieved results?; (v) What data is available on other unbelief?;
(vi) Why and how was the actions proposed to lead to the planned results?; and (vii) what is
He assumed that it would happen and what really happened?
As part of the impact criteria, the "most significant change" (mentioned in the
Start Report) Complete, what was done was - as was provided in the evaluation matrix - apply the question:
Which one do you consider. What has been the most significant change that the program has generated? to all informants and
Recipient population consulted, and the answers have been systematized looking for the most frequent common elements.
The evaluation methodology sought to transversalize gender approaches, equity, interculturality, rights of the
Childhood and Human Rights, from the design of the evaluation (evaluation matrix, evaluation questions, strategies
of approach) through the design and construction of the instruments and concluding in the systematization and analysis of
The information.

4.3 Quantitative data collection method
Objective and scope of data collection. With the aim of having evidence about the current (final) state of the
Indicators of effect of the logical framework of the program, a modular survey was applied to the allocated families of the
Implementation (in its three components) in the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood of the municipality of Montero; The data
quantitative are specifically used to contribute to evaluate the criteria of effectiveness and impact, allow to assess
compliance with the indicators of effect of the logical frame12 that are: (i) use and operation of mosafa
delivered; (ii) hygiene habits and practices in the recipient population; (iii) habits and practices of prevention and
response to violence; and (iv) habits and practices of adaptation to climate change.
In addition, the data that come from the survey to recipients provide supplies to validate the sequence
Logic of the TDC, since it has been developed taking as the main input the logical framework of the PSSDU. Has to
It is taken into account that the data lifting was carried out in the final phase of implementation of the program, in which
Many or almost all the effects of the implementation are fresh, and, in contrast, the TDC is formulated with a
Medium and long term orientation, since it is the TDC of the MSSDU, with the prospect of becoming public policy.
Background of the baseline. It should be noted that there is no baseline of the program, that is, a record of the
starting situation of each of the indicators of the logical framework; The program components start at times
Different: Wash in 2018, it does not have a baseline, and the other two components that initiate actions on 2020,
Nor do they have immediate baseline, but there are diagnostic documents and baseline dating from April
of 2021, which do not correspond to the indicators of the logical framework (corresponding to the components of
Protection and climate change); Finally, there is a monitoring of the situation of the indicators of the three
components as of February 2022, which also does not show a concordance with the logical framework13; In short, it is not counted
with a baseline matrix that would have been very useful for the monitoring and evaluation of the program.
Sample design PSSDU implementation responds to a demonstrative project logic, therefore, it is
of a small intervention in regard to the number of families achieved; In this sense, it did not correspond
Develop a sample design for the application of the Survey to Recipient Families, but sought to apply it to the
totality of these.
Sample strategy The instrument applied to the head of the woman present in the house at the time when the
polls made the visit; Subsequently, the woman head of the family was asked: (i) if any person from 13 to lived
18 years in the house; and (ii) if he authorized the application of the questionnaire to the minor, in cases where
They found more than a teenager in the house in said age range, it was requested to interview the major; finally,
The woman head of the family or the teenager was asked if a person of sex was present in the house
male older than 21 years to whom to apply the questionnaire, if the answer was affirmative, the
instrument and if it was negative, the consultation was finished.
Effective sample. Despite having made the effort to arrive with the survey to all the recipient families of the
Program, it was not possible, especially due to the absence of families for travel reasons, work or others,
During the days and schedules in which the operation was carried out. Combining the lists of recipients provided
Both for a UNICEF consultant, and by Fundación Sepa, a list of 75 families was consolidated, of which 63
were identified as beneficiaries of mosaafa or bes and the remaining 12 as beneficiaries of the component
Protection but not mosafa.
With the accompaniment of the neighborhood leadership, the tour was made and home visit to all homes
listed as recipients, and the modular survey was applied to 47 families, 23 were not found in their
Home during the days and schedules in which the operation was carried out, 3 families said they had not participated in the
Program (despite being registered on the list), 1 head of the family did not accept that the survey and 1 of the
addresses recorded in the list as beneficiary housing it turned out to be poorly registered, because instead they were

Representativeness and bias risks in the sample. There are no variables that could be used to demonstrate,
statistically, the level at which the sample can be inferred to the total recipient population, however, the product of
Field visits, interviews with local informants, especially with the director of the partner
IMPLEMENTATOR: SEPA FOUNDATION, AND THE REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL BASE DIAGNOSIS, it can be concluded that the characteristics
socioeconomic, productive and labor of families in the neighborhood are quite homogeneous, and more are inside
of the group of recipients, therefore it can be assumed that the fact of not having reached 100%
From the recipients does not imply a high risk of bias of the survey results.
An aspect that allows to form an idea of the dispersion of the sample, and, therefore, of its representativeness at the level
Territorial, it is its distribution in the different intervened apple trees, the PSSDU has built mosafa in 27 apples
from the Guadalupe II neighborhood, and the survey has been applied in 24 of these 27 apple trees (in Annex 13 there are
The detail of the number of recipients and effective surveys per Manzano), with this data can be affirmed
that the survey has not concentrated in a neighborhood point, but has been distributed almost throughout the territory
intervened.
Survey content. A survey form was applied with the following modules:
1. Verification of mosaafa and bes, proper functioning and satisfaction test
2. Hygiene practices, questionnaire with structured questions
3. Safe water supply, questionnaire with structured questions
4. Protection, questionnaire with structured questions
5. Violence prevention, questionnaire with structured questions
6. Perception of security and availability of services for NNA and women in the neighborhood, questionnaire with
Structured questions
7. Citizen security perception, questionnaire with structured questions
8. Knowledge and practices of environmental care and adaptation to climate change (ACC),
questionnaire with structured questions aimed at adolescents
9. Violence prevention, questionnaire with structured questions aimed at adult men
Annex 14 of this document includes the survey form that was applied.
Procedure for field data collection
For the collection of field data through a survey to recipients, the first step was to make contact with
The SEPA Foundation team, who, in turn, facilitated contact with the neighborhood leadership of the Guadalupe II neighborhood
Cofadena; On March 2, 2023, the presentation of the study and the field team was carried out, formed
for a supervisor and two pollsters, before the representatives of apple trees and neighborhood in general.

4.4 Qualitative data collection methods
4.4.1 Secondary information
The secondary information that has been reviewed, has been made up of: (i) 9 methodological guide documents and
Institutional of UNICEF; (ii) 4 referential documents, from previous evaluations prepared under the guidelines
GEROS (Global Evaluation Report Oversight System); (III) 34 Design documents, monitoring, consulting products
and means of verification developed within the framework of the PSSDU, all this documentation has been provided to the equipment
Evaluator in digital format by the Unicef sectors of the program executors, and the detail is presented in the
Annex 16.
It is worth mentioning that the documentation provided to the evaluation team after the presentation of the final report
draft has not been considered within the framework of this evaluation, because it was considered extemporaneous, since the
Scenario in which the evaluation began in October 2022 may have changed substantially to July/August
of 2023, months in which the latest documents were delivered to the evaluation team.
Complementarily, the investigation has required the identification of another secondary documentation that has been
Obtained from the Internet, these are 20 documents that are: (i) public development plans and policies, and
specifically in the basic sanitation sectors, protection and climate change; (ii) statistical information of the
municipalities and intervention departments; (iii) Reports of performance indicators and diagnostic studies of the
Senters of sanitation, protection and climate change; (iv) budget information of municipal levels and
departmental; and (v) national laws in the sectors involved; In this case, a list of the
Documentation consulted in Annex 16 of this document.
Although, all these documents are necessary, to a greater or lesser extent, to obtain evidence and
support information within the framework of this evaluation, it has been identified that the following documents are
Centrals to understand the design, development, results and effects of the PSSDU: (i) Project Document

Punctual evaluation.
4.4.2 Semi -structured interviews
Individual and collective semi -structured interviews were conducted, a detail of the sample is attached in Annex 17
Scheduled and effective of informants to which this type of interview was reached. In the case of interviews
individual, all informants suggested by UNICEF sector teams were attended; The team
Evaluator requested listings of valid informants - that is why they know the program, who have participated in some (s)
of their activities or that have some kind of relationship with the execution - to apply the interviews, by type of
Informant, sector (Wash, Protection and Climate Change) and level of government (national, departmental, municipal and
community). Of a total of 30 contacts of informants received, 26 interviews were completed14; The list of
Revised individual interviews is attached in Annex 18.
In the case of collective interviews, intentional sampling was made considering, in each case, the sex criteria,
eternary group and main characteristic to form the interview groups, this detail can be observed in the annex
19.
In the case of Montero, the call for collective interviews were made by the field team of the
Evaluation company in coordination and with the support of local leaders, for interviews with beneficiary families (both
of mosaafa and family development plans) was supported by the neighborhood leaders, who identified
People who could participate in the interview based on their availability of time, the interview with members of
The committees was coordinated with one of the members of the Environmental Committee, the interview with adolescent women
He coordinated with the director of the San Ramón de la Víme Educational Unit and the interview with adolescent men coordinated
with one of the leaders of the Grupo Estrellas.
In the case of Cobija, the identification and call of participants for interviews, depending on their availability
of time, it was carried out with the support of PSC; for the security of the participants the interviews were carried out in
Foundation facilities, but during their application there was no presence of PSC personnel, this for
guarantee the independence of the responses of the interviewees; In Montero, to guarantee the security of the and
Participants, especially adolescents, interviews were conducted at the neighborhood headquarters and in the EU San
Ramón de la Víbora, did not intervene at any time personnel executor of the project or the implementing partner for
guarantee the independence of the evaluation.
In total, 10 collective interviews were conducted within the framework of the evaluation, 5 in Montero and 5 in Cobija, with a
Total participation of 64 informants, 33 in Montero and 31 in Cobija, of which 19 were men and 45 women; in it
Annex 20 shows a detail of the conformation of collective interviews.
4.4.3 Evaluation mission
Between March 8 and 10, 2023, an evaluation mission was developed in territory, by Eduardo Pando,
main evaluator of this consulting; The activities carried out within the framework of this visit to the Guadalupe II neighborhood
Cofadena, are detailed in Annex 22.
14 It was not possible to interview a teacher and two participating teachers of the program, because they did not accept to answer the questionnaire,
And because you could not make contact with one of the teachers, because the available phone number was wrong; I also know
had suggested to interview the former subgovernor of Santa Cruz but this interview could not be completed, due to the busy schedule of the
informant; On the other hand, it had not been scheduled to interview leaders or leaders in the start report, but the execution responsible
of the program protection component suggested to reach this group of informants, and it was possible to interview 3 NNA leaders and also
to a community leader, representative of the Municipal Council of NNA de Montero.

data.
4.6 Considerations of ethical nature
The evaluation was carried out following the evaluation standards established by the Nations Evaluation Group
United (UNEG) 15, such as:
• Evaluation of independence and impartiality. In the first instance, the evaluation company
This consultancy has been awarded from a public, competitive and transparent process. On the other hand, the team
Evaluation has used all the documentation made available to the UNICEF and PSSDU teams, and
He assured the participation of the actors involved in their three components, as well as the recipient population,
Key implementing partners and actors.
• Credibility assurance and quality control mechanisms. The onset report has been submitted to the
different established quality control mechanisms, particularly for the lifting and
Information analysis, which were implemented during the field operation and during the entire process of
assessment. It is also important to mention the supervision that UNICEF has exercised, through several instances of
Feedback and quality control to the evaluation process, having reviewed and adjusted the start report,
The progress report and this final report.
• Conflict of interest. It is declared that the Gerensa company and its professional team have no conflict of interest in
The elaboration of this evaluation, has no particular relationship with UNICEF or with the responsible team
of the supervision of the evaluation and the execution of the program, beyond the strictly professional.
• Human rights and gender. The gender, equity and interculturality approaches in
the design of the evaluation and its instruments, as well as in the process of lifting and analysis of the
information; All views expressed during the survey processes, interviews and
discussion of findings.
In addition, the ethical principles of UNICEF16 and UNEG17 have been considered, such as integrity, responsibility, respect
and beneficence.
• The evaluation team and its field brigades have acted, at all times, and particularly during the operation
of field, with honesty and truthfulness18. Efforts have been exhausted to reach all and all informants whose
testimony reverses importance and a triangulation methodology of information sources for information has been applied to
Avoid skewing the conclusions and recommendations that may arise from the evaluation, being fully aware
of the responsibility that this process implies.
• It has sought to minimize the discomforts that every investigative process implies, especially during the
field visits, inspections on situ to mosaafa and survey application, trying to be respectful, brief
and as invasive as possible, providing all the necessary information, promoting the accompaniment of the
field operation by the leadership and neighbors, always with the informed consent of the
15 UNEG (2016) Evaluation standards and standards.
16 UNICEF (2021) UNICEF procedure in terms of ethical standards in research, evaluation, information collection and analysis
17 UNEG (2020) Ethical guide for evaluation.
18 To verify this action, there are means of verification (form and database in KOBO, syntax of the base operation
of data, recordings and transcripts of the interviews carried out) that are made available to the supervision at the time
require, several of them have already been delivered.

population and informants; There were practically no difficulties or misunderstandings in the relationship with
social, community and institutional actors and with the same base population.19
• Safeguards for participants. The main safeguards that were designed and implemented for the
minors were: (i) Informed consent forms; (ii) anonymity in the application and
systematization of primary source information; (iii) Ethical review of the start report by an entity
impartial; and (iv) design and implementation of a risk identification matrix for NNA (see Annex 23, annex
24 and Annex 25).
• Ethical review. The external ethical review of the starting report by Health Media Lab, Inc., allowing
Adjust and improve the protection mechanisms of informants and information protection. The certification of
Approval of the start report was issued on January 10, 2023, it is attached in Annex 24.
Risk management for NNA. A risk management matrix has been built for the same that is included in the
Annex 23 of this document; With the construction of this matrix it has been determined that the risks for the
protection and/or security of adolescents who were consulted during the operation of lifting of
information have been low, and the measures to mitigate these risks have been established, which were applied before and during
data lifting activities (based on UNICEF Ethical Research procedures with children20). For
This has been implemented the following measures:
• Field team training, regarding the correct way to apply the instruments, without forcing or pressing
to no teenager to respond to them and subscribe forms of informed consent with
the adolescents who access the survey and with their parents or guardians; and regarding the correct form
to take photographs as means of verification, without exposing any children without consent from their parents or
tutors, taking general shots from field pollsters, with informants of legal age, and avoiding the
First planes.
• Application of housing surveys, or at the street door of the housing of the recipients (without
transfer or summon adolescents to different places to apply the survey); Prior application of
Instrument at the head of family (woman) present in the house; Informed consent sign of both the
mother, father or tutor as of the same adolescent21; No any survey form was included in the survey form
Question that requires the name or telephone number of any informant; The options of
geolocation, in order to guarantee the anonymity and confidentiality of the informants; monitoring
permanent by the brigade supervisor; The accompaniment of community or personal leaders was requested
Teacher to the pollsters brigade during the operation.
• Application of collective interviews in educational units, neighborhood headquarters or child care center, low
coordination and surveillance of teaching staff or the neighborhood or personnel of the children's center (except
during the interview itself, to avoid biases in the responses of the adolescents and guaranteeing the
independence of the evaluation); coordinated work with local partners (SEPA Foundation and Social Pastoral Caritas).
4.7 Limitations of evaluation and mitigation strategies
The following limitations of the evaluation have been identified, and in each case, actions to mitigate have been carried out
the contingencies that could have been generated.
1. The first, during the work of lifting primary source information was the reduced accessibility and
time availability of informants, especially hierarchical positions inside the VAPSB and
Teaching staff preferred not to respond to interviews; To mitigate this situation, the support of the
19 When starting the field operation in the municipality of Cobija, the evaluation team had not been reported timely that the agreement between
UNICEF and its local partner (PSC) had been fulfilled, therefore, there was no knowledge about its staff had no contractual obligation
To logistically support the evaluation, upon learning about it, the evaluators sought to correct and reimburse any logistics expense in
that it has been incurred, and even find other mechanisms for relationship with the recipient population and other informants, however the
Attitude of the partner was very proactive, and despite not having a current agreement, they supported the entire information lifting process.

Supervision of the evaluation issued by credential letters for the evaluating team with the UNICEF guarantee, sent
Notes requesting audience for consultants, and even scheduled interviews.
2. A second limitation that was found in field work, specifically during the application of the survey
To recipient families, it was the impossibility of making contact with families that do not reside permanently in
The neighborhood. To seek to mitigate this situation, they repeatedly tried to make contact with these families,
making periodically visits with accompaniment of the neighborhood leadership; Unfortunately, even so
It was possible to make contact with about a third of the beneficiary population, so it was decided to subscribe a
Field operation closing report, with the endorsement of the president of the Neighborhood Board of the Guadalupe II Cofadena neighborhood,
in order to support the work done.
An aspect that allows you to have an idea of the dispersion of the sample (and its representativeness) is its distribution in
The different apple trees intervened, the PSSDU has built mosaafa in 27 apple trees from the Guadalupe II neighborhood, and the
Survey has been applied in 24 of these 27 apple trees (89%), with this data we can affirm that the survey
It has not concentrated in a point in the neighborhood, but has been distributed almost throughout the territory intervened, which
It increases, in terms of territorial coverage, its representativeness. For everything explained, this limitation does not imply
Risks related to the quality and integrity of the field information used.
3. A third limitation for evaluation has to do with some weaknesses observed in the system of
Monitoring and evaluation (m & e) 22 of the program reported below:
(i) PSSDU does not have a baseline with which to compare the results and effects attributable to the
implementation; Nor does it have technical chips of the indicators that determine a priori the form of
calculation.
(ii) PSSDU did not have a theory of change (TDC), this tool has been developed in the course
of the implementation and has established in the course of this evaluation as part of the scope
established in the TDR.
(iii) the documentation and means of verification is compartmentalized and therefore its delivery was made
partially and at the request of the evaluation team. Having access all the documentation in the
First phase of the study, would have allowed being more precise in the design of evaluation instruments.
See Annex 16.
It is important to mention that the weakness identified are specifically the M&E system, and not of the
Execution of the program, therefore, the evaluation is not indicating weaknesses or deficiencies in the execution of the
components of the PSSDU or breach of results/objectives - of fact, the considerations that are made to
throughout the document, they account for a very high assessment regarding the results and effects on the short
deadline achieved by the program - but observes the need to improve M&E processes and mechanisms
and means through which the program reports and evidence its progress.
4. A fourth and last limitation of the evaluation is that, due to the moment in which it is done, that is to say in the phase
end of the implementation (in practice, several elements of the program remain in execution), it is not yet possible
Observe the impacts. Methodologically, the following has been chosen: (i) the evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Program contemplates the analysis of compliance with results and objectives of the implementation, linked to the analysis
of the PSSDU logical framework; and (ii) the impact evaluation focuses on the identification of the observed changes
in the short term, for which the reconstructed TDC is used.
22 The M&E system refers to the processes of collection, systematization and analysis of information based on objectives, results and
planned and executed activities of a project, program or policy, in order to improve its execution and efficacy; Usually these
M&E processes are developed around design and planning tools such as the logical framework, results matrix, change theory,
Performance evaluation matrix and others; In summary, the M&E system within the PSSDU should include at least: (i) TDC, (II)
MML, (iii) baseline, (IV) indicators sheets, (v) progress reports (depending on the MML and indicators), (vi) mml with reports from
Advance of indicators, (VII) all the means of verification that support the report of the progress of the indicators and (viii) the reports of
Evaluation (of mid -end, impact or ex post).

5 Evaluation findings
5.1 Impact
Taking the TDC as an analysis framework for the results and expected changes of the program, this section is analyzed
and evaluates the changes observed in the short term as a product of the PSSDU implementation, and subsequently,
systematizes and analyzes the most significant changes observed by the different actors involved in the intervention;
It is observed below what are the changes in the short term contemplated in the TDC:

What is the contribution of the program on possible changes in the short term, both in the Wash component and
in the protection and adaptation and mitigation of climate change, considering the framework of results and changes
expected raised in the TDC?
On an individual and family level, it is concluded that families benefited from mosafa, for the most part, make good use
of the modules, but it is advisable to strengthen the accompaniment and training of the families that need it,
since the unhealthy habits of some families can affect neighbors and even the entire neighborhood;
Likewise, most families have a positive perception regarding the service provided by Cosmol, but a
approximately third is not fully compliant, so it is advisable to identify in what aspects can
Improve the EPSA to raise the level of families.
It is verified that hand washing by families is adequate in most cases, but that the use of
Hand jaboncillo is not generalized, so it is advisable to insist on the use of hygiene inputs
appropriate staff; The toilet of the patio is adequate at least two thirds of the homes visited, it is recommended
Carry out intra -adomyciliary cleaning campaigns to support that third of families that do not clean
adequate of its courtyards.
A favorable evolution is observed in the perception of the program recipients of the program regarding security
In the neighborhood, as well as a better assessment of protection services especially for NNA
and women and a greater contribution of families for the generation of safe spaces in the neighborhood; However, the
perception of insecurity in the neighborhood, especially by women heads of household, although it has improved
During the last year and a half of implementation, it is still high.
Important effects are observed in the adolescent population in terms of knowledge and perceptions about
different themes, ranging from ph-MHM, to prevention of violence, friendly habits and customs with
The environment and a better relationship with their parents, teachers and peers. A decrease is also observed
of the proportion of families that leave their children alone, but at the same time, a
increase in the proportion of families that leave the children in charge of their younger brothers of
age; The increase in physical punishment and verbal violence against girls and boys such as
Disciplinary measures in the program recipients of the program.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
Important changes are observed in the strengthening of local populations and organizations around
climatic action; It highlights the incorporation of several environmental practices and habits,
especially by adolescent population; In this framework it is advisable to continue implementing activities
of awareness, but above all of training, to improve the knowledge and skills of the youngest
to effectively undertake environmental care actions.
At the neighborhood community level, the change in orientation of neighborhood organizations is remarkable, from what
strictly political to a more social approach, and the integration of the Guadalupe II neighborhood, which remained isolated, with the
rest of the municipality; The program leaves a share capital for the sustainability of certain actions and effects; is
advisable to work more depth in the diagnosis of citizen insecurity in the neighborhood and in the
Identification of strategies to face and reduce it.
At the institutional and political level, the Municipal Planning Tools battery prepared in the GAM stands out
Montero, however, it is recognized that there are goals raised in these tools that are far from being fulfilled,
since the macroeconomic scenario has changed and is adverse; An important contribution is also verified in the
generation of regulations and public policy at the departmental level in issues of climate and national change in issues of
protection.
With regard to the closure of the nutrient cycle, there has been a favorable first experience, having
reached a fertilizer production times higher than the one estimated, which was used in tasks of
arborization and reforestation made by the GAMM; A perfectly harmless fertilizer has not yet been obtained, for
which its use is not recommended in food crops.
As for changes in habits and/or behaviors at the individual and family level, the first thing that can be underlined is that
The families, for the most part, are making good use of mosafa, this is evidenced with the results of the
Verification in situ that was carried out within the framework of the evaluation, and that are expressed in Annex 26.
The aspects best managed by families are those that are not exclusive to dry baths, that is, having
toilet paper and with a dump inside the module, practically in all mosafa it has been verified that these
elements are present, it has also been observed that practically in all mosafa there is sawdusts as
drying material; Where some shortcomings have been observed, it has been that not in all cases the feces within the
cup had enough drying material (13% did not have enough sawdust, and therefore a feces smell of the
interior of the module) and also that a tool to throw the drying material was not observed in all modules
on feces (this tool was not observed in 11%.
At this point it is important to mention that the EPSA must verify and guide families regarding the amount of sawdust
It is used as drying material, since it cannot be too much, since it would make it difficult to obtain a fertilizer
quality, nor can it be insufficient, since this would generate emission of bad odors and flies proliferation.
In 16% of cases there was a presence of flies inside the module, fecal material was observed in 18% in the
surroundings of the cup or floor and in 11% on the edge of the cup, these indications denote that these families are not
making optimal hygienic use of the modules, it is recommended that cosmol decomes identify and
support these families to improve the use of their modules, since, even with an operational mosa
families do not use them properly, they remain vulnerable to contracting infectious diseases, product of
little hygienic habits.
An indicator of the proper use of the mosafa has been built by adding these eight practices identified from
The visual inspection, and it has been found that 62% of families make optimal use of their modules, and 17% make a
High regular use, that is, in 79% of cases it has been verified that families implement 4 to 8 use practices
correct of mosaafa; On the other hand, 2% of families make low regular use and 19% make poor use of
Its modules, as they apply between 1 and 3 adequate practices or, directly, do not apply these practices (see Annex 27).
Although, a little suitable use of modules in a minority of cases has been verified (in 21% of mosaafa
inspected), it is advisable to strengthen training and accompaniment to users, since the
Model requires generalized structural changes in the population in terms of hygiene practices, to achieve
impacts on public health and especially in the population of NNA.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
As for the frequency of use of mosaaf
They need them, 5% have stated that they use them sometimes (these are 2 families, one of them has another bathroom and
The other indicates that they do not use the mosafa because it has no water) and the 2% that does not use it (this is a family that does not use the
Mosafa because it would have been covered and flooded); It is observed that almost all the beneficiary families use their
Mosafa as the only or main sanitation option, and that a few families do not use them (see Annex 28), in these
cases are observed indications of inappropriate use of mosafa due to ignorance of technology and how it works
A dry bath, they point out that they do not use them because they do not have water or because they were flooded, when these modules do not
They require water for its operation.
Another aspect that has been taken into account in the inspection has been the emission of bad odors, since it is frequent
that in the dry baths it is frequently perceived, bad smells, and this situation deters the use of them,
especially by NNA23. In 76.3% of the 38 inspected mosaf
Urine, but the smell of urine was perceived in 7.9% and the smell of feces in 15.8% of cases, in these modules it was also detected
Little useful uses of the module (the stool in the cup did not have enough secant material, the cup cover
It remained open and/or fecal matter was observed at the edges or surroundings of the cup); Therefore, it has been observed
that mosaafa technology minimizes the emission of bad odors, but the use made by the families of these modules
It is essential to maintain the comfort and good condition of the modules, an aspect that is advisable to reinforce the
less in a room of families (see Annex 29).
Another aspect evaluated is the acceptance of the waste collection and accompaniment services provided by Cosmol,
which has been asked through a perception question regarding said service24, 18% have described it as
Excellent and 52% as very good, that is, 70% of families benefited from mosafa have a good
perception regarding the service offered by Cosmol; On the other hand, the remaining 30% of families do not have a good
Perception with respect to this service, 23% consider it regular, 5% bad and 2% lousy (see Annex 30).
The reasons why families consider that the service is not good or optimal are mainly the frequency
very spaced with which they carry out the waste, the low quality of attention and the poor or insufficient
Coordination by Cosmol with families25; It is recommended that the EPSA identify families that are not
satisfied with the service, which determines the causes of its disagreement and can implement the measures that are to
Its scope to improve its service, since this is one of the innovative elements of the model and, to a large extent,
The sustainability of the same depends on the quality, the acceptance and satisfaction of the families (see Annex 31).
To evaluate some key habits and behavior in the program recipient of the program, the
families that indicated having received training in hygiene issues26: how often do you wash their hands after
to use the bath? And what are your hands washed after using the bathroom? The results to both questions are presented
in Annex 32 and Annex 33.
All families have indicated that their hands are washed after doing their needs, 80% every time, 15% the
Most of the time and 5% sometimes, 12% do so with a hand jaboncillo, 71% with clothing soap, 10% with
detergent and 7% only with water. It is valuable that all families point out to wash their hands after doing
use of health services, but it is desirable that all people do it whenever they use services and not the
23 The bad smell in the BES is a consequence of the inappropriate use of the system and also of the same technology, since the feces remain
Below the module very close to the surface, so it is important to use an adequate amount of drying material to reduce the emission
of bad odors; Bes must have adequate ventilation systems, according to Cosmol officials who accompanied the
Visit of the evaluator to the neighborhood, the previous versions of Bes (implemented by other organizations) had no adequate systems of
ventilation, in the design of the mosaaf
faster of bad odors.
24 In this case, the question was applied to all the families that have a mosafa and not only to those who gave permission for the inspection
Visual, that is to say 44 families.
25 This is an answer that 2 families surveyed have given, when asked why are they not satisfied with the service of
Cosmol? They have responded that the EPSA does not properly coordinate with families, but not much more investigated; I probably know
They refer to the fact that Cosmol technicians go to homes when they are not present (the evaluation has been able to verify that there is a high
seasonal migration in this neighborhood).
26 seeks to identify effects or contributions generated by the intervention, therefore, the intention of the survey was to identify habits of
hygiene in the population that received training and not in the general population, these questions have been applied to a total of 41 families
Recipient, those that pointed out to have participated in training courses in hygiene issues in the framework of the PSSDU.

most times or sometimes; On the other hand, although there are economic and material limitations in all areas
peri -urban of the country, it is recommended that Cosmol, in their daily work of monitoring to families, insists that the
Best option for hand washing is to do with water and handshand, since it guarantees the
Elimination of germs and microbes, while soap or clothing detergent are designed for another purpose, and
Effects on hand washing practices may not be optimal.
Another aspect that was verified through visits to the housing of recipients was the cleaning conditions
General of the Patio de las Casas; In two thirds of them the patio was clean, in 24% of cases a
Little garbage and in 10% of the homes visited a lot of garbage were found (see Annex 34). This is another aspect that,
particularly in warm climates, could monitor the EPSA (as long as this task is limited to its mandate
and powers), as it can be the origin of infection spotlights that affect not only the families of the little homes
neat, but also to neighboring homes and even the entire neighborhood.
Finally, in health care and care issues, it has been investigated, through the survey, about water quality
that families consume (although it is not directly part of the objectives of the program); In the first instance, families
They do not know how to identify the term "safe water", since 83% have failed to identify this concept, therefore, it is
advisable to work with the community, in the following instances, in the conceptualization and identification of what it is and
How you get or prepare safe water for human consumption (see Annex 35).
However, in practice, it is observed that most families consume safe water, since 53% drink water from
bottle (see Annex 36); However, this practice, within the framework of an integral intervention such as the PSSDU, is
contradictory with the environmental care practices it promotes, since bottled water consumption
It is a little ecological practice.
On the other hand, 38% of families consume water directly from the tap, which should be considered a little practice
healthy, on which it is important to socially and communicationally to change it, since for the purposes
that you want to obtain in the medium and long term, the consumption of tap water can go exactly in the opposite direction
of what is expected to achieve with the installation of mosaafa, which is the decrease in the prevalence of diseases
gastrointestinal infectious, especially diarrhea; It is advisable, in this regard, is to promote the practice of
Boil the water obtained from tap before consuming it.
Protection component. Questionnaires have been applied separately to women and men, belonging to families
Recipients of the program, regarding the measures that apply in families when children discuss fouls,
And it has been found that there is still verbal violence is very frequent, both in men and women, as a measure
corrective; In the second instance, prohibitions are used a lot27 (to leave home or something that NNA likes)
as a disciplinary measure; practices such as talking or negotiating horizontally with children or positive reinforcement
They are still rare or non -existent in these families, so it is advisable to continue working on generating
Changes within families tending to improve domestic relationships and positive disciplinary practices
and affectionate. The perception of the relationships of the mothers/fathers with their sons and daughters is good on average (see annex
37 and Annex 38).
In the final implementation report of the Integral Program for Protection of Children and Adolescents and Climate Resilience
Within the framework of the PSSDU, the evolution of 8 indices calculated in the baseline of the component to the line of

The main changes in the short term that are observed as the effect of the implementation of development plans
family (PDF) are: a decrease in the proportion of girls and boys under 10 years of age who remain alone while
His caregivers carry out their daily activities, however, the same document reveals that the number of girls and
young children who remain in the care of their brothers also minors, has increased in the same
proportion; The proportion of families who point out not to leave their girls and boys have also been drastically reduced
At no time.
The reduction of violent practices within families is also an observable change in the final report of the
Component, the evaluation team has been able to verify, in collective interviews to women mothers, which exists
an important assessment regarding the attitude changes observed in their sons and daughters thanks to the program, in these
Interviews have mentioned that their children have become more collaborators and less rebels.
Another effect that this report reports is the reduction of the negative perception of the participating population of the
Component regarding the incidence of violence in the neighborhood, this result shows a decrease of 52% to 33% (it is assumed
that this is a percentage of recipients with negative perception); On the other hand, the evaluation survey
Applied to women's heads reveals that 38% have a negative perception regarding citizen security
In the neighborhood, it can be seen that both reports do not have too much, so it can be concluded that
Approximately one third of the recipient population has a negative perception regarding the conditions of
neighborhood security.
The contribution of families has increased to the generation of safe spaces and has improved the perception of
families regarding public services for citizen protection and security, and it can also be seen that
Knowledge of families of the factors that affect the development of NNA have increased; Finally, the
Component has calculated a NNA self -protection capacity index that also shows an evolution
positive. 28
On the other hand, in this same report it can be found that the frequency of various types of punishment against the children,
both physical and verbal, has increased in the output line with respect to the baseline of the component, the percentages
From families that hit their children with Chicote, 57% have increased from 52% from the baseline to the exit line,
The percentage of families that violate punishments such as pinches, blows or cocachos has increased from 14% to 27%, from
Families that shout at them have risen from 60% to 75% and those that quarrel from 88% to 98%.
Climate change component. Regarding environmental friendly habits and behaviors,
Qualitatively, it is observed, in the results of the individual and collective interviews, and in the routes in the neighborhood,
that there is sensitivity in the population with respect to keeping the neighborhood clean, not throwing garbage in the street, and also
Regarding saving water in everyday uses.
On the other hand, the survey has revealed that the adolescents of the recipient families still do not incorporate
Recycling practices in their day to day, these habits are not simple to acquire and demand greater awareness
environmental; The survey shows that 57% of adolescents practice, at most, a recycling technique, and
that the remaining 43% practice 2 or 3 recycling techniques (see Annex 39).
As for the use of plastic bags, 57% indicate that in their homes they are used frequently or every day, 36%
that are used from time to time and the 7% that are never used (see Annex 40); An interesting result of the survey is
28 It is worth mentioning that the evaluation company has not been provided, within the relevant times, the databases or methodologies
of calculation of these indices, so the evaluation cannot issue a criterion regarding the calculation of these indices.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
That 79% of adolescents claim to have planted trees during the last two years (see Annex 41), is recommended
maintain and increase this frequency, developing reforestation campaigns, and continue to insist on the generation of
Environmental friendly habits, with strategies to strengthen the local population around action
Climatic, through training activities and instances that, on the one hand, sensitize more to the population regarding the
importance of caring for the environment and, on the other hand, develop knowledge and skills in people,
especially in the youngest, to redesign and repair equipment, reduce consumption, reuse, renew, recover
and recycle materials of all kinds effectively.
With regard to the economic situation of families, the post pandemic context has negatively affected
To families, during field work it has been very recurrent to listen to the neighborhood families and leaders
that the situation is very difficult in the neighborhood in particular and in the country in general, that there is no availability of sources of
employment and that income is no longer enough to meet basic needs; In the final implementation report of the
protection component, it is observed that the percentage of families with economic problems has increased
considerably, 21% in the baseline to 42% in the starting line, as well as the percentage of families that affirm
That their economic income is insufficient and failed to meet the needs, has increased by 17% in the
Baseline to 23% on the output line. (SEPA Foundation, 2023)
The economic aspect is essential for the sustainability of the model, and is transversal to all aspects and dynamics
relatives, so, an economically precarious situation could cause from the impossibility of paying
quarterly the rate rate provided by Cosmol, until the inability to acquire cleaning supplies
adequate as hand jaboncillo, also affecting the intrafamily relationships that can be damaged by the
economic concerns, and could even force NNA to leave school to devote themselves to some activity
remunerated, to financially support their parents; All these situations would result in violations to
NNA Rights.
As for the changes observed at the community and neighborhood, the most remarkable is the reorientation of the organization
Neighborhood, which had, at first, purely political ends, and the conclusion of the implementation of the program
presents objectives and instances committed to the rights of NNA, with the care of the environment and the
Violence prevention, this reorientation has been achieved from a permanent coordination between the partner
Local Foundation SEPA and the leadership of the neighborhood, has also been achieved from awareness processes and
Training to neighborhood leaders, both in issues related to protection and prevention of violence and in issues of
Environmental care.
The evaluation team has been able to verify in territory, through tours throughout the neighborhood and through interviews with the
technical team of the program, to neighborhood leaders and the same allocation population, as the neighborhood, as before
Program was isolated physical, socially, politically and economically from the rest of the municipality, currently presents
better conditions for integration, and has specific elements that have improved the NNA environment and
Resilience conditions at specific points.
It has been verified that the protection and environmental committees have been made up of the participation of the
Manzano delegates have recognition and legitimacy at the community level (through minutes of
recognition signed by the delegates), and with action plans that guide their functions. The component too
He has reported the formation of an education committee and another child development. (SEPA Foundation, 2023); also
It is worth mentioning the NNA network "Las Estrellas" that is empowered and active in the neighborhood, while the leaders
remain on the network, there are conditions for this group to continue to carry out activities, both in the defense of
NNA rights as in the care of the environment.
The Luciérnaga CDI, with the capacity to serve 50 girls and boys, has an agreement with the Santa Government
Cruz that guarantees its sustainability at least in the medium term, DNA Montero staff has been trained and,,
While there is no personnel rotation, the effects achieved in the attention of cases of violence with the mechanism
reference and contrary is also sustainable in the medium term; Likewise, the spare parts made to the
Infrastructure of the CDI, of the EU San Ramón de la Víbora, and to the public space are elements that remain as a
capital of the neighborhood at the conclusion of the program.
Among the pending aspects, the most important is citizen insecurity and perception of insecurity in the
neighborhood; With the data of the Survey to Convenient Families, a “indicator of perception of insecurity has been built
For NNA and for women, in the neighborhood and at school ”, combining five variables and structured in four categories,

The variables that have been considered have been the following: (i) frequency with which they find out of situations of violence
in the neighborhood; (ii) frequency with which they find out about situations of violence in their children's school; (iii) perception of
the improvement of security for NNA in the neighborhood; (iv) Perception of improving women's security in the neighborhood; and
(v) Perception of how serious is the problem of citizen insecurity in the neighborhood.
These variables have been dichotomized, assigning a value 1 to positive perception and value 0 (zero) to perception
negative, subsequently the values assigned to the five variables for each family surveyed have been added,
obtaining a scale from 0 to 5, where: (i) families that have a score 0 (zero) are those that have perception
more negative; (ii) those that add 1 or 2 have a partially negative perception; (iii) those that add 3 or 4 a perception
partially positive; and (iv) families that add up to 5 have the most positive perception.
The result of this exercise reveals that 38% of women have a negative perception of security for
NNA and women in the neighborhood and in school, another 38% has a partially negative perception, 17% a perception
partially positive, and 7% have a positive perception, in short, three quarters of the women consulted
They perceive that the NNA and Women's environment is insecure in the neighborhood and in school (see Annex 42).
However, within these variables, not all have the same perception by families, most of the
families29, approximately two thirds of them, perceive that there have been no improvements in the security offered by the
Neighborhood for NNA and Women, thus, two thirds of the exhibition considers that the problem of insecurity
Citizen in the neighborhood is a serious problem (on a scale of 0 to 7, they assign scores greater than 3); Instead, when
They are asked how often they find out situations of violence in the neighborhood or in the school of their children
proportion of families who find out frequently or every day is smaller, 13% and 26% respectively, in
This point is striking that women head of the family find out more frequently of situations of
Violence in the school of their children who of situations of violence in the neighborhood.
Women have been asked to have the family who scored, from 1 to 7, how serious they consider that they are
different problems within the neighborhood, and the result has been that, on average, all problems have received
A score greater than 3.5 that is the central score of the scale, this means that all problems
mentioned are considered serious, the most critical being the malfunction of justice, alcohol consumption
and violence against women, and the least critical (although with very little difference) the abuse against NNA, violence
youth and citizen insecurity (see Annex 44).
The final component implementation report indicates that, when the implementation starts, these problems were
even more serious (or at least this was perceived by the population), except in terms of drug trafficking and violence
youth that, from the point of view of the neighborhood, have worsened in recent years; There is also an effect
interesting of the intervention, and that is that the level of trust of the population in the public security system has
Improved, with the exception of the Ombudsman's Office and the Judicial System; The population currently trusts Slim,
Police, the Interior, the Municipal Guard, the Office of the Office of Children and Adolescents and the municipal government that makes
Three years ago. (SEPA Foundation, 2023)
At the political and institutional level, the program has generated important planning tools at the municipal level and
Political incidence at the departmental and national level, this battery is composed of: (i) the departmental policy of
Climate change of the GAD Santa Cruz 2021 - 2025; (ii) The Territorial Plan for Integral Development to Live well of the municipality
of Montero 2021 - 2025; (iii) The Municipal Water and Sainting Plan of Montero 2019 - 2030; (iv) the municipal plan of
Climate change with focus on children's rights of GAM Montero; (v) the Cosmol Sustainability Plan; (vi) the
Cosmol Prevention and Mitigation Plan; and (VII) the municipal childhood and adolescence plan, as main
Municipal policy planning tools.
These documents are the result of participatory planning processes, and have important strategic lines
of work in drinking water, basic sanitation, adaptation to climate change, with a focus on childhood rights;
However, structural aspects, of a macroeconomic nature, currently affect as a factor that limits the
Compliance with commitments assumed and established municipal policy goals, more specifically, the plan
Municipal de Agua y Sanitation de Montero raises the goal of building 3,000 mosafa until 2030, for which
had proposed the construction of 300 modules every year, and so far the municipality has not been able to specify the

Construction of a single module (although there is a commitment and budget for the construction of 25 mosafa during
management 2023).
This is largely due to the abrupt fall of municipal budgets after the Covid-19 pandemic; In the case
Del Gam Montero, the year 2020 its budget was reduced by 12.3% compared to the previous management, and 2021 was reduced 30.4%
Regarding 2020, as of 2022 the budget has been recovering slowly, in the order of 7.7% increase

45).
Finally, at the level of political incidence, the program has produced necessary materials, such as pieces of law and
Research and Systematization Studies that allow to support technical aspects of the model to authorities at the level
national and departmental; In interviews applied to VAPSB officials, AAPS and Senasba within the framework of this
evaluation, it has been possible to verify that they have a general knowledge of the model, identify the elements
central and innovative, such as the waste collection service by the EPSA and the closing model of the cycle of
nutrients, but do not identify specific aspects such as sustainability difficulties of the collection service of
waste, or the incorporation of the protection component (which frequently confuse with a management approach to
risks and not children's rights).
With regard to the closure of the nutrient cycle, an important element of the model that seeks to contribute to the
environmental and financial sustainability (through the sale of fertilizer obtained from the waste collected from the
Mosafa), there has been a favorable first experience, having reached a fertilizer production thirteen times
superior to the one estimated, which was used in arborization and reforestation tasks made by the GAMM;
A perfectly harmless fertilizer has not yet been obtained, so its use is not recommended in food crops.
What are the most significant changes perceived by the different actors of the system and how the program
Could it contribute to these?
One of the most significant changes identified, almost by all actors, is the improvement in the quality of life of the
Families who have received a mosaf
spotted testimonies, both by recipients and by leaders, and even cosmol technicians and authorities
municipal, are very explicit regarding the precariousness in which families did their needs before counting
with its module; In all cases the quality of infrastructure and equipment, families,
Particularly women are very grateful.
From a more subjective approach, there are several informants who mention that there have been significant changes
In the self -esteem of families that have benefited from a mosafa, precisely because the conditions of
health precariousness prior to the implementation of the program were extreme and currently the perception of the
benefit generated by this equipment is very positive; It has also been mentioned that adolescents have
Improved self -esteem, product of the different activities (especially artistic - creative) carried out in the
resilient school program frame, but also thanks to the implementation of an assistance service
Free psychological that adolescents valued a lot.
Another significant change that identifies the informants has to do with the changes of habits and attitudes, in
Different aspects, on the one hand they mention the habits learned in terms of garbage management, savings of the
water and care of the environment, but changes in attitudes are also mentioned, especially the
younger (teenagers) both in the family environment, where they are more respectful and collaborators, and
In the educational field, where they are more tolerant and also respectful in front of the classmates,
particularly during its menstruation days.
In this same line, the change in attitude, both of fathers and mothers, and
teachers and educational community in general, regarding addressing issues related to menstruation in
The educational units, being that initially, especially mothers and fathers, they showed some
resistance to their daughters talk about this subject at school, currently MHM's theme is addressed
successfully in educational units.
At the level of municipal authorities and technicians, it is considered that the most significant changes in implementation
They have to do with the environmental benefit generated by water saving, originated in the implementation of mosafa
47

and the impact on public health, on the decrease in infectious gastrointestinal diseases, especially in
Nna; However, they also recognize that there is no hard evidence regarding these impacts, since not
Impact studies in the environment and public health have been carried out, as a result of the implementation of the
Mosafa
Finally, it is worth mentioning what are the aspects that adolescents value more as changes
significant, since its optics and its problem is different from that of adults. Adolescents feel
that they have improved their social skills, their self -esteem and that violence in school (bullyng) has been reduced,
They also state that they have improved their knowledge on topics that are of their direct interest, including the
MHM theme and the theme of environmental care.
The authorities and technicians consulted emphasize the environmental benefit of the model, which is observed
in the savings and care of water resource and in the prevention of environmental risks and disasters; So, they point out
that there is a social benefit regarding savings in the payment of the rate linked to this type of ecological systems that
It is less than the rate linked to a conventional system of drinking water and sanitary sewerage. These considerations,
They have not so far backed through a formal analysis, it is advisable to develop an investigation
on the environmental impact generated by the mosafa and the integral model.
The authorities and technicians also identify the favorable impact on the health of the population, especially the most
small, as another of the main and most important effects generated by the program, although it is also indicated
that there is no serious impact study of this type of projects on public health and that is necessary
do it; It is advisable to implement monitoring mechanisms to the health status of the recipient families in
The framework of the program, in the case of possible replicas, since the health centers, especially in areas
peri -urban, they are precarious and do not have means or resources to do this monitoring, or to keep a record
rigorous.
From the point of view of authorities and technicians, the impact observed on the quality of life of families
Recipient is evident, because they go from doing their needs in conditions of great unhealthiness and discomfort, of
reduced security and dignity, to have health modules that have all the necessary services (
Bathroom, urinary, shower, sink) and with bio-jardin for gray water reuse.
Another significant change observed by technicians and
“… There is a big difference in sitting on two woods, with
Authorities, in Montero and Cobija, is that the population
risk of falling and with everything fétida that is a latrine in the

dwelling. Blanket)
Another effect observed by authorities and technicians is the change of some habits and practices, they point out that there is a
Better garbage management in the Guadalupe II neighborhood thanks to the different instances of information, training and
sensitization carried out, less garbage thrown into the streets is observed, families have learned to separate
its garbage and deposit it in differentiated dumps and not to burn it, which was a frequent practice before the
intervention.
The leaders and members of the committees believe that the most significant changes are those related to the
Improvement in the quality of life of families that were benefited with mosafa; They also point out that another effect
Visible has been that people have changed their negative and distrust attitudes30, for more proactive attitudes;
30 Since its creation, the Guadalupe II neighborhood has been characterized by the defensive position of its leadership and its general population, position
that it is created, as mentioned, from the illegal taking of properties belonging to the armed forces of Bolivia, therefore these
families have faced all the time to the possibility of taking their properties to return them to the State; This situation has
configured to a distrustful population, especially in front of external visitors.

They also emphasize that the work of installation of drains and drains carried out in apple trees are very
significant because they have had an impact on the reduction of floods and flooded streets; in addition,
They state that the benefits generated with the installation of the nursery are very significant for mothers that
Before they had where to leave their children, and even for the members of the committee, who as educators use in
Some moment the CDI facilities to perform workshops.
The adolescents interviewed indicate that the most significant changes they have experienced with the
Program implementation, they have to do with the increase in their self -esteem and their social capacities, with
changes in their behaviors and attitudes with respect to others, because they state that they have learned to be more
tolerant and to live with their peers in a more harmonious way, they point out that before the program there were violence and
"Bullying" at school, and now that has reduced a lot.
They also point out that their perception regarding the care of the environment has changed, they have learned the importance
of not throwing garbage anywhere and recycling and reusing everything you can; They think they have changed their habits
related to the use of water, that the knowledge taught at school (within the framework of the school program
Resilient) have taken them to their respective houses and the other members of their families have learned from them to
Economize water and not waste it.
In the case of women's adolescents, the most important change they mention is that they can now speak with more
trust and knowledge about their menstruation, and that they have learned to use reusable hygienic towels, and that this
It implies a contribution of your part to the care of the environment and also an aid in the economic aspect, because they spend
Less to buy disposable wipes.
NNA leaders and leaders indicate that they have experienced "a mental change", as they began to reason
different from several issues, especially regarding water and environment care, and regarding how
help more in their homes; They also state that the program has allowed them to generate social skills, to lose the
shyness and acquire artistic skills.
One of the leaders, representative of the Municipal Committee of NNA, indicates that the psychological assistance program has had
an important impact, both on a personal level, because it allowed him to become aware of how important it is to have a
good mental health, as at the level of their school classmates, several of them with communication problems with their
parents, who also agreed to help and psychological guidance.
Mosafa's recipient families consider that the greatest benefit has been generated by the modules that have
Improved hygiene and health conditions in their homes, they also point out that the installation of the nursery has been
One of the most important elements of the program.
The recipient women of the protection component point out that the attitude changes they have witnessed in their
sons and daughters, now more respectful and collaborators than before, is the most significant effect that the program has left,
as well as the improvement in their intrafamily relationships, which have gone from being chaotic and violent, to be of greater tolerance
and respect; They also mention the installation of mosafa as part of the most important changes that have
experienced, since the above conditions were too precarious and now, with the modules, they are more
Comfortable, and they are no longer afraid to go to the bathroom as they felt before.
The directors of educational units and teachers, highlight that the respect that children now demonstrate
For their partners, particularly when they are with their menstruation, it is one of the most significant changes
that they have observed, because before the implementation they made fun and bothered their companions, by
ignorance and lack of empathy; They also point out that another important change has been seen in the attitude of many and
Many moms and dads that initially did not agree that the school is talked about in menstruation,
But in the end they have understood that this is a natural process, that you should not be ashamed to talk about it and that so much
Girls as boys should know these processes.
As education professionals, the implementation of the program has also meant for them a level change
staff, since before the implementation they had assumptions and prejudices, that the students,
Fathers and mothers would not accept to talk about menstruation, however there has been a massive participation,
even beyond the educational units of intervention (as it has been reached, with the radial program “the world of
Rosita ”to the entire municipality) and a great interest in the subject.

Another important change that they observe at the neighborhood level is that no garbage is seen anywhere, the processes
training in recycling and environmental care issues, added to the installation of garbage dumps in
Different points of the neighborhood, has resulted in it is cleaner.
They consider that there has been an awareness, by students and families, regarding water, because it has been
implemented experiential activities, in which students have known the entire process and the route that must
Follow water, from aquifers to the school or home tap, have visited the water treatment plant,
and in this way they have learned to value it and take care of it.
5.2 Relevance
To what extent did the program take into account the needs and requests of the beneficiaries and respond properly
To current challenges and needs, with a prospective perspective on the future of the Wash sector in the country?
The review documentation of the program, as well as secondary information sources and informants testimonies
key and recipient population of the PSSDU, provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the program has
taken into account the needs and requests of the recipients, of the municipal governments and actors
local (neighborhood organizations and educational communities) in regard to: (i) extension of the coverage of
Basic sanitation in areas for a long time excluded and with physical limitations for the installation/expansion of
sanitary sewerage systems; (ii) adoption of hygiene practices that improve the general state of health of the
population, mainly of NNA; (iii) provision of mosaafa maintenance service by EPSA; (IV)
NNA care need; (v) Interpellation of social and taboos stereotypes around menstruation in the
student population and in families in general; (VI) Reduction of the incidence of domestic violence,
mainly against NNA and against women; and (vii) availability of greater and better resources to respond
For climate change, mainly floods.
The waste collection service provided by the EPSA (Cosmol in the case of Montero), is one of the elements of the
Model better valued, this service is suitable for the social, environmental and sustainability context of the
system.
There is no clear evidence regarding the availability to be paid (DAP), high or low, of families for collect services
of waste currently lends cosmol, this evidence should be generated from an objective technical study,
Made by an independent entity, in order to determine the relevance of the collection of the current rate of 39 Bs.

The residents of the Guadalupe II neighborhood, in general, do not know the BES technology and the most frequent solution mode
Health is the latrine with water drag and the blind well; While the PSSDU provides a satisfactory solution for the
Need for basic sanitation, natural demand for Bes technology is reduced.
Ph/MHM school programs are valued as very useful, therefore, adequate and relevant, no

The basic sanitation coverage deficit is a latent problem in rural and peri -urban area at the national level; while
Drinking water coverage has had an important advance in recent years, basic sanitation has been
approximately 43% stagnant in rural areas (UNICEF, 2018). To this is added the permanent threat of
natural disasters as a consequence of climate change, which is an element that is currently managed by form
Transversal at all levels of public policy.
The program has raised an alternative response to sanitation coverage expansion needs
Improved basic in the municipality of Montero, a city with about 26,400 homes, where about 1% has coverage
With dry ecological baths (BES), 36% have coverage with sanitary sewer and 63% have precarious solutions
through latrines, septic chambers and blind wells (Gam Montero, 2018); This situation compromises the safety of
aquifers and water reservoirs in the municipality. The objectives of the program coincide with the GAM priorities
Montero, in terms of expansion of basic sanitation coverage - with the purpose of protecting the environment
and the water sources of the municipality - embodied in the strategic lines of the water and sanitation plan and the most
recent PTDI.
The program is aligned with several specific objectives of the Water and Sanitation Plan of GAM Montero, among which are
points out: (i) expand the coverage of unconventional sanitation, considering the closure of the treatment cycle of the
waste; (ii) Promote hygiene promotion programs (pH) and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) in units
educational and other entities; and (iii) propose technical, social and institutional policies to promote a service of
sustainable sanitation, incorporating all technological possibilities, among which is mentioned: the sewer
Conventional and condominial sanitary, dry organic baths and latrines with water drag into a septic chamber. (Gam
Montero, 2018).
The Municipal Plan has scheduled investments “to meet the 100% needs of the population in drinking water
and 95% in basic sanitation until 2030. By 2025 the expected situation is to have 98% water coverage
potable and 65% in basic sanitation ”(Gam Montero, 2018); in turn, the PTDI of the municipality raises among its policies and
Strategic guidelines: “Expand and improve the coverage of basic services in quantity and quality, mainly
Sewer Networks. ”(Gam Montero, 2020)
In the case of Cobija, the program has provided an alternative of basic sanitation solution in an environment in which the
Urban spot has expanded uncontrollably, passing, in the period of 10 years, from 30 to 68 neighborhoods, a situation that
has caused a huge deficit in basic sanitation coverage, especially in the recent neighborhoods
occupation.
The integral approach of the program has sought to respond to the needs of a population that has historically
remained outside the appropriate hygiene knowledge and practices, in this way the program has been oriented to
improve the general health conditions of the recipient population, to dignify their lifestyle and improve
Conditions for accessibility to health services especially to children and adolescent population, with emphasis on women
adolescents (with the menstrual hygiene management component).
Basic sanitation coverage problems are presented much more frequently in areas
peri -urban; Both in the case of Montero and Cobija, the neighborhoods prioritized by the program arise from
illegal settlements, which over time have sought to legitimize themselves to access the rights and benefits of
the regularization of the proprietary law; This situation has caused families in these areas to have
remained for a long time excluded from municipal policy, since municipal governments do not have
Competition to make investments in areas whose legal situation is not sanitized.

Although, the situation of these settlements is not legal or recognized by the respective municipal governments, it should not
lose sight of the fact that drinking water and basic sanitation are human rights, and families settled in these
areas often have girls and young boys, becoming populations of high vulnerability. It is for
This that the program is relevant regarding its contribution to respond to the needs of the population long
postponed in these areas, as the neighbors of the Guadalupe II (Montero) neighborhood that participated in one
of the workshops held:
“… In this neighborhood we had no support from any of the authorities we have here in the municipality, because
We were in rural area, we were not within the urban stain, so the authorities did not
They had that possibility of helping us, and that is why we, all the things that are seen here, we have done with
Our own agreement, with our own contribution, therefore I believe that the support of the
Institutions… ”(neighbor Barrio Guadalupe II of the municipality of Montero)
“… Before the program arrives… there was practically no institution that supports us, so it did not enter or
The Mayor's Office, or from the Government, nothing absolutely, we did not have any kind of support before
program… ”(neighbor of the Guadalupe II neighborhood of the municipality of Montero)
The waste collection service provided by the EPSA (Cosmol in the case of Montero), is one of the elements of the
most prominent model by the executing team, by local partners, by public entities, for the financier and for
The recipients. It is worth mentioning that dry bath technology is not new in the country, there are experiences
of projects, both public and cooperation, which sought to expand the basic sanitation coverage in areas
rural installing dry bathroom31, but most of these projects failed, to a large extent, because the
maintenance and final disposal of waste fell to the recipient families, shortly after having received their
modules, families faced difficulties to continue keeping them operational, closed them, and returned to the
previous practices that demanded less work, and the modules became, in most cases, in
deposits.
With this antecedent, the program has relevant the stool collection strategy in charge of the EPSA,
On the one hand, because it is the competence of the EPSA to carry out this collection, but also because the families are not found
in the possibility of performing the proper maintenance and disposition of the feces in a particular way, therefore, this
Service is suitable for the social, environmental and sustainability context of the system.
The evaluation team has found indications, in the interviews with Cosmol officials and in conversations with
Neighborhood leaders, difficulties in the population to pay the rate for basic sanitation and water services
potable (these services are charged in the same invoice), also, in the performance reports of the EPSA as
The AAPS publishes, a sustained fall is identified (in the last five years) of the collection efficiency of Cosmol32,
what should also be considered an indication of the difficulties currently faced by families to pay for
Drinking and sanitation water services.
On the other hand, the program implementing team states that there is an availability to be paid for the services of
collection of waste, however, since the rate is for this service integrated to that of drinking water, it is not possible to identify
If the availability to be paid by families is for one of the services and not for the other. In short, there is no clear evidence
Regarding the availability to be paid (DAP), high or low, of families for the waste collection services
Currently cosmol, this evidence should be generated from an objective technical study, conducted by an entity
independent, in order to determine the relevance of the collection of the current rate of 39 Bs. Quarterly by the services of
collection of waste.
31 Bolivia has implemented public decentralized sanitation policies using Bes technology, with the support of institutions
Internationals such as the Inter -American Development Bank (IDB), the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation
(AECID) through the Spanish Fund for Water and Sanitation Cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean (Fecasalc), among others, having
Built more than 5,000 bes in rural communities, remote and scattered since 2000. Another similar or greater number were built
by NGOs financed by international cooperation, which has not only invested in rural areas but also in peri -urban areas, including
You can appoint Procade, Adra, Water for Popple, Aguatuya, Sumaj Huasi Foundation, Bibosi, among others.
32 The last AAPS performance report available, indicates that Cosmol presents a sustained fall in its collection efficiency
Since 2018, and is quite below the optimal parameter, reaching 47.4% when it should be higher than or equal to 90.0%. (AAPS,
2021)

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
As for the cultural/idiosyncratic relevance of dry bath technology (BES) the evaluation team has verified
In the field that the residents of the Guadalupe II neighborhood, in general, they do not know the BES technology and the most frequent modality
of sanitary solution is the latrine with water drag 33; It has not been possible to identify a single private initiative, of
some family that has built a kiss with their own means; Also, the MSSDU establishes, as the first phase
For its implementation, the generation of demand for mosafa, therefore, although the model provides a solution
Satisfactory for the need for basic sanitation, natural demand for Bes technology is reduced.
In interviews conducted and in the program documentation, school programs of
PH/MHM as very useful, therefore, adequate and relevant, not only for the student population but for the
general population, as students are important replicators of the EU knowledge in the EU
These themes. Teaching staff identifies ignorance and prejudices around menstruation as
problems that the program sought to respond, based on informative processes and awareness oriented to
Student population:
“The issue that in other years was taboo, the issue of menstrual hygiene management, is one of the main issues that
It was treated in the educational unit ... it was emphasized that children have to learn to respect this phenomenon that
It is something that occurs in their own homes, with their own mothers… ”(Director EU Guabirá Don Bosco)
“Even in our environment we continue to have a kind of care, fear, of taboo regarding what this is
so important information that our students need [menstrual hygiene management], ladies and
The men who are in this age, which also are part of the biological state of each of the people ... "
(Director EU Villa Cruz)
Regarding the protection component, the program has sought to contribute to reducing violence rates against
NNA and against women, especially intrafamily, has also sought to identify and respond to different
forms of violation of NNA rights and has been identified, based on the physical component - that is, focusing the
Protection actions in recipient families of the health modules - different vulnerabilities in NNA and women
from the neighborhood.
In the baseline that rose at the start of this component, information about different aspects was relieved
related to the socioeconomic level, knowledge, perceptions and practices of families and adolescents
Selected for the intervention, this baseline revealed that families, very often, met to
talk and plan aspects that involve harmonic survival, development and coexistence at home, this is
A key aspect from which it was raised as an intervention strategy, the development of development plans
familiar.
The women's recipients of the program recognize that before the intervention different types of violence were lived in
Their homes and that the implementation of the PSSDU protection component has allowed them to identify and make visible
These situations and begin to improve parenting and relationship patterns between families members:
“… Sometimes one went to the family where the children were mistreated, they made them work from an early age and that
Since the farta families were elaborated, both in the treatment of the children of one, and
to see and be able to guide other families. " (Neighbor of the Guadalupe II neighborhood of the Municipality e Montero)
“… Towards our children who are already young people who rebelled against the parents, in that I fed up with me because
Twice that I brought my girl fed up, her character was very strong, but the orientation they gave her
Here in Caritas fed up he helped him reflect… ”(Neighbor of the Friendship neighborhood of the municipality of Cobija)
33 Although it has not been included in the survey ballot or in the interview guidelines, aspects related to idiosyncrasy or, to the pride that
Families feel regarding the use of Laterinas BIS, compared to families that have drag latrine, the evaluation team has
came to show during field work and during the Evaluation Mission in Territory, which: (i) the most frequent modality of
Sanitation in the neighborhood (approximately 90% of families) are traditional latrines and blind wells, an important proportion of these,
According to what was stated by the neighborhood leadership, they are in poor condition, but there are also some families that have lyricas in
Very good condition; (ii) There are no families who, autonomously and with their own resources, have built bes in their homes, only
There are some kisses from previous implementations from other NGOs that worked in the neighborhood several years ago; and (iii) the masons
And builders available in the market, do not know Bes technology, this is another important reason why families cannot install
This type of sanitation autonomously; So, practically all families who have not benefited from a
Mosafa are unaware of the type of Bes technology or have only a very superficial knowledge of their existence.

Finally, with regard to the climate change component, one of the main interests of GAM Montero has
It was to reduce the consumption of water in educational units within the municipality, both for an economic issue, put
That, according to GAMM informants, the payment of services represents about one million Bolivians per year for the
Municipality, as in the sense of care of the environment and responsible water management.
In the participating educational units, the need for students to have
adequate knowledge and techniques of adaptation to climate change, mainly in risk prevention, and about
All of promoting a change of perspective regarding their personal relationship with the environment and with Mother Earth, from
of the implementation of gardens, recycling techniques, water savings, energy savings among others.
Within the Guadalupe II neighborhood, floods are identified as the main threat caused by factors
climatic, in this case by the rains, which prevent the normal displacement of the neighbors through certain streets,
Even now, after several actions were implemented that improved this type of vulnerability, in certain
Manzanos faces this type of contingency:
"Well before the neighborhood did not have such a help in the environmental part ... for example, our street
Water flood [I used to be in the rainy season], then there was no support ... ”(Member of the Committee
Environmental, Barrio Guadalupe II of the municipality of Montero)
“… You couldn't even walk, and so far there are streets that cannot be walking when it rains, because it is like like that
One walks and wants to fall, rather that the entrance to the school has felt fed up with what they have done
ripiar, and rather you can, because teachers also stayed halfway with the mud until the
knee… ”(Member of the Environmental Committee, Guadalupe II neighborhood of the municipality of Montero)
To what extent the strategic objectives and approaches of the models (urban sanitation, childhood protection and
climate change) of PSSDU implementation are well adapted to the national/ subnational/ local context?
The strategic approaches of the models are aligned to the context of public policy at the national and local level,
especially with regard to: (i) the strategic needs of the Bolivian state to reach the goals
Defined in the PDES, 2025 Agenda and ODS; (ii) The need for extension of sanitation coverage
decentralized (projecting a solution for 18% of the need for coverage that the municipality has through
Bes technology until 2030); and (iii) the ability of the mosafa to adapt to any ecological floor and climate.
The context of institutional weakness and fragility of political stability is one of the most difficult aspects to which
The implementation has had to adapt, on which there is no control, but has had the ability to
internalize it; Given this context of instability, the strength of neighborhood leaderships and organic structure,
Specifically in the Guadalupe II neighborhood, it is an element that has been well used by the Anclaje program
of the intervention.
The adaptation capacity of the Integral Protection of Children and Adolescents and Adolescents and
climate resilience within the framework of the PSSDU, because it is a modular character program, which may well
It is implemented within the framework of the PSSDU, but also in that of other interventions from other sectors or in a way
independent; You can also implement different subcomponents partially or total, depending on the
context and characteristics of the population.
The model raised by the PSSDU adapts to the strategic needs of the Bolivian State, since, to arrive
At the levels of basic sanitation coverage established in the PDES, 2025 and SDG, it is necessary to have
Alternative systems to conventional sanitary sewer, since it does not adapt to all types of territory and, in addition,
Its cost of implementation is very high, so it would need amounts of money that the country does not have to reach
the desired coverage levels; With a decentralized sanitation model it is possible to reach territories that
They have reduced water resource, or that have high slopes, or rocky terrain, or scattered homes, among others
Characteristics of peri -urban and rural areas, and in addition, the cost of implementation is less than the systems of
conventional sanitary sewer.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
The year 2018 was developed the Municipal Water and Sanitation Plan of Montero 2019 - 203034, this document identifies
The needs for improvement of water coverage and sanitary sewerage, and is also considered the need
To improve the coverage of dry bathrooms, the commitment to build 3 thousand dry baths until the year is reflected in this plan
2030 (GAM Montero, 2018), and to continue betting on the work of awareness, promotion of hygiene and management of
menstrual hygiene in educational units; In this sense, there is also a clear link with the model with the
municipal planning.
This plan also considers the need to expand and rehabilitate latrines with water drag with septic chamber, such as
An alternative that allows the municipality to advance in its goals regarding basic sanitation coverage; this is
important to mention, since, in terms of adaptation, no longer of the program but of the model, to the local context
and of municipal policy, it must be taken into account that the 3 thousand kiss committed to the GAM until 2030 represent
18% of the more than 16 thousand homes that at this time do not have a sanitary sewer in Montero and that, in
A majority of cases, have a precarious health solution; In this sense, the model would be providing a
Potential 18% solution of the need for coverage that the municipality has and would not be contemplating a solution to
The remaining 82.
The program executing team highlights certain actions that have meant an effort to improve the level of
PSSDU adaptation to the context of subnational and national public policy, as is the case with the three Wash Bat35
carried out: (i) an initial one of only Montero; (ii) Another intervention evaluation in Montero and initial of Santa Cruz
(in order to identify a municipality of replica); and (iii) the last nationally; A municipal summit was also held
of water and sanitation in Montero with the support of UNICEF.
The municipalities in which the program has intervened are in the Amazon area of the country (Montero and Cobija),
Therefore its climate is tropical, high temperatures and considerable levels of environmental humidity, therefore, the
fact of not having basic sanitation in these areas implies serious risks to public health (greater than in
other more temperate or cold regions and with lower levels of environmental humidity), since the so -called "gutters",
which are the channels in which the sewage is usually seen, in these climatic conditions they become focuses
of infection of various diseases and in mosquito farms, which are the vector that transmits dengue, a
very present disease in tropical regions; In this sense, the solutions posed by the model to needs
Basic sanitation are well adapted to the country's Amazon region.
It is worth mentioning that mosafa, as a central element of the model, can adapt to any ecological floor and
any climate; Probably, in regions of the sub -Andean valleys or the highlands, there are no problems with hatcheries
of mosquitoes and with the proliferation of dengue, but it is equally desirable to have sanitation systems that
reduce the contamination of surface water, of the water table, of the food from the flies and
Other vectors, among many other aspects that can be patiated or resolved with sanitation implementation
improved; In cold and dry areas, there could be the advantage that stool dries faster than in areas
Wet, which could favor the fertilizer production process from this waste.
It is perceived, among the authorities of the central level, that municipal governments do not completely assume responsibility
to monitor and control the work of the respective drinking water services and basic sanitation operators,
In the specific case of Montero, a tense relationship between Cosmol and the GAM is perceived. The program has worked
strengthening institutional capacities, within EPSA and GAM, this is an element that has been relevant
to contribute to improving the abilities of institutions to fulfill their responsibilities and to improve the
inter -institutional relationships, but also to improve the scenario in which they must last instances that
They will provide sustainability for the purposes of the program, such as neighborhood and community committees.
34 The Municipal Water and Sanitation Plan (PMAS) of the municipality of Montero has been a collective construction led by the GAM, with
Participation of Cosmol, Local Entities, Health and Education Services, the 3 Potable Water and Sanitation Committees (Capys), the
Cooperation, and validated at a water fair and a massive workshop, with all the actors. This degree of participation of the different actors and
of the general population, he gave (to the plan) high legitimacy.
35 are meetings that bring together key actors in the sector in order to develop processes of participatory analysis of the problem of
ASEH. The Wash Bat tool “analyzes the complex interaction of institutional structures and processes that determine the effectiveness with which
Human, material and financial supplies become sustainable access to the supply of drinking water and sanitation. Provides a
rational approach based on evidence to formulate an investment strategy for multiple sectoral objectives of efficiency, equity and
sustainability." (UNICEF, 2023 b)

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
The context of institutional weakness and fragile political stability, influences institutional structures and
Synchronization that must exist among EPSA, social organizations, institutions and municipal governments; In great
measure, this synchrony, depends on the political situation, which is not always suitable for inter -institutional coordination,
but is mediated by political interests nationwide, being able to jeopardize the endurance of
results obtained with the intervention; It is worth mentioning that, when the program has supported the elaboration of the plan
Municipal de Agua y Sanitation (PMAS) of Montero, has begun with the socialization of municipal competences
In Ays, thanks to this, it was possible to work in coordinated actions between the GAM and the EPSA, although its managers were (and
They are still) of different political trends.
However, little is what can be done to modify the scenario of political polarization in this
moment in the country, this should be considered as an assumption of the model, on which there is no control but that
It must be taken into account and internalized.
Regarding the Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents and Climate Resilience within the framework of the PSSDU,
value positively, not only the way in which it has adapted to the context of the Guadalupe II neighborhood - with the
Implementation of a contingency plan against the Covid-19 pandemic, with the elaboration and implementation of
individualized family development plans for each family, with the use of available infrastructure
in the neighborhood for the installation and commissioning of a Child Development Center (CDI) or with the realization of
Social and environmental base diagnoses, which allowed concrete mitigation and change adaptation plans
Climate, among several other actions well adapted to the context - but also the adaptability of the model.
This comprehensive protection and climate resilience model has the characteristic of being modular, that is, it can
It is implemented, both within the framework of the PSSDU, as in the framework of other programs, not necessarily of sanitation,
but also from other sectors and independently; Likewise, some subcomponents of the
model in certain contexts and in response to certain needs, and in others not, depending on the local context and
the needs of the population.
Finally, although, within the framework of the PSSDU, because it is a demonstrative intervention and by the limitation
of resources, it is understood that in Montero the model has been implemented in a dispersed way in the territory (the route
de Campo revealed that between 1 and 6 mosafa per Manzano have been built, in a total of 27 apple trees inside the neighborhood
Guadalupe II), the results and effects that are expected to be achieved with the model, require an integral intervention
In territorial terms, that is, at the public policy level, the implementation of the model in
full neighborhoods and not in a dispersed way.
The main reason for this recommendation is that the effects on public health will be optimal to the extent that all
The homes of a certain neighborhood or sector or district implement improved sanitation solutions, since,
Even if a few families continue to defecate in the open, or in superficial holes, the contamination of the waters
superficial, or of the groundwater layers of the soil, or the generation of spotlights of infection and proliferation of vectors and
infectious diseases, will continue to be present in a certain territory, even if most families have
opted for an improved sanitation option.
Within the framework of the PSSDU, the climate change component has intervened with a territorial logic, in the case of the
Protection component has been intervened, both at the territorial and family level, in this case it is desirable that
All families in a certain neighborhood or territory can benefit, to a different extent and according to their
needs, of the protection component; Finally, the Wash component has intervened fundamentally at the level
familiar with the implementation of the mosafa, but it also has subcomponents that have a character
territorial, such as decomes or implementation of the feces collection service and the treatment plant, which can
benefit from the generation of costs at scale and reduction of fixed costs, with the implementation of the model at the level
territorial.

indicators partially completed are those of strengthening the EPSA for the closure of the nutrient cycle and the
implementation of environmental protocols in the EPSA, both were implemented only in Cosmol, due to
that the collection service in Cobija has not yet been implemented; the case care indicator through
Reference and reference mechanisms in the Montero DNA has not been achieved by very little.
Finally, the OE 4 has all its compliments; These are referred to training professionals and technicians
on policies, norms, guides and other sector instruments, with the implementation of the diploma on services of
Water, sanitation and hygiene, the indicators referring to the elaboration of the document of
systematization of the model, the elaboration of pieces of law, the generation of spaces for dialogue, the subscription of
Agreements to provide technical assistance services for the development of the program nationwide.
Finally, the indicators on the elaboration of an investment impact study are also considered fulfilled
in family programs and the presentation of a public policy proposal on protection and strengthening
families at the instances of the central government; However, it is important to note that the document that, as
commented from the protection team, it is considered valid for this indicator, given an existing agreement between the
Program and financier, corresponds to a systematization of family strengthening programs, and not to a
Impact study of investment in this type of programs36.
To what extent have the strategies, approaches and operational methods of the models developed by the
Program (urban sanitation, childhood protection and climate change) to the achievement of the expected results?
Based on the reviewed documentation, the interviews applied to key informants and recipients, as well as
The survey of beneficiary families, it can be asserted that the strategies, approaches and operational methods of each
component of the PSSDU have allowed to achieve the expected results with a level of effectiveness that, although it has not
been optimal, that is, the 100% compliance has not been reached in all indicators - mainly due to
context factors that have limited the actions and achievement of some results - has been within the
Expectations established in planning instruments, that is, the logical framework and TDC.
The strategy of implementing the three components jointly has resulted in the generation of
Batteries of benefits for families and neighborhoods (territorial units) and public policy packages for
municipalities, providing conditions to generate comprehensive changes in the short and medium term, at the individual level,
family, community and institutional. It is advisable, to seek integrality in the implementation of the MSSDU, no
only at the sector level, which is already given by the design, but also in terms of assisted population and approach
territorial.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
The first result that leaves the implementation of the PSSDU in the Guadalupe II neighborhood is a sanitation system
Decentralized demonstrative in operation, composed of 77 mosaf
the waste collection service by Cosmol and the treatment plant37. Of a sample of 44 homes
benefited with mosaafa visited within the framework of the evaluation, access and verification was allowed to 38, and in all the
cases have been found that they have fully operational modules (of which at least 86.3% of
The modules are operating properly) 38, also, of 47 families surveyed 41 point to have been trained
In hygiene habits (it can be inferred that 87.2% of the program recipients of the program have received training in
PH/mhm).
Sector authorities highlight two important elements of the model that have influenced the results achieved: the
first than the EPSA (cosmol in the case of Montero) is in charge of the removal of solid sludge and waste, since
The experience of installation of dry baths in other locations in the country has shown that the population cannot be done
Sustainable position of the maintenance of these units. It is indicated in the TDC that the waste collection service
It must be sustainable to move to the following levels, that is, the desired changes in the short, medium and long term,
In this regard, there are observations to the sustainability of this service, as will be seen in the corresponding section.
The second element is that mosafa technology allows minimizing the emission of bad odors. The experience
of other dry bath technologies has revealed that the emission of bad odors in this type of
Health solutions, a situation that dissuades the population to use them. In this sense, in 76.3% of the 38 mosafa
inspected no smell of feces or urine was perceived, but a smell of urine was perceived in 7.9% and the smell of feces in the
15.8% of cases, in these modules, little adequate uses of the module were detected (the stool in the cup did not count
With sufficient drying material, the cup cover remained open and/or fecal matter was observed at the edges or
surroundings of the cup); Therefore, although technology minimizes the emission of bad odors, the use made by families
of these modules is essential to maintain the comfort and good condition of the mosafa, an aspect that is
Recommended reinforce at least a room of the families visited.
In educational units, training and awareness activities referring to menstrual hygiene management are valued
and promotion of hygiene in general, with adolescents of both sexes and fathers and mothers, the
permanent coordination and involvement of program personnel that were in charge of this component,
Reference is also made to the radiovela produced and the exchange instances between different
Educational units that allowed to share experiences and reach greater audiences with the topics of interest.
The result that could not be achieved in this component was the construction of mosafa by the GAM, with resources
municipal; At the end of this evaluation there is a commitment from the municipality of Montero de
build 25 mosaafa, and even the public bidding process would have started, and to build 36 mosaf
Gam Cobija. The main cause for not having achieved this result, responds to the budgetary limitations of
The GAM, accentuated by the Covid-19 health emergency crisis, which triggered an economic deceleration
at the national (and world) level, which, of course, has also affected municipal governments in their availability of
resources; The GAMM has allocated 490 thousand Bs. In the 2023 management for the construction of 25 mosafa, equivalent to 0.26%
of its annual budget, and the Gam Cobija does not register a specific item, although it has budgeted to invest 700 thousand
Bs. In strengthening the EPSA. (SIGEP, 2023)
The second observed result is the strengthening of neighborhood and educational communities within the neighborhood
Guadalupe II, in terms of NNA protection and violence prevention; Through field visits, tours of
the neighborhood and interviews with neighborhood leadership and the same allocation, it has been observed that the neighborhood already
had a solid organic structure before the implementation of the PSSDU (precisely this organicity has been
a factor that has facilitated, in several aspects, the execution of activities in the neighborhood), but that the purposes and motivations
For this organization they were of a political nature, while, with the implementation of the program these purposes have
gone gradually, around the rights and interests of NNA, to the care of the environment, the management of
risks and health promotion within the neighborhood.
37 According to program reports, Cosmol would be providing the waste collection service to 141 families in total.
38 The refusal of some families to be verified in person the operation of their mosafa, in this case of 13.6% of families
beneficiaries visited, it could be due to the fact that it is not operating properly or directly is not being used by the family.

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
Some tangible results that this component leaves in favor of the neighborhood, particularly the NNA population, are: (i)
a formed protection committee; (ii) a strengthened NNA network (Las Estrellas Group); (iii) a development center
Infant (nursery) with capacity for 50 girls and boys in operation (Luceérnaga CDI); (IV) District DNA (District 2)
in operation; (v) DNA officials trained in the reference and reference system; and (vi) a camera
Gesell adequate and equipped in the Montero Prosecutor's Office, in addition to trained personnel in its use; is attached in the annex
48 of this document A detail of the results achieved in this component. (Salinas, 2022)
The Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents and Climate Resilience in the framework of the PSSDU has reached
These results through a methodology that has sought to be integral, addressing actions from four
Strategy: (i) Development and implementation of family development plans for 45 families in a situation of
vulnerability, the majority benefited from the mosafa installation; (ii) strengthening of community leadership to
the prevention of violence and conflict resolution with gender and culturally adapted approach; (III)
Strengthening of the resilience of NNA from artistic and cultural activities that allowed them to acquire
life skills; and (iv) strengthening child protection services through specific interventions
in the DNA and other children's services. (Salinas, 2022)
The results of the survey to allocation families attract attention regarding the perception of the neighborhood regarding
to the citizen insecurity in the neighborhood, specifically of the mothers of home surveyed who,
mostly, they have a negative perception; They perceive that violence in the neighborhood has been maintained or
increased during the last year, that protection services for NNA and women are insufficient, and that all
Days or often find out of cases of violence in the neighborhood and/or at school (Manager survey to families
Recipient, 2023).
On the other hand, it is important to mention that the final evaluation document of the implementation developed by
SEPA Foundation presents the monitoring of two indices related to the security issue in the neighborhoods: (i) the first
It is the index of perception of households towards situations that lead to violence in the neighborhood, which has reduced from
52% in April from 2021 to 33% as of December 2022; and (ii) the second is the index of perception of institution performance
responsible for protection and citizen security, which has increased from 33% in April 2021 to 64% in December
2022.
On average, both indices indicate that, in a year and eight months, the perception of the population allocates of the
component has improved by 25%, which although, does not reach the 35% goal established in the logical framework, shows a
Positive evolution attributable to implementation, an aspect that is highly valuable.
The third result of the program is the strengthening of climate resilience and the ability to adapt to the
Climate change of the neighborhood and the educational units where the neighborhood goes, through the implementation
of a community strategy and plans, of the “Resilient Schools” school program, of the formation of a committee
environmental and community and student organizations, and training for families and leaders in management of
risks and adaptation to climate change.
The person responsible for this component by UNICEF highlights that this has been an important opportunity to
implement a project at the territorial level and that important tangible results have been achieved, including actions
and works of adaptation to climate change in 12 apple trees identified as vulnerable, environmental improvements
implemented at the Child Development Center (rainwater collection system, worm and composer,
Garden, storm drainage and gray drainage, French drainage, among others); Family Garders, a garden
Community, garbage dumps, recycling containers, solar luminaires, and improvements at the San Ramón de la Víbora school
(sinks, toilets, refacted taps and school garden).
With regard to social and student mobilization that promoted this component, conformation stands out,
training and institutionalization of the Environmental Committee, the implementation of the Resilient School Model, in whose
Marco was implemented a pedagogical program development and change adaptation program
Climate both in students and in teaching staff, leaderships were promoted and formed in NNA, and
They formed organizations and instances of NNA for climate action, such as the intercollegial table of climate action,
The EU EU Student Brigade, the strengthening of the Las Estrellas group, the implementation of the Biennial
Youth Infant of Arts and Socio -Cultural Expressions and the Young Expo (both the Biennial and the Young Expo had two
versions, the 2021 and 2022). A detail of the results achieved is attached in Annex 50 of this document
With this component. (SEPA Foundation, 2023)

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
It is considered that the strategies and approaches used by the three components to achieve these results have
been effective and adaptable enough to the situation, since, despite the complex context, pandemic by pandemic
COVID-19 and political, social and economic crises in which the PSSDU has been implemented, it has been possible to put into
The model in Montero, and is being replicated in Cobija.
As for the criteria for selecting beneficiaries of the different components, some disarticulation is observed,
since, for the Wash component, the recipient families were chosen considering that they should have the
sufficient resources to contribute an economic counterpart (according to all -part families this counterpart was
Bs. 3,800) for the construction of their respective mosafa, that is, the population was not necessarily
vulnerable from the neighborhood, however, for the protection component interests precisely to reach the population more
Vulnerable, the one that is not in a position to meet an economic counterpart.
Differences between the recipients and the intervention territories of the three components are observed:
(i) The Wash component worked at the family level, with mosafa installation dispersed in different apple trees,
but he also worked at a neighborhood scale with Decoma and in educational units with the components pH and MHM;
(ii) The protection component worked at a family level, but only with a part of beneficiary families
With mosafa, and with another part of families in a situation of extreme vulnerability that have no mosaf
It has also intervened at a neighborhood level and at the level of educational units, reaching populations different from
those that the Wash component arrived;
(iii) the climate change component has not worked at the family level but also at the apple level and also in
educational units; In both cases, it has reached populations that do not match exactly those of
the other two components of the program; and
(iv) The Wash component began to be implemented independently since 2018, and
Subsequently, the year 2020, the components of protection and climate change were incorporated (in
Huntsman).
These differences between recipients, levels, territories and moments of intervention generate confusion and
Difficulties for monitoring and evaluation, but, above all, they make it difficult to talk about comprehensive intervention in all their
aspects, not only in terms of sector integrality, but also in terms of population reach and coverage
territorial. In the replica that has been executed in Cobija, several of these aspects have been remedied, for example, the
Wash and Protection components have started at the same time and the identification of recipients have been
carried out jointly (the counterpart is no longer economical but in labor), but the
Component of climate change as executed in Montero, for not having a budget item.
The execution of the three components jointly, formally, must result in combined a
“Decentralized sanitation model, strengthening the exercise of NNA rights to sanitation, protection
and a healthy environment. ”In practice there is a natural synergy between the Wash and climate change components, then
The first raises a sustainable sustainable solution with the environment, which constitutes, in itself,
an adaptation and mitigation strategy of climate change. Instead, the protection component is more
Independent, as mentioned in the relevance criteria, it can be implemented as part of the PSSDU,
You can also do it within the framework of another sector program or you can do it autonomously.
At the family level, the implementation of the three components jointly, has allowed the population to be provided
It would recipient a complete battery of benefits, which has generated changes in the short term, and can potentially
detonate changes in habits and behaviors, individual and family, in the medium term; with the implementation of
The three components the same family can benefit, at the same time, a mosafa, with all the assistance
technique and operational maintenance that the program foresees, of the elaboration and implementation of a family plan
appropriate to your reality, your needs, capacities and interests, training in hygiene habits, MHM,
Parental care, positive masculinities, prevention of violence and adaptation skills to climate change.
At the neighborhood level, a set of benefits for the community articulated with each other is also available,
Basically: a decentralized sanitation system, composed of the health modules, the collection system of
waste and the treatment plant, the strengthening of the community with the installation and improvement of services of
protection, adaptation works to climate change, and social mobilization, at the neighborhood and educational community level,
61

for the formation of committees, networks, organizations inside the neighborhood, event organization, fairs, spaces of
Participation, among several other options, to give sustainability to the model.
At the institutional level, the relationship with municipal governments is facilitated and optimized, since they reach them with a
Package of programs and projects articulated with each other, at once; The program can be addressed through equipment
multidisciplinary within the GAM, which facilitates the definition of strategies and decision making coordinated between
sectors, as well as coordination in general and the reduction of administrative steps.
What are the factors that most influenced or not the results, considering external factors
and internal?
According to the revised documentation, testimonies of informants and allocation population, and from the
survey results, the most important factors, both limiting and facilitators of the
implementation.
The identified limiting factors are: (i) the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the social political crisis and, subsequently,
economic for which he went through (and still crosses) the country, since October 2019; (iii) that not all families
recipients had their documentation in order; and (iv) the rainy season (climate factor).
It is worth mentioning that the health emergency by the pandemic, on the other hand, has detonated results and effects
favorable not expected, such as greater interest in the theme of hand washing and pH-MHM, the
production and dissemination of the radiovela "The world of Rosita" on ph-MHM themes with municipal reach, the
Incorporation of virtual classes in the subject ph-MHM and the distribution of tablets to the allocation families so that
They can precisely follow the virtual classes.
The facilitating factors identified are: (i) the waste collection service and periodic monitoring of the mosaafa
by the EPSA; (ii) the inter -institutional cooperation network that has been woven in favor of the implementation of the
Program; and (iii) the organicity of the Guadalupe II neighborhood and the active participation of the neighborhood.
The rate is a facilitating factor to achieve the balance of the model, as long as, on the one hand, the
Sustainability of the system, and on the other, it is realistic and feasible for families to pay it monthly, if it does not comply
These conditions become a limiting factor for the subsistence and development of the system.
Within the framework of the PSSDU there has been an important socialization work and, above all, of community development,
which has allowed generating a very positive perception of the beneficiary families regarding mosaafa, this
situation has facilitated both the implementation and the operation of the modules; In another scenario (with a view to the
replicability of the intervention), if this accompaniment did not exist or if it were poor, a little perception
favorable of the population with respect to the modules can become a factor that hinders the implementation.
The main limiting factor between the 2020s and 2021 has been the Covid-19 pandemic, which as is of knowledge
public, has limited all activities due to health emergency and quarantine, first strict and after
flexible; at the operational level, as expressed in the interviews and the above in the progress reports, for the
Program implementation This situation has meant delays in the execution and reformulation schedule of
Some activities.
At a family level, according to its own testimonies, the pandemic has caused a variety of difficulties, since the loss
of loved ones because of the disease, until the reduction of family heritage, product of the decrease, and, in
Some cases, of the total loss of economic income of families, which has melled family economies
increasing their levels of vulnerability; At the institutional level, pandemic and its consequences, it has caused a
economic deceleration, which has influenced the reduction of municipal budgets, this situation causes that
Public investment levels, at all levels of government, are reduced.
With regard to the program, the contraction of municipal public investment means that the GAM de Montero and
Cobija, do not have sufficient resources to meet their commitments and counterparts in terms of construction
of mosafa with municipal resources (precisely one of the most affected logical maro indicators in its
compliance); In its 2023 management budget, the GAMM has assigned the sum of Bs. 490 thousand for construction
of 25 mosafa (Sigep, 2023), when, in its municipal plan, the goal of building 300 mosafa had been established
62

annually (Gam Montero, 2018); The GAM Cobija has not assigned resources in the 2023 management for the construction of
Mosafa or for the expansion of sanitation coverage.
However, it is worth mentioning that the health emergency, on the other hand, has detonated favorable results and effects
planned, such as (i) a greater interest on the part of the population in the subject of hand washing and pH-MHM,
as a means of prevention in the face of the threat of COVID-19; (ii) the production and dissemination of radiovela “The world of
Rosita ”(on the subject ph-MHM) with municipal reach, as a means of distance training; (iii) the incorporation
of virtual classes in the subject ph-MHM; and (iv) the distribution of tablets to the allocation families so that they can,
Precisely, follow the virtual classes.
Another important factor, particularly in the Guadalupe II neighborhood, has been the political and social crisis unleashed in
October 2019, which extends during 2020 during a transitory government (which coincides with the emergency
sanitary by pandemic); This neighborhood, during this year of conflict, became a “bastion” of resistance of the
Party of former President Morales, in front of contrary groups from the rest of the municipality of Montero and the
Santa Cruz City, becoming a scenario of serious clashes, which caused several injured and even
dead people. (El duty, 2019)
In this context, the entry of the technicians of the program to the neighborhood became complicated during that year of conflict, the
neighborhood leadership and many of the resident families (in addition to prioritizing their survival in full pandemic and
quarantine) were occupied in political issues, giving importance to health, hygiene, protection and
climate change that the program carried with it; Likewise, leaders and families in general are distrusted
During this stage, therefore, the program staff had to make several approaches and move forward and
gradually convincing the neighborhood leaders to move forward with the implementation and to start
Implement protection and climate change components.
The implementation methodology, which includes the maintenance service of the modules and accompaniment by
part of cosmol (in general with the EPSA), both in regards to the collection of the waste generated by the mosafa,
As in periodic monitoring, it is an important factor for the results that have been achieved so far with
the implementation and is decisive for the sustainability of the model; Within the framework of said accompaniment, the
Cosmol technicians perform monitoring visits periodically to each recipient family, identifying
eventual faults in the modules, or difficulties in their management.
Survey data reveal that in 70% of cases, families receive at least one cosmol service
once a month (in some cases, more than once a month); 23% of families indicate that receiving this service with less
Frequency: once every two, three or even four months (see Annex 47).
One of the 44 families surveyed said that Cosmol goes to their home every time they call them, and 2 informants
They pointed out that they do not receive the cosmol service; Although it is a minimum percentage (5%) this result must call
The attention of the program and cosmol team, to identify for which reasons a family that has mosafa
It might not be receiving the waste collection service.
The rate is a facilitating factor to achieve the balance of the model, as long as, on the one hand, the
Sustainability of the system, and on the other, it is realistic and feasible for families to pay it monthly, if it does not comply
These conditions become a limiting factor for the subsistence and development of the system. Within the framework of this
Evaluation does not have sufficient evidence to conclude whether the availability to pay the quarterly rate of Bs. 39
It is high or low, because it is integrated into the drinking water rate, therefore, the real DAP39 should be defined
through an objective and independent study, as mentioned in the relevance criterion (subtitle 5.2) of this
document.
In the same vein, a factor that can be facilitator or limiting is the perception of the recipient population with respect to
to dry baths, their operation and maintenance; according to the implementing partner, municipal technicians and
39 It is important to differentiate the real DAP from a nominal or official DAP, while the latter can be justified by signing agreements or
contracts whose compliance, in reality, is not guaranteed, the real DAP is calculated from defined methodologies, which seek to assess
Economically goods or services that do not have an established market, such as environmental goods or public services. To perform
A DAP study can be used by the contingent valuation method (MVC), which consists of creating a hypothetical market and asking the
Potential consumers how much they would be willing to pay for the good or service in question; There are several methodologies to apply the MVC,
And, once the data is obtained, the DAP can be estimated from different inferential and/or economy models.

The same recipients, within the framework of the PSSDU there has been an important socialization work and, above all,
of community development, which has allowed to generate a very positive perception of the beneficiary families regarding
The mosafa, this situation has facilitated both the implementation and the operation of the modules; from the point of
View of experts and sector authorities, if this accompaniment did not exist or if it were poor, a perception
unavailable to the population with respect to the modules can constitute a factor that hinders the implementation,
and even more the maintenance and sustainability of the system.
According to testimonies of the recipients and technicians of the EPSA, a couple of factors that also harmed
partially the development of some program activities, especially related to the construction of
Mosafa and the treatment plant were: (i) that not all recipients had their documentation
in order to start with the constructive phase of the modules; and (ii) the climatic factor, since the rainy season
It has delayed the construction of mosafa and the treatment plant, especially in the municipality of Cobija.
Another factor valued by the informants interviewed is the cooperation network that has been woven for implementation
of the model, based on the financing of Swedish cooperation, UNICEF as the main implemer, Cosmol
as the technical entity responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system, GAM, neighborhood organizations,
Gabriel René Moreno University and the Environmental Laboratory Unit that has allowed improving production
of fertilizer from the waste of the mosafa40, without the conjunction of each and every one of these actors and institutions
The implementation of the model would not have been possible.
A factor that has been very important to have an active participation of the neighborhood is the structure
Neighborhood Organizational, made up of 36 representatives of Manzano and a neighborhood board of directors, which have facilitated the
entry of the model implementing team to the neighborhood and that permanently accompany Cosmol's work in
territory, at the beginning the relationship was not simple, due to distrust by the neighborhood and
leadership, but the implementing team, both from UNICEF, as of SEPA and Cosmol have managed to tend ties of
confidence that now constitute an important social capital, and an important element to give sustainability to the
system.
5.4 Coherence
To what extent do the activities and components of the models relate (urban sanitation, childhood protection
and climate change) with the objectives of the program and the results found?
Based on all the information collected and analyzed, from both documentary and source sources
primary, it is observed that there is an adequate causal relationship between the activities (strategies) developed
For each of the components, the objectives of the program, and the results and changes in the short term
Observed (review Graph 1. Reconstructed TDC scheme of the MSSDU).
In the future, and thinking about the scalability of the model to public policy, the evaluation team considers that it is possible
Improve the coherence of policy by expanding the variety of the offer of sanitation technologies, considering
other options in addition to the BES, and address interventions with a territorial approach, that is, to implement the
Model in full neighborhoods, both considerations would improve the adaptability of the model to the socio -cultural context
(since there will be families who agree to use kiss and others not) and reinforce the logical step of the changes of
short term to long -term interventions at the neighborhood level.
In what aspects are the different activities developed by the three components complementary and what was the
Added value of implementing the three components in a combined way?
A natural complementarity is observed between the components of wash and climate change, since
Mosafa are a sanitation solution and, in themselves, they constitute a strategy of prevention and mitigation of the
40 According to data from the compliance report of indicators of the logical framework updated to May 2023, Cosmol, so far, has
managed to produce 16 thousand kg. of fertilizer, which have been used in GAMM reforestation campaigns; According to studies
carried out, an absolutely pathogenic fertilizer has not been achieved, therefore, as indicated in the systematization document
of the model, this should be used for high or ornamental stem crops. Production for commercial fertilizer purposes by Cosmol
It has not yet begun, this step is desirable to contribute to the financial sustainability of the EPSA.

climate change; The protection component is independent, can be implemented within the PSSDU framework as
also within the framework of other sector programs or autonomously.
The implementation of the three components in a combined manner has allowed to make available, both of the
families, as of the community/neighborhood, of the municipal government and of the municipal technical instances, packages of
benefits and tools, which allow at the same time addressing several problems that families are going through and
Institutions.
At the operational level, it has facilitated the entry of the executing teams to the territory and address “in a single entrance” or in
A single meeting, issues that involve aspects of health, hygiene, protection and environment at the same time.
The authorities at the municipal and national level do not completely understand the integrality of the proposal,
Technical officials in the sanitation area often confuse the protection component from a
Right approach, with a risk management approach; They also consider that integrality and
Intersectorality in this type of interventions has been provided for in Bolivian regulations, and any program of
Sanitation must contemplate social variables.
As can be seen in the TDC, the execution of the three components jointly must result in a model
of decentralized sanitation, in which the exercise of the rights of NNA to sanitation is strengthened, to the
protection and a healthy environment; As already mentioned, within the framework of the implementation there is a synergy
Natural among the Wash and Climate Change components, as the first one raises a sustainable sanitation solution
Environmental friendly, which constitutes, in itself, a strategy of adaptation and mitigation of change
climatic; On the other hand, the protection component is independent, this can be implemented as part of the PSSDU,
You can also do it within the framework of another program or you can do it autonomously.
At the family level, the implementation of the three components jointly, has allowed the population to be provided
a complete battery of benefits, which has generated observable changes in the short term, and
Potentially they can detonate changes in habits and behaviors, individual and family in the medium term;
With the implementation of the three components the same family has been able to benefit, at the same time, a
Mosafa, with all the technical assistance and operational maintenance provided for the program, of the elaboration and
implementation of a family development plan appropriate to its reality, its needs, capacities and interests, of
Training in hygiene habits, MHM, parental care, positive masculinities, violence prevention and
Climate change adaptation skills.
At the neighborhood level, a set of benefits for the community articulated with each other has also been made available to each other,
Basically: a decentralized sanitation system, composed of the health modules, the collection system of
waste, and the treatment plant, the strengthening of the community with the installation and improvement of services of
protection, adaptation works to climate change, and social mobilization, at the neighborhood and educational community level,
for the formation of committees, networks, organizations inside the neighborhood, event organization, fairs, spaces of
Participation, among several other options, to give sustainability to the model.
At the institutional level, the relationship with municipal governments has been facilitated and optimized, since it has been reached
They with a package of programs and projects articulated with each other, at once; potentially, the program can
approach through multidisciplinary teams inside the GAM, which facilitates the definition of strategies and takes
of coordinated decisions between sectors, as well as coordination in general and the reduction of administrative steps.
However, at the level of municipal and national authorities, this integrality has not yet been understood,
Authorities consulted, consider that the protection component, in this program, is linked to the management of
risks, climate change and resilience and not so much to an approach to children's rights and violence prevention; in
This context, the program has allowed a first step towards recognition by servers and
public officials towards the recognition of the existence of other areas with which to work in a way
Interdisciplinary
The authorities consulted value the integrality of the program, but instead of identifying an added value of the
Intervention, point out that this is a mandate of the Ministry of Environment and Water, and that water projects
Drinking and sanitation must always be accompanied by a decom component; They also point out that the approaches
65

of interculturality, gender and adaptation to climate change are transversal to this type of interventions, and which is a
Country policy work in that regard.
5.5 Sustainability
How likely, the results of the program continue after the interventions end?
Important elements of technical sustainability (waste collection service by the EPSA) are identified and
of environmental sustainability (Bes technology and nutrient cycle closure); As for financial sustainability, it is
Probable that the system continues to operate in the neighborhood in the short term, but in conditions of subsidiarity, already
That by itself and on the current scale, the model is not sustainable, and expanding coverage could expand the gap
financial and make the system even less sustainable for the service provider, since there is no evidence
on economy of scales in the model or on the availability to be paid of the population.
It is also likely that, in the short and medium term, the Luciérnaga CDI and the District DNA continue to function as
They did it during the execution of the program, to the extent that the agreements signed with the Government and the GAMM
allow to count on financial resources for it.
According to the final report of the protection component, it can be observed that care guidelines and
NNA breeding within families in the exit line with respect to the baseline, from which it follows that the effects
generated from training and awareness actions in families regarding parental care are little
durable
The effects achieved with the training of students on environmental care issues, based on
Interviews with the same adolescents, survey of families and program documentation, are shown
potentially sustainable, due to the opening of this age group and its sensitivity regarding related issues
with climate change; It is advisable to continue working on new training cycles.
The sustainability of municipal policy, specifically referring to the construction of mosafa as a replica of the
Program in the municipality of Montero, is subject to the availability of investment resources, to achieve
Scheduled goals, it is unlikely that GAMM meets its policy objectives in the sector until 2030
(to build 3,000 mosafa), due to its reduced availability of resources.
It is advisable to carry out an impact assessment to the three years of completion of the intervention, with the purpose of
Evaluate changes in the medium and long term, propitiated by the program.
Following the analysis framework that has been defined in this evaluation, from the TDC, the
Sustainability of program results according to what is observed.
Regarding the decentralized sanitation system that is a first result of the PSSDU, and probably the most
important of the model, the authorities and technicians interviewed, in terms of their sustainability, mention: (i) the
Main maintenance does not fall directly to users but the EPSA, this is an important
factor that favors system sustainability; (ii) the rate that the benefited population pays to the EPSA for the
Module maintenance is a very sensitive aspect for system sustainability, it must guarantee
EPSA operations and at the same time must be in accordance with the socio -economic reality of families; and (iii) the
Social accompaniment that, according to the model, must provide the EPSA, is a determining element for sustainability
of the system.
An aspect mentioned by technicians in relation to the sustainability of the model, has to do with the system scale,
Only from a certain amount of mosafa installed, the service provided by Cosmol is made financially
Sustainable (from the collection of the rate), but if the amount of mosafa is very small, then the EPSA
It is obliged to subsidize the service, and cannot do so indefinitely, therefore financial sustainability
of the system is compromised.
In the case of the replica in Cobija, EPSA technicians consider that there will be no greater difficulty with sustainability
of the system, since the calculation of the rate has already been made and this will be charged on the same water invoice, in addition to
An important community development work has been carried out with the support of UNICEF, socializing, informing,
training and sensitizing the allocation population with respect to mosafa, their proper use and their maintenance; without
66

However, the Empsa Cobija is one of those that presents worse conditions of technical sustainability nationwide, according to
The AAPS performance reports.
According to the results presented by the Technical Assistance Report for the determination of prices and rates
of the Collection, Transportation and Treatment Service of Dry Fecal Waste by the Services Cooperative
Public montero (cosmol), prepared in 2022 with support from UNICEF (PSSDU, 2022 c), the status of situation is a lot
less encouraging. The subsidy of the system in Montero is 94% being the annual operating costs of the order of Bs.
481 thousand and the invoiced income of the order of Bs. 60 thousand, of which only some Bs. 36 thousand are made, given
that the percentage of collection efficiency is 60%41. If the service is considered to be provided to some
150 families The annual subsidy per unit amounts to Bs. 3,000 per family that is equivalent to a monthly subsidy of Bs. 25042.
The high operational cost of maintenance of mosaafa becomes even more evident when compared to costs
of septic camera cleaning maintenance between Bs.300 and Bs. 500 (1 m3 septic chamber) and which is
covered directly by users. The possibility that the unit cost curve can lower to less than 10% of
The current costs under an escalation scenario is not evident and the analysis of analysis has not been shared with
The evaluation team by Cosmol despite having required several times. Therefore, the scenario
Sustainability of the sanitation system is fragile despite the fact that at the time of evaluation it is in use and
operation.
Other aspects that must be taken into account within the framework of the sustainability of the sanitation system raised by
The model are, in the first place, the acceptance and correct use of the system by the recipient families, although,
In this program closing phase a majority of families value modules and cosmol service, and make a
Good use of mosaafa, there is also a percentage of families that do not, according to the data set
approximately 20%; On a scale of 77 mosafa the problem is not very large, but with a view to scalability
and replicability of the model, this would imply that of every 1,000 mosafa installed 200 would not be well used from a
Principle, and that is already a scale in which the model of sustainability of the model becomes larger and more complex.
Regarding the second and third results, referring to the creation of protective and healthy environments for NNA,
It is worth mentioning that in the Guadalupe II neighborhood neighborhood committees, environmental, protection,
Childhood Education and Development, recognized and legitimate by the population, but that do not have financing or
economic sustainability mechanisms, they have internal acts of recognition and appointment, but not
They have other formal documents, such as a constitution or recognition of the gamm, therefore these
Committees are still weak, and depend, to a large extent, on the will of the same members.
On the other hand, this neighborhood is counted with permanent equipment such as the Luciérnaga CDI and a District Ombudsman,
It has been invested in improvements at the San Ramón de la Víme School and also in mitigation and adaptation works to change
Climate, such as family, community and school gardens, drains, garbage dumps among others; Personnel have been trained
municipal and teaching staff, and agreements have been signed with the Government and the GAMM for the sustainability of the services,
To the extent that this financing is maintained, and the rotation of personnel is not very high, the effects achieved in
This aspect could be sustainable in the medium term.
From the field visits and interviews with neighborhood leaders, municipal personnel and the same families and
students, a good predisposition of the population, their leaders and formed networks is perceived, to give it
continuity to activities, but at the same time they point out that they need the external support of UNICEF and the Foundation
Know, what can be an unavailable indicator for the sustainability of the actions implemented, especially
in issues of protection and climate change.
According to the final report of the protection component, the following can be observed: the perception of the
families regarding citizen security in the neighborhood and with respect to the public security system, as well as have
Improved certain solidarity mechanisms inside the neighborhood; But it has worsened the care guidelines and nna breeding
41 AGREE THE LAST REPORT OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OF THE AAPS, COSMOL SUSTAINED SUSTAINED ITS INDICATORS OF

within families43, from which it follows that the effects generated from training actions and
Sensitization in families regarding parental care are not very durable.
At the institutional and political level, the program has left an important battery of policy instruments and tools
public, practically all plans elaborated within the framework of the program are being executed in the municipality of
Montero, but it is also observed that the context of economic slowdown that the country is going through since the year
2020, as, to a large extent, of the Covid-19 Pandemia, has hindered the full execution of these plans and
It constitutes a limiting factor to achieve the goals of municipal policy in many aspects, and specifically
in the water and sanitation sector.
The effort made by the program in terms of political incidence is positively valued, having achieved the
Commitment by the GAMM to give continuity to the implementation, however, while the context
economic is unavailable, the sustainability of the intervention is very weak in the sense that the ability of
Municipality of investing in replicating and climbing the model is very limited.
Finally, it is important to underline that, the evaluation of the sustainability of the results achieved by the three
Program components, is done based on the survey results, on the testimonies of key informants and
allocation population and in the review of the documentation made available to the evaluation team, at one time
Specific that is the final phase of the PSSDU execution, these sources of information and the evidence collected does not allow
Formulate definitive conclusions regarding the sustainability of the medium and long term model, therefore, one of the
main recommendations that arise from this analysis, is to make an impact assessment to the three years of concluding
the intervention, for which both UNICEF and Fundación SEPA and all external support that has been articulated in the framework
From the intervention, it must be withdrawn from this period, in order to make visible the capacity for autonomy
that the different local actors have to give continuity to the model.
To what extent has the program promoted the institutional and economic sustainability of the models? What is the
Institutional and family installed capacity that allows the sustainability of the models after the program?
The program has promoted the sustainability of the model in a priority way, providing the neighborhood with an infrastructure
important in terms of mosafa installation, protective spaces for children and adolescents and solutions to
problems caused by climatic factors within the neighborhood, also, through institutional strengthening
to local entities such as the EPSA and the GAM, of organizational strengthening within the neighborhood and awareness
and training of the recipient population.
From the evaluation it is considered that technical, environmentally and socially, the model incorporates important elements of
Sustainability replicable in other neighborhoods and municipalities and scalable to public policy; However, in terms of
Financial sustainability of the system Weakness are observed: (i) Regarding the operational subsidy of more than 90% with the
that it has been projected that the system will work; (ii) Regarding the absence of evidence of economies of scale in the
Model that effectively allows a balance point with the massive implementation of mosafa; (iv) in
as for the absence of evidence about the availability to be paid by families and that the
Current Bs. 39 Rate, really, a balance rate; and (iv) regarding the insufficiency of resources with which
The GAM and the EPSA tell to build more mosaafa and expand the system.
Regarding the institutional and economic aspects, the authorities and technicians interviewed indicate the following: (i) the
Solid waste treatment plant should be evaluated periodically in terms of installed capacity, put
that, over time, by increasing the number of modules and families benefited, it will be necessary to consider the possibility
to expand this capacity or build another plant; (ii) the rate paid by families benefited by the service of
Collection must be evaluated with technical and social criteria, guaranteeing, above all, the operation of the service, likewise,
considers appropriate that it is jointly charged with the drinking water rate; (iii) an institutionally institution
strengthened is a strategic element for system sustainability; (IV) Have local authorities convinced
43 While the percentage of families that leave children alone has reduced from 31% to 13% during implementation, the percentage of families that
They leave young children in charge of their minor brothers has increased from 10% to 32%; It is not observed, in the exit line, the
Use of the Lightning CDI by the recipient families; As already observed in the impact criteria, the percentages of families that
They hit their children with Chicote has increased from 52% to 57% from the baseline to the exit line, the percentage of families that violate
Punishes such as pinches, blows or cocachos has increased from 14% to 27%, from the families that shout them have risen from 60% to 75% and from which they
They quarrel 88% to 98%. (SEPA Foundation, 2023 b)

Regarding the benefits and feasibility of the model (political will) is another element of utmost importance for the
Sustainability of the system.
Regarding the conditions that must be present in the recipient families to guarantee the sustainability of the
model, it is often mentioned that: (i) the socialization of the system is important, since most of the
families, when they are spoken of basic sanitation, they want to have a conventional drag toilet and few know
Or they wish to have an ecological bath, therefore, it is important to socialize the benefits of the mosafa; (ii) training
Regarding the use of ecological baths, it is a determining factor, since the proper functioning of the system depends
directly from the proper use of the modules, permanent monitoring regarding proper use must be added
of the dry baths by the EPSA; (iii) the information and awareness of families regarding the importance of
hold the system through a rate that covers the operating costs of collecting, monitoring and processing of the
Waste, it is also an important factor for social acceptance and system sustainability.
It is pointed out that the Mmaya in coordination with the Ministry of Education has introduced into the new curricular mesh for
primary and secondary levels, educational content referred to basic sanitation and the different typologies of
sanitation available, as well as the criteria to identify what type of sanitation is appropriate according to the area
or to the ecological floor.
5.6 Scalability and replicability
What are the most important factors that must be considered for the replica/scalability of the level models
subnational and/or national?
With a view to the scalability and replicability of the model, it is observed that there is no natural demand by the
population to settle modules with Bes technology on their own, which is why the program has planned a
First phase for demand generation; On the other hand, the financial sustainability of the model must be
guaranteed, and clarity must be provided to municipal governments, technical entities and national entities with respect to
at the cost of implementation, operation and maintenance of the system, before being inserted as part of the programs
sanitation audiences.
Less priority aspects, but which is also advisable to take into account are: (i) have documentation
that systematizes the experience and rescue good practice for the replica of the model44; (ii) conduct feasibility studies
to determine where the model can be implemented and where not; (iii) affect politically, to find the
Incorporation of the model in public policy at all levels of government45.
As for the replicability and scalability of the model, authorities of the sector consider that it is important to have
A systematization of experience, rescuing methodologies, legal and normative aspects generated at the level
Subnational, implementation and operation costs and lessons learned, both good and, and especially bad;
It is important that this knowledge generated through experience can be shared to think about replicating
Aspects that work well and not repeat the errors that have been identified. In this sense, the
MSSDU systematization document and the family strengthening programs systematization document,
both developed within the framework of the PSSDU, which constitute an empirical knowledge base oriented to replica
of both models.
Another aspect mentioned by authorities and municipal technical personnel is the importance of socializing the model with
authorities and organic structures in places where the system is intended to be replicated, it is considered very important
demonstrate to the leaders and the general population that the model works, which generates results and effects
beneficial for families, and that is an alternative to conventional sanitary sewerage systems that are
more expensive and not very feasible to implement in peri -urban areas.
It is necessary to carry out previous studies to determine in which municipalities and in which areas it is feasible to implement a
Sanitation system based on the PSSDU model, as part of these previous studies, the
44 This is a suggestion that starts from the technical team of the municipality of Montero and Cosmol, it is advisable to share with them the
MSSDU systematization document.
45 This suggestion is also part of the municipal and cosmol technical team, it is advisable to share with these instances the efforts that
perform UNICEF to position the model in instances of the central government as a public policy.

local organic structures, the presence or not of EPSA or CAPYS, to determine both physical and
social for the implementation of the model. Once again, the model systematization document,
where preconditions that must exist for its implementation are established.
The processes of political incidence are also important thinking about the scalability and replicability of the model,
since cooperation resources are limited to the enormous amount of needs that the population has and
The municipalities, these incidence processes must be carried out at different levels of public administration, in order
to achieve the commitment of resources for the extension of alternative sanitation systems, in this case of the
PSSDU Model. This is basically a lesson learned from the implementation of the PSSDU in the Guadalupe II neighborhood,
where the work of incidence at the level of the gamm, cosmol and neighborhood organizations was fundamental for the
intervention success.
As for the limitations for scalability, two areas of analysis are considered: the first related to elements
idiosyncratics related to the appropriation of such technology by families. Both in Montero and
Cobija could not be identified families that have opted for a dry bathroom solution (type
Mosafa) with own resources.
On the contrary, there seems to be some trend, in the medium term, to migrate to the conventional sanitation system,
Therefore, mosafa technology should foresee the possibility of migrating to conventional models. On the other
side, the intervention unit should not be the family, but the community (neighborhood, neighborhood unit, district) to opt
By technology it is a cultural element, to be worked, also at the community level and not just familiar.
The second element is related to economic costs and their intertemporal distribution in the different actors
institutional and families; While the mosafa system can have construction costs below the systems
conventional sanitation, these costs are usually covered by EPSA through cross -subsidy systems between
the drinking water service and the basic sanitation service and therefore sinking46 part of the investment costs
public in basic sanitation.
Along the same lines, pretending a financial self -sustaining scheme of the organic material collection system
based on family contributions can be equivocal when proposing scalability in this type of
interventions In addition, it is important to consider the competitiveness of the system against other traditional systems, already
That a Bes system that works with Bs. 13 per month per family, but with a subsidy of 90%, has a cost
real operation of Bs. 130 per month, that is Bs. 1,560 per year, in front of ETRL technologies that represent a
Operational cost between Bs. 300 and Bs. 1,200 a year per family (without considering investment).
There is a study by UNICEF in 2022 that shows that in the case of Cosmol in Montero, the
System subsidy is of the order of 90% and the economies of scale to move from the order of the 150 are not evident
Solutions to the three thousand solutions (PSSDU, 2022 C). The aforementioned study should be reviewed in depth and adjust,
since, the financial projection model, evidence overestimated fixed costs or underestimated variable costs
(or both), since part of a scenario for the year zero, in which the operating cost per mosafa is, on average,
of Bs. 4 thousand, and, in the fifth year, in which it is supposed to have 3,000 mosaa installed, the
Operating cost per module is reduced to Bs. 200.
The assumptions used for this modeling must be reviewed and adjusted to reality, as well as the projections must
Consider achieveable scenarios, since the unit maintenance cost cannot experience such a variation
large, or an operational structure is being considered too expensive at the beginning of the flow, for the nearly 150
modules to which the EPSA currently provides the service, or a structure is not being considered sufficiently
solid to operate the 3,000 modules that are expected to have towards the end of the projection.
Therefore, at the time of evaluation there is no evidence about the costs of subsidy of both investment and

5.7 Efficiency
How are the costs related to the activities carried out by the components of each model implemented by
The program?
The program has assumed an important resources allocation in the category of management, leadership and assistance
Specialized program, and a minority allocation of resources to goods, services and benefits that arrive
directly to the recipients, in relation to the global resources assigned to the intervention. Establish a
priori parameters between direct expenses and indirect expenses could improve the efficiency of programs financed to
through UNICEF.
In both the protection component and in the climate change component, the wide amount of
activities implemented, in search of articulating an intervention model that can be integral and sustainable, for
which these sectors have worked with the different actors, both at family and community level, as well as with
three levels of the State. The approach of these two sectors has been both family and territorial at the level of units
educational and community, which has allowed wide coverage in its interventions. Special emphasis is placed on
This territorial approach, since it has been one of the main differences of the intervention model with the component
Wash, whose intervention has prioritized the family/individual level with respect to the community level (it is not being said that
There have been no element of community intervention, but these have been less relevant than actions
oriented to families).
At the efficiency level it is very careful when paying for the activities carried out, taking into account that
Both the urban decentralized sustainable sanitation program and the model is multilevel and multisectoral, and
Therefore the analysis unit to determine efficiency parameters varies depending on each of the three
components and level of activity intervention. On the other hand, it is observed that given the characteristics of the
Wash component and, being the articulating axis of the intervention, 88% of the budget has been assigned to said sector
and only 7% for protection and 5% for climate change which shows that the central axis of the program is focused
In Wash.
On the Wash sector side the criteria for the selection of the beneficiaries of the MOFASA and their limitation as
At intervention –77 Mofasa modules over a total of 870 lots in the Guadalupe II neighborhood - have made the intervention
be dispersed, minority as technology and therefore experimental. Costs linked to the construction of the MOFASA
and idiosyncratic barriers have not motivated it to be built - until the time of evaluation - resource mofasa
private by families outside the program, which would respond to the following limitations: (i) cost of the
Mofasa module, (ii) prestige47; (iii) cost of the collection service; and (iv) Sustainability of the service.
From the global program of the program, 56.5% has been allocated to programmatic activities related to the PSSDU, a
24.9% for management costs, leadership and specialized assistance and 6.3% as an administrative cost of UNICEF.
Additionally, within the framework of the Budget, the Sweden Embassy approved 7.5% for emergency care for
Outside the program, which is not included for the estimation of the TCI (indirect cost rate).
Although there is no parameter that defines the optimal relationship between indirect costs and direct costs in projects of
Social development - since this relationship may vary substantially depending on the objectives, scope,
allocation populations, location, sectors, among many other aspects of interventions -
Budget reveals that the items "Management, Leadership and Specialized Assistance of the Program" and "Costs
UNICEF administratives ”(resources that do not reach the recipient families) have absorbed 31.2% of
Budget (almost third of USD 4.5 million executed), while other items, which record the resources that
They arrive directly to the recipient population, and represent the emblematic components of the program, they have received
considerably minor sums:
47 Although a question has not been included in the survey or in the interviews, regarding the prestige it means for families to have a bathroom
Dry vs. A conventional bath, conversations made inside the neighborhood, with non -recipient families, have revealed that they are
waiting for the sanitary sewer network to reach the neighborhood or save enough to build a latrine with water drag by
Own account (many families inside the neighborhood already have one), since the assessment that is regarding Bes technology is
less than having a swine bathroom, with a "normal" toilet; It is advisable to deepen, in the future, to study and analyze this perception,
with a sociological and/or anthropological approach.
71
Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented
By UNICEF Bolivia 2018-2022
- The item "Infrastructure and Research in Montero", where the resources destined for construction are recorded
of the mosafa, that is to say the most important component of the program and that are resources that arrive
directly to the recipients, has absorbed 10.5% of the budget;
- The item "interventions with families", that is to say the implementation of family development plans, element
Central of the protection component, has received 3.3% budget;
- The item "Community Resilience Program", the basis of the intervention of the CC component has executed hardly
0.7% of the budget.
If the percentage applied to direct costs (CD) is assumed as TCI to finance the associated indirect costs (CI)
to the respective project (CI/CD) 48; It is evident that the program has a TCI close to 50% that is basically explained
for having assumed a load too large in the category of management, leadership and specialized assistance of the
Program, in relation to the global resources of the program.
In addition to this, a very delicate aspect is to observe that the resources that reach the population directly
recipient, in the form of goods (mosaafa) or services (training, technical assists, strengthening actions
organizational, resilient infrastructure, improvement and implementation of CDI, among others) represent a percentage
budget minority. In the case of a replica, it is recommended that an escalation in its financing be foreseen
that allows the program to maintain a broader participation of direct costs (see budget of the
Program in Annex 49).
5.8 Gender and equity
To what measure the most vulnerable girls and boys in the intervention sites have been able to benefit from the program?
What categories of vulnerable children have the program not arrived and why?
The targeting of the PSSDU implementation in peri -urban neighborhoods has allowed its benefits to reach
populations in a situation of vulnerability and to excluded territories, therefore to girls, boys and adolescents who
They belong to these families; However, within the Guadalupe II neighborhood the program, specifically in what
It refers to mosafa installation, has not reached the population of extreme vulnerability, since
established as a requirement that families cover a monetary counterpart, a requirement that worked as a filter
preventing children from belonging to families in extreme vulnerability to access the benefits of
Program; This filter has been eliminated in the Friendship neighborhood of Cobija, where a counterpart has been established in
job.
The implementation has not considered the inclusion of people with disabilities in the design of the mosafa or in the
model strategies, it is advisable to make this population visible that, eventually, and considering scalability
From the public policy model, it must be included.
The Guadalupe II neighborhood of Montero, like the friendship neighborhood of Cobija, are peri -urban territories where they reside
Populations with different forms of vulnerability, as already mentioned in this document are areas
long excluded that they had never benefited from important public investment projects in
infrastructure or expansion of basic services, therefore, the focus of these neighborhoods for the implementation of the
Program is successful, because it is supporting vulnerable families and excluded territories.
Within this vulnerable and excluded population, there are even more vulnerable groups to those who probably have not
achieved the implementation of the PSSDU; According to the neighborhood leadership and the implementing partner, the selection of families
Recipients in the Guadalupe II neighborhood has responded to different vulnerability criteria, but it has also been
Chosen families capable of complying with the monetary counterpart, this has worked as a filter that has avoided
48 Direct costs (CD) are understood as the resources that can be attributed directly to direct benefit actions in populations
program or project goal. Among the direct costs are: (i) personnel salary directly involved; (ii) purchase of supplies,
equipment and tools, (iii) execution of works, (iv) training costs, and (iv) transport costs, among others. In turn, costs are understood
indirect (CI) resources that cannot be attributed directly to activities or products (and therefore results and results of
Development) of the specific program or project. Among the indirect costs are: (i) costs of administrative and operational structures
of regional and national offices whose operation and operation are independent of the program or project; (ii) supervision costs,
monitoring and evaluation; (iii) audit expenses; (iv) Other administrative costs (Overhead), among others.

that families in extreme vulnerability (unable to cover the monetary counterpart) are benefited
With the implementation, especially with the installation of mosafa.
Therefore, girls, boys and adolescents of families in extreme vulnerability of the Guadalupe II neighborhood
They have been able to access the benefits of the program; However, it is worth mentioning that in the friendship neighborhood of Cobija this
situation has been corrected, since a monetary counterpart was no longer established as a requirement of families to
Participate in the program (but the counterpart in Cobija is in work), this has eliminated the filter that restricted that
The most vulnerable children access the benefits of the PSSDU.
A group that has not been considered by the program since its design, is the population with disabilities, although it is treated
of a demonstrative program, and, probably, people with disabilities have not been identified in the
allocation population, it is important to incorporate into the design of the mosafa and also in the implementation strategies
of the model, elements that allow to include people with disabilities, especially physical, but also of another type
(sensory, mental, psychosocial or others).
To what extent is the project integrates in its design and implementation gender equality, interculturality,
reduction of inequities and in general the rights approach?
The gender component is very important in the model, based on two central aspects: (i) the component of
Menstrual hygiene management, which does not focus exclusively on adolescent women, but also on men
and throughout the educational community, and (ii) the prevention and comprehensive care of violence against women, both in the
family environment as in the community/neighborhood.
The interculturality approach has also been relevant in the implementation of the PSSDU in the Guadalupe II neighborhood,
since most of its population is of Quechua origin, therefore, it was a priority to study and meet the
Families from the cultural neighborhood and idiosyncratically, for this one worked with a local partner with a long work experience
in the area and with this population (SEPA Foundation).
One of the fundamental principles of implementation is to reduce inequities, allowing
populations in vulnerable situation have greater opportunities to exercise their rights, seeking
mechanisms to reduce access gaps to basic sanitation services, protection and services services
Environmental As indicated and developed in the answer to the previous question, the implementation of the
Program in the Amistad de Cobija neighborhood has eliminated the filter of the monetary counterpart present in the
implementation in Montero, facilitating the access of families and NNA in a situation of extreme vulnerability to
Benefits of the PSSDU.
Finally, the rights of childhood and adolescents is central in the model, since the ultimate goal is
Improve the exercise of NNA rights to access sanitation services, to live in a healthy environment and
of protection, to live a life free of violence and, basically, of its right to survival.
6 lessons learned
1. One of the most important learning left by the demonstrative/pilot implementation of the PSSDU is the
Incorporation of the waste collection service in charge of the EPSA that provides technical sustainability to the
system; Previous experiences of decentralized sanitation projects based on Bes technology,
implemented by both public instances and cooperation in different regions of the country, have
failed, largely because the responsibility for the maintenance and final disposal of waste was
In the same families, and these did not have the capacity or resources to meet this
responsibility sustainably.
2. The accompaniment provided by the EPSA team to the recipients, together with the service of
collection of waste, represents an added value of the system, since, beyond the service purely
health and technical, a greater closeness of the EPSA has developed with the population, and a
monitoring system that allows you to adjust and/or correct any problems that arise in the normal
operation of the modules or referring to the use that families make of them.

4. Cost analysis models Efficiency and cost sustainability of basic sanitation technologies must
be part of the design of programs to allow their scaling, especially in rural areas and
peri -urban where contributions or fees payments by users are usually limited.
5. The program and its technical teams have had the ability to adapt to the context of Covid-19 Pandemic and
health emergency, using distance educational tools such as virtual pH-MHM classes, the
Radionovela "The world of Rosita" also with MHM themes and the distribution of tablets to families
recipients, through which it has been reached with informative, educational and sensitizer content to
a major population than expected; This is an important experience of transformation of a situation in
Negative extreme in an opportunity to generate greater coverage and scope with the intervention.
6. The formation of a coordination network, among the UNICEF implementing teams and local partners
(SEPA Foundation and PSC), authorities and municipal technicians (both in the basic sanitation sector and in
the protection and environment sectors), responsible and technical personnel of the EPSA (Cosmol),
Public Servants of Protection, Directors and Teaching School of Educational Units, leadership
Neighborhood, academic actors (NUR, UAGRM) and even instances of departmental and national governments,
They have provided a very solid institutional and organizational basis for the implementation of the program and
for the sustainability of results and effects achieved.
7. In this context, the appropriation of the strategies and actions of the program by the neighborhood organization has
been fundamental for the success of implementation in a historically conflictive neighborhood such as
Guadalupe II, as well as for the anchor of the program at the territorial level; In a context of high personnel rotation
In municipal, departmental and national instances, the involvement of social organizations and
Community represents an effective response to achieve the continuity of the effects achieved by the
Program.
8. The political incidence generated from the program at different levels of government has been effective, must

Strategic lines at different levels of government.
9. The elaboration and implementation of family development plans is a strategy that allows identifying, of
individualized way, the needs of each family and the specific actions to respond to said
needs, depending on their own characteristics and potentialities; PDFs are versatile instruments that
They can be implemented within the framework of other projects and programs as a diagnostic tool and

10. The psychological assistance office implemented in the neighborhood as part of the component of
protection is a practice that has been very well valued by youth leaders, has allowed to make visible the
importance of mental and emotional health especially in the adolescence stage and is also (as well
that PDF) a very versatile tool that can be implemented within the framework of other projects and
programs that have teenagers and young people as a target population.

7 conclusions and recommendations
7.1 Conclusions
Regarding impact (observable effects in the short term):
1. At the individual and family level, it is concluded that the population benefited from mosafa, for the most part, make a
good use of modules, but it has been identified that one in five families do not make proper use (see
Mistake! The origin of the reference is not found.). Also, most families have a perception
positive regarding the service provided by cosmol, but approximately one third is not fully compliant
(See error! The origin of the reference is not found.).
2. It is verified that hand washing by families is adequate in most cases (error!
Find the origin of the reference.), But the use of hand jaboncillo is not widespread (error!
find the origin of the reference.). The toilet of the patios of the houses is adequate at least two thirds
of the houses visited, in the remaining third, garbage accumulation has been observed (error! is not the
Origin of the reference.).
3. There is a favorable evolution in the perception of the recipients of the program regarding the
Security in the neighborhood, as well as a better assessment of protection services
especially for NNA and women and a greater contribution of families for the generation of spaces
insurance in the neighborhood; However, the perception of citizen insecurity, especially by women
Home heads, although it has improved during the last year and a half of implementation, is still high (error!
The origin of the reference is not found. And error! The origin of the reference is not found.).
4. While there is a decrease in the proportion of families that leave their children alone
There is also an increase in the proportion of families that leave the children in charge
of his minor brothers; The increase in physical punishments and verbal violence also attracts attention
against girls and boys as disciplinary measures in the program recipients of the program (SEPA Foundation,
2023 b)
5.
different themes, ranging from ph-MHM, to prevention of violence, friendly habits and customs
with the environment and a better relationship with their parents, teachers and pairs.
6. Important changes are observed in the strengthening of local populations and organizations in
climate action; The incorporation of various friendly practices and habits with the medium stands out
environment, especially by adolescent population; In this framework it is advisable to follow
implementing awareness activities, but above all training, to improve knowledge
and skills of the youngest to effectively undertake environmental care actions.
7. At the neighborhood community level, the change in orientation of neighborhood organizations is remarkable, from what
strictly political to a more social approach, and the integration of the Guadalupe II neighborhood, which remained isolated,
with the rest of the municipality; The program leaves a share capital for the sustainability of certain actions and
effects.
8. At the institutional and political level, the Municipal Planning Tools battery prepared in the
Gam Montero, however, it is recognized that there are goals raised in these tools that are far from
It is fulfilled, since the macroeconomic scenario has changed since its elaboration and is
adverse; An important contribution is also verified in the generation of regulations at the departmental level in issues
of climate and national change in protection issues.
9. Regarding the closure of the nutrient cycle, there has been a favorable first experience, having
reached a fertilizer production times higher than the one estimated, which was used in tasks

of arborization and reforestation made by the GAMM; A perfectly fertilizer has not yet been obtained
innocuous, so its use is not recommended in food crops.
Most significant changes:
10. One of the most significant changes identified, almost by all actors, is the improvement in the quality of life
Of the families that have received a mosafa, situations prior to the intervention of much are identified
precariousness, the testimonies spilled, both by recipient families and by leaders, and even technicians of
Cosmol and municipal authorities are very explicit regarding the precariousness in which families made
your needs before having your module; In all cases the quality of the
Infrastructure and equipment, families, particularly women, are very grateful.
11. From a more subjective approach, there are several informants who mention that there have been significant
changes in the self -esteem of families that have benefited from a mosafa, precisely because
health precariousness prior to the implementation of the program were extreme and currently the
Perception of the benefit generated by this equipment is very positive; It has also been mentioned that
teenagers have improved their self -esteem, product of different activities (especially artistic -
creative) carried out within the framework of the Resilient Schools Program, but also thanks to the implementation
of a free psychological assistance service that adolescents valued a lot.
12. Another significant change that identifies the informants has to do with the changes of habits and
attitudes, in different aspects, on the one hand mention habits in the management of garbage,
Water savings and environmental care, but changes in attitudes are also mentioned,
especially of the youngest (teenagers) both in the family environment, where they are more
respectful and collaborators, as in the educational field, where they are more tolerant and also
respectful in front of the companions, particularly during their menstruation days.
13. In this same line, the change in attitude, both of fathers and mothers, and
teachers and educational community in general, regarding addressing issues related to
menstruation in educational units, being that at first, especially mothers and fathers,
They showed some resistance to their daughters talk about this subject at school, currently the
MHM theme is addressed successfully in the educational units.
14. At the level of municipal authorities and technicians, the most significant changes of the
implementation have to do with the environmental benefit generated by water saving, originated in the
implementation of mosafa and impact on public health, on the decrease in diseases
infectious gastrointestinal, especially in NNA; However, they also recognize that there are no
Hard evidence regarding these impacts, since no impact studies have been carried out in the medium
Environment and public health, product of the implementation of the mosafa.
15. Finally, it is worth mentioning what are the aspects that adolescents value more as changes
significant, since its optics and its problem is different from that of adults. Adolescents
They feel that they have improved their social skills, their self -esteem and that violence in school has been reduced
(Bullyng), they also state that it has improved their knowledge on topics that are of their direct interest,
among them the MHM theme and the theme of environmental care.
Regarding relevance:
16. The program has taken into account the needs and requests of the recipient populations, of governments
municipal and local actors (neighborhood organizations and educational communities) in regard to: (i)
Expansion of basic sanitation coverage in areas for a long time excluded and with physical limitations
for the installation/expansion of sanitary sewerage systems; (ii) adoption of hygiene practices that
They improve the general state of health of the population, mainly of NNA; (iii) provision of the service
mosaafa maintenance by the EPSA; (iv) need for NNA care; (v) Interpellation of
social and taboos stereotypes around menstruation in the student population and in families in general;

(VI) Reduction of the incidence of domestic violence, mainly against NNA and against women; and (VII)
Availability of greater and better resources to respond to the purposes of climate change, mainly
floods
17. The waste collection service provided by the EPSA (Cosmol in the case of Montero), is one of the elements
of the best valued model, this service is adequate for the social, environmental and sustainability context
of the system.
18. There is no clear evidence regarding the availability to be paid (DAP), high or low, of families for services
From waste collection that Cosmol currently provides, this evidence should be generated from a study
target technician, carried out by an independent entity, in order to determine the relevance of the collection of
The current rate of 39 Bs. quarterly, for waste collection services.
19. The neighbors of the Guadalupe II neighborhood, in general, do not know the BES technology and the most frequent modality of
Health solution is the latrine with water drag and the blind well; While the PSSDU provides a solution
Satisfactory for the need for basic sanitation, natural demand for Bes technology is reduced.
20. PH/MHM school programs are valued as very useful, therefore, adequate and relevant, no
only for the student population but for the general population, as students are important
Replicators
21. The elaboration of Family Development Plans (PDF) was raised as a reduced intervention strategy
frequency with which, in general, families meet to talk and plan aspects that involve
Survival, development and harmonious coexistence in the home, in this sense this strategy is considered very
relevant as part of the protection strategy.
22. Within the Guadalupe II neighborhood, floods are identified as the main threat caused by
climatic factors, in this case by the rains, which prevent the normal displacement of the neighbors through
Certain streets, the CC component has raised different actions to respond to this problem.
23. The strategic approaches of the models are aligned to the context of public policy at the national level and
local, especially with regard to: (i) the strategic needs of the Bolivian State to reach the
Goals defined in the PDES, 2025 and SDG; (ii) The need for extension of sanitation coverage
decentralized (projecting a solution for 18% of the need for coverage that the municipality has
through Bes technology until 2030); and (iii) the ability of the mosafa to adapt to any floor
Ecological and climate.
24. The context of institutional weakness and fragility of political stability is one of the most difficult aspects to
Those who have had to adapt the implementation, on which there is no control, but has had the capacity
to internalize it; Given this context of instability, the strength of neighborhood leaderships and structure
Organic, specifically in the Guadalupe II neighborhood, is an element that has been well used by the
Program for anchoring the intervention.
25. The adaptation capacity of the Integral Protection of Children and Adolescence Protection is positively assessed
and climate resilience within the framework of the PSSDU, because it is a modular character program, which may well
It is implemented within the framework of the PSSDU, but also in that of other interventions from other sectors or in a way
independent; You can also implement different subcomponents partially or total, depending on the

In terms of effectiveness:
26. The strategies, approaches and operational methods of each component of the PSSDU have allowed to achieve the
expected results with a level of effectiveness that, although it has not been optimal49 - mainly due to

context factors that have limited the actions and achievement of some results - has been within the
Expectations established in planning instruments, that is, the logical framework and TDC.
27. The limiting factors identified are: (i) the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the social political crisis and, subsequently,
economic for which he went through (and still crosses) the country, since October 2019; (iii) that not all families
recipients had their documentation in order; and (iv) the rainy season (climate factor).
28. The identified facilitating factors are: (i) the waste collection and periodic monitoring service of the
Mosafa by the EPSA; (ii) the inter -institutional cooperation network that has been woven in favor of the
Program implementation; and (iii) the organicity of the Guadalupe II neighborhood and the active participation of the neighborhood.
29. The rate is a facilitating factor to achieve the balance of the model, as long as, on the one hand, it is guaranteed
The sustainability of the system, and on the other, is realistic and feasible for families to pay it monthly, if not
It meets these conditions becomes a limiting factor for the subsistence and development of the system.
30. In the framework of the PSSDU there has been an important socialization work and, above all, of development
Community, which has allowed generating a very positive perception of the beneficiary families regarding
Mosafa, this situation has facilitated both the implementation and the operation of the modules; in another
scenario (with a view to the replicability of the intervention), if this accompaniment did not exist or if it were
Poor, an unavailable perception of the population with respect to the modules can become a factor
that hinders the implementation.
Regarding coherence:
31. It is observed that there is an adequate causal relationship between the activities (strategies) developed by
each of the components of the PSSDU, the objectives of the program, and the results and changes in
The short term observed. (Review Graph 1. Reconstructed TDC scheme of the MSSDU).
32. In the future, and thinking about the scalability of the public policy model, the evaluation team considers that it is
It is possible to improve the coherence of politics by expanding the variety of the offer of sanitation technologies,
Considering other options in addition to the BES, and addressing interventions with a territorial approach, that is
Implementing the model in full neighborhoods, both considerations would improve the adaptability of the model to the
socio -cultural context and reinforce the logical step of the short -term to the long -term changes with
interventions at the neighborhood level.
33. Natural complementarity is observed between the components of wash and climate change, since
Mosafa are a sanitation solution and, in themselves, they constitute a prevention and mitigation strategy
of climate change; The protection component is independent, can be implemented within the framework of the
PSSDU as well as in the framework of other sector programs or autonomously.
34. The implementation of the three components in a combined manner has allowed to make available, both of
families, such as the community/neighborhood, the municipal government and the municipal technical instances,
benefits and tools packages, which allow at the same time addressing several problems that
Families and institutions are going through. At the operational level, it has facilitated the entry of the executing teams to
territory and address “in a single entrance” or in a single meeting, issues that involve health aspects,
Hygiene, protection and environment at the same time.
35. Authorities at the municipal and national level do not completely understand the integrality of the proposal,
Technical officials in the sanitation area often confuse the protection component from
a rights approach, with a risk management approach; They also consider that integrality and
Intersectorality in this type of interventions has been provided for in Bolivian regulations, and any program of
Sanitation must contemplate social variables.

Regarding sustainability
36. important elements of technical sustainability are identified (waste collection service by the
EPSA) and environmental sustainability (Bes technology and nutrient cycle closure); Regarding sustainability
financial, the system is likely to continue operating in the neighborhood in the short term, but under conditions of
subsidiarity, since by itself and on the current scale, the model is not sustainable, and expand the coverage could
Expand the financial gap and make the system even less sustainable for the service provider, already
that there is no evidence on economy of scales in the system or the availability to be paid of the
population.
37. It is also likely that, in the short term, the Luciérnaga CDI and the District DNA continue to function as it
they did during the execution of the program, to the extent that the agreements signed with the Government and the
GAMM allow you to have financial resources for it.
38. According to the final report of the protection component, it can be observed that the guidelines of
Care and upbringing of the families in the exit line with respect to the baseline, of what is
deduces that the effects generated from the training and awareness of families regarding
Parental care are little durable.
39. The effects achieved with the training of students on environmental care issues, based on the
Interviews with the same adolescents, survey of families and program documentation, are shown
potentially sustainable, due to the opening of this age group and its sensitivity regarding issues
related to climate change.
40. The sustainability of municipal policy, specifically referring to the construction of mosafa as a replica
of the program in the municipality of Montero, is subject to the availability of investment resources for
Reach the scheduled goals, it is unlikely that the GAMM meets its policy objectives in the
sector until 2030 (to build 3,000 mosafa), due to its reduced availability of resources50.
Regarding scalability and replicability
41. There is no natural demand by the population to install modules with Bes technology on account
Own, that is why the program has planned a first phase for demand generation; on the other hand,
The model's financial sustainability must be guaranteed, and clarity must be provided to governments
municipal, technical entities and national entities regarding the cost of implementation, operation and
System maintenance, before being inserted as part of public sanitation programs.
In terms of efficiency:
42. The program has assumed an important resources allocation in the category of management, leadership and assistance
Specialized program, and a minority allocation of resources to goods, services and benefits that arrive
directly to the recipients, in relation to the global resources assigned to the intervention.
Seting a priori parameters between direct expenses and indirect expenses could improve programs efficiency
financed through UNICEF.
As for gender and equity approaches:
43. The targeting of the PSSDU implementation in peri -urban neighborhoods has allowed its benefits to reach
to populations in a situation of vulnerability and to excluded territories, therefore to girls, boys and adolescents than
They belong to these families; However, within the Guadalupe II neighborhood the program has not reached the population
in a situation of extreme vulnerability, since it established as a requirement that families cover a

in a situation of extreme vulnerability they access the benefits of the program; This filter has been removed in the
Cobija Amigos Barrio, where a counterpart has been established in work.
44. The gender component is very important in the model, based on two central aspects: (i) the component
of menstrual hygiene management, which does not focus exclusively on adolescent women, but also
men and throughout the educational community, and (ii) the prevention and comprehensive care of violence against
Women, both in the family environment and in the community/neighborhood.
45. Finally, the rights approach to childhood and adolescence is central in the model, since the ultimate goal
It is to improve the exercise of NNA rights to access sanitation services, to live in an environment
healthy and protection, to live a life free of violence and, basically, of its right to survival.
7.2 recommendations
1. It is advisable to strengthen the implementation M&E system (particularly the mechanisms of
monitoring and reporting of the logical framework); In this framework, an evaluation is recommended
of PSSDU impact on the Guadalupe II neighborhoods of Montero and Cobija's friendship, as well as developing studies
About: (i) the impact of the Public Health program; and (ii) the environmental impact of the program.
2. Provide technical assistance to Cosmol to review and adjust the model and projections of financial equilibrium
System operation, specifically linked to the Bes waste collection service; In this same line,
It is advisable to provide technical assistance to EPSA to evaluate and reorient your sustainability plans.
3. Developing a study on the feasibility of implementing the sanitation system in a modular way is
say with more basic mosaafa variations whose implementation requires a lower investment of resources;
Within this framework, it is recommended to conduct costing studies for the implementation of the model with orientation to
the GAM, considering at least three types of GAM (small, medium and large) calculating the volume of
resources that would demand each case.
4. It is recommended to carry out a study on the availability to be paid (DAP) for the collection service rate of
solid waste, in order to technically establish the demand for the service; In this same line, it is
recommended to strengthen the communication component of the program, in order to inform and sensitize
to the population regarding the importance of supporting the service through the payment of a rate by all
Users.
5. It is advisable to make periodic diagnoses on the use of mosaf
population served, and reinforce communicational aspects oriented to social changes and
behavior
6. It is recommended to continue working to diagnose the problem of citizen insecurity in the neighborhood
deepening its nature, with the aim of designing an action plan to face and reduce it.
7. It is recommended to continue working the development of skills and change of adultocentrist behaviors,
by positive parenting guidelines, in order to reduce the prevalence of physical punishments as corrective measures
In nna.
8. It is advisable to continue investigating the processes for obtaining a perfectly fertilizer
innocuous, as well as design a business plan for commercialization.
9. It is recommended to strengthen the socialization processes of the model to municipal levels, departmental and

10. With a view to the scalability of the Public Policy model, it is advisable to continue generating links and synergies
with strategic guidelines at the central government level and subnational governments, as well as with others
institutions and organizations that work basic sanitation issues in territory.

Annex 7. PSSDU change theory: Semi -structured scheme presented in the third report to donor51
In accordance with the Sweden Embassy, UNICEF complements the narrative of the logical framework with the analysis of the theory of the
Change, which does not represent a modification of the program or approach of the program, but a supplement that contributes to
the description and analysis of what is raised in the logical framework.
The present analysis of the change theory, as a scheme of thought - action, describes the logical course of actions
adopted in the program, to conduct it successfully amid the complexity of social change processes
required to achieve the objectives set.
Graph No. 2 Socio -ecological model of intervention of the urban decentralized sustainable sanitation program

The image exposed here shows the ecological framework, which is the central approach of the theory of change adopted
by the program, because it identifies and visible the different levels at which the program must operate for its success, thus
as the integrality of the thematic areas of Wash, protection and climate change:
• At the family level, the program seeks empowerment and change in individual behaviors, the provision
of a solution (mosafa) and the strengthening of life skills;
51 transcribed textually of (pssdu, 2021)

Final Report
Evaluation of the urban decentralized sanitation program (PSSDU) implemented

• At the community level, neighborhood seeks to strengthen positive leaderships, change social norms on behaviors
related to climate change or hygiene from the school environment, or prevent violence by strengthening mechanisms
community to address and support the most vulnerable families;
• At the local-municipal institutional level, institutions seek to strengthen for better fulfillment of their functions
through the establishment or operation of strategies, regulations, plans, strong systems and capable of solving the
demand for services.
• At the departmental or national political level, the program seeks to influence two key pillars that are the formation of the
human resource and sector and intersectoral policies.
This theory of change suggests that a programmatically integral and coordinated work at these multiple levels, is what
which will result in the sustainable and complete change that seeks to achieve the program, stipulated in the logical framework.
Addressing only one of the levels or from a single thematic area would be inefficient or insufficient. Comprehensive results
Like those looking in this program, they require compound, prolonged processes, at multiple levels and from
different sectors.
From the theory of change it is possible to address the challenges of the logical framework, from multiple levels (partner model
ecological) and integrating programmatically: Wash + climate change actions + protection, since they are enhanced
among themselves, in addition to opening mutual opportunities, for example, the provision of an ASH service such as the construction of
The mosafa and the subsequent collection service, provides an opportunity for family dialogue and training in others
Aspects related to gender, detection of violence, health, among others. While work in communities
educational, on hygiene issues including menstrual hygiene, opens the doors to address bullying, harassment, reflections
on harmonious coexistence, equity, and even develop transforming actions of gender roles.
Complementarily, work with the neighborhoods and the community on protection issues, open the way to strengthen
Life skills, which are useful for all types of decision making, such as healthy practices against
Environment, or adaptation to climate change, strengthening, empowering and corresponding to individuals
and communities in local development. All in a circle that feeds and power through multilevel work
of the Socio Ecological Framework.
What types and levels of change can be achieved in the decentralized urban sustainable sanitation program?
The program does not only intend to achieve emerging changes (of natural adaptation to a fact) or changes
Projectable (result of specific actions against simple problems). The program faces a context
complex, compound and dynamic, so it requires to achieve transformative changes, which can imply
unlearn and modify social behavior patterns, mental, personal, collective or institutions, which are
hindering the crystallization of new realities, for a greater exercise of rights.
In this sense, the program works with a complexity of components, pillars and transversal that help to deepen
The change. Some program components, for example, infrastructure support, contribute to improving the level
operational; while other components, such as social, seeks to generate education through long presence processes
permanent in communities, neighborhoods and educational units, aiming to achieve changes in the way of thinking (level
of patterns) and in the way of understanding reality (fundamental/structural level).
These levels of depth in change are also allowed by the interaction of change transversals
Climate and child protection, which in turn enrich the reflections that are tried to generate in the context
selected, introducing gender elements, violence prevention, norms of coexistence, medium care
environment, even conflict resolution and culture of peace.

A deeper analysis of the program and its components allows to make viable that the composition and synergy of the actions
raised, points to the four quadrants, for example:
