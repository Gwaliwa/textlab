Executive Summary
Introduction
The following is a report on an independent evaluation of the integrated model and services
provided by Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) in Guyana to child victims of sexual violence and
their families. CACs were established by the Childcare & Protection Agency (CPA) with United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) support in eight (8) of the ten administrative regions in
Guyana. The aim of the CPA and UNICEF’s collaborative initiative was to ensure the best
interests of child victims of sexual violence were addressed, by introducing an integrated
service delivery approach and inter-institution cooperation nationally.
The main objectives of the CPA and UNICEF’s initiative were: 1) develop and implement an
integrated approach for child sexual abuse investigation to avoid duplicative interviewing; 2)
guarantee multidisciplinary involvement for all interventions to assure that the unique needs
of children are recognised and met; 3) bring professionals to the child instead of asking
children and their families to access services through many different portals; and 4) secure
the involvement of communities across the country, to help prevent child abuse and offer
child abuse victims the services and support that they need and deserve.
Evaluation Purpose, Objectives, and Intended Audience
The purpose of this independent evaluation was to assess the model and services provided by
CACs for child victims of sexual violence and their families in eight pilot regions and covered
the period of January 2015 to March 2021. Evaluation evidence was assessed using the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance
Committee’s criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and value
for money.
The objectives of the evaluation included:
(i) To assess and evaluate the CAC integrative model of service delivery.
(ii) To assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the CAC
programme implementation over the period 2015-2021.
(iii) To take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the goals and objectives of
the CACs.
(iv) To identify challenges (including the capacity to deliver) and opportunities (enablers
factors) experienced in the delivery of prevention and support services in CACs.
(v) To identify and document lessons learned, including those related to service design, the
scope of support provided, resources, and implementation.
(vi) To determine if the current strategies operational approaches of the CACs are sustainable
or not and provide recommendations for the process of institutionalizing and scaling up of the
CAC model and services nationally.
The primary intended audiences of the evaluation includes UNICEF’s Guyana country office,
the CPA, and the service providers ChildLink Guyana and Blossom Inc., which are managing the
operation of CACs in the eight regions. Other secondary intended audiences, include key
government members including Law Enforcement, Office of the DPP, Ministries of Health and
Education, Parliamentarians, local government and municipal authorities and professionals
working with children and parents at the local level, civil society organizations providing service
viii
in Guyana, as well, and the duty bearers and rights holders (particularly children and
vulnerable groups).
Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation used a non-experimental design and mixed methods that included both
quantitative and qualitative data. Furthermore, the evaluation adopted a Theory-based,
participatory, and utilisation-focused approach, integrating the identified information needs
of users as well as how they will use the findings. Evaluation methods included (i) Desk review;
(ii) Inception phase consultations; (iii) Partner/key informant interviews (KIIs) with
stakeholders; (iv) Beneficiary interviews; (v) Review of administrative data; and (vi) Value for
money assessment. The evaluation relied on both primary and secondary data. Primary data
sources included the data that was collected through key informant interviews (KIIs) with
stakeholders from UNICEF, national and sub-national government, implementing partners
(IPs), private sector and other UN agencies. A purposeful sampling approach was used to
interview individuals who had knowledge of and/or experience with the CACs. A total of 149
persons were interviewed, including 1 UNICEF staff, 10 CAC staff/partners, 14 key
stakeholders, and 124 beneficiaries.
Key Evaluation Findings
Relevance
o The analysis found that the objectives of the CAC integrated model of service delivery
for child victims of sexual violence is aligned to six SDGs, namely SDG 3, 4, 5, 11, 16,
and 17.
o All 25 interviews with stakeholders and partners yielded positive responses that the
CAC is aligned with national priorities. However, it was observed that at the
community level there existed norms and practice that were inimical to child
protection. These including older males targeting adolescent girls in particular.
Effectiveness
o The CACs, both at the operational and strategic levels, demonstrated that
multidisciplinary involvement was essential in ensuring that the needs of children who
are victims of sexual violence are identified, understood, and addressed.
o CAC eliminated the need for multiple interviews from staff of participating agencies.
However, in a few instances, matters directly reported to the police were not
immediately referred to CAC.
o In terms of the CACs ability to get professional from partner agency to collaborate in
service delivery, the CAC scored an average of seven (7) on a scale of 0-10 where 10 is
indicative of very effective. A partner divulged that “on the operations level about 8;
at the strategic level we are struggling, the MDT at the high level, heads need to sit
once a quarter.”
Impact
o Children self-reports show that 95% of them felt that CACs had positively contributed
to them making positive changes in their lives.
o From a parental perspective, almost nine (9) out of ten parents felt the CACs had
contributed to their children making positive changes in their lives. This overwhelming
positive response on the part of parents add to the burden of evidence that the CACs
have been contributing to positive changes in children lives after victimization
o Rising demand for services coupled with constrained resources have forced CACs to
ix
extend the responsibility of current staff which can result in physical and psychological
burn out. It was noted that at minimum of three core staff (forensic interviewer,
counsellor, and court support officer) will cost CACs US$2010 monthly. To increase
staff more resources would be needed.
Sustainability
o CACs provide an essential service and once current levels of child sexual abuse
continue there will be need for their service.
o UNICEF and government subvention were essential to the maintenance of CACs
quality of service and sustainability of operations.
Efficiency
o CACs reported several approaches demonstrating their efficiency in resource usage
including bulk procurement, collaborative training, and use of electronic documents
and reducing printing.
o Cost of service per child victim and family was computed at US$325. When compared
to the economic cost of violence this amount is small. In 2017, the global per
inhabitant cost of violence was US$ $1,988.
Value for Money Assessment
o None of the expense categories appeared excessive, for instance, the modal value
reported for telephone use was just about US$50 monthly, average stationery cost
monthly was US$50 per month, and annual expenses on toys and other child stress
relief equipment and supplies was US$150 per centre.
o The estimated value in terms of productivity savings ranged from a minimum of
US$67,368 and a maximum of US$114,863.
Key Conclusions
Relevance
o Conclusion 1: The CAC model of integrated service delivery for child victims of sexual
abuse and their families is harmony with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3, 4,
5, 11, 16, and 17 by disrupting and preventing sexual abuse of children and providing
broad child protection services for children who are victims of abuse in ways that are
both gender sensitive and culturally grounded, safeguarding their rights and mental
health, removing emotional barriers to continued education, building emotional
stability and resilience, and promoting positive self-image, child development and
wellbeing.
o Conclusion 2: Child Advocacy Centres are also important because they offer parents
with education and awareness about abuse helping them to understand abuse
including the signs of child abuse and how to protect their children.
Effectiveness
o Conclusion 3: There is overwhelming evidence that suggests that there is a high level
of satisfaction of the services received from the CAC among parents and children
o Conclusion 4: CAC eliminated the need for multiple interviews from staff of
participating agencies. However, in a few instances, matters directly reported to the
police were not immediately referred to CAC. Additionally, it was reported that a few
police officers are still questioning children.
o Conclusion 5: A key to success has been partnership the CPA and two well established
NGOs, ChildLink and Blossom. Blossom and ChildLink were able to establish
partnerships with police and justice officials. Additionally, other factors crucial to the
effectiveness and achievements of CACs success were their interdisciplinary
x
Impact
o Conclusion 6: The CAC integrated model of service delivery is demonstrating positive
outcomes for both children and parents.
Sustainability
o Conclusion 7: Current levels of sexual violence against children along with the
importance of CAC in providing a comprehensive response covering recovery and
access to justice make a strong case for sustaining CACs. Further, UNICEF and
Government funding of the CAC are the predictable sources of revenue for CAC and
are important to their sustainability.
o Conclusion 8: Judging from the cost per service in the context of the duration and
quantity and quality of engagements with child victims of sexual abuse, one can only
conclude that resources are used efficiently by CACs.
Efficiency
o Conclusion 9: The recurring costs associated with the operations of the CACs
demonstrate efficiency in procuring materials for operations. It also confirms that
resources are not wasted.
o Value for Money
o Conclusion 10: Without costing the psycho-social, parental capacity development,
promotion of pro-social behaviour and personal development, and prevention of child
sexual abuse, the analysis show significant return on investment.
o
Lessons Learned
o Lesson 1: An important lesson learned was that CACs make significant contribution to
children and families, including helping them to access justice, psychologically recover
from the trauma of experiencing sexual abuse, provide training for parents to better
interact with their children. It was noted that children and parents/caregivers who
access CACs would have experienced traumatic events that have caused them to
suffer physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual harm, and even post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) in some cases. Failure to process and overcome trauma can
have long-term negative impacts on children and parents/caregivers; thus, CACs work
with children and families have helped to improve their well-being and minimize the
risk of such long-term negative impacts.
o Lesson 2: It was observed that Working with boys was more challenging for CACs
because boys were reluctant and tentative in discussing abuse. These initial hurdles
have been overcome through patient confidence building approaches. An important
lesson here is that there is need for continued efforts in mainstreaming gender in the
training of forensic interviewers.
o Lesson 3: Another lesson learned was that success of the CAC model of service in
contingent on commitment and leadership on the part of NGO, the CPA and other
government partners. Important too is willingness of UNICEF to support the services
of the CACs. Programmes such as these take time to demonstrate results and in
eliminating the bottlenecks in service delivery. Persistence and patience are required
from UNICEF and the implementing agencies work to improve programme standards.
o Lesson 4: A key lesson learned was that a fully functioning CAC demands consistent
and ongoing training and support on treatment interventions, including the use of
trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy, the laws on sexual violence in the
country and on-the-job support to navigate the social, police, prosecutorial systems.
xi
Recommendations
Relevance
o Recommendation 1: CAC should formalise a blended approach (face-to-face and
remote) to counselling child victims and their parents. PSE should be prepared in
audio-visual format and shared with parents.
o Recommendation 2: Efforts should be made to refer poor families of child victims for
public assistance from the MHSSS and to fast-track applications and approval. Further,
a system of providing CACs with advance funding using an ex-ante system of approval
from the CPA for specific spending on special cases of poor families.
o Recommendation 3: There is need for comprehensive public education programmes
on the long-term impact of child sexual abuse and the benefits of intervention to
promote children’s recovery and access to justice. Efforts should also concentrate on
involving communities in detecting and reporting sexual violence against children.
Effectiveness
o Recommendation 4: There should be an initial orientation for police officers and
health care workers who were not exposed to working with children who are victims
of sexual violence. The orientation in the main should cover key working principles of
the FIT.
o Recommendation 5: The evaluation also recommends the immediate resuscitation of
the MDT to address issues and bottlenecks in the CAC integrated service delivery
model.
o Recommendation 6: Training in foreign language and communicating with hearing and
speech impaired children is essential if the CAC is reach vulnerable groups equally.
This should be an area of focus for UNICEF’s support for the CACs
Sustainability
o Recommendation 7: UNICEF should ensure that resources are made available annually
for training to guarantee quality in service delivery are maintained.
o Government and UNICEF should continue supporting UNICEF since their resources are
critical to the sustain the CACs
o Recommendation 8: There might be some indirect cost not included in the cost per
service calculation, to get a picture of the true cost of their service CAC should seek to
tally both direct and indirect costs associated with their service delivery.
o Recommendation 9: Support be provided to CAC to develop a system for data
compilation and retrieval.
Efficiency
o Recommendation 10: CAC should seek to further identify inefficient processes
through participatory staff assessment. Once the relevant information has been
collected, CAC should seek to refine processes eliminating superfluous activities.
o Recommendation 11: CACs should also seek to consolidate suppliers lists so as to
leverage economies of scale in purchase. Forging meaningful and trusting
relationships with a core group of preferred suppliers will result in improved and
seamless service.
Value for Money
o Recommendation 12: There is need for UNICEF to fund longitudinal research to value
the achievements of long-term outcomes for children and families.

1. INTRODUCTION
This was an independent evaluation of the model and services provided by Child Advocacy
Centres (CACs) to child victims of sexual violence and their families, which were established
in Guyana by the Childcare and Protection Agency (CPA) with United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) support. UNICEF’s Guyana Country Office (CO) in partnership with the Childcare and
Protection Agency (CPA) commissioned this evaluation to undertake a comprehensive
system-wide assessment of the CACs established regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 in Guyana
covering service design and implementation of the model, the reach of the programme,
resourcing, and involvement of partners. Overall, the evaluation brings an understanding of
what works well and what does not in the CACs model. The consultant, over the period of
June – September 2021 assessed the achievement of results in accordance with the
objectives, criteria, and methodology specified. The design of this evaluation was guided by
information garnered from a review of the terms of reference and the country programme
and project documents, including UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy (2018), the Evaluation
Norms and Standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) (2020), the UN-SWAP
Evaluation Performance Indicator (2016), UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards and
Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis (2015), and UNICEF-Adapted UNEG
Evaluation Report Standards (2017). Evaluations are essential because they provide assurance
that the intervention is really benefitting, not harming, the people it is designed to help
(Thompson and McClintock 1998). In this context, the evaluation offers evidence to support
the view that the CAC model is advantageous in helping victims of child sexual abuse.
Violence and abuse against children are global challenges. Every year, millions of girls and
boys around the world face sexual abuse and exploitation. One in eight of the world’s children
have been sexually abused and/or sexually exploited at some time in their lives and one in
every twenty girls aged 15 to 19 (around 13 million) have experienced forced sex during their
lifetime (UNICEF 2020a). One in four young women in Latin America and the Caribbean were
first married or in union before their 18th birthday (UNICEF, 2019a). In Guyana, 127 boys and
688 girls were sexually abused in 2020 (Guyana Chronicle 2021). Data from Guyana Women’s
Health and Life Experiences survey revealed that 13% of women in Guyana reported having
experienced non-partner sexual abuse before the age of 18 (Contreras-Urbina, et al., 2019).
Since violence undermines children’s well-being outcomes and aspirations, it is essential that
society intervenes to protect children from the horrendous consequences of experiences of
sexual violence and abuse and prevent unintended re-victimisation. Child Advocacy Centres
(CACs) were created as critical structures in protecting children who are victims of sexual
violence and abuse from further harm by primarily providing them with forensic interviews
and counselling to minimise any further trauma and assist in creating the environment for
holding offenders accountable for their actions. Since 2013, Guyana has adopted the CAC
model with the hope of improving its response to violence against children particularly sexual
violence.
The primary users of this evaluation are UNICEF’s country office, the CPA, and the service
providers ChildLink Guyana and Blossom Inc., which are managing the operation of CACs in
the eight regions. Other users of this evaluation include Law Enforcement, Office of the DPP,
Ministries of Health and Education, Parliamentarians, local government and municipal
1
authorities and professionals working with children and parents at the local level, civil society
organizations providing service in Guyana, as well, and the duty bearers and rights holders
(particularly children and vulnerable groups).

2.1. Country Context
The Cooperative Republic of Guyana is a small developing country that is located on the north-
eastern coast of the continent of South America between 10 and 90 north latitudes and 570
and 610 west longitudes. It is the only English-speaking country on the South American
continent. The country is bordered by Venezuela to the west (650 kilometres), Suriname to
the east (726 kilometres), the Atlantic Ocean to the north (436 kilometres), and Brazil to the
south and southwest (1,208 kilometres). It has a total territory of 214,970 square kilometres
(km2).

Guyana is a sparsely populated country totalling 746,955 inhabitants. Guyana’s small
population size results in a constrained fiscal envelope, which negatively affects public service
provision in the areas of public safety, child protection, education, health, and infrastructure
services. The population pyramid for Guyana is typical of population structures for developing
countries with longer bars at the base and concave or straight sides (figure 2). This population
pyramid is wide at the base, which means there is a large proportion of children and young
people in Guyana. The comparatively large number of children relative to the working age
population suggests increasing demands on an already constrained fiscal envelope. It follows
therefore that Guyana will need external support in meeting its obligation of service delivery
to children in areas of education, health, and protection.

For administrative purposes Guyana is divided into ten regions. Georgetown is the national
capital, and it is in Region 4. This Region has the highest population density countrywide,
which stands at 140.6 inhabitants per square kilometre. Regions 7 and 9 have the lowest
population density of 0.4 inhabitants per square kilometre. The national population density
is 3.5 inhabitants per square kilometre. The population densities of three (3) of the ten regions
are all below one (1) inhabitant per square kilometre (Regions 7, 8, and 9) and another four
(4) are all below 10 inhabitants per square kilometre (Regions 1, 2, 6, and 10). Low population
densities across these regions make it difficult to leverage economies of scale in public service

provision including child protection services.
2.2 POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL CONTEXT AND GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES
2.2.1 Political, Economic and Social Development
Guyana is a multiparty democracy with a parliamentary system of Government. The country’s
Constitution asserts that it is the supreme law of the nation. Fundamental to Guyana’s
Constitution is the separation of powers of the three branches of Government namely the
Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. Even so, all organs of the State and the Parliament
must act in accord with the Constitution. The Executive branch governs Guyana. The President is
the Head of State and supreme executive authority, and he/she is elected by the electorate for a
five-year term. The country’s legislative body comprise sixty-five (65) members. This body has
the power to pass bills and constitutional amendments. Bills approved by the legislative body
must be assented to by the President before they become law.
The administration of justice in Guyana falls under the purview of the Chancellor. The
Judiciary comprises Magistrate Courts in each of the ten regions and a Supreme Court
consisting of a High Court and a Court of Appeal. The lower courts, known as the magistrate’s
court, have jurisdiction in criminal cases and civil suits involving small claims. The High Court
has general jurisdiction in both civil and criminal matters. Appeals from the High Court rulings
go to the Court of Appeal (Adams 2020). The Director of Public Prosecutions is mandated with
instituting criminal proceedings against any person committing any offence against the laws
of Guyana.
The country is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). CARICOM has developed
a Regional Framework for Action for Children which serves to member states and
development partners both as a guide in the preparation of developmentally focused
programmes for children in the region and a benchmark to measure progress regarding goals
and targets set for children. Among the priorities of CARICOM’s Framework are protection of
children against abuse, exploitation, violence, child labour including worst forms,
discrimination, and neglect in Member States; formulate guidelines for policy, regulation, and
standards in early childhood development services; and devise comprehensive, sustainable,
and effective early childhood development programmes in member states (CARICOM 2012).
Since 2016, Guyana has been classified as an upper-middle-income country. The country’s
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP), in 2020, amounted to US$8,741 increasing by 42.8
per cent from US$6,122 in 2019 (constant 2010 US$). This level of growth is phenomenal
when compared to annual percentage growth of per capita GDP for 2018 and 2019 of 3.9 and
4.8, respectively (World Bank 2021a). Previously, Guyana’s economy was heavily dependent
on exports of precious metals, bauxite, and agricultural products. Following a series of sizable
discoveries of petroleum offshore in 2015, Guyana became one of the top 20 largest oil and
gas reserve holders in the world (World Bank, 2021b). Guyana falls within the medium human
development category with an HDI value for 2019 of 0.682 which positions the country at 122
out of 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Guyana’s HDI value increased
from 0.548 to 0.682, an increase of 24.5 percent. Between 1990 and 2019, Guyana’s life
expectancy at birth increased by 6.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 1.7 years
and expected years of schooling increased by 1.3 years (UNDP 2020).
4
Despite consistent economic growth averaging around four percent since 2006, 43.4 percent
of the country’s population live on less than US$ 5.50 per person a day in 2011 Purchasing
Power Parity (PPP) making Guyana one of the poorest countries in South America (World Bank
2021b). The 2019 Guyana Voluntary National Review informs that poverty among children
and young people was consistently high at 33.7% of people aged 16-25 and 47.5% for children
under the age of 16. A UNICEF Situation Analysis of Children and Women in Guyana concluded
that poverty is central to most of social maladies facing children in Guyana. Statistically,
children living in poor families in Guyana have lower probability of access to computers and
books; more at risk to domestic violence and other types of abuses; have higher probability
of being stunted and have higher chances of being out of school; significantly higher rates of
pregnancy among early adolescents; and higher likelihood of being among children in conflict
with the law (UNICEF 2016). Moreover, particularly in poor families, children’s vulnerability
was increased because of inadequate parental guidance and supervision as well as the lack of
financial support to satisfy the basic needs of the homes (UNICEF 2019b). Families living below
the poverty line are not provided with adequate safety nets and services to ensure that their
children have the same opportunities as wealthier children.
2.2.2 Government Strategies and Priorities
Guyana’s Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) 2030 establishes government’s priorities
for creating a more environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable society. Gender
equality, social inclusion, equity, and human rights are cross-cutting themes forming the
foundation of the LCDS 2030. The LCDS 2030 prioritises improving access to quality health
care and improving education to enhance personal agency and empowerment, and ease of
access in social and economic experience (Government of Guyana 2021). The issue of safety
from threats of violence in society is not addressed in the LCDS 2030.
Notwithstanding, the President of Guyana, on the observance of World Children’s Day,
emphasised that children’s rights are a priority for the government. The Head of State is
quoted as saying:
The foundation for a better tomorrow must be built on promoting greater respect for
and enforcement of children’s rights, providing adequate protection, care and
strengthening children’s education. The Government of the Cooperative Republic of
Guyana is committed to promoting the rights of every child. (Stabroek News 2020).
As noted in the terms of reference for this evaluation, the Government of Guyana, in 2019,
invested about 14.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in social sector programmes to ensure
basic social services for all, including children. Despite this substantial investment relative to
income, addressing the structural causes of children’s vulnerability is necessary and it is
imperative that investing in children be a focal point for international developmental
resources.
2.2.3 Violence and Abuse Against Children in Guyana
Violence in it various forms is much a part of children’s life in Guyana. Available evidence
suggests that the violence against children phenomenon is manifested both in homes and in
5
schools. The Safe Neighbourhood Survey (SNS) 2017-2018 and the Multiple Indicators Cluster
Survey (MICS) 2019-2020 confirm significant prevalence rates for violence against children in
the home. In the SNS 2017-2018, 33% of parents/caregivers reported that they spanked a
child in the last month and 10% indicated that they hit a child in their care somewhere on the
body other than the hands or buttocks with an object such as a strap or a stick (table 2).
It was observed from the MICS 2019-2020 data that 67% of parents admitted to verbal abuse
of children by shouting, yelling, and screaming at them. Further, 11% of parents emotionally
abused children by calling them dumb, lazy, or other derogatory names. Regarding physical
abuse, 34% shook the child, 26% hit a child on the bottom or elsewhere with a belt, brush,
stick, 23% hit or slapped a child on the hand, arm, or leg, 7% hit or slapped a child on the face,
head or ears, and 3% beat a child up as hard as one could (table 3).

MICS 2019-2020
Analysis of survey data from a random sample of primary and secondary schools nationally
suggests that aggressive behaviours are very much a part of children and adolescents school
life. Data from the primary school survey indicated that 37% of children reported being
beaten by school mate(s) and 31% said they were beaten by a teacher. Among Secondary
school students, 25% reported that schoolmates were physically abusive to them, and 19%
said that teachers or other adults in the school were physically abusive to them (UNICEF
2017).
A qualitative study on social norms in Guyana regarding emotional, physical, and sexual
violence against children disclosed that seven out ten persons interviewed opined that
6
physical punishment is generally considered as an accepted way of ‘managing and controlling’
children and a similar ratio of persons interviewed felt that emotional abuse in the form of
harmful words to children was accepted even though they did not subscribe to this practice
(UNICEF, 2019b).
Administrative data from the CPA also draw attention to the enormity of the problem of
violence against children. For the period January 1, 2015- June 30, 2021, there were 25,213
occurrences of violence against children reported and detected. Annual occurrences of
violence against children for the years 2015 to 2020 averaged 3,883. The three most prevalent
forms of violence against children reported and detected were neglect, sexual violence, and
physical violence (figure 3). The mean number of occurrences for neglect, sexual violence, and
physical violence against children were 1901, 850, and 816, respectively. In relation to victims
of reported violence against children for the period January 2015 to January 2021, girls were
more affected (figure 4).
Figure 3: Occurrences of Violence against Children reported to the Childcare and Protection
Agency, January 2015 - June 2021
Figure 4: Violence against children by sex, January 2015-June 2020
Moreover, it is generally believed that violence against children is gravely underreported in
7
Guyana. A media release reported the Director of the CPA intimating that the reports are just
the tip of the iceberg. Her position was that violence and abuse of children occur behind
closed doors and this situation is compounded because some children who are victims of
abuse and violence literally do not have a voice to report abuse (Guyana Chronicle 2019).
Underreporting of violence and abuse against children is believed to be linked to trust deficits
between child victims and care providers and law enforcement; families of child victims are
afraid that the child will be stigmatised; victims and families are fearful of suffering other
forms of violence; the parent who is financially dependent on the perpetrator fail to report
occurrences of child abuse over worry that they will lose their only significant financial
support; matters are settled with the victim’s family receiving a compensation; and some
teachers, social services staff, and health workers choose silence out of fear that they are
putting themselves at risk of being harmed by the perpetrators, even though these
professionals are well positioned to identify cases of child abuse (UNICEF 2016).
2.3 Child Protection System in Guyana
2.3.1 Factors causing Child Protection Issues in Guyana
Child protection refers to the prevention and response to violence, exploitation, and abuse of
children in all contexts (UNICEF 2015). A child protection system is the overarching framework
for the protection of children, and it comprises “a set of laws, policies, regulations and services
that are needed across all social sectors, but especially social welfare, education, health,
police and justice to support prevention and response to child protection-related risks”
(UNICEF 2020b, 4). Several factors provide significant rationale for child protection in Guyana.
Among the leading issues in child protection is poverty and access to jobs, transportation, and
public services, particularly in hinterland areas. The maladies of economic disadvantage in
Guyana include low educational attainment, teen pregnancy, substance abuse and violence.
For instance, in 2014, secondary school dropout rates among 12-15 years old were 11.9% for
the poorest quintile and 1.2% for the richest quintile (Henry 2019). Approximately 10% of
Guyanese population live in remote and hinterland communities where a lack of access to
services, infrastructures and transport makes children and families particularly vulnerable.
There is also evidence of high prevalence of alcohol and drug use among school-age youth.
Results from the 2013 Secondary School Drug Use Survey in Guyana showed that 52.2% of
the students had consumed alcoholic drinks at least once in their lifetime, 31.2% had
consumed alcoholic drinks in the last 12 months and 16.0% had consumed alcoholic drinks in
the last 30 days (Crime and Social Observatory 2013).
Another relevant issue is social norms that condone violence against children. One such norm
is the belief that girls are ready sexual partners and ready to mother children when they reach
puberty. In Guyana, 13 per cent of girls aged 15 to 19 years were married or cohabiting and
the adolescent birth rate stands at 71 per 1,000 women (Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of
Public Health and UNICEF 2015). Additionally, Suicide was the second leading cause of death
among 10-14 years old (8.2 per 100,000 population for boys and 4.1 per 100,000 population
for girls) and the leading cause of death among 15-19 years old countrywide (32.3 per 100,000
population for boys and 18.2 per 100,000 population for girls) (Pan American Health
Organisation (PAHO) 2017). Furthermore, available evidence also suggests that there are
limited intra-familial protective factors for children. Statistical returns from the 2010 Global
8
School Health Survey results show that only 36.9% of students were of the view that parents
usually understood their problems and worries during the past 30 days and just 42.0%
reported that their parents usually knew what they did with their free time during the past
30 days (Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) 2017). While government has been
responding to these phenomena, which have been increasing, more efforts are needed. Key
bottlenecks to be addressed are the limited budget allocated to child protection services,
violence-tolerant social norms, harmful substance abuse, awareness and prevention
programmes, and limited access to and availability of services.
2.3.2 Incorporation of International Human Rights Law
The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which was adopted by the General Assembly
of the United Nations on November 20, 1989, presents the goal of the international
community with regard to the well-being of children and prescribes universal legal standards
for the protection of the children against neglect, abuse, exploitation; as well as guaranteeing
them their basic human rights, including survival, development and full participation in social,
cultural, educational and other endeavours necessary for their individual growth and well-
being (UN 1989). Guyana is a signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the
Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Guyana ratified the CRC in January
1991. Guyana’s Constitution recognises the welfare of children as paramount and binds the
State and all government and State agencies, when considering the interest of children, to
ensure that the welfare of the child receives the top consideration.
2.3.3. National Laws and Institutional Arrangement
The Constitution of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana1 mandates a Rights of the Child
Commission to initiate actions to reflect and enhance the well-being and rights of children.
The Commission was fully operationalised in 2010 comprising 15 persons. Among the
functions of the Rights of the Child Commission as prescribed in Article 212V are promoting
the rights and interests of, and respect for the views of, children; ensuring that the rights and
interests of children are taken into account at all levels of government, other public bodies,
and private organisations when decisions and policies affecting children are taken; monitoring
compliance and making recommendations for the compliance with international instruments;
ensuring that children have effective means of redress if their rights are being violated; and
monitoring, evaluating and making recommendations on policies, procedures and practices
of organisations, bodies, and institutions in order to promote the rights of the child.
In 2009, Guyana approved several new legislations aimed at recognising children’s rights
congruent with the CRC. These laws include the Child Care and Protection Agency Act of 2009;
Protection of Children Act of 2009;2 The Adoption of Children Act of 2009; and The Status of
1 Constitution of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana Act. Retrieved from: https://www.oas.org
/juridico/spanish/mesicic2_guy_constitution.pdf.
2 The Protection of Children Act, 2009 governs the rights of a child in Guyana. Under this act, a child is defined
as a person under the age of 18 years and includes persons who have special needs, who is under the care or
protection by virtue of the law, has a disability or is certified as needing care and protection. The act stipulates
that the “Best Interest” of a child must be the primary consideration in any decision regarding a child by the
Court or any other decision-making body must abide by when making decisions about a child’s safety, health,
9
Children Act of 2009. The Childcare and Protection Agency (CPA) is a pivotal agency in Guyana
with responsibility for child protection. The CPA was established by the Childcare and
Protection Agency Act, 2009.3 The CPA is responsible for ensuring that all the provisions of
the Protection of Children Act 2009 are implemented and enforced (George 2010). Its mission
is to prevent, reduce, and alleviate the effects of abuse and neglect of children through
effectual services in keeping with their status as rights bearers in their communities and
families (CPA 2016). The CPA falls under the purview of the Ministry of Human Services and
Social Security. Even though the Agency’s main mandate is from the Protection of Children
Act of 2009, it is supported by other legislation such as the Sexual Offences Act of 2010 and
the Custody, Contact, Guardianship and Maintenance Act of 2011 (UNICEF 2019b).
According to the CPA’s 2017, 2018, and 2019 Annual Reports, the CPA’s staff strength was
stable for the period 2017-2019 at 165, 170, and 170 respectively. As of December 2019, the
CPA was 26% below is staff capacity. Available information indicates the CPA has a range of
supportive programmes. Figure 5 provides a snapshot of the impressive number of services
provided by staff of the CPA.
Figure 5: Selected Services provided by CPA, 2015-2019

Guyana has not conducted an independent review of its child protection system. However,
all things considered, recognition of children rights has improved in Guyana when compared
to the 1990s with the passing of several laws and the setting up of complementary
institutions; notwithstanding, greater progress is desired.
and well-being. In deciding what is best for a child, the Court or other agency dealing with a child must seek to
prevent harm coming to or continuing in relation to the child; ensure that family ties are maintained where
there is a healthy family environment for the child to grow in remove the child from their home but only
where it is necessary in the best interests of the child consider the need for the continuous care and stability in
the child’s life, the age of the child and his or her needs along with the need to have a normal family
environment.

2.4 Children’s Access to Justice in Guyana
Since the Government of Guyana ratified the CRC in 1991, it has amended the country’s
Constitution and passed several laws aimed at protecting the rights of children. These new
laws include the Sexual Offence Act (2010) and Sexual Offences Amendment (2013), the
Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Juvenile Justice Act (2018). Guyana has since setup
specialised courts such as the sexual offences court to accelerate the speed of trials for sexual
offences and a Juvenile Justice Department to address issues related to children in conflict
with the law. In 2010, Guyana also ratified the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of
Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and the Optional Protocol to the CRC on
the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2010. Consequently, there now exists
considerable commonality in terms of the rights protected by the CRC and those termed
fundamental in the Guyana Constitution, including rights to non-discrimination, protection of
life, freedom from torture, guarantees of expression, access to the media, assembly and
association, rights to privacy and freedom of thought, conscience, and religion (Child Rights
International Network 2015). Figure 6 depicts local laws and agencies that are mandated to
ensure children’s access to justice. It should be noted that in Guyana children and their
representatives can bring civil cases to courts in cases related to violations of their rights
(Child Rights International Network 2015).
Figure 6: Laws related to Access to Justice and Protection of Children
Kertzious et al (2012) are of the view that the Rights of the Child Commission does not have
the resources to carry out its function. They observed that only 12% of the Commission’s
US$85,000 budget was available for programme implementation with the bulk of the annual
allocation being utilised to defray administrative expenses including commissioners’ monthly
stipend. In 2019, annual expenditure was US199,000. In 2021, US$275,000 was budgeted for
11
the Commission. In 2019, 53% of the Commission’s expenditure was on salaries and
allowances (Ministry of Finance 2021).
In 2014 numerous inefficiencies in Guyana’s justice system were identified and documented
(Child Rights International Network 2015). These included outdated court rules and use of
outdated procedures; backlogs and delays in the Magistrates and High Court; perceived
inadequate performance of Magistrates and Judges; the quality of case presentation; multiple
adjournments; delays of up to seven years for a case to be completed; delays in handing down
decisions; poor facilities in court, police stations and prisons; low awareness of citizens of
their rights and responsibilities; and poor access to justice for the poor and vulnerable; little
victim care; and use of outdated procedures (ibid). Notwithstanding, the establishment of the
Family Court in 2014 and specialised Courts (2017) for sexual offence have resulted in
significant improvements by the judiciary in addressing family matters and sexual offences. It
has also been found that complainants are also more likely to follow through with their
complaints (Stabroek News 2020). Moreover, efforts to punish offenders in Guyana
encounter numerous barriers such as children unwilling to break their silence because of the
absence of child-safe and child-friendly spaces, slow resolution of prosecution, and children
traumatised because of having to repeat the story of abuse to several persons (e.g., teachers,
Child protection Officer, Police, and Prosecutor). It is important to note that in addressing
child sexual abuse, representatives from child protective agency, law enforcement,
prosecution, medical, victim advocacy, and mental health are called upon to respond to child
abuse cases. Traditionally, each of these agencies or professionals has distinct roles in the
investigation and intervention process and carrying out the functions linked to their roles
often resulted in the re-victimization of the very child they are attempting to help. The
Principal Investigator was advised in initial discussion with frontline personnel that prior to
the setting of the CACs a child under 5 years old was subject to lewd interrogation in the
Courtroom. The institution of the CACs was intended, inter alia, to reduce the number of
times children have to rehearse the hurt and pain of abuse, offer support to child victim of
sexual abuse through investigation and prosecution, provide a child-safe and child-friendly
environment for the conduct of interviews of victims of child sexual abuse, and cater for
therapeutic referrals for children and non-offending caregiver.
3. Evaluation Object
The object of the evaluation is the advocacy-specific activities and tactics undertaken by
UNICEF Guyana during its 2015-2021 programmatic cycle which resulted in or gave rise to
specific goals and outcomes that contributed to strengthening child protection systems,
towards the realisation of children’s right to be free from violence and abuse
including facilitating the decentralization of services, when needed, in order to better serve
and protect children and their families throughout the country. This report presents the
findings from the evaluation of UNICEF Guyana’s Child Advocacy Centres (CAC) (2015–2021).
UNICEF Guyana commissioned and managed the evaluation, working in close coordination
with UNICEF LACRO. The evaluation covers the implementation of the CACs in eight Regions
in Guyana during this period.
12
3.1 Child Advocacy Centres (CAC) and implementation in Guyana
A review conducted, in the year 2010, by the Government of Guyana (GoG) identified violence
against and the abuse of children as a key area of concern and reiterated its commitment to
the protection of children in Guyana. Further, the Ministry of Human Services and Social
Security (MHSSS) CPA recognised that traditional approaches to the protection of children
had not been the most effective and felt the need to modify its approach to reflect best
practices worldwide. This led the CPA formalised partnerships with UNICEF, the European
Union, and NGOs to pilot Child Advocacy Centres (CAC) to provide sustained and enhanced
child-focused services for children who have been sexually abused (Ministry of Social
Protection 2016). In 2013, the first CAC was piloted with ChildLink Guyana and in 2014 a
second pilot was commissioned with Blossom Inc. Both pilot CACs were in Region 4. In 2015,
UNICEF, UNICEF and partners expanded on the pilot for CAC by providing additional resource
to formalise programme design and enhance service delivery in the pilot region (Region 4)
and expand services to Regions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10 (see figure 8). UNICEF, the CPA, Child
Link, and Blossom developed a National Protocol for Child Advocacy Centres and Multi-
disciplinary Teams that outlined the approaches and building blocks to enhance the delivery
of services for child victims of sexual abuse.
Figure 7: CACs in Guyana, year of launch, region, Operating agency
In keeping with the Protocol, the goal of the CAC model of service is to create a model of
integrated service applicable to all regions in Guyana to meet the complex needs of children
suffering because of sexual violence, eliminate its consequences by ensuring that child victims
benefit from efficient child protection and judicial systems, have access to integrated services
providing psycho-social support, legal aid, and other support. The CAC initiative aims to
provide effective services to children who have been sexually abused and their families and
offer a model of multidisciplinary team practice for Guyana and the Caribbean region.
The key objectives of the CAC model of service are to:
i) to enhance and formalised an innovative service for victims of child sexual abuse
based upon an integrated approach and child friendly legal proceedings.
ii) Establish CACs in 8 in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 which provide services to child
vicitms and their families.
13
iii) Improve Interagency collaboration and cooperation to coordinate child protection
interventions in order to reduce potential trauma to children who have experienced
sexual violence and their families.
iv) Raised awareness on adverse effects of violence against children.
v) Develop the capacities of professional involved in child protection, teachers, police
officers, prosecutors, courts, and health care workers to ensure the best interests of
children who are victims of sexual violence.
The CACs were design as child-focused, facility-based programmes where representatives
from various disciplines collaborate to conduct interviews with children who have been
sexually abused and make team decisions about the investigation, treatment, management,
and prosecution of child sexual abuse cases. CACs are outfitted with an interview room which
is a child friendly space specially equipped with video and sound recording systems for
evidential video interviewing of child victims and witnesses. At CACs children are interviewed
by a trained forensic interviewer about sexual abuse that they have experienced. Interviews
with children are recorded and serve as audio-visual records of the child’s statement. While
the interview is in progress, it is observed on a screen in an adjoining room by Forensic
Interview Team (FIT) comprising Police Officer, Case Workers, and other FIT members. CACs
provide case management in close cooperation with the CPA, police, prosecutors, and courts.
This integrated approach helps in enhancing communication and cooperation among
responsible agencies in the best interests of the child, and reducing inefficiencies,
duplications, and omissions in service provision for child victims. The CACs also provide
support during the investigation and prosecution of child sexual abuse along with referrals,
therapeutic services, community outreach work, and aftercare for victims and caregivers to
guarantee that child victims receive protection, support, and gain redress.
CACs are developed on the foundation of collaboration among multidisciplinary teams (MDT).
The principal mission of the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) is to provide a coordinated, multi-
disciplinary responses to child sexual abuse resulting in interagency collaboration to
coordinate child protection interventions to reduce potential trauma to children who have
experienced sexual violence; to improve service delivery to children who have been sexually
abused and their families and reduce re-victimization; and to increase the number of
successful prosecutions of child sexual abuse cases (MSP 2016).

ChildLink and Blossom are the leading NGOs in Guyana involved in child protection. The two
NGOs regularly collaborate and share methodologies and good practices to equip their staff
with the knowledge and skills needed to carry out effective case management and risk
assessments, and to monitor and review children’s progress, and to evaluate the needs of
children and their families. Staff members at CACs are trained in psychology, counselling,
behaviour therapy, sociology, social work, and case monitoring and tracking. In addition to
leading on forensic interviews, CAC staff coordinate and conduct individual needs assessment
for each child and his/her family, conduct therapeutic sessions, support child victims and their
parents during court proceedings, and work with child victims and their parents/guardians on
immediate and long-term recovery. Expanding further, CAC staff offer parents/guardians
advice as to the types of care and assistance their child needs to fully recover. They work with
both abusive and non-abusive parents. In cases of child sexual abuse, CAC staff work with the
non-abusive parent to develop his/her protective capacities and abilities to recognize risk and
warning signs of abuse, to protect the child(ren) who remains in family care. The CAC staff
also provide, therapeutic and crisis interventions crisis interventions. In carrying out their
duties, CAC staff are involved in critical partnerships and work closely with staff from the CPA,
police investigators, and prosecutors. CAC staff work with the CPA in ensuring protective
measures are in place to guarantee children’s safety and well-being and with Police
Investigators and prosecutors to support investigations and conduct all pre-trial procedures
including forensic interviews.
3.2 Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) Reconstructed Theory of Change
Based on local context, a Theory of Change was reconstructed for this evaluation in
consultation with UNICEF Guyana. Child Advocacy Centres are widely perceived as being able
to contribute to social impacts. CACs are designed to reduce the stress on child abuse victims
and families created by conventional child abuse investigation and prosecution procedures
and to improve the effectiveness of the response. Thus, a fitting goal of the CAC initiative is
to ensure the best interests of child victims of sexual violence were addressed by introducing
an integrated service delivery approach and inter-institution cooperation at local levels.
The fundamental logic is that the CAC model of service is that child abuse response systems
should focus on the needs of the child and family and are most effective when the skills of
multiple agencies are successfully coordinated (Chandler 2000). CACs counters the main
issues surrounding conventional child abuse investigation and prosecution which subjected
child victims to multiple, redundant, and distressing interviews about their abuse by different
agencies. Even more, child victims were questioned by professionals who possessed little or
no knowledge of children’s developmental limitations or experience working with children
and in the main the setting where the interviews were conducted stressed already frightened
children (Pence & Wilson, 1994; Whitcomb, 1992).
The changes expected from the creation of CACs are access to support and rehabilitation
services for child victims of sexual violence and introduce child friendly practices to legal
and judicial proceedings in keeping with international standards. The CACs in Guyana were
created as One-Stop Centres to achieve positive related outcomes. The straightforward logic
is that CACs offers an effective platform to enhance coordination between public agencies
and professionals involved in the child sexual abuse response and intervention system. The
15
main outcomes expected are multidisciplinary support in integrated services for child sexual
abuse victims, influence legislation and policies at the national level to address child abuse
and specifically child sexual abuse and ensure that the relevant sectoral systems engaged in
prevention and response to violence against children deliver prompt and effective services.
The theory of change identifies the key elements of the logic model underpinning the CACs
including the problem, strategies, outputs, outcomes, results, and impact (see Annex A:
Reconstructed Theory of Change). The theory of the CAC model of service is aligned with
UNICEF’s Country Programme 2017-2021, which aims to strengthen child protection systems
to realise children’s right to be free from violence, neglect and abuse, including the right of
children to live in a family environment and their right to protection as a key element of justice
for children (UNICEF 2016).
3.3 Expected Programming Outputs and Outcomes Results
In keeping with the theory of change for the CACs, the expected results included:
(i) Establishment of CACs in eight administrative regions in Guyana (Regions One, Two, Three,
Four, Five, Six, Seven, and Ten).
(ii) Raised awareness on adverse effects of violence against children.
(iii) Developed methodology for integrated service for children who are victims of violence.
(iv) Children and families are better informed, recognize and report cases of violence against
children.
(v) Professionals (teachers, social workers, police officers, prosecutors, judges) cooperate and
coordinate actions following the best interests of children who are victims of violence.

3.4 UNICEF’s Role and Contributions
UNICEF’s country programme 2017-2021 for Guyana recognised the substantive prevalence
and incidence of sexual violence and abuse against children, particularly in hinterland areas.
Particular attention is given in the country programme to the strengthening of local child
protection systems in a manner that is culturally respectful (UNICEF 2016). Although Guyana
has made efforts to reform its child protection legislation, critical work remains to be carried
out on strengthening capacities at the legal, policy, institutional and service-delivery levels.
Bottlenecks and barriers include limited budget allocation to child protection services,
geographical challenges in accessing child protection services, the lack of cross-sectoral
coordination, and public attitudes. Violence and abuse against children fall within the scope
of UNICEF’s programme priorities of safety, justice, social inclusion, and child rights
monitoring. For these reasons UNICEF have been involved in the support of CACs.
UNICEF’s support was primarily focused on removing the barriers and bottlenecks in service
provision to children, scaling up service provision, enhancing service quality and
implementation of CACs in the eight regions in Guyana. The notable bottlenecks impairing
service provision included insufficient funding for child protection, inadequate knowledge in
responding to child victims of sexual abuse by clients and providers, shortages of social
workers and counsellors in the public service, poor support for training or retention of social
workers, and a failure to convert national policies into action plans. Key barriers included an
absence of effective programme coordination between and within partner organisations,
scarce financial resources, and inadequate training and support for duty bearers.
The Child Advocacy Centres programme, supported by UNICEF employed a mix of strategies
to support the realization of planned outcomes and outputs. The programmatic
components/strategies of the Child Advocacy Centres in Guyana 2015-2021 are translated

3.5 Roles of UNICEF and Key Partners
In Guyana, CACs are founded on the bases of joint efforts among the UNICEF, the CPA, and
their NGO partners (Blossom Inc. and ChildLink). Both Blossom Inc. and ChildLink has had
substantial experience in engaging communities and providing support services for children
who are victims of violence, abuse, and neglect. For over decade these NGOs have been
consistent advocates for legal and institutional reforms aimed at ensuring the rights of
vulnerable victims in the areas of social protection, access to justice, education, and
healthcare. Other key stakeholders include, the Guyana Police Force, the Ministry of
Education, the Ministry of Health (MoH), and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution.
See Annex C for the stakeholder analysis related to CAC. The stakeholder analysis identifies:
duty bearers with decision-making authority related to the intervention (e.g., government
officials, leaders, funding agency); duty bearers with direct responsibility for the intervention
(e.g., funding agency, programme managers, partners and staff members); individual rights
holders (who are the intended and unintended beneficiaries of the intervention); and other
19
interest groups who are not directly participating in the intervention while providing strategic
technical inputs into the intervention.
3.6 UNICEF Guyana Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) Programme Budget
UNICEF’s overall expenditure on the CACs for the period 2015-2021 totalled US$30,000. This
amount was expended on programme design (US$6,000), programme implementation
(US$18,000), and results and analysis (6,000) (see table 6).
Table 6: UNICEF’s Guyana Child Advocacy Centres programme budget by programme
components/strategies, 2017-2021 (million US$).
4. EVALUATION: PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, AND USERS/AUDIENCES
Considering context, UNICEF Guyana Office decided to commission an independent
evaluation of its Child Advocacy centres (CACs) with focus on relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, impact, sustainability of the CACs and value for money of the CACs and the findings
will inform decisions and preparation for scale-up.
4.1 Evaluation Rational and Purpose
The purpose of this evaluation is to obtain an independent assessment of the model and
services provided by CACs to child victims of violence and crimes and their families, which
were established with UNICEF Guyana support in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
Consequently, it is expected that the findings, conclusions, and recommendation will be used
to aid in the improvement of the implementation and quality of the services of CACs in regions
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, and eventually to inform the decision to scale up service provision
and sustainability. The evaluation also identifies and document lessons learned including in
terms of service design, scope of support provided, resourcing, implementation, reach, and
involvement of partners.
On the one hand, the evaluation was meant to be summative (backward-looking) to support
enhanced accountability for development effectiveness and learning from experience. The
intention was to understand why and to what extent intended and unintended results were
achieved and to analyse implications of the results. On the other hand, the evaluation was
expected to serve as a formative evaluation (forward-looking) to support the Country Office
and national stakeholders with strategic learning and decision-making for future
interventions with regard to improving the structure, functionality and quality of services
offered by CACs, and its eventual scale up and sustainability through legal and administrative
20
institutionalization and state budgeting.
This evaluation was supported by an Evaluation Review Group (ERG), consisting of
representatives of Child Protection Agency, Law Enforcement, and UNICEF. The ERG
supported and oversaw the evaluation process and reviewed evaluation findings and
recommendations.
4.2 Evaluation Scope
The 2015-2021 UNICEF Guyana Child Advocacy Centres (CACs), covered 8 territories in
Guyana. The evaluation took into consideration perspectives and views of all relevant
partners and stakeholders, including UNICEF Guyana staff, NGO partners, CAC staff, state and
municipal authorities (e.g., police officials, child protection officials, prosecutors, judicial
officials), and local service providers of social and health services (general
practitioners/paediatricians, hospital staff, social service providers), as well as children and
parents who have benefited from the services of CACs. Additional meetings with key
stakeholders at national levels (e.g., The Ministry of Human Services and Social Security
(MHSSS), through the Childcare and Protection Agency, including Child Protection Agency, key
government partners, NGOs, and other service providers were also covered, as well as
interviews with municipal authorities and other professionals working with children.
Gender, Human-rights, child-rights, and equity-based perspectives guided the evaluation and
data collection approach. Particular attention was paid to exploring equity dimensions of the
intervention. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive,
develop, and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias. Equity-based evaluations
provide assessments of what works and what does not work to reduce inequity, and
highlights intended and unintended results for the most vulnerable groups as well as
inequalities in outcomes for vulnerable and marginalized children and families. To the extent
possible, access to quality support and outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable and
marginalized children and families were explored in this evaluation.
The investigation included all relevant stakeholders including Child Protection Agency, key
government partners, NGOs, and other service providers. This evaluation assessed the
achievement of results of CACs for the period January 2015 to March 2021 in accordance with
the objectives, criteria, and methodology specified. The scope of the evaluation covered the
following dimensions:
▪ Temporal scope: covered the implementation of this programme between January 2015 and
March 2021.
▪ Programmatic: the evaluator concentrated on the CACs programme exclusively. The
evaluation considered all criteria according to the CAC protocol.
▪ Thematic scope: covered aspects of the CACs implementation. The evaluation looked at the
relevance of the CAC programme at the national and sub-national levels.
▪ Geographical scope: at the country level, this evaluation covered CACs’ work in Regions 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
▪ Stakeholders: All stakeholders who the evaluation deem relevant to a thorough evaluation
were engaged.
21
▪ Gender and Equity, Results Based-Management, and Human Rights-Based Approaches
(HRBA): assessed the equity and gender equality, and mainstreaming approaches. Particular
attention was paid to exploring the equity dimensions of the intervention.
▪ Value for Money: considered the element of economy and cost efficiency as additional
criteria which are related but sufficiently different and inform decision on a permanent union
between Value for Money and evaluation.
4.3 Evaluation Objectives
The objectives of the evaluation remained as stated in the evaluation terms of reference
(ToR): In keeping with the terms of reference, the main objectives of this evaluation were to:
1. Provide national-level stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the achievements
and challenges associated with the scaling and mainstreaming of CACs, approaches, and
practices.
2. Help country-level stakeholders understand how to integrate improvements in programme
design, implementation, coordination, and monitoring to maintain and enhance the CAC
implementation’s relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability.
3. Advise on how to use the evaluation findings to (a) support the scale-up of CAC
programming at the national levels, and (b) catalyse national discussions regarding the
necessary modification to the CAC model and delivery services.
4. Compile lessons learned and recommendations to inform the future rollout of the CAC
programmes
In keeping with the terms of reference, the specific objectives of this evaluation were to:
(i) Assess and evaluate the model, its implementation, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and
sustainability and, to the extent possible, its impact on children and parents of the CAC
programme implementation from 2015-2021.
(ii) Assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the CAC
programme implementation over the period 2015-2021.
(iii) Take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the goals and objectives of the

5. EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODS
5.1 Evaluation Design and Approach
The evaluation was both summative and formative. The evaluation relied on a non-
experimental design using mixed methods.. Utilising a participatory approach, the evaluation
sought to engage key partners in the planning of the evaluation, as key informants, and in the
validation of evaluation findings. Methods, data collection tools and analysis, all reflected
human rights and child rights considerations and was gender and culturally sensitive. Because
of the range of evaluation questions, the mixed-method design was necessary, since it
increases the validity of conclusions related to evaluation questions through triangulation.
This design facilitated the combining of qualitative and quantitative components of the
investigation, to ensure complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses.
Qualitative method provided opportunities for depth in the evaluation while quantitative
method allowed for measurable assessments. Moreover, equity analysis and value for money
assessment benefitted significantly from the mixed methods design.
The evaluation relied on a ToC contribution analysis. An overarching programme theory of
change was reconstructed during the Inception Phase to understand the types of changes
that were being anticipated, the different pathways through which change was intended to
be brought about and the influence of key contextual factors and assumptions that underpin
the internal logic of what the Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) programme has been aiming to
achieve. Contribution analysis will help in determining the extent to which the intervention
has influenced the observed result, the role the intervention play in attaining the result,
whether it is reasonable to conclude that the programme made a difference, how well the
programme is making a difference, the conditions necessary for this type of programme to
succeed. Further, the evaluation used a theory-based approach to identify pathways of
change and create a contextual understanding of the environments in which the CAC has been
implemented in different regions in Guyana. Additionally, the evaluation adopted a
utilisation-focused approach, and integrated the identified information needs of users and
how users will use the findings. Through the use of a participatory approach, the evaluation
process included duty-bearers, such as UNICEF, implementing partners, municipal and
national experts, and also rights-holders who were beneficiaries of UNICEF, children, their
caregivers and the broader community. Their involvement included guidance in evaluation
24
design, information sharing, review, and oversight.
5.2 Sampling Strategy
A heterogenous purposive sampling approach was used to interview individuals who had
knowledge of and/or experience with the CACs at the stages of planning, development, and
implementation. The sample included a cross-section of duty bearers and individual rights
holders in the eighth pilot regions. This approach facilitated data capture from urban, rural,
and hinterland areas and duty bearers at senior and middle managers, and frontline officers.
In those municipalities without comparable services, a cross-section of municipal authorities
(duty bearers) was sampled. Children selected were those who had achieved an appropriate
level of recovery from their experiences of violence and trauma to be interviewed.
Determination of appropriate level of recovery was based upon a combination of time post-
incident and/or time receiving treatment/services. Parents and guardians of the children
selected were also interviewed. Table 8 provides summary information about the sample of
respondents by region.

5.3 Data collection
The data collection aimed to capture a variety of perspectives through both primary and
secondary data sources. This evaluation used three tools (see Annexes G, H, and I) for data
collection tools which were developed based on the evaluation questions and matrix in
consultation with UNICEF-Guyana and CACs Centres. This evaluation used three main primary
data collection tools:
25
Tool 1 – Interviews with stakeholders and implementing partners such as Directors of CPA,
Directors of UNICEF-funded CACs, including both current CAC director, or their proxy, and the
directors during the UNICEF-funded period, municipal leaders, and frontline service providers.
The tool facilitated digital data collection and allowed for skips where the query was not
applicable to the person interviewed. The interview focused on the information and
perspectives of service programme development and offerings, service delivery mechanisms,
capacity, competence and resource, community engagement and participation, challenges
and barriers, sustainability, CAC services and its relevance to national priority, its contribution
to child protection and child development, its potential for national scale up, and perceptions,
opinions, and insights about the CAC model.
Tools 2 and 3 - Structured interview schedule for beneficiaries. One instrument was
developed for interviews with parents and another for interviews with children aged 12-17.
Queries for children and parents were designed to capture respondents’ experiences and
perspectives of the CACs regarding ease of access, nature and relevance of the services
provided, and perceptions on the quality and benefits of CAC services.
The evaluation has been carried out both in-person and remotely due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the section on limitations details out the challenges encountered, their
implications to the methodology and the necessary responses and adjustments made.
5.3.1 Desk review
The desk review for this evaluation covered materials on the environment in which the CACs
operate. Documents included relevant background documents including laws and policies,
strategy documents, programme documents, reports, manuals and guidelines, and secondary
data shared by CPA, Blossom, ChildLink, and UNICEF.
Regarding secondary data reviewed, the Consultant sought to understand how data were
collected, assembled, and assessed. Secondary data were also analysed to identify trends and
patterns of abuse of children and services offered to children and their families. The CPA
supplied data on violence and abuse against children.
The desk review was instrumental in the design and development of the Inception Report,
the evaluation methods, data collection tools and approaches, and documents for the Board
of ethics approval. Staff from UNICEF’s Country Office and the CPA were consulted to ensure
programme documents were properly understood, both in terms of merit and use.
Information from the desk review have been incorporated into the final evaluation report.
5.3.2 Inception Phase consultations
During the inception phase, the evaluator participated in briefing meetings with UNICEF and
CPA Director via Zoom. The meetings focused on planning for the evaluation, refining and
finalising evaluation methodology and data collection tools, securing Board of Ethics
Approval, and finalising evaluation schedule.
26
Staff from the UNICEF Country Office were in regular contact with the Consultant to ensure
progress in the implementation and quickly responded to request for information. Country
Office Staff were very supportive when the Consultant sought their help in securing the Board
of Ethic approval. The ERG led by UNICEF provided input and feedback into finalisation of the
Inception Report.
5.3.3 Partner/key stakeholder interviews
A structured interview schedule was used to guide the interviews with UNICEF Country Office,
Partners, and Stakeholders (See Annex G). The structured interview questionnaire was
designed to generate a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection
involved one-on-one and small focus group interviews (two to four persons), self-
administered questionnaire, observation, and feedback from field staff. One-on-one
interviews were generally conducted with Senior Officials from Institutions or professionals
from a specialised area. One-on-one interviews were conducted in person and virtually using
Zoom. Small group interviews of two to four persons were utilized when interviews were
conducted with staff of the same organization, institution, ministry/agency and centre,
including staff who work together as a team. Small group interviews allowed for some degree
of synergy and discussion on questions which allowed for more depth and perspective by
groups from the same organization, institution, ministry/agency and centre. In small group
interviews data were entered separately for participants. Overall, there were 18 interview
events involving 14 stakeholders and 11 partners. On average, interviews with national
partners and key stakeholders took one to two hours to complete. Additionally, information
was garnered from feedback from the 14 Team members.

5.3.4 Beneficiary interviews
Given that this is a mixed-method evaluation, the sampling methodology for beneficiary
interviews was also mixed. Data collection from beneficiaries were conducted in Regions 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10. Each of these eight regions were selected because they are the regions
where UNICEF supported CACs were established. A purposive sampling approach was used
for the beneficiaries. This was done in collaboration with Blossom and ChildLink. The selection
criteria shared with CACs prescribed identification of beneficiaries who were clients and
benefited from the services of the CACs for the period 2015-2021. During the engagement
with Blossom and ChildLink it was decided and implemented that only children who had
achieved an appropriate level of recovery from their experiences of violence and trauma
should participate. Effort was also made to ensure that there was diversity in the sampling.
Once beneficiary families were identified they were contacted and invited to participate. All
27
participation were voluntary (Annexes G, H, and I). Children interviewed were from the 12-17
age category.
Interviews with children and parents/guardians were conducted at the CACs to leverage
benefits of a familiar environment including ease of access, comfort, and well-being. During
the participatory engagement with Blossom and ChildLink all questions were reviewed, and
questions related to children’s experiences of violence or victimization were removed to
avoid revictimizing children and their parents/guardians. In the main interview questions
focused on the quality of the services received through the CACs, shortcomings and gaps of
CAC services, and the benefits and impact of those services. The interviews also focused on
shortcomings and gaps in services (See Annex I: Parents Interview Questionnaire and Annex
H: Children’s Interview Questionnaire).
Beneficiary interviews were conducted both in person one-on-one interviews (46 completed)
and through telephone interviews (78 completed). Parents and children were interviewed
separately unless a parent/guardian specifically requested to participate in the interview with
their child (in which case the request was accommodated). Interviews were conducted by
trained interviewers. Telephone interviews were adopted because for persons who shunned
face to face meetings because of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Those coming to the centre
were reimbursed travel and provided with a stipend for a snack.

Parental consent was obtained prior to conducting interviews with children, and children’s
verbal assent to be interviewed was also obtained. Both parents/guardians and children were
informed that their access to services and/or the quality of services provided was in no way
tied to their participation in the interview. They were also instructed that they could choose
to decline the interview and/or end the interview at any time or skip questions they did not
want to answer without penalty, and without anyone from the CAC knowing. Both
parents/guardians and children were provided confidentiality and anonymity in keeping with
international guidelines for human subjects’ protections and UNICEF ethical standards.
Interviewers collected data using tablets and Android smart phones. Kobotoolbox was
configured to support data collection. The software facilitated both online and offline data
collection.

Most parents and guardians interviewed were females (89%). In terms of the age of parents
and guardians interviewed, 8% were below 30 years, 34% were from the 30-39 years old age
category, 31% were from the 40-49 years old age category, 16% were from the 50-59 years
old age category, and 11% were 60 years or above.
5.4 Methods to ensure data quality
Overall, the evaluation sought to improve data quality through the triangulation of findings.
Triangulation is an essential part of the evaluation approach to ensure not only the credibility
of information and data collected, but also to allow diverse perspectives and experiences to
be captured. The evaluation used more than one source for data gathering. Data sources
included interviews, observations, questionnaires, and documents. Reliance on multiple data
sources aided in eliminating bias and increased the validity of the conclusions related to
evaluation.
5.5 Data Analysis process
Data collected was stored in Kobotoolbox before being exported. For the data analysis, the
evaluator utilized RQDA for qualitative data analysis and Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences (SPSS) for quantitative data analysis. Qualitative data was Data was coded and
analysed using grounded theory. Grounded theory methodology involves verbatim
transcription, coding of data, development of themes, comparison and contrasting of themes,
and recording of findings (Glaser & Strauss 2006). RQDA allowed for coding of transcribed
data along with the identification of themes.
Quantitative data analysis focused on descriptive statistics utilising tables and charts in SPSS.
Where inferential statistical methods were used, the evaluation used non-parametric
approaches because the sample was derived from a non-probability sampling approach.
Standardized coding procedures were developed by the evaluator for use in SPSS. Close-
ended questions from interviews were coded and inputted into two separate SPSS data
management systems for analytical purposes. One SPSS data management system comprised
close-ended response data from interviews with UNICEF, partners and stakeholders; and the
other SPSS data management system comprised close-ended data from interviews with
children and parents.

7. EVALUATION NORMS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The evaluation was undertaken in accordance with UNEG Norms and Standards for
Evaluation, UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection
and Analysis, UNICEF procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC), UNEG Ethical
guidelines for Evaluation (2008), UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN System
(2007). In addition, the evaluation was conducted in an independent manner, with key
elements of impartiality, objectivity, professional integrity, and absence of bias at all stages
of the evaluation process. Credibility was established as evaluation findings and
recommendations were informed by and grounded in the use of the best available
quantitative and qualitative data and analyses to meet organizational needs for learning and
accountability (UNEG 2016).
Special measures were put in place to ensure the evaluation process was ethical and that
participants could openly provide information and express their opinions in confidence.
Sources of information were protected and only known to the evaluator and interviewers. All
collected data were protected and coded to ensure anonymity. In data collection all
participants were informed of the context and purpose of the evaluation, and guaranteed
confidentiality. To ensure confidentiality, all interviewees were assigned an identifier at the
time of the interview which was automatically generated. To ensure that the key ethical
principles for the conduct of evaluation involving human subjects are followed, each potential
respondent were given full information about the evaluation including the purpose and
potential benefits of the evaluation, their rights, and how the information collected will be
used. They were also informed that all data were kept confidentially and were only accessible
by members of the assessment team. Verbal consent was secured from all those who agreed
to participate. All participants were informed of their right to discontinue their participation
at any point and approaches for ensuring confidentiality were described. Parental consent
was sought for children participating in data collection and researchers observed the norms
and standards outlined in the document “Ethical Research Involving Children”.7 Impartiality,
credibility, responsibility, honesty8 and integrity9 underpinned all activities in the evaluation.
In addition, the team-maintained respect for the dignity and diversity of the individuals
interviewed, and respect for human rights, gender equity and equality10 throughout the

7.1 Ethical Review
Before field data collection, the Consultant sought the approval of the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee, who are responsible for reviewing research proposals and
granting permission to conduct research in Guyana. The IRB operates under the provision of
Regulation (2007) of the Ministry of Health Act (6 of 2005) of the Laws of Guyana. The IRB in
Guyana affords harmonisation of multidisciplinary ethical reviews aimed at improving the
protection of human participants in all aspects of social, medical, and health-related research
involving human beings, human material, and data. Ethical approval was received from the
IRB (see Annex K: Research Ethic Approval). The IRB assessed the proposal for methodological
soundness, absence of undue risk relative to perceived benefits, special protections provided
for children, inform consent from each human subject or the subject’s legally authorized
representative prior to their participation in the evaluation, and informed assent from
children prior to their participation in the evaluation. Further, the IRB sought to confirm the
presence of protocols for the protection of subjects’ identities, for the protection of collected
data, and for ensuring that analyses do not result in violations of confidentiality and/or
anonymity. The IRB also reviewed interview questionnaires and other data collection
instruments, and interviewee recruitment plan.
7.2 Ethical Issues and Safeguards
The Child Advocacy Centres (CACs) evaluation of UNICEF Guyana was conducted in line with
the UN Evaluation Group (UNEG) Ethical Guidelines for Evaluations, UNEG Code of Conduct
for Evaluation in the UN System 2007, the United Nations Guidance for Integrating Human
Rights and Gender Equality in Evaluations, and UNICEF’s requirements for ethical research
involving children. All work with children has been done in their best interests and under the
ethos of “do no harm”. The evaluation team adhered to UNICEF’s Procedure for Ethical
Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis and the UNICEF-Adapted
UNEG Evaluation Reports Standards. This means that the evaluation team upheld the
appropriate obligations of evaluators, including maintaining the independence, impartiality,
credibility and accountability of the individual team members and the evaluation process. The
evaluation team was not subject to any conflicts of interest and confirmed that they were
able to carry out the evaluation without any undue interference. With respect to ethical
approaches to managing client and evaluation participant data (applying to the content of
interviews), the evaluation specifically ensured the following:
1) Respect for dignity and diversity: We respected the differences in culture, local
customs, religious beliefs, gender, disability, age and ethnicity and the potential
implications of these when carrying out our research. We took steps to minimise any
risk of disruption to the respondents, provided ample notice and respect their privacy.
Towards UNEG Guidance,www.uneval.org/document/detail/980
32
2) Rights: We ensured that participants were treated as ‘autonomous agents’ and were
given the time and information to decide whether or not they wished to participate,
and not pressurized into participating. The participants were selected as per the
defined sampling methodology. We complied with codes of conduct governing
vulnerable groups, such as young people.
3) Redress: Participants were provided sufficient information to seek redress and how to
register a complaint.
4) Confidentiality: We have respected the respondent's right to provide information in
confidence and made them aware of the scope and limits of confidentiality. Names
and any other sensitive information have been anonymised.
5) Data security: Data was stored systematically, securely, and in a way that made it
accessible to the evaluation team only. If requested and following appropriate
anonymisation, the data will also be shared with UNICEF.
8. RISKS AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Minimising and mitigating risks during the evaluation were essential elements in the
planning and implementation of the evaluation. The following approaches were adopted
for risk reduction and mitigation:
(i) Regular debriefing and feedback from field interviewers to identify challenges
and problems during data collection that may affect interviewee.
(ii) When children or other vulnerable groups become upset during an interview, the
interview was cancelled immediately and a psychologist from the CAC was invited
to counsel the participant.
(iii) The Consultant ensured that only data necessary for the evaluation was collected
and only a minimum number of identifiers necessary was collected
(iv) The Consultant took steps to ensure anonymity and confidentiality to minimize
risk to human subjects.
(v) The Consultant securely stored data so that the confidentiality of the subjects is
preserved.
9 Findings
This section presents the findings of the evaluation, responding directly to the evaluation
criteria and questions (Annex B). The section was developed using findings from the desk
review, data collection from parents and children, and interviews with key stakeholders,
including CPA, UNICEF, Blossom, and ChildLink. The findings are presented under the
Development Assistance Committee of the Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD/DAC) criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability and the
value for money criteria of Economy and Cost-efficiency.
Further, the findings are presented so that readers of the report know the characteristics of
respondents who are quoted throughout the findings section of this report. Respondents are
referred to as partners (respondents from government agencies, UNICEF, and NGOs),
stakeholders (community members), parents, and children.
33
9.1 Relevance
Evaluation questions related to relevance focused on the extent to which the intervention’s
objectives and design responded to beneficiaries and partner/institution needs, policies and
priorities.
Findings related to relevance are grouped under four (4) themes:
(i) intervention’s alignment with international goals and priorities including UNICEF’s
Country Programme;
(ii) alignment with national priorities and needs of the Government;
(iii) evidence demonstrating that CACs provide access to support services for child victims
of sexual abuse and Families; and
(iv) importance of CAC to children and families.
9.1.1 Relevance to International Goals and Priorities
The CAC model of integrated service delivery for child victims of sexual abuse and their
families is harmony with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3, 4, 5, 11, 16, and 17 by
disrupting and preventing sexual abuse of children and providing broad child protection
services for children who are victims of abuse in ways that are both gender sensitive and
culturally grounded, safeguarding their rights and mental health, removing emotional barriers
to continued education, building emotional stability and resilience, and promoting positive
self-image, child development and wellbeing. Interviewees with knowledge of the SDGs all
confirmed that the services offered by the CACs contribute to the achievement of SDG 3, 4,
5, 11, 16, and 17. Based on the information collected the table below was prepared to offer a
comparative look at the CAC model of service and relevant SDG goals.

development.
The CAC model of service delivery is also in harmony with the UNICEF’s Country Programme
Document (2017-2021). Areas of alignment include strengthening capacities and promoting
cross-sectoral collaboration to prevent and address violence, neglect and abuse of children;
protecting children from violence and strengthening national and local capacities related to
service delivery; and accelerating the universal realization of children’s rights by fostering
greater social inclusion, especially for the most disadvantaged and excluded children and
families. Data already presented on children interviewed revealed that both boys and girls are
benefiting from the CAC model of service, and as was explained, recognition of the specific
gender needs of children are considered during service provision.
9.1.2 Alignment with National Priorities and Needs of the Government
The CAC delivery of integrated services to child victims of sexual abuse and violence and their
families to a great extent has been in line with the Government of Guyana priorities to
improve child protection system, enhance the monitoring of child rights, and respond
appropriately to abuse and violence against children. As was relayed to the Consultant by a
member of a partner organisation “over the past 15 years the national government has placed
particular emphasis on preventing violence and safeguarding children and in particular
addressing physical and sexual abuse against children.” CACs are helping protecting victims
and helping in making perpetrators accountable for their actions. This view was confirmed
unanimously by partners and stakeholders interviewed as they concluded that the CAC model
of service is aligned with national priorities and the needs of government.

by offering child friendly areas and
specialist forensic interviewing to
help children share their experiences of violence and abuse free of intimidation. As explained
by a respondent from a partner agency “Before the CACs a number of children have
experienced deep level of trauma without any kind of support, the CACs fills this gap and now
even adults are getting the support for issues that occurred in their childhood but [were] not
addressed.” Victims of child sexual abuse needs to be listened to in a non-judgemental
manner and in an environment that they perceive as safe, and they would like to see their
perpetrators be brought to justice for abusing them. Additionally, support in helping them
overcome the psychological harms associated with abuse. The CACs model of service helps in
these areas. “CACs provide comprehensive service in ways that the beneficiaries are
safeguarded” reported a partner. “CACs provide opportunities for children to tell their story
in a safe manner without being humiliated,” a stakeholder stated. The CACs “provide a safe
space with trained forensic interviewers and counsellors to record the child statement of
sexual abuse and provide trauma-based counselling to aid in the healing from sexual abuse”
explained a respondent from a partner agency.
Responses from children and parents demonstrated that the CAC model of service had made
it easier for them to access needed service with 97% saying yes, the CAC model of service has
made it easier to receive needed help and support. For boys, 82% said yes, the service has
made it easier to access needed help and support; 100% of girls said CAC made it easier for
them to access needed services. Moreover, 94% of parents claimed that the CACs made it
easier for them to receive help.

Combined girls and boys 97%
Girls 100%
Boys 82%
Parents 94%
CACs also aided in increasing access to justice for children and helped in holding perpetrators
of violence and abuse against children accountable. This contribution is mainly through giving
a chance to child vicitms to tell their story and taking their story to build a case against
perpetrators. This evidence suggest that CACs are making this possible. “More children have
better access to services to tell their stories, to have the CAC document their statement which
has led to more cases reaching the court and more successful convictions.” “Every case that
make it to the in court there is an increase chance that there will be a conviction” stated a
respondent from a partner agency.
It has been noted that in many cases of child sexual abuse children were denied justice either
because families were embarrassed with the nature of the police interviews, children were
afraid to tell their experience of abuse, or families were frustrated with having to go to several
agencies. These hurdles were removed by the CAC. As explained “some families are too
embarrassed to follow-up or do not have the contacts to get their matter to the Court, CACs
help them here.” Partner agency praised the efforts of CACs in following-up with Investigators
and the Chambers of the Director of Public Prosecution on progress of matters. “Yes, they
make it hard for perps to get away, they follow-up constantly and on their responsibility for
the most part forensic interviews reports are timely submitted, even though there is room for
improvement here.”
Partners and stakeholders also perceived that in at least in two ways CACs were making useful
contributions to children who were vicitms of abuse, namely, increasing access to justice and
improving service delivery. The data from the interviews indicate that 93% of stakeholders
and 100% of partners were of the view that CACs improved access to justice and 100% each
of partners and stakeholders agreed that CACs have improved integrated service delivery to
child victims of sexual violence (figure 15). Moreover, the CAC’s provision of court support-
before, during and after trial was important in keeping child victims and their families engaged
leading to the advancement of the matter in the courts. On the other hand, stakeholders
complained that even though there have been some improvements due to the advocacy of
CAC, parents and community members are still not sufficiently reporting violence and abuse
against children. Additionally, the shortage of judges and the COVID-19 pandemic have both
severely affected efforts to prosecute offenders.
37
Figure 10: Partner and stakeholder views on CAC model of service (N=25)
9.1.4 Importance of CAC to children and families
Respondents’ views were sought on how important CACs are to children who experienced
sexual abuse and violence. They were asked to rate CACs on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1=not
important to 10=very important). Additionally, they were asked to rate how important CACs
are to their municipality/region. Figure 16 depicts that all respondents felt that the CACs are
very important to children who experience sexual abuse and violence. The combined
responses averaged 10 on a scale of 1-10. Further, when stakeholders from the various
regions were asked how important the CACs are to the regions, their scores too averaged 10
(scale of 1-10).
Figure 11: Respondents perception on the importance of CACs to child victims of abuse and
violence
A logical inquiry in the analysis is what contributed to the high ratings on the importance of
CACs? According to partners and stakeholders the CAC model service were important because
“CACs make the children receive both justice and therapy in a comfortable environment with
no fear or hesitancy.” The importance of CACs was best presented through a comparison of
what existed before. Prior to the implementation of the CAC, it was explained that “children
had to tell their stories several times and at times in terrifying situations to Teachers, CPA,
Police, Medical Staff, Prosecutors, and Magistrates/Judges.” Thus, CACs importance is linked
to the fact that they “reduce the number of times children have to rehearse the hurt and pain
of abuse.” This respondent continued “the integrated service delivery of the CAC is
38
comprehensive, they now have to only turn up to one location, before they had to go to
several agencies sometimes more than once.” “The previous lengthy and repeated process
often discouraged victims and their parents resulting in them refusing to continue seeking
justice,” explained a stakeholder.

help parents to better understand the nature of
child abuse and how they can emotionally support
their child and prevent further abuse. “The work done with parents helped them to
understand abuse including the signs of child abuse and how to protect their children. These
parents have also reported that they have empowered neighbours and friends in preventing
and recognizing child abuse in their communities.” Another Partner observed “Parents would
later come and say that they are now able to better listen to their child and paying more
attention to the concerns of their children.” Additionally, the researcher was told that the PSE
helped parents in communicating with their child.
Survey of Children and Parents Views on Importance of CACs
Quantitative survey data also highlighted the contribution of CACs in helping child vicitms
to access needed services. It was observed from the data that 97% of children and 94%
of parents stated that CACs made it easier for them to receive help and support. These
results further emphasise the relevance of CACs for parents and children.
The data show that 97% of children said that counselling services helped them, 48% of
children felt that the forensic interview helped them, 14% felt that legal advice/court
support was helpful to them, and 12% felt the referrals helped them. Only 2% of children
were of the view that none of the CAC services helped them.
Child beneficiaries also felt that CACs are very important and relevant to children and
families in Guyana because of much needed suite of services they offer. Girls though
considered the CAC more important scoring it an average of 8.8 on scale of 1 to 10 (scores
> than 7 suggest the service is very important). Boys scored it at 7.9 which is
approximately 10% less than the average rating scores given by girls.
In Annex D the evaluation presents a summary table on the status of indicators of relevance
in the evaluation matrix.
9.2 Effectiveness
The key question is to what extent were the intended outputs/outcomes, realized? What
were the enablers? What were the bottlenecks and how, if at all, where they addressed? As
mentioned earlier in the report there no results framework for the CAC, therefore
effectiveness is assessed based on the system created by the evaluation tool. The findings on
39
effectiveness are grouped under the following seven (7) themes: (i) extent to which
programme objectives are attained; (ii) parents and children’s satisfaction with the CAC’s
Model of service; (iii) improving access to services and access to justice for children including
vulnerable and marginalized children (iv) effectiveness of capacity building activities for CAC

9.2.1 Extent to which Programme Objectives are attained
Table 16 below provides a summary assessment on whether the CAC project attained its
objectives.
Table 16: Extent to which CACs attained objectives
Objectives of CACs in Guyana Extent to which Comments
objectives are
achieved (Fully,
Partially, Not
achieved)
An integrated approach for child Fully CAC eliminated the need for multiple
sexual abuse investigation to avoid interviews from staff of participating
duplicative interviewing agencies. However, in a few instances,
matters directly reported to the police were
not immediately referred to CAC.
Additionally, it was reported that a few
police officers are still questioning children.
Multidisciplinary involvement for all Fully The CACs, both at the operational and
interventions to assure that the strategic levels, demonstrated that
unique needs of children are multidisciplinary involvement was essential
recognised and met in ensuring that the needs of children who
are victims of sexual violence are
identified, understood, and addressed.
Bringing professionals to the child Fully The CACs are referred to as one-stop
instead of asking children and their centres because the provide child victims
families to access services through with access professional interviewing,
many different portals trauma focused counselling, and emotional
and court support as part of their suite of
assistance.
Involvement of communities across Partially The CACs have conducted numerous public
the country to help prevent child education programmes annually that have
abuse and offer child abuse victims yielded some positive results as it relates to
the services and support that they community support for the prevention of
need and deserve child abuse; however, certain norms that
are prevalent in communities are inimical to
preventing child sexual abuse and making
offenders accountable. Therefore,
continued public education is necessary.
The CACs are centre-based services that helps children who are victims of sexual abuse and
their families by providing a confidential and physically and psychologically safe environment
for them to narrate experiences of abuse. As was noted previously, CACs have been able to
prevent duplicative interviews of child victims of sexual abuse by facilitating forensic
40
interviews that are legally sound and neutral in nature and allow for live observation of
interviews by participating agencies. How is this achieved? CACs use of expert interviewers
have proven to be very useful in drastically eliminating the need for law enforcement to
directly confront and interrogate children to capture evidence of sexual abuse. Instead, CAC
interviewers get children to share because through training they “know how to talk to
children and are getting them to share more evidence of the abuse.” Further, it was explained
that since all parties are able to observe the interviews in real time, police and prosecutors
can “request clarification or follow-up questions through the forensic interviewer.”
Moreover, with the “DPP office on Board they can advise on what information is required to
complete the case file”, recounted a partner. Prior to the multidisciplinary approach
implemented by the CAC, case files were often returned to the police investigators for more
evidence to complete the case file. This meant that investigators had to reengage the victims
every time more information is requested by the Chambers of the DPP. “The CAC considerably
reduced the number of times additional information was requested by the Chambers of the
DPP to complete case files,” an interviewee explained.
Another factor leading to effectiveness of the intervention is that multidisciplinary
involvement in the intervention assures that the unique needs of children are recognised and
met. The CAC model of service, both at the operational and strategic levels, demonstrates
that multidisciplinary involvement is essential in ensuring that children’s needs are identified,
understood, and addressed. At the operational level the forensic interview teams comprise
officers from the police, the CPA, and the CACs. At the strategic/policy level the
Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) consists of the Director of the CPA, Crime Chief of the Guyana
Police Force, Directors of the CAC, Chambers of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ministry
of Public Health, and the Ministry of Education. The MDT addresses policies, legislations, and
systemic changes to synergise child protection mechanisms for investigations, treatment, and
prosecutions of child sexual abuse cases. The MDT receives quarterly reports from the
Directors of the CACs and meets twice yearly. However, since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic the MDT has not been meeting. Partners are of the view that it is important that
the MDT find ways of coordinating meetings to carry out their functions. Forensic teams too
have been affected by the pandemic and were temporarily postponed; however, they remain
active in service to child victims. Next, CACs has been successful in eliminating the need for
child vicitms to visit several agencies for support. The CACs are referred to as one-stop centres
because the provide child victims with access professional interviewing, trauma focused
counselling, and emotional and court support as part of their suite of assistance. Parents
report that CAC provided child friendly interviewing, arranged for medical and health checks,
court support, counselling, and emotional support. The CACs also build parental capacity
through their parental skills education training. One parent opined CAC “has given me
pointers on how I can contribute to the recovery of my child. It helped me to put better
systems in place for my child in order to avoid a repeat of what transpired in the past.”
The CACs have conducted numerous public education programmes annually that have yielded
some positive results as it relates to community support for the prevention of child abuse;
however, certain norms that are prevalent in communities are inimical to preventing child
sexual abuse and making offenders accountable. For instance, CACs reported conducting
sensitisation programmes for children and parents in the regions they operate. In 2020 with
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, CACs turned to social media to continue with their
41
public education campaigns. CACs also utilised the print media to disseminate their public
education information related to the prevention of child sexual abuse and for holding
offenders accountable. One partner detailed that since communities are being sensitised,
they are becoming more aware of the services offered by Blossom/ChildLink. So now there is
an increase in reports of child abuse and sexual violence against girls and boys.” Another
partner pointed out that “once the CACs were established and services were available child
victims and families found it easier to come forward, what I mean is that people are more
comfortable to report abuse.”
Notwithstanding, some progress in getting communities to assist with the prevention of child
sexual abuse there are some norms, attitudes, and practices that have remained resistant to
change and continue to endanger children. High among these are child marriages (Thompson
2020) which encourages older men to adolescent girls. A stakeholder advanced the view that
the problem of child sexual abuse is caused by “Children left unsupervised, parents are poor,
and people take advantage of children, and children going to adult parties.” Another
stakeholder explained that “In Close knit communities, parents are pressured not to report
abuse against children. This is prevalent in small hinterland communities where in many cases
households are related in some way. Other times sexual abuse goes unreported just so to
protect the good name of the family. So substantial numbers of abuse and violence against
children are not reported.”
9.2.2 Parents and children’s satisfaction with the CAC’s Model of service
Another indicator of programme effectiveness were children and parents’ testimony of
satisfaction with the CAC service. Their qualitative responses point to numerous ways in
which the services benefited them and their children. “It helped me to have better systems
in place for my child”, one parent responded. Another parent reported “It helped me to
cope with various situations and how to rectify the problems.” Children reported that the
CAC was instrumental in getting their parents to listen to them more and the counselling
and court support give them a chance to say what happened to them in the court. Partner
reported that trauma counselling was the most important service because the healing is
important, help the child move pass the hurt.” “The trauma counselling helps the child
move past the hurt; forensic interview is more for the society.”
Survey Of Children and Parents on satisfaction with CACs’ Support
Quantitative information from the survey indicates that both parents and children were satisfied
with the services and support they received from CACs.
Parents opined that they felt respected (100%), the CAC staff members were responsive (100%),
CAC staff explained matters in a way they could understand (100%), and they felt safe at the CAC
(98%). The data also show that only 8% of parents complained of difficulty accessing the CAC.
Children who accessed the services of the CAC reported that they felt safe at the centre
(100%), centre staff treated them with respect (100%), and centre staff explained things
to them in a way that they understood (100%). Further, 95% of children who benefited
from the services at the centre reported of feeling better to handle their situation.
42
Satisfaction with the service may be linked to quality of service rendered by the CAC staff.
Both boys and girls surveyed rated the CAC specialists as very effective, however, boys scored
them slightly lower than girls. This possibly suggests that there is need for more training to
identify and respond to the needs of boys.

9.2.3 Improving access to services and access to justice for children including vulnerable
and marginalized children
The CACs in Guyana were able expand access to services in Guyana for children who are
victims of sexual violence and their families. As explained by a partner “We opted for
collaboration with NGO in order to supplement the state’s capacity and getting
communities more involved in child protection.” CACs, it was observed, offer their services
to children and their families regardless of their economic, migrant, or disability status. It
was in this light that the survey queried respondents on CACs’ effectiveness in improving
access to services and justice for vulnerable and marginalized children and families where
1 represented not effective and scores greater than 7 represented very effective. Overall,
stakeholders and partners reported a mean score of 8.1 (figure 12). This means that on
average stakeholders and partners felt that the CACs were very effective in improving
access to services and justice for vulnerable and marginalised children and families. A
partner noted that “CACs provide services to all children who have been sexually abused.”
Figure 12: Respondents’ perception of effectiveness of CAC in improving access to services
and justice for vulnerable and marginalized children and families (scale 1-10), N=25
There was no expansion in the type of services, since implementers were guided by the
Protocol that prescribed the nature of their services. However, data from one of the agencies
revealed steep annual increases in demand for services with the exception of 2020 (the year
43
the pandemic started). Already, as of September 30, 2021, demand for service was higher
than any previous year.

Nevertheless, partners admitted that they were numerous challenges in responding
vulnerable and marginalised groups such as children with disabilities that hampered their
verbal communication, migrant children that do not speak English, and children living in
remote hinterland communities with poor transportation network. CACs have reportedly
been able to secure a translator in Region7 to aid in interviews with migrant children.
However, resources are needed here especially for regions 1 and 7 where numerous
Venezuelan migrants reside. Currently, CACs rely on the CPA for support in translation
services. It was reported too that CAC staff have also been engaged in training in
communicating with speech and hearing-impaired persons to ensure that children with these
types of disabilities are provided with needed services. Reaching children in remote
communities remains an overwhelming challenge.
9.2.4 Effectiveness of capacity building activities for CAC staff and partners
As narrated by an interviewee from a partner agency “ongoing training is necessary as these
are skills that have to be developed and reinforced over time to engage children to gather
very sensitive but also very specific data for successful prosecutions.” Another interviewee
advanced the view that “learning new tool is critical as offenders find more complex ways to
have access to children including online approaches. Many are targeting children on their
parents’ cell phone when they children are in learning sessions as school learning is
transferred online owing to the pandemic. The CAC needs a budget for staff development
and a budget line for maintain staff mental health.”
Partners were asked what type of capacity building CAC received. Partner related that “All
staff are graduates of the University of Guyana, mostly social science, and therefore come
into the CAC with the capacity to take the training necessary to function in the CAC.” Further
the partner explained “All CAC officers have to be engaged in robust training in the first three
months to learn how to counsel children who have experienced trauma, to understand the
tools and theories and to develop their practice through clear assessment for each child.” The
Consultant was told that training to conduct forensic interviews were done through
observation, reviewing of good practice documents, and role play in staff development
44
sessions. “All staff must complete trauma focused cognitive behaviour therapy training”
noted a partner. Training, by and large, are conducted by both local and overseas facilitators.
Formal academic intuitions such as the University of Guyana also provide opportunity for
capacity development among CAC staff. For example, the University of Guyana offers
graduate programmes in psychology and counselling. Additionally, CAC staff have accessed
government sponsored training in forensic psychology. Moreover, staff at the CACs have
received training in foreign languages (Spanish and Portuguese) and sign language training.
Partners were also asked how effective the capacity building activities were in improving
quality of service at the Centre. Senior partners noted seeing improvements in the way staff
performed their functions in terms of the “number of cases they managed and the case
outcome, number of interviews, and number of disclosures from the interviews.”
9.2.5 Improving cross-sector Coordination in the best interests of children
Respondents were questioned on how effective CACs were in getting professionals from
across sectors to cooperate and coordinate their activities in the best interest of child victims
of violence and crime. Partners scored the CAC at average of seven (7) on a scale of 0-10
where 10 is indicative of very effective. A partner divulged that “on the operations level about
8; at the strategic level we are struggling, the MDT at the high level needs to sit once a
quarter.” A recurring theme among partners is for the strengthening of the MDT at the
strategic level. Admittedly, the COVID-19 pandemic had curtailed the functioning of the MDT.
In terms of effective partnerships to support child victims, partners report that linkages with
CPA Staff, Teachers, schools Welfare Officers, Police Officers, Prosecutors and Legal Officers,
Health Workers, CPA Staff, Donors, embassies, and private organisations. Data from Parents
and children reinforces the evidence that these agencies partnered in successful service
provision for children. Additionally, stakeholders reported that community-based group with
grass root connection are discovering and reporting sexual abuse of children. Multilateral
donor agencies, foreign government embassies and missions, and private sector have all
supported in terms of resource mobilisation for the CACs.
When asked what partnerships have been important when it comes to improving child
victims’ access to justice? Partners responded “the Chief Justice, Chancellor, Chief Magistrate,
Police, DPP, and CPA. The MDT, even though not operational since 2020, had been a critical
forum for improving children’s access to justice. As explained thoroughly “A mechanism has
been established for improving children's access to justice - The functioning of a national
multi-disciplinary team which is chaired by the DPP with key members like the Crime Chief,
Deputy Director of CPA, CACs Directors, other civil society organizations that are advocates
such as Red Thread and Help and Shelter.
When asked whether there are other partnerships that the CACs need to establish or
strengthen to improve their work on behalf of children and families. A Partner stated that
“local authority (RDC and NDC) could prove vital in improving efforts in child protection from
sexual abuse.” “Yes, the CAC need to have strong collaboration with the local authority -
regional administration - all 10 have a gender affairs committee - they need to have good
45
clarity of the situation in their region regarding children's protection from sexual abuse, they
need to be effective and build collaboration with the community leaders particularly the faith
leaders, they need to be the advocates at the community level, in all communities in the
region and in particular the high risk communities.” It is observed by the Consultant that CAC
should also engage the National Commission on Disability.
9.2.6 Barriers to effective service delivery, enablers, and critical success factors for CAC
Frequent transfer government officers involved in the supply of services to child victims of
sexual abuse. Partner intimated that “staff changes each come with own limitations on
continuity, police change often and abruptly, which means CAC constantly have develop new
relationship and providing training, this to lesser extent is the same with medical officers. The
challenge is continuous.” Additionally, “there limited amounts of rape kits and the constant
need for training of medical officers in the use of the rape kits are barriers and challenges in
service provision.” Even though a rarity, it was explained by a partner “that some professional
still question children about the abuse outside of forensic interviews.”
The Consultant was told that “some parents apparently don’t fully cooperate and seem to
make a consciously attempt to avoid completing the supportive counselling for their children.
It is possible that some parents wish to have the matter dismissed perhaps to facilitate a
settlement.” “In other cases, the child may not to cooperate to protect the accused. In this
way the child is not blamed for breaking up the family.” Additionally, CAC reported that there
were significant numbers of inactive cases, defined as, cases in which the children have
attended one to four counselling sessions and have stopped going to the CACs for counselling.
Factors that contributed to the success of CACs included guidance and support for child
victims and their families in court proceedings, regular training of officers, committed staff
members, donor support, and partnerships are some enablers and critical success factors
related to CACs effectiveness. Partners added that advocacy on the part of the CPA, Blossom,
ChildLink and their drive to drive to expand services, and incorporating feedback from
partners, beneficiaries, and stakeholders were also instrumental in improving services. One
Partner explained that CPA coordinating role was also instrumental in the success of the CPA.
Partners and stakeholders also identified areas where the CACs were effective which included
forensic interview, trauma counselling, Parental Skills Education, training of stakeholders,
advocacy and public prevention education, online training, radio and television programmes,
dissemination of prevention of sexual abuse of children posters, researching issues, and court
support. A Partner elucidated that “the CAC work collaboratively which is very effective,
additionally, the forensic interviews have led to more convictions, more children have been
counselled and more parents have better skills to care for their children. In all cases going to
the court - children have the support of a court support officer.”
9.2.7 The CAC’s ability to influence legislation and policies on national level.
The Consultant was informed that Child Advocacy Centre been able to influence national
strategies as it relates to improving prevention or responses to violence against children.
The CAC was created to serve a robust mechanism for the implementation of the
46
prescription of the Sexual Offences Acts while recognising children’s rights. As mentioned
by partner “CACs and CPA advocacy has resulted in the decentralisation of sexual offences
court to other areas of the country, further decentralisation of the centres, recognition of
the importance of and mainstreaming of trauma informed services delivery for children
through the justice chain. However, no new national laws were developed as a result of
the CACs’ intervention.
Annex E provides a summary on the status of indicators of effectiveness
9.3 Impact
In this evaluation, impact refers to the positive and negative changes produced by a
development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.
9.3.1. Increased Demand for CAC Integrated Services
Data from both ChildLink and Blossom reflect increase demand for services, in particular
forensic interviewing. Figure 13 depicts a steep increase in the number of forensic
interviews conducted by Blossom. The number of forensic interviews conducted by
Blossom in 2021 have already overtaken the total amount for the entire 2020.
Figure 13: Demand for Services from Blossom Inc.
Data for ChildLink covering 2019 and 2020 also reveal significant increases in demand for
services. Number of forensic interviews involving boys increased by 38% and those
involving girls rose by 16% in 2020 when compared to 2019. The number of trauma
counselling also showed significant increases for both boys and girls. Trauma counselling
conducted for girls increased by 85% and trauma counselling for boys increased by 467%.
The data reflects a 50% reduction in group psychosocial counselling for boys and a 12%
reduction in group psychosocial counselling for girls.

Qualitative information was also in harmony with the quantitative data indicating an
increase in the demand for services rendered by the CACs. One Partner remarked: “Yes,
more families are coming forward with cases of abuse of Boys.” Stakeholder noted that
public awareness programmes and observation of the benefits children derived from the
system have encouraged greater demand for the service.
9.3.2 Child Advocacy Centre contributed to long-term positive changes in well-being of
children, such as their recovery from violence and victimization
Children self-reports show that 95% of them felt that CACs had positively contributed to
them making positive changes in their lives (figure 14). Children reported several ways
they perceived the CAC contributed to their recover from violence and victimisation. “It
helped me to be a better person and to cope with difficult situations.” This is an important
finding because it speaks to self-improvement and resilience building which are crucial
ingredients for adolescents and children to tread a positive path. Additionally, children
reported the CAC’s intervention “taught me to be more confident”, “helped to boost my
self-esteem”, “bold enough to talk with strangers and if not comfortable tell the person
(s) they are making me uncomfortable”, “cope with and manage anger”, “better able to
communicate with siblings and family bond became stronger”, “help me to get over my
depression”, “my behaviour and thoughts have changed”, “help me have a closer
relationship with her mother”, “I improved academically”, “help me be a girl I was longing
to be in life”, “helped me to feel better after my incident” “make better decisions and set
goals and recognized where there are red flags. So, from children’s testimony one can
undoubtedly deduce that CAC has helped with their recovery in a variety of positive ways.
Figure 14: Proportion of children reporting that CAC has helped to make positive changes to
their lives
48
From a parental perspective, almost nine (9) out of ten parents felt the CACs had contributed
to their children making positive changes in their lives (table 21). This overwhelming positive
response on the part of parents add to the burden of evidence that the CACs have been
contributing to positive changes in children lives after victimization.

Based on observation of their children parents articulated several positive changes they
noticed in their children’s lives. The aspects of positive changes that parents observed in their
children included children developing better coping skills and self-confidence, improved
anger management skills, children were more focused academically, and overall
improvement in their behaviours. As explained by parents: “she learned to cope with
situations as they arise”, “she developed more confidence in herself”, “my child changed her
behaviour for the better”, “my child is more educationally focused”, “he used to get angry
fast and was very disrespectful - that has changed a lot”, “she don't be in the streets anymore,
and she is behaving herself”, “she is having a positive outlook in life after trainings”, “she's
not withdrawn like before”, “he is better able to handle situations”, and “first she was
showing signs of fear --she was trembling before -- this has stopped now.
Partners also observed positive changes in children post intervention from the CACs.
Partners explained that they are seeing sustained changes in children who were victims of
sexual abuse. A Partner narrated that “many of them would come and visit the office even
after their counselling sessions are over and this gives us an opportunity to observe the
changes they have attained, and we see a lot of improvements.” The programme is also
helping children indirectly by training parents to better safeguard children. Among
partners and stakeholders’ perception of the greatest achievements of the CACs were
expansion of their services to cover 8 administrative regions, helping children feel safe
through integrated child friendly service provision including the conduct of forensic
interviews with trained experts, helping to rebuild relationship between children and their
parents, and public education programmes that placed focused attention on child sexual
abuse and its consequences.
9.3.3 Unintended Results
On the positive side of unintended results, it was shared with the Consultant that the bringing
together of professionals from the police, schools’ welfare, prosecutors, magistrates, medical
workers, and teachers helped the referral system prescribed in the CAC Protocol due to
exchanges of contact information during training activities.
49
On the negative side, rising demand for services coupled with constrained resources have
forced CACs to extend the responsibility of current staff which can result in physical and
psychological burn out. Partner emphasised “more staff is needed, right now staff are
doing double roles.” “Rising demand and not commensurate funding have forced CACs to
task staff with dual responsibility and frequently stretch them to the limit.”
9.4 Sustainability
9.4.1 Sustainability of the CACs
Based on the evaluation findings several services of the CAC were seen as effective and
therefore worthy of being replicated and expanded. The table below summarises this analysis.

Additionally, respondents were asked if they were of the view that the established CACs
would be sustained. Partners and stakeholders all agreed that the CACs will be sustained. A
stakeholder opined that “CACs provide an essential service and once current levels of child
sexual abuse continue there will be need for their service.” Another partner informed that
CAC need governmental support to continue their work.” On a positive side we note that
successive political administrations in Guyana have supported CACs with an annual
government subvention which cover some of the cost for running CACs. A partner
acknowledged “Yes this is a successful public-private partnership on display and should be
encouraged so that we can have examples of gold standards in service delivery in Guyana.”
The evidence also suggests that the CAC model of service has the support of partners (91%)
and of stakeholders (86%) (figure 15).
50
Figure 15: How supportive are national partners and stakeholders of the Child Advocacy
Centres
9.4.2 Availability of financial resources for Child Advocacy Centres
Partners opined that financial resources are available to ensure sustainability of CACs. As was
explained by interviewees, Government provides an annual subvention that is disbursed
twice a year in April and August and multilateral and bilateral international partners also
commit resources to sustain the CAC model of service. Collectively partners concluded that
government subvention and donors’ financial and technical support were essential to the
maintenance of CACs quality of service and sustainability of operations, mainly because
current government budget allocation is insufficient based on current demand for services
and donor technical support remains vital to improving quality and standards which is also
linked to demand for the services of CACs. Co-funding and ownership are therefore especially
important for the sustainability of this programme.
9.4.3 Legal Framework to support sustainability
In Guyana there is a National Protocol for the CACs that has been adopted by the Ministry of
Human Services and Social Security, the Guyana Police Force, the Department of Public
Prosecutions, Blossom, ChildLink, Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health. The CACs
are fundamental to the implementation of the Sexual Offences Act and the decentralisation
of the sexual offences court. Partners are confident that the current level of embeddedness
of the CACs in the child protection system and children’s access to justice in Guyana augur
well for the sustainability of the CACs. A Partner related “Yes, CACs are sustainable we have
the Act [Sexual Offences Act], a Protocol, and persons who are leading at the level of
Chancellor, Chief justice, Chief Magistrate who are all helpful. The CPA has embraced and
helped in building relationships.” Another Partner points out that “The Legal framework was
developed and receives judicial support from the policy perspective. Yes, CPA have been very
instrumental in building all the relationships.
9.5 Efficiency
Efficiency in evaluation is focused on the extent to which the intervention delivers results in
an economic and timely way. This subsection will address the issue of cost efficiency of the
CAC implementation.
51
9.5.1 How cost efficient was the approach to Implement and Manage the CAC
Timely disbursement of financial resources for the implementation of interventions is a major
contributor to success in programme delivery. CACs reported that financial disbursement
were predictable being consistently disbursed twice annually. They advised that UNICEF’s
disbursement was received in a timely manner even though it was channelled through the
Government of Guyana.
Partners explained that both Blossom and ChildLink adopted a range of cost saving measures
in the management of their operations. Cost saving measures included procuring office
stationery in bulk, minimising printing by using electronic documents, and conserving on
electricity.
Based on financial information and data on the number of children receiving support that
were shared with the consultant cost of service per child victim and family was computed at
US$325. Services covered forensic interviews, counselling, court support, and parental skills
education training. As was mentioned earlier the modal time for children visiting the centre
was 4 or more times. This amount is a cost effective when one considers the range of expert
services that child victims and their parents receive. When compared to the economic cost of
violence this amount is small. In 2017, the global per inhabitant cost of violence was US$
$1,988 (Iqbal, Bardwell and Hammond 2021). That apart, the benefits itemised by children
and parents justify the investment in integrated service provision for child victims of sexual
abuse and their families. Recapping, the suite of services offered by CACs were instrumental
in enabling children to access justice, protect children from further abuse, recover from
trauma, and improve parents’ capacity in raising and protecting children.
9.5.2 Avoiding overlap in activities
Partners explained that CACs were coordinated with the child protection programme of the
CPA. The CACs provide a unique service. CACs collaborated with other agencies based on the
needs of child victims and their families.
9.5.3 Monitoring and Evaluation
There are clear signs that the CACs are well managed. There is an overarching National
Protocol for the Child Advocacy Centres that mandates the roles and responsibilities of
partner agencies. The Protocol outlines the overarching structure for the CACs including the
structure of the MDT and the forensic interview theme. The Protocol details the roles of the
CAC’s manager and provide guidance on forensic interviews referrals, retention of evidence,
medical services, mental health services, and case review. Each CAC signs on to a term of
reference which define their scope of activities, objectives, purpose, expected outcomes,
operating guidance, and organisational capacity.
CAC has produced evidence that they collect data on clients. However, there is need for
improvement in this area. In fact, there is a need for resources to be directed toward
developing a data system for CACs. Currently data are compiled in excel sheets. This is not the
best platform for collating and storing data. CACs use the data collected to prepare annual
52
reports which cover major activities conducted during the year along with challenges and
lessons learned. Somewhat of challenge to CAC is the fact that they do not get feedback on
their reports submitted. One partner informs “Reports yes we prepare yearly and half yearly
reports, used internally, but don't know where they go.” The National Protocol for the CAC
request that the MDT receives monthly reports from Centre managers. This reporting helps
the MDT carry out its oversight functions. However, the MDT has not met in a year.
Notwithstanding the prescription in the CACs operating terms of reference on minimum data
requirement, there was no standardised indicator system for the CACs in Guyana. Partner
shared “yes, I have my own data collection and monitoring and evaluation system.” It is
important that UNICEF and partners address this situation.
While the evaluation found rudimentary monitoring and evaluation system at both NGOs that
coordinates the CAC and sees the need for the development of a more robust data
compilation and monitoring and evaluation system for CACs. System should be able to work
both online and offline and facilitate data entered at CACs locations be uploaded to a central
database. Further, it must have a system of data retrieval that is accessible at all CAC
locations. The consultant recommends the following as potential indicators response time for
cases (time taken from report to conduct of forensic interviews), percentage of children
completing counselling, percentage of parents completing PSE, prevalence of trauma
symptoms, anxiety, depression, anger, PTS, dissociation among victims of abuse, number of
non-offending caregivers supported, number of children protected from alleged perpetrators
of abuse by placing them with kin, placed in foster care, perpetrator was removed etc.,
number of repeat instances of abuse (and whether it was by the same perpetrator or
someone else), number of disclosures and levels of completeness, number of charges laid and
severity, number of successful convictions, prosecution rates, conviction rates (and severity
of sentencing), number of cases closed due to child no-show.
9.6 Value for Money (VFM) Assessment
Value for money (VfM) assessment, simply put, is a selection of economic evaluation
measurements that calculate the relationship between monetary inputs and desired outputs,
outcomes, and impact. These measurements give managers evidence to help them target and
refine programme management for increased efficiency and effectiveness. There is an
evident correlation between value for money criteria and the Development Assistance
Committee of the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD/DAC) criteria that have
been adopted by UNICEF and used in this evaluation. For instance, equity - the quality of
being fair and impartial - as a value for money principles underpins the work of UNICEF and
specifically it is a guiding post for this evaluation and all evaluation criteria. The table below
shows the substantive match between DAC and Value for money criteria.

9.6.1 Economy
The economic evaluation that are undertaken in the process of evaluating the CAC Model of
Service for victims of child sexual abuse was not included in the planning processes of this
programme. Thus, the evaluation of value for money calculations are limited to the extent
that there is sufficient information to inform conclusions. As mentioned earlier, cost-
minimisation strategies were used in the procurement of supplies for this CACs. The supplies procured
for this programme included devices for the interview room, stationery, child friendly furniture,
toys for waiting area and stress relief during forensic interviews such as anatomic dolls, books,
crayon, play dough, and puzzles. Other expenses included internet, electricity, and telephone
costs. None of the expense categories appeared excessive, for instance, the modal value
reported for telephone use was just about US$50 monthly, average stationery cost monthly
was US$50 per month, and annual expenses on toys and other child stress relief equipment
and supplies was US$150 per centre. These costs are indicative of economy in service
provision under the CAC model. In country transportation, by road, air, and sea, were used to
transport supplies to centres and travel to monitoring the various centres. CACs also
supported, when necessary, travel for client to centre.
Disbursement was transferred directly to the Ministry of Human Services for the
implementation and monitoring of the CAC model of service. This was possible as the risk
rating of Ministry of Human Services Child Protection Agency assigned by the Supreme Audit
Institution (SAI) was low. The modality for the cash transfer included request from CPA to
UNICEF for the agreed sums of money, guided by the principles and practices of the
Harmonised Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT). Once cash was transferred, programmatic
visits and quality assurance spot checks were conducted to ensure the utilization of funds as
per agreed work plan. As mentioned earlier the CAC Model of service also benefitted from
government subvention, other multilateral and bilateral donors, and private sector entities.
Information sharing in the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of this programme
emanated from any partner, depending on the need and or challenge. Information was shared
by email between and among UNICEF and the CPA. Electronic communication in the main
was used among CACs and the CPA. Electronic communication results in cost savings.

The CAC model investment by both from Government and UNICEF increased as more centres
were established. The increases in costs were mainly linked to the expansion of the
programme to reach more communities, especially hinterland community where the CAC
services were urgently needed. The cost increase was associated with more staffing, greater
need for equipment, more training and monitoring associated with increase coverage.
Social returns on investment
Investing in CAC model of service and advocacy has high likelihood of reducing immediate
physical injuries and psychological harm children may experience. The literature on children’s
55
experience with sexual violence suggests it may result in long-term debilitating physical and
psychological conditions. This may result in lifelong costs of healthcare and loss of quality of
life, alongside the possibility of early pregnancy and related lower levels of education
(Pereznieto, et al. 2014). As mentioned in the preceding, the core activities undertaken by the
CACs include joint assessment and investigation, coordination of therapeutic intervention,
ongoing support and follow-up, coordination of prosecution activities, prevention initiatives,
and advocacy and partnership development. Several key features set the CAC model apart
from traditional service delivery models. The distinguishing features are summarised in the
table below:

issue of child sexual abuse
--Developing operational standards and guidelines, and championing best practices in integrated
response to child sexual abuse and advocating and influencing policy reform across the country
Apart from costing the benefits of the CAC’s integrated service model, there are significant
returns in terms of valuation of productivity improvements. The estimated value in terms of
productivity savings ranged from a minimum of US$67,368 and a maximum of US$114,863.
Without costing the psycho-social, parental capacity development, promotion of pro-social
behaviour and personal development, and prevention of child sexual abuse, the analysis show
significant return on investment.

9.6.3 Availability of Skills needed for implementation
The CACs had the required skillset for the delivery of integrated services to victims of child
sexual abuse. The Centres targeted individuals with a minimum bachelor’s degree in social
work, Sociology, Psychology, and Behavioural Sciences. CACs have been conducting training
for staff in trauma focused therapy and forensic interviewing. A major challenge is the
frequent transfer of police officers and medical personnel who had received training. Aside
training is continuous by the CAC.
10. CONCLUSIONS
The CAC implementation in Guyana to a great extent has been successful in achieving its
objectives. On all the evaluation criteria, the CAC implementation has demonstrated very
promising results in terms of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and
value for money. In summary, this evaluation found that there has been significant progress
made as beneficiaries, partners, and stakeholders all recognised the importance of CACs and
their integrated service delivery model. The following are conclusions based on the findings
of the evaluation.
Relevance
Conclusion 1: The CAC model of integrated service delivery for child victims of sexual abuse
and their families is harmony with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3, 4, 5, 11, 16, and
17 by disrupting and preventing sexual abuse of children and providing broad child protection
services for children who are victims of abuse in ways that are both gender sensitive and
culturally grounded, safeguarding their rights and mental health, removing emotional barriers
to continued education, building emotional stability and resilience, and promoting positive
self-image, child development and wellbeing. The CACs work also raised awareness on adverse
effects of VAC in communities thereby helping children and their families to be better informed,
recognize, and report cases of sexual and other forms of violence against children.
Conclusion 2: Child Advocacy Centres are also important because they offer parents with
education and awareness about abuse helping them to understand abuse including the signs
of child abuse and how to protect their children.
Effectiveness
Conclusion 3: There are several beneficial outcomes associated with the use of a CAC, such as
increased collaboration, programme management and caregiver satisfaction, child and
parent satisfaction with service delivery, and higher acceptance of cases for prosecution.
58
Conclusion 4: CAC eliminated the need for multiple interviews from staff of participating
agencies. This was achieved through the coordination of Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of
professionals working together to gather evidence, review cases, deliver high quality services,
and address systemic problems. However, in a few instances, it was reported that a very small
number of staff from a government agency were not following the protocol in every instance.
Conclusion 5: Overall, CACs, both at the operational and strategic levels, demonstrated that
multidisciplinary involvement was essential in ensuring that the needs of children who are
victims of sexual violence are identified, understood, and addressed.
Conclusion 6: A key to success has been partnership the CPA and two well established NGOs,
ChildLink and Blossom. Blossom and ChildLink were able to establish partnerships with police
and justice officials. Additionally, other factors crucial to the effectiveness and achievements
of CACs success were their interdisciplinary teams/staff, including qualified professionals in
the areas of social work and psychological counselling, and legal advocacy for children and
victims of violence.
Conclusion 7: Counselling was the service delivery that benefited children and families the
most. As CACs successfully supported children and families, the number of referrals made to
CACs by institutions/agencies and self-referrals to CACs has significantly and steadily
increased from 2015 to 2019, declined slightly in 2020 and increased again to 2021.
Conclusion 8: CACs have improved access to justice for children who experience violence and
crimes, including improved access to justice for vulnerable and marginalized children. CACs
improved access by increasing staff and mobilising more resources through partners such as
UNICEF, Government of Guyana, and the EU. CACs also promote proper use of Forensic
Interviews Rooms in cases involving children as victims.
Conclusion 7: The CACs have conducted numerous public education programmes annually
that have yielded some positive results as it relates to community support for the prevention
of child abuse; however, certain norms that are prevalent in communities are inimical to
preventing child sexual abuse and making offenders accountable. Therefore, continued public
education is necessary.
Conclusion 8: Expansion of CAC service will require commensurate increase in human and
financial resources and skills and expertise to serve unique demographics such as children
with disabilities and non-English speaking children and families.
Impact
Conclusion 9: The CAC initiative has contributed to the overall goal of establishing integrated,
multidisciplinary youth friendly services for child victims of sexual abuse in all the regions. The
current initiative attained the target of establishing fully functioning standardised centres in
eight regions. Lessons and experiences garnered from current implementation will contribute
to establishing services in the remaining two (2) regions. Further, child victims of sexual violence
benefited from access to integrated services providing psycho-social support, legal aid, etcetera.
59
Sustainability
Conclusion 10: Current levels of sexual violence against children along with the importance of
CAC in providing a comprehensive response covering recovery and access to justice make a
strong case for sustaining CACs. Further, UNICEF and Government funding of the CAC are the
predictable sources of revenue for CAC and are important to their sustainability.
Conclusion 11: Judging from the cost per service in the context of the duration and quantity
and quality of engagements with child victims of sexual abuse, one can only conclude that
resources are used efficiently by CACs.
Conclusion 12: There is need for an effective data compilation and retrieval system for CACs.
This is essential for monitoring and efficiency in service provision and in tracking the long-
term social outcomes of the CAC’s intervention
Efficiency
Conclusion 13: The recurring costs associated with the operations of the CACs demonstrate
efficiency in procuring materials for operations. It also confirms that resources are not
wasted.
Value for Money
Conclusion 14: Without costing the psycho-social, parental capacity development, promotion
of pro-social behaviour and personal development, and prevention of child sexual abuse, the
analysis show significant return on investment.
11. LESSONS LEARNED
The following are the main lessons learned.
Lesson 1: An important lesson learned was that CACs make significant contribution to children
and families, including helping them to access justice, psychologically recover from the
trauma of experiencing sexual abuse, provide training for parents to better interact with their
children. It was noted that children and parents/caregivers who access CACs would have
experienced traumatic events that have caused them to suffer physical, psychological,
emotional and spiritual harm, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some cases.
Failure to process and overcome trauma can have long-term negative impacts on children and
parents/caregivers; thus, CACs work with children and families have helped to improve their
well-being and minimize the risk of such long-term negative impacts.
Lesson 2: It was observed that working with boys was more challenging for CACs because boys
were reluctant and tentative in discussing abuse. These initial hurdles have been overcome
through patient confidence building approaches. An important lesson here is that there is
need for continued efforts in mainstreaming gender in the training of forensic interviewers.
Lesson 3: Another lesson learned was that success of the CAC model of service in contingent
on commitment and leadership on the part of NGO, the CPA and other government partners.
60
Important too is willingness of UNICEF to support the services of the CACs. Programmes such
as these take time to demonstrate results and in eliminating the bottlenecks in service
delivery. Persistence and patience are required from UNICEF and the implementing agencies
work to improve programme standards.
Lesson 4: A key lesson learned was that a fully functioning CAC demands consistent and
ongoing training and support on treatment interventions, including the use of trauma focused
cognitive behaviour therapy, the laws on sexual violence in the country and on-the-job
support to navigate the social, police, prosecutorial systems.
Lesson 5: For some cases referrals maybe needed to other specialised services where CAC
does not have the capacity, and this becomes even more difficult in outlying areas where
other services may not exist. CACs are also successful where they can make referrals for other
services, such as birth registration, legal aid and social protection services.
Lesson 6: Consistent and adequate funding is a major issue as CACs costs are free, including
the follow-up for court cases, which may take over one year to complete. At minimum CAC
human resource requirement include a Forensic Interviewer, Counsellor, and Court Support
Officer could accumulate to US$2010 monthly. Added to this cost are materials and supplies,
internet and phone cost, inter alia.
Lesson 7: The success of CACs is largely based on the success of other protocols at national
level, including clinical guidelines for examining patients and protocols for police. It would be
important for these to be imbedded in the CACs and vice versa.
12. RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations are presented based on the evaluation findings.
Relevance
Recommendation 1: CAC should formalise a blended approach (face-to-face and remote) to
counselling child victims and their parents. PSE should be prepared in audio-visual format and
shared with parents.
Recommendation 2: Efforts should be made to refer poor families of child victims for public
assistance from the MHSSS and to fast-track applications and approval. Further, a system of
providing CACs with advance funding using an ex-ante system of approval from the CPA for
specific spending on special cases of poor families.
Recommendation 3: There is need for comprehensive public education programmes on the
long-term impact of child sexual abuse and the benefits of intervention to promote children’s
recovery and access to justice. Efforts should also concentrate on involving communities in
detecting and reporting sexual violence against children.
Effectiveness
Recommendation 4: There should be an initial orientation for new officers working on the FIT
especially those that were not exposed to working with children who are victims of sexual
61
violence.
Recommendation 5: The evaluation also recommends the immediate resuscitation of the
MDT to address issues and bottlenecks in the CAC integrated service delivery model.
Recommendation 6: UNICEF should support the CACs in developing posters with key aspects
of the integrated service delivery model for child victims of sexual violence.
Recommendation 7: Use of multimedia fora to highlight and discredit societal norms that are
detrimental to child sexual abuse prevention.
Recommendation 8: UNICEF should continue to incorporate support for this successful child
protection programme in their next programme cycle
Recommendation 9: Training in foreign language and communicating with hearing and speech
impaired children is essential if the CAC is reach vulnerable groups equally. This should be an
area of focus for UNICEF’s support for the CACs
Recommendation 10: UNICEF representation should serve as an Ex Officio member of the
MDT to provide technical advice and share internationally proven practices in child protection
and access to justice.
Recommendation 11: CACs need to examine what barriers and bottlenecks exist that
negatively affecting children’s completion of counselling regime and develop solutions
including blended approach of remote and face-to-face counselling where cost to get the
centre is a challenge.
Recommendation 12: Based on the self-reports of successful outcomes for parents and
children the MDT and donors should ensure that the CAC’s model is sustained.
Recommendation 13: CACs management need to identify and articulate to the CPA, MDT, and
UNICEF the increase cost required due to the rise in demand for service for action to be taken.
Sustainability
Recommendation 14: UNICEF should ensure that resources are made available annually for
training to guarantee quality in service delivery are maintained.
Recommendation 15: There might be some indirect cost not included in the cost per service
calculation, to get a picture of the true cost of their service CAC should seek to tally both direct
and indirect costs associated with their service delivery.
Recommendation 16: Support should be provided to CAC to develop a system for data
compilation and retrieval.
Efficiency
Recommendation 17: CAC should seek to further identify inefficient processes through
participatory staff assessment. Once the relevant information has been collected, CAC should
62
seek to refine processes eliminating superfluous activities.
Recommendation 18: CACs should also seek to consolidate suppliers lists to leverage
economies of scale in purchase. Forging meaningful and trusting relationships with a core
group of preferred suppliers will result in improved and seamless service.
Value for Money
Recommendation 19: There is need for UNICEF to fund longitudinal research to value the
achievements of long-term outcomes for children and families.
Recommendation 20: The substantial return on investment justifies current and future
investment in access to justice and recovery for children who are victims of sexual abuse.
Therefore, we recommend UNICEF’s ongoing support for this intervention.
Annex F provides a summary of the recommendations along with time frame for
implementation and priority.

Annex A: Theory of Change
IMPACT
◼ To create a model of integrated service applicable to all regions in Guyana to meet the complex needs of children suffering and witnessing
violence and eliminate its consequences.
◼ Children victims of violence benefit from efficient child protection and judicial systems and have access to integrated services providing
psycho-social support, legal aid, etcetera.
OUTCOMES –
◼ By 2018, children victims of violence in four pilot regions (2, 3, 4, and 5) receive multidisciplinary support in integrated services.
◼ By 2018, pilot services in regions 2, 3, 4, and 5 influence legislation and policies on national level.
◼ By 2021, relevant sectoral systems engaged in prevention and response to VAC deliver prompt and effective services.
INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMESRESULTS
◼ Raised awareness on adverse effects of VAC;
◼ Developed methodology for integrated service for children victims of violence
◼ Piloted integrated services for children victims of violence in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 of Guyana
◼ Children and families are better informed, recognize and report cases of VAC
◼ Professionals (teachers, social workers, police officers, prosecutors, judges) cooperate and coordinate actions following the best interests of
children victims of violence
OUTPUTS
◼ National communication and fundraising campaign have raised the awareness on adverse effects of VAC in general public, children, parents
and professionals and funds for pilot intervention.
◼ Children, adolescents, their parents and families in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 are aware of different types and forms of VAC and where
to seek professional help.
◼ Local authorities in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 are able to identify and refer children victims of violence to services. –
◼ Cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 is strengthened. –
◼ Child Protection system in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 is better equipped to respond to VAC in regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10
◼ In regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 child sensitive investigation and hearing/ forensic interviewing is implemented in VAC cases.
◼ Children victims of violence benefit from professional legal aid.
INPUTS

and reporting.
ENABLERS
Governance; People; Knowledge and information systems; Management; Partnerships; Community participation.
STRATEGIES:
• Advocating for legal reform -Fostering an enabling legal and policy framework for prevention, identification and response to VAC cases.
• Building awareness among the public, children, parents and professionals on VAC
• Educating and mobilizing parents, families, teachers and community members to change attitudes and behaviours towards VAC
• Strengthening child protection and justice systems -Strengthening the capacity of the professionals to improve coordination in VAC cases
Developing, piloting and promoting integrated services to support children victims and witnesses and their parents
PROBLEM:
Children victims of violence do not have access to specialized services targeting VAC and suffer additional pain and suffering because of the lack of
effective cooperation between the systems – child protection, police, justice, healthcare, educational system.

1. BACKGROUND/CONTEXT
Guyana is located on the northeast coast of South America and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, Suriname,
Brazil, and Venezuela. It has a landmass of 215,000 square kilometres and is divided into 10 administrative
regions. Guyana is a sparsely populated country totalling 746,955, with 50.2 percent males and 49.8 percent
females, inhabitants, of whom 89 percent live mostly along a narrow coastal strip (Guyana Bureau of Statistics
2014). Besides, 35.5 percent of the population is under 15 and young people 15-19 represent about 8.9
percent. The Coastland regions, which include the capital city have a population size of 89.1 percent. The
population of the Hinterland regions, comprising more than two-thirds of the land area, is 10.9 percent. The
population in the hinterland of Guyana is over 80per cent Amerindian descent and Amerindians account for
9.2per cent of the population. Guyana’s child population is 293,915 or 39.35 percent of the total population
and the child population, 4248 children are living with disabilities.
Guyana is an upper-middle-income country with a per-capita income of US$5,194 (World Bank 2019) and a
Gross Domestic Product growth from 3.42 in 2018 to 3.82 in 2019. Though Guyana’s Human Development
Index ranking has improved, Guyana is still ranked at 123rd out of 189 countries. Without concerted efforts to
accelerate and consolidate social gains, Guyana risks missing a unique opportunity to fast-track inclusive
economic growth resulting from the oil discovery and demographic dividend.
In 2019, the Governments invested about 14.5per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the social sector
programmes to ensure basic social services for all, including children; Investment in social assistance (core and
complementary). The discovery of large oil reserves is predicted to lead to significant economic growth. Since
that time, ExxonMobil has announced more than 15 discoveries, with potentially 6 billion barrels available as
recoverable resources. Since the declaration of first-oil on December 20, 2019, it is projected that the revenue
from oil exports has the potential to double the GDP and non-tax revenue over the next five years. This
presents both a unique opportunity and challenge for the country and UNICEF's cooperation.
Overview of the Child Advocacy Centres in Guyana.
Globally, every year, millions of girls and boys around the world face sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexual
violence occurs everywhere – in every country and across all segments of society. A child may be subjected to
sexual abuse or exploitation at home, at school, or in their community. Most often, abuse occurs at the hands
of someone a child knows and trusts. At least 120 million girls under the age of 20 – about 1 in 10 – have been
forced to engage in sex or perform other sexual acts, although the actual figure is likely much higher. Roughly
90 per cent of adolescent girls who report forced sex say that their first perpetrator was someone they knew,
usually a boyfriend or a husband.
In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) 23 per cent of women aged 20-24 were married/cohabited by age 18
and 5 per cent by age 15. Ten (10) per cent of men in Cuba and Honduras are married/cohabited by age 18
and LAC is the only region globally where child marriage rates among girls have not declined in 30 years.
The Ministry of Human Services and Social Security, through the Childcare and Protection Agency, provides
leadership on several prevention and response programmes on VAC. One of these programmes- through a
120
Public-Private partnership, is the “Child Advocacy Centres” (CACs) or one-stop centre for the reporting on and service for
child sexual abuse. These centres are currently coordinated by the Child Care and Protection Agency (CPA) and operated
by 2 NGOs- Blossoms Inc. and ChildLink Guyana. There are eleven centres altogether and they are located in eight of the
ten administrative regions of Guyana i.e. Regions 1 (one), 2 (one), 3 (one) 4 (three), 5 (one), 6 (one), 7 (one) and 10 (two).
The CACs are guided by national protocols and conducts court support, referrals, community outreach work, and
aftercare for victims and caregivers. CACs are provided with a Government subvention along with some support from
UNICEF, as part of ensuring access to services. Based on the number of cases of child sexual abuse (e.g. at least 500
reported cases as of September of 2020) and the need to ensure the continuation of “ breaking the silence” on abuse,
CACs need to be decentralised, and furnished with the requisite support so that every child is protected from violence
and can TELL their story, as part of ensuring the cycle of violence is broken.
PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, AUDIENCE OF THE EVALUATION
Purpose
Given the foregoing context, the Child Protection Agency in Partnership with UNICEF commission an independent
evaluation of Child Advocacy centres (CACs).
The purpose of the evaluation of the CACs is to lead to improvement of the implementation and quality of the services
of CACs in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, and eventually to inform the decision to scale up service provision and
sustainability.
The evaluation will identify, and document lessons learned, including in terms of service design, scope of support
provided, resourcing, implementation, reach, and involvement of partners (Ministry child protection agency, NGOs etc.)
The evaluation will also provide recommendations for the process of institutionalising and scaling up the CAC model and
services nationally, and for actions to ensure their quality and sustainable implementation in the future.
This evaluation will also seek to foster the scale-up of service provision, quality, and implementation of CACs in all regions.
This evaluation aims to assess the effectiveness, relevance, efficiency, impact, sustainability, cross-cutting contributions,
and value for money of the CACs and the findings will inform decisions and preparation for scale-up
https://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/49652541.pdf.
Evaluation Objectives
The overall aim of the evaluation is to conduct an independent evaluation of the model and services provided by the Child
Advocacy Centres (CACs) for children, women, and their families who are victims of violence, in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
and 10. The evaluation is both formative and summative. Overall, the evaluation will bring an understanding of what
works well and what does not in the CACs model.
The General goal and objectives are to:
1. provide national-level stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the achievements and
challenges associated with the scaling and mainstreaming of CACs, approaches, and practices.
2. help country-level stakeholders understand how to integrate improvements in programme design,
implementation, coordination, and monitoring to maintain and enhance the CAC implementation’s
relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability.
3. advise on how to use the evaluation findings to (a) support the scale-up of CAC programming at the
national levels, and (b) catalyse national discussions regarding the necessary modification to the CAC
model and delivery services.
4. compile lessons learned and recommendations to inform the future rollout of the CAC programmes.
121
The specific objectives will be to:
- assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the CAC programme
implementation over the period 2015-2021.
- take stock of the progress made towards the attainment of the goals and objectives of the CACs, and
identify the most effective implementation strategies and partnerships that can be adopted
immediately and in the scale-up phase.
- identify challenges (including the capacity to deliver) and opportunities (enablers factors)
experienced in the delivery of prevention and support services in CACs.
- identify and document lessons learned, including those related to service design, the scope of support
provided, resources, implementation, reach, partnerships, etc.
- determine if the current strategies operational approaches of the CACs are sustainable or not and
provide recommendations to ensure their sustainability and scale-up.
Key and intended users

SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
This is a formative and summative evaluation that will cover the implementation of the Child Advocacy
Centres. The formative and forward-looking aspects will focus on CACs in Guyana’s current and evolving
contexts, while the summative aspect will look backward at the support and accountability patterns,
development, and effectiveness.
The investigation will include all relevant stakeholders including Child Protection Agency, key government partners,
NGOs, and other service providers. The consultant, over the period of June - September will assess the achievement of
results in accordance with the objectives, criteria, and methodology specified.
The evaluator will review the progress made on the implementation of CACs. He/she will also review the coordination
and or implementation support and guidance provided by the following institutions.
- The Childcare and Protection Agency
- Blossoms Inc.
- ChildLink Guyana
The evaluator(s) will:
- Review regulations and standards compliant with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other
international standards and good practices.
- Map and describe the formal and informal structures and functions of key agencies of the sector.
- Assess the adequacy of existing networking and coordinating structures among the various sub-
sectors and their effectiveness in facilitating service delivery.
- Examine the continuum of services from prevention to response. This will also consider the nature
and level of interaction between CACs and the justice and education systems; the process of care,
referral, follow-up, response, etc.
- focus on the CACs from between 2015 to 2021 in the geographic locations of Regions 1 (Mabaruma),
2 (Land of Plenty); 3 (Pouderoyen), 4; East Bank (Eccles), Quamina Street (Child Link); 5 (Forth Wellington);
6 (Springlands); 7 (Bartica) and 10 (Linden and Kwakwani). Regions 8 and 9 will not be considered in
this evaluation as CACs do not exist in these regions.
- The evaluator will assess the equity dimensions of the interventions, as well as gender equality.
Other specific scopes that will be considered are:
• Time: the evaluation caters to the implementation of this programme between January 2015 and
March 2021. This excludes any related efforts before and after this period as the technical and
financial assistance, from UNICEF and development partners, intensified in this period which enabled
full-fledged implementation.
• Programmatic: The evaluator will concentrate on the CACs programme exclusively. This will be
important to consider when the attribution/contribution of the programme is evaluated. The
evaluation will consider all criteria according to the CAC protocol
• Thematic scope: This evaluation will cover aspects of the CACs implementation. The evaluation will
look at the relevance of the CAC programme at the national and sub-national levels.
• Geographic scope: This evaluation will have a country-specific coverage focus. At the country level,
this evaluation will cover CACs’ work in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10.
• This evaluation will assess the Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA), equity and gender equality,
and mainstreaming approaches. Particular attention would be paid to exploring the equity
dimensions of the intervention. (For UNICEF equity means that all children have an opportunity to
survive, develop, and reach their full potential, without discrimination, bias, or favoritism. Equity-
based evaluation provides assessments of what works and what does not work to reduce inequity,
and it highlights intended and unintended results for the most vulnerable groups as well as the
123
inequalities in the outcomes for vulnerable children and families. To the extent, possible access to quality
support and outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable children and families (based on ethnicity,
residence, setting – institutional/family, gender, disability, etc.) and identify the groups least reached.
EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
The evaluation will assess the CACs in terms of the following criteria: (i) relevance to national priorities/context and
needs and the child rights and equity agenda, (ii) effectiveness, (iii) efficiency, (iv) impact (v) sustainability, as defined by
the OECD Development Assistance Committee evaluation criteria (OECD/DAC).
Below are given indicative questions to guide the evaluation but the Consultant may further expand and refine them
during the inception phase in consultation with UNICEF and implementing partners and the Reference Group.
The evaluation will provide answers to the following questions:

METHODOLOGY
In order to ensure that the services provided by CACs are according to national standards, conform to the articles of the
125
Child Protection Act and the Child Rights Conventions, a mixed-method evaluation is being commissioned.
Phase 1: Inception: Desk review, evaluability assessment, interviews with CPA stakeholders, development of
research instruments, and submission of the inception report.
6.1. Overall design and approaches
The design of the evaluation will be non-experimental, utilisation focused, and theory-based approaches in assessing
the effectiveness of the CACs and the approaches adopted in the implementation against their intended results. During
the process, the evaluation team will develop a Theory of Change for each programme component and the overall CAC
programme.
A mixed-method approach will be applied in the evaluation combining qualitative and quantitative components to
ensure complementary strengths and non-overlapping weaknesses. The analysis is expected to build on information
collected from a variety of sources through different methods including review of administrative data, primary data
collection from government representatives, representatives of Child Protection agency/ service providers, judiciary,
community members, staff, and managers of the CACs, and others. It should critically examine the information gathered
and synthesize it objectively.
Evaluability assessment
An evaluability assessment (EA) will be integrated into the CAC process of evaluation. The evaluator will conduct a desk-
based EA as part of the inception phase, which will help frame the evaluation and identify the methods.
The EA will likely include key questions on:
• Design and results framework: to what extent is the CP design clearly defined, with a robust Theory
of Change and results framework in place, and relevant to the CAC programme?
• Measurability: to what extent are there appropriate indicators, tools, systems, and resources
established and in use for monitoring, reporting, and learning on progress and results? Are critical
data sets available that are suitable for the intended scope of the evaluation?
The annual reports from CPA and the supporting CSOs will be shared with the Evaluator to contribute to the
measurement of the impact of this programme. The evaluator is expected to triangulate data collection methods and
audiences to ensure the credibility and validity of the findings. The Evaluator will reconstruct a theory of change for the
programme, (for further information, please consult:
www.betterevaluation.org/en/resources/guide/theory_of_change), based on desk review and interviews with
stakeholders.
The Evaluator will commence work on June 1 and by September 30, 2021, would have concluded and submitted the final
report which would have incorporated feedback from stakeholders. The Evaluator expected to work closely with the key
officials of the CPA, (Blossom Inc., CHildLink) and UNICEF through every phase of the evaluation.
Data collection methods
The Child Advocacy Centres evaluation will rely on several quantitative and qualitative information methods that will be
triangulated. The evaluation will use data from primary and secondary sources, including desk review of documentation,
and remote interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, surveys, and case studies to consult groups of rights
holders and duty bearers as appropriate. The final design should specify how data collection and analysis methods
integrate gender considerations throughout the evaluation process.
126
A Desk Review of relevant available annual reports from the CPA. A review of literature will include but not limited to
relevant materials listed below which will be made available to the Evaluator. The Evaluator is expected to review and
reference all literature cited in the inception and final reports. The Evaluator will, on his/her own accord, source other
materials. CPA will make the following available:
- The CAC programme documents
- The CAC implementation standards
- The Sexual Offenses Act and other relevant legislations
- Results frameworks for CACs
- Completed Monitoring forms and reports from CACs
- Budget for the programme, workplans, monitoring system, etc.
- Administrative data related to centres (case files, witness reports, etc.
Primary data collection will be collected through in-depth, Key informant interviews, focus group
discussion, individual face-to-face interviews with questionnaires, and case studies. All data
collection instruments should be developed and pretested in the inception phase. The evaluation
team is expected to ensure that the methodology allows for exploring the views of representatives
of different stakeholders, including CPA, NGOs, social service providers, and UNICEF. Subject to
evolving COVID19 social distancing regulations, the data collection methods will be reviewed before
data collection.
Phase 2: Data collection
The Evaluator is expected to:
• Conduct KII and FGDs with the Director (and designated staff) of the CPA, CEOs of ChildLink and
Blossoms, Social Workers; community members, service providers, healed victim (as per
recommendation, parents/caregivers; and other key stakeholders.
• Conduct observation of centres that are providing CAC services.
• Manage all data in the field in accordance with principles of anonymity and confidentiality. The
safety of data during the data collection phase will be the total responsibility of the evaluator.
• Collect the necessary data to respond to the VfM criteria and conduct the appropriate analyses.
An analytical framework will be developed by the evaluator, outlining how each evaluation question
will be answered/measured and how the information will be collected. This matrix will serve to
ensure data collection coherence, facilitate data triangulation, analysis based on both quantitative
and qualitative data, and participation of stakeholders.
Sampling
Given that this is a mixed-method evaluation, the sampling methodology is also mixed. For the selection of regions,
centres and personnel who will participate in this evaluation, a non-probability purposive sampling will be used, since
the programme was implemented in specific locations.
The stratified sampling method will be used to select regions that did not implement this programme but will be engaged
for comparison. This was chosen since the selection of these centres will be random within and without the regions
where the programme was implemented.
Phase 3: Data Analysis and report writing.
The process will start at the inception phase when the evaluation team will propose a detailed methodology and the
structure of the final report. Data analysis will progress simultaneously with the desk review and the in-country data
collection. The draft final report will be reviewed by CPA, UNICEF, and national stakeholders. The evaluator will
incorporate the comments received and submit the final report to UNICEF Guyana
Data analysis, report writing, and presentation of findings
127
The Evaluator will be responsible for the data analysis, writing of the report, and presentation of findings to partners:
• For the data analysis, the grounded theory methodology will be used, involving verbatim
transcription, coding of data, development of themes, comparison and contrasting of themes, and
recording of findings and theoretical propositions.
• The main findings will be presented by the Evaluator to National Stakeholders and three weeks will
be allocated for comments.
• The writing of the report should be done in constant communication with UNICEF and CPA.
• The final report will be approved by CPA and UNICEF.
Validation of findings
Initial findings will be presented to stakeholders in a workshop to assess the validity/accuracy of the findings and their
relevance to the Guyana context. Stakeholders will be invited during the workshop to provide feedback which will be
documented and incorporated.
General considerations: The methodology of the evaluation should be in line with the United Nations Evaluation Group
(UNEG) Norms and Standards. UNEG Norms and Standards and UN Evaluation Policy (attached).
Limitations
At the time of writing this TOR, the main limitation posed to the CAC evaluation relates to the COVID19, which is affecting
Guyana as it is the rest of the world. Currently, it is impossible to predict how the emergency will unfold in the coming
months and whether constraints will be relaxed, continue or become more restrictive. This will be observed consistently.
Ethical considerations
UNICEF supports evidence generation conducted in full compliance with ethical considerations, including during
evaluations, research, and data collection. Ethical considerations will be assessed and documented, and clearance will
be sought before data collection can commence. The ethical review will include the complete set of evaluation
documents including proposal, inception report, TOR, and related data collection instruments (interview guide), and
other tools as applicable (consent form, protection protocol). Documentation for ethical clearance will be prepared by
the evaluator in accordance with the requirements of the available Internal Review Board (IRB).
No data collected and or reviewed for this evaluation or data to which the evaluator is privileged during the time of the
evaluation- as a direct or indirect result of being the evaluator for this evaluation- can be shared and or be used by the
evaluator neither can s/he approve the use of the whole or any part of it, for personal or professional purposes, without
approval in writing from the Child Protection Agency and UNICEF, jointly.
EVALUATION NORMS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Evaluator will follow the Ethical Guidelines for UN Evaluations (http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/102)
and UNICEF procedure for ethical standards in research, evaluation, data collection, and analysis
https://www.unicef.org/supply/files/ATTACHMENT_IV- UNICEF_Procedure_for_Ethical_Standards.PDF).
To ensure that the key ethical principles for the conduct of evaluation involving human subjects are followed, each
potential respondent will be given full information about the evaluation including the purpose and potential benefits of
the evaluation, their rights, and how the information collected will be used. They will also be informed that all data will
be kept confidentially being only accessible by members of the assessment team. Verbal consent will be collected from
all those who agree to participate. Written ascent from
128
Parents/guardians and consent from children will be obtained. All participants will be informed of their right to
discontinue their participation at any point and approaches for ensuring confidentiality will be described. Since children
are expected to participate in the interviews, the inception report and methodology (including data collection tools,
consent forms, and protection protocols) will need to go through an ethical board for review. The evaluation will not be
able to proceed with the data collection before being approved by the ethical review committee. In this regard, the
evaluator must consult and respect the norms and standards outlined in the document “Ethical Research Involving
Children”: http://childethics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ERIC- compendium-approved-digital-web.pdf . Overall,
the Evaluator is expected to be impartial, credible, responsible, honest1, portray integrity2 and maintain respect for the
dignity and diversity of the individuals interviewed, and respect for human rights, gender equity, and equality3
throughout the evaluation process.
This evaluation follows the norms and standards established by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG)
(http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1914) as well as the UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN
system (http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/100) and will have to be endorsed by the Evaluator during the
evaluation process.
The evaluator is required to disclose in writing any experience, of himself or his immediate family, which may give rise to
a potential conflict of interest, and to deal honestly in resolving any conflict of interest which may arise during the
evaluation. The External Ethical Advisory Group to give clearance of all processes.
DISSEMINATION
The preliminary findings of the evaluation will be presented to stakeholders including the evaluation technical committee,
at a workshop, to be followed by a question and answer session. The comments/concerns will be addressed by the
Evaluator and the necessary changes made to the final report. Once completed, this report will be handed over to UNICEF
and the CPA and then distributed in hard and soft copies to policymakers, heads of agencies, technical officers,
development partners, and civil society. Copies will also be sent to CACs, communities, and other stakeholders to persons
who were engaged in the data collection process. Summaries and child-friendly copies of the findings of the evaluation
will be prepared and disseminated.
QUALITY ASSURANCE OF DELIVERABLES
A Technical Reference Group composed of immediate stakeholders at the country level will be established to assure
quality. The Reference Group will include UNICEF staff (Child protection Specialist, M&E Specialist, Regional Evaluation
Specialist) and Government counterparts (CPA), donors, and other relevant stakeholders. The Reference Group will assess
the quality of key evaluation products, including methodology and evaluation instruments, inception, and final reports. It
will validate all intermediary documents. If not all members of the Reference Group can respond, a minimal quorum will
be established. Comments by the Reference group will be submitted according to a deadline respecting the agreed
chronogram. The Evaluation proposal should include a minimum of two weeks for any comments of validation by the
Reference group and the External Ethical Review Group will also review the final report.
