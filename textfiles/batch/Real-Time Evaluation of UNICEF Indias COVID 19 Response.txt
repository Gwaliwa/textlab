delivery and public confusion around
health-related guidelines. This confusion resulted froma lack of clear-cut and lucid communication around
masking, lockdown protocol and what constituted essential services, as well as if government-mandated
health and nutrition outlets would continue to function. For example, the number of pregnant women that
received 4 or more Antenatal Care (ANC) check-ups in India reduced by more than 40% in April 2020 compared
to the pre-lockdown period (Jan 20 - March 20). Further, given that most health functionaries were
predominantly engaged in COVID-19 related activities, Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) check-ups were
40% lower in April 2020 vis-à-vis April 2019.1
However, overall, the Government of India’s (GoI) response to COVID-19 was pre-emptive, proactive and
graded with a high level of political commitment. Indeed, the government took several preventive and
mitigating measures such as progressive tightening of international travel, issuing of advisories for the
members of the public, setting up of quarantine facilities, contact tracing of persons infected by the virus and
various social distancing measures. Further, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and GoI
drafted and shared the Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks - COVID-19. Accordingly, public health measures
and non-pharmaceutical measures were implemented in all states/UTs. State, district, and block officials were
trained on COVID-19 responses.
The Government of India imposed a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the disease and further
extended it until July 2020. India also launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on 16 January 2021. However,
new variants of COVID-19 were detected, which propelled India into a second wave in March 2021 that
resulted in higher death and infection rates. By June 2021, India was again able to reduce the number of

COVID-19 cases in the country. This decrease was possible because of the sustained vaccination drive, massive
information campaigns, lockdowns, and public strict compliance COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior (CAB). The
third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India between January and March 2022, marked by the rise of the
Omicron variant.
Waves of COVID-19 in India
Wave 1: March -June 2020 Wave 2: March – June 2021 Wave 3: (January -March 2022)
UNICEF India worked closely with World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare focusing its efforts to support coordinated action for the preparedness, containment, and mitigation
of the outbreak from March 2020 till the present. UNICEF adopted a multi-sectoral approach to its response
strategy, coordinating with relevant Ministries involved in the response, to enable policies that protect the
rights of the most vulnerable, especially women and children. UNICEF response plan was designed in early
2020, soon after the onset of the pandemic, with two major goals: (a) minimizing the spread and mortality of
the pandemic, and (b) mitigating its socio-economic impact on women and children. UNICEF’s efforts focused
on:
I. Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) to build resilient communities.
II. Improve Infection and Prevention Control (IPC) and provide critical medical and water, sanitation, and
hygiene (WASH) supplies.
III. Support the provision of continued access to essential health and nutrition services for women, children,
and vulnerable communities, including case management.
IV. Data collection social science research for public health decision making.
V. Support access to continuous education, social protection, child protection and gender-based violence
(GBV) services.
VI. Coordination, technical support, and operational costs.
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed following any explicit ToC. The response
was developed at the onset of the pandemic and there was not much sufficient time to develop a ToC. It
mainly relied on the experience of managing H1N1 and its SBCC strategy. The UNICEF response also lacked a
results framework because of which comparative inferences and achievements could not be assessed against
any set milestones.
Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation:
UNICEF India commissioned IPE Global Limited to carry out a Real-Time Evaluation (RTE) of its COVID-19
Response Strategy to assess and improve the relevance, coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency2 of its COVID-
19 crisis response, by providing real-time feedback and recommendations for improvement across the
different pillars of response outlined above. The objectives of the evaluation included:
• Providing feedback to the UNICEF India Crisis Management Team (CrMT) on the relevance, coverage,
efficiency, and effectiveness of its COVID-19 response.
• Identifying challenges and bottlenecks in service delivery and providing recommendations for
improvement.
• Involving partners and stakeholders in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure it is more participatory

and responsive to needs on the ground.
• Acting as a real-time lesson learning exercise that adjusts and improves planning and performance,
allowing for ongoing correction of the current crisis response, but also collecting lessons for future health
emergencies.
• Identify gaps in UNICEF India’s ongoing evidence-gathering efforts and recommend suggestions.
• Collect data for use in future evaluation/s of UNICEF’s response.
The evaluation team assessed UNICEF’s technical assistance to support the Government of India in addressing
the COVID-19 crisis at the national, state and district level. The evaluation has used Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) evaluation criteria of
relevance, coverage, efficiency, and effectiveness3. The evaluation has assessed UNICEF’s contribution from
the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020) till the evaluation of each pillar had started i.e.:
Evaluation Pillar Pillar-specific evaluation period
Pillar 1 March 2020 – November 2020
Pillar 2 March 2020 – February 2021
Pillar 5 March 2020 – July 2021
Pillar 3 March 2020 – January 2022
The evaluation did not evaluate pillars 4 and 6 because it was mutually decided with the UNICEF research and
evaluation team, given the dynamic COVID-19 context, that the evaluation of these 2 pillars will not serve the
purpose of real-time learning. Hence, these 2 pillars were dropped from the evaluation’s scope of work.
Evaluation Methodology:
A participatory, consultative, and utilization-focused approach was deployed for the evaluation to assess
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response for each pillar against the OECD-DAC criteria mentioned above. The RTE focused
on the delivery and implementation of the UNICEF India COVID-19 Response Plan indicators in five evaluation
states: Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra. A longitudinal-observation design was
used to review the data (documents for undertaking desk review) on a monthly/ongoing basis to provide
feedback and recommendations to improve UNICEF’s ongoing COVID-19 response. A combination of methods
(desk review of UNICEF’s share link data covering all real-time data/reports against each of the pillars,
qualitative interviews, and secondary data analysis) were used for this evaluation. The primary data collection
mainly relied on qualitative methods [Key Informants Interviews (KIIs)] of different sets of stakeholders –
UNICEF officials at the National and State levels, State and District/Block Government officials and Civil Society
Organizations (CSO)/implementation partners. The KIIs were conducted with the key stakeholders who
UNICEF had partnered with or that were involved in/responsible for the design and implementation of the
COVID-19 response activities. These KIIs were undertaken virtually (using online platforms such as Microsoft
Teams and telephonic calls) asface-to-face/on-ground data collection was not feasible due to the pandemic’s
restrictions. Overall, the modes of data collection were outlined in the ToR and mutually agreed upon with
UNICEF.
Overview of the Challenges and Limitations during Evaluation:
• Due to the ongoing pandemic, all data collection took place remotely and online mode. Therefore,
community or beneficiary-level interviews couldn’t be conducted.
• The rapid nature of data collection and analysis meant that gold standards of reliability could not be

Evaluation Report
followed. The evaluation team mitigated these limitations by triangulating the evaluation results reported
in each brief with monitoring data, field and reports received from UNICEF (national and state offices),
and other sources to ensure that multiple sources informed the reported findings of evidence.
• There have been substantial delays in scheduling interviews during the COVID-19 waves in India. The
COVID-19 waves in India affected the turnaround time of UNICEF’s teams and the unavailability of
stakeholders. Moreover, incorporating real-time learning in the evaluation approach also led to the
extension of the evaluation timeline.
• It was of paramount importance to ensure this RTE does not get in the way of the response and overwhelm
already inundated officials. Another limitation of this evaluation was that it needed to respond to the
unfolding situation; therefore, long-term planning was not possible. Response pillars for investigation and
participants were chosen in collaboration with UNICEF on a rolling basis.
• Since the pandemic has affected the whole population, the government and UNICEF’s response plan
targeted the whole population, including the marginalized and vulnerable. Therefore, it is important to
highlight that though gender and equity have been the underlying theme of the pillar-specific evaluations,
it was not explicitly (and in isolation) focused upon by UNICEF while providing essential supplies and
support. Therefore, the evaluation reflect gender and equity as an underlying theme but not an explicit
and standalone area of inquiry. However, UNICEF’s support towards women and children-centric services
(such as routine immunization, antenatal care, etc.), as well as the evaluation of the latter, are evidence
of a targeted attention to this group.
• Given the amount of crucial information, the length of the executive summary and comprehensive report
exceeds the suggested length as per the Global Evaluation Report Oversight System format. Condensing
the information in the report or executive summary may have led to the loss of pivotal information
necessary for depth for any key user.
Key Conclusions on Findings:
The key findings of this evaluation study are grouped under OECD-DAC criteria of relevance, coverage,
effectiveness, and efficiency. Each of them has been summarized below:
Relevance:
The evaluation revealed that the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response were highly
relevant and fully aligned with the government priorities since UNICEF’s response plan was developed in close
consultation with the national and state governments to address their needs. The response plan was
developed in March 2020, and then regularly updated to adapt to the evolving pandemic situation and partner
government’s requests. Often, UNICEF’s activities provided supplementary support to the ongoing
government activities and helped in their bolstering and scale-up. For instance, government priorities w.r.t.
Education largely focused on enabling continuity of education. To address the government priorities, UNICEF
focused on providing support towards continuity of education through providing state-specific strategic
support towards home-based learning, preparation and mobilization of materials and content; and supported
unhindered Early Childhood Development by promoting gender-responsive parenting.
The evaluation found that the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF were tailored to the local
(socio-cultural) context of different states. UNICEF India followed the ROSA (Regional Office for South Asia)
and HQ guidelines (and standard indicators) to structure its COVID-19 response. The global guidelines provided
a wide array of activities and only those sections of the global guidelines were adopted that suited the Indian
context. Rapid assessments were undertaken to identify the state's needs. These were accommodated in the
form of HPM indicators in UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. UNICEF supported state governments across all 5

Evaluation Report
states to develop material in the state’s local language and involved local dialects in the awareness generation
material to increase the understanding and adaptation among people which were critical in the context of the
pandemic. For instance, to support the government’s need for continuity of education, UNICEF supported
state governments across all 5 states to develop material in the state’s local language which could be easily
understood by the children.
UNICEF’s support was largely relevant in meeting the needs of children and families at the ground level. The
cessation of services during lockdown affected, for instance, immunization, institutional deliveries, and
coverage of other essential services, with serious repercussions on maternal and child health. UNICEF was
quick to recalibrate and advocate for the re-establishment of essential health and nutrition services. For
example, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW),with contributions from partners including
UNICEF,drafted the national technical guidelines on Immunization and Reproductive, Maternal, New-born,
Child and Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N), which lead to the partial resumption of services.
Following UNICEF’s engagement, indeed, GoI announced the initiation of early identification and treatment of
children with acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) as a priority action.
Coverage:
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response reached and was accessible to the majority of the sections of the target
population, but not all. For instance, UNICEF officials in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar reported that only 25%
of children had access to continued learning, while the rest of the children lagged behind due to the
unavailability of smartphones, network issues, and limited learning. Though reports and articles state that a
large section of the children, especially from rural areas, could not access continued learning,no mechanism
was in place to validate the percentage quoted by the officials
UNICEF leveraged direct (rapid assessments) and/or indirect (images of people receiving supplies/services,
data regarding reach from partner organizations at the local level) methods to understand the reach and
accessibility. For example, UNICEF officials in Maharashtra and UP informed that telephone surveys – RapidPro
– were extensively used to understand the needs of the people and to assess the coverage and whether
UNICEF’s response is reaching the target population. However, there was no formal or dedicated tracking
mechanism at the community-members’ level to track whether the supplies and services were reaching the
target population; and if they were reaching, then what was the actual coverage of community members being
reached.
Efficiency:
The evaluation found that there was a need for increased resources (human and financial) and that the
available resources for reaching the target population with various services and supplies were not adequate.
For instance, the national level staff of UNICEF informed that the budget allocation received by the
communication departments (C4D and CAP) for undertaking RCCE activities was limited, restricting them to
undertake financial/paid partnerships for wider reach. However, challenges in terms of restricted resources
were mostly mitigated as the situation progressed and UNICEF was better prepared/equipped with the
passage of time and real-time learning. UNICEF health officials at the national level highlighted that, in the
initial months of the pandemic (March 2020), there was a lot of confusion within the UN family – UNICEF,
WHO, and UNDP, globally – on who does what, and what is the mechanism. Indeed, the demand from the
government came to all agencies because the government was not aware, for example, that all the ventilators
were being procured by WHO, and concentrators by UNICEF. This caused confusion and affected the overall
efficiency of delivering the response. This ultimately resulted in the formation of a global portal about UNICEF’s
procurement. Later, additional guidelines helped in defining the roles and responsibilities of UN agencies along
with their sections.
xii
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Evaluation of some pillars (such as RCCE) highlighted that the response was largely timely, coordinated, and
coherent and was delivered in a quality way, while the evaluation of other pillars highlighted that the efficiency
could have been better. For instance, in the RCCE pillar (Pillar 1), in the beginning, the focus was primarily on
CAB (hand hygiene and mask usage). Nevertheless, with the evolving crisis, a need for promoting sensitive
messaging (related to stigma and discrimination, providing psychosocial support) was identified and included
in the response plan. The discussions with internal stakeholders highlighted that there was no delay in the
implementation of RCCE activitiesHowever, the evaluation of Pillar 2 (IPC), brought forth that UNICEF India’s
response could have been executed faster. A major reason cited for the delays in the supply of essential
materials and services was UNICEF’s extensive internal processes (like processing of requests from the
government, on-boarding a new partner, etc.) which were extremely time-consuming. This has been reported
by many of the stakeholders during interviews.
Many respondents of this evaluation also opined that UNICEF’s efficiency improved during the second and
consequently the third COVID-19 wave, as a result of better preparedness and information stemming from
earlier work.
Further, secondary data analysis and interaction with stakeholders highlighted that UNICEF did adapt its
response (activities and support services) based on the changing needs and situation. Important adaptations
include the shift to the virtual mode of communication, training, and knowledge dissemination, the production
of visual and audio content for awareness generation, education etc., the facilitation of online meetings to
plan and support the response, and the provision of WASH supplies based on the needs of the states.
Moreover, knowledge management and sharing were also given importance to promote real-time learning
and adaptation of the response. For example, UNICEF used the ECM platform to share content developed for
COVID-19 activities through studies and reports, which were available to their staff. Finally, Rapid Assessments
served as a source of knowledge and evidence for learnings in the absence of a proper mechanism.
On the other hand, the evaluation identified certain pillar-specific gaps and inefficiencies associated with the
implementation of the crisis response., which are discussed below. These mostly dealt with the lack of
coordination, difficulty in accessing remote geographies, challenges in transitioning to digital modalities across
focus areas, and a lack of scenario analysis. However, sustained efforts were made by UNICEF to address them
and respond to an evolving situation in a dynamic fashion. For instance, the evaluation of Pillar 2 brought forth
that there was scope for improvement in the procurement and provision of critical supplies. UNICEF WASH
officials at the national level opined that UNICEF procedures for working at the L3 level needed to be eased to
allow flexibility and autonomy to the country office to amend the support parameters and guidelines to suit
the country’s context.
Effectiveness:
The evaluation highlighted certain bottlenecks during the implementation of the UNICEF response – mostly
pertaining to lack of coordination across different departments, difficulties in transitioning to digital
modalities, and uncertainty/unfamiliarity with COVID-19 protocol across multiple geographies. For instance,
since the COVID-19 response was mostly health-led, convergence between Health and WASH departments
lacked in certain areas, which led to a different understanding of IPC. As a result, priority areas varied i.e.,
critical areas recognized by the WASH team were not given equal importance by the health team. In addition,
there was no mechanism in place to capture the exact reach of UNICEF’s support and interventions, which
limited the implementation efficiency. Moreover, some officials revealed that in the absence of a structured
platform, there was double counting of community members and people provided with supplies and services.
The monitoring mechanism also lacked in capturing whether the community members were provided with
supplies only once or on a regular/continuous basis.
xiii
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Major reliance was on digital and mass media for undertaking communication activities and messaging which
had its own limitations and grey areas to reach out to all sections of society. Furthermore, network
connectivity also posed a hurdle in reaching the target population.
The evaluation found that UNICEF’s support largely benefitted the target and vulnerable populations, but not
all (as discussed in the previous section). UNICEF collected and leveraged sex-segregated data (wherever
possible and applicable) and HMIS data to identify vulnerable populations/pockets in a state as well as to
assess different support services; based on which UNICEF advocated to draw the government’s attention to
support these people/pockets. By doing so, UNICEF attempted to address equity concerns in accessing
information, supplies and services by women, vulnerable and minority populations. Though UNICEF’s support
was intended to be equitable, lockdown restrictions and the prevailing digital divide have hindered the access
to information and services, as desired. For instance, UNICEF adopted a multi-model approach, which consists
of disseminating through different models a variety of different learning content to children across different
classes and in multiple languages to target the diverse needs of children. UNICEF also provided psychosocial
support to children by bringing 300+ counsellors on board, which contributed to reduced irritation and anger
levels among children. However, in absence of community-level interviews and face-to-face interviews, it was
difficult to ascertain the extent to which the services were accessed by the minority and vulnerable
populations, besides coverage.
Key Recommendations:
The recommendations below were drafted during the evaluation of each pillar and are therefore pillar-
specific4.
Overarching Recommendations:
• UNICEF's internal reporting mechanism mostly reported on the progress and activities. The reporting
systems did not capture the challenges, gaps, unaccomplished goals/targets, and bottlenecks. Capturing
the challenges and gaps would help UNICEF in making course corrections and risk mitigation. This would
help in increasing the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of UNICEF’s response.
• There is also a greater potential for more internal coordination, streamlining processes and joined-up
approaches with other UN agencies which would avoid delays relating to decision-making and the
provision of services. This will help both sections in advocating for common goals, resource planning and
streamlining the response.
• It was suggested that UNICEF should increase its field/on-ground personnel or consultants such that it is
more informed of ground-level challenges of delivery, the effectiveness of its support and working
modalities of partner agencies. This could be done by establishing local-level partnerships at the state level
and linkages with communities, while establishing feedback mechanisms.
• It is also important for UNICEF to develop a results framework with targets and timelines for all its
programs, including emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This would help UNICEF to monitor
progress, track achievements and report. UNICEF has no formal mechanisms in place to understand the
actual reach and coverage of its support. It is suggested that UNICEF deploy a system to capture the real-
time reach of its support to further improve informed planning and advocacy at national and state levels.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
• RCCE needs to move toward achieving actual behavior change, to close the knowledge-behavior gap.
4 Since pillar evaluations were undertaken at different time periods of the pandemic, the recommendations reflect the same. There may be some
recommendations which may have been acted upon by UNICEF after the pillar-evaluation was concluded, and not be relevant in the current situation/
context.
xiv
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
There is a need for a social behavior change strategy, particularly in emergencies. In addition, real-time
evidence should be shared to improve the messaging and communication material, which should be
reviewed and regularly updated. Evolving situations like this requires taking cognizance of everchanging
challenges, such as the current message fatigue.
• Given the changing context of COVID-19, regular training of FLWs/partners are important so that updated
information could reach the community. Improvements can be made in more strategic planning and better
internal coordination between sections/teams (C4D and CAP).
• HPM indicators should be tightened for them to include a unified operational definition, levels of reporting
from the state, coverage/reach of communication package, and the subsequent impact on the ground.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
• UNICEF should work towards tweaking/easing its internal processes such as on-boarding new partners
and mobilizing resources from a local vendor at the state level). UNICEF has a different way of responding
to different levels of emergencies – L1, L2 and L3. It has established mechanisms and roles in place to
loosen up the processes depending upon the level of emergency. These mechanisms should be revisited
and amended when necessary to ease the internal processes and improve the promptness and efficiency
of the response.
• UNICEF can introduce layered auditing and quality assurance compliance protocols for various essential
supplies. For example, it can have extensive auditing and quality assurance for supplies like oxygen
concentrates or PPEs (or pharmaceutical-related supplies) but less exhaustive audit and quality assurance
procedures for supplies like soaps, especially while partnering with well-established donor companies
working at the national level. This will help in increasing the turnaround time of providing support and
reducing donor fatigue throughout the process.
• UNICEF should increase its field/on-ground presence (through local-level partnerships at the state level or
linkages with communities, and establishing feedback mechanisms, institutionalizing, and scaling up state-
level partnerships) such that it can be more aware of the practicality of implementation of different
activities, way of working of partner agencies and donor priorities. This will help UNICEF to advocate with
the government in an improved and more relevant manner.
• Hand hygiene and hand-washing behavior are major focus areas of SBM 2.0 and JJM. The pandemic has
pushed hand hygiene and hand-washing behavior into the limelight. UNICEF should hold on to this
opportunity and focus on advocating more with the ministry to allocate funds and promote good hand
hygiene behavior in future.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
• Since COVID-19 is a health emergency, the government’s focus on prioritizing nutrition is comparatively
less (as a result, Anganwadi Centers are still closed). UNICEF Nutrition section should undertake advocacy
to bring the government’s attention to nutrition under the umbrella of essential services.
• Virtual health consults have been widely leveraged during the pandemic. This has resulted in a neglect of
physical check-ups by both the patient (especially in the case of pregnant women) and service providers.
UNICEF should emphasize the importance of promoting physical check-ups during the training and
capacity-building sessions.
• UNICEF should continue to strengthen community-based and more permanent mechanisms such as PRIs

and SHGs to ensure continuity of services – which would result in a more sustainable system
strengthening.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education:
• UNICEF officials at the state level spent a considerable amount of time searching for partners with the
required expertise to bring on board. For a prompter response, UNICEF can maintain a state-specific
partners pool which can swiftly be tapped into by the program teams depending upon the nature of the
crisis and subsequent requirements.
• The findings indicated that support provided by UNICEF towards continued learning has reached 60-70%
of children. UNICEF should introduce new strategies to reach/ provide access to continued learning to the
remaining 40-30% of children.
• UNICEF is utilizing the available sex and age disaggregated data to focus more on and identify ways of
improving access to continued learning. It is recommended that UNICEF utilize this data to undertake age
and gender-appropriate decisions which will contribute towards inclusive policy decisions in the long run.
Child Protection:
• The overall working capacity of UNICEF was reduced due to the rapid spread of the virus amongst officials,
especially during the second wave. UNICEF should update and maintain its existing rooster pool which
would enable program teams to quickly hire consultants with the required knowledge and skill sets to
support the smooth and efficient implementation of response activities.
• Partnership with Judiciary has helped in expediting the government’s decision-making process and has
resulted in quick actions. UNICEF should continue to leverage this partnership further to advance the Child
Protection agenda.
• Kinship care has received the government’s attention during the pandemic. UNICEF should leverage this
opportunity to advocate and advance the kinship care agenda.
• UNICEF should strengthen the existing government systems (Panchayats, School management
Committees, Teachers, Police personnel, etc.) on which it relies to implement CP activities. Additionally,
UNICEF should focus on developing and strengthening its CSO/volunteer network to implement CP-related
activities on the ground.
Social Protection:
• UNICEF lacked a nuanced understanding of bottlenecks at the implementation level which impacts the
relevance and effectiveness of its support at the planning level. UNICEF should explore mechanisms to
understand implementation procedures and gaps to undertake more informed advocacy and provide
better technical assistance.
• Social protection is a comprehensive theme which requires UNICEF officials to coordinate the response
with multiple stakeholders (ministries and departments). herefore, to improve the efficiency and delivery
of services, UNICEF should increase its human resources at the state level.
• Government processes often delay decision making, whichwas reflected in the reach of benefits to
potential community members. UNICEF should identify ways to reduce the number of departments and
officials involved in the decision-making process to ensure prompter responses.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• UNICEF should continue to focus on developing more trusted partnerships and a consortium of partners
who have fed UNICEF with evidence from the grassroots level. This may help UNICEF significantly in
planning and delivering the response efficiently and effectively.
Since the evaluation itself is a lesson learnt activity, a separate section on lessons learnt has not been included
in this report. The findings will serve as lessons learnt.
The Concept note for Lessons Learnt Review, which was envisaged in the Terms of Reference document, was
not submitted/is not a part of this evaluation report. This was decided in mutual consultation with UNICEF
Research and Evaluation (R&E) team. Instead, based on the learnings that emerged from the pillars, an After-
Action Review workshop has been planned after the submission of the report with the UNICEF CrMT team to
understand what measures were undertaken by them to mitigate the challenges and which good practices
were adopted or scaled up to promote an improved response. The findings emerging from this activity will be
shared with the UNICEF team separately.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT
The report opens with the Introduction chapter which briefs the reader about the background and context of
COVID-19 in India; followed by a sub-section outlining (indicatively) UNICEF’s Response Plan to support the
government and other multilateral agencies in combatting the pandemic. In doing so, the goals of the response
plan and focus areas (6 pillars) have been outlined (as mentioned in the response plan). The chapter then
delves into the real-time evaluation of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response undertaken by IPE Global - its purpose,
objective, scope, study coverage and target respondents, indicative Cost/Budget of UNICEF’s Response Plan,
and information about community members and duty bearers.
Chapter 2 on Evaluation and Methodology begins with the Evaluation Approach – describing the
participatory, consultative and utilization-focused qualitative approach which was deployed for the evaluation
to assess UNICEF’s COVID-19 response for each pillar against the OECD-DAC criteria of Relevance, Coverage,
Efficiency, and Effectiveness. The report then details the sampling design and methodology, followed by the
data collection method and approach, quality assurance measures put in place by the evaluation agency, and
data analysis framework. This chapter concludes with the Challenges and Limitations in this evaluation and
Ethical Considerations adopted based on the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation and the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and
Analysis.
Chapter 3 consists of the Key findings. The key findings have been presented based on the OECD DAC criteria
mentioned above. Under each OECD-DAC criteria, the subsequent KEQs as outlined in the ToR document have
been evaluated and answered. Since pillar-specific evaluation was undertaken as part of this larger Real-Time
evaluation, therefore the key findings have been presented in a pillar-specific fashion for each KEQ.
Since this was a real-time evaluation, and learnings from each concluding pillar were being incorporated into
the evaluation approach of the next pillar, the areas of inquiry (KEQs) were also prioritized/dropped by the
UNICEF section teams and UNICEF Research and Evaluation (R&E) team based on the relevance of capturing a
certain set of information/evaluating certain KEQ.
Moreover, each KEQ has a summative finding which is summarized at the beginning of each KEQ. These
findings represent the larger trend in pillar-specific findings, cross-cutting themes (if any) and examples (used
in the pillar-specific findings) to substantiate the summative statements.
Chapters 4 and 5 include a Conclusion and Recommendations, respectively. The Conclusion largely
summarizes the findings and touches upon each of the DAC criteria in an evaluative tone.
Given the sequential manner of the pillar-specific evaluation rounds undertaken as part of the RTE,
recommendations were drafted based on the findings of each pillar and are therefore pillar specific. It is
important to note that the pillar-specific evaluations were undertaken at different periods of the pandemic
and, therefore, the recommendations drafted and clubbed under this report were drafted during the pillar-
specific evaluation. There may be some recommendations which may have been acted upon by UNICEF after
the pillar evaluation was concluded, and not be relevant in the current situation/ context.

and nutrition, posing particular risks for
vulnerable groups such as young children and pregnant women5. School closures have impacted 247 million
children enrolled in elementary and secondary education and 28 million children who were attending pre-
school education in Anganwadi centers6. This is in addition to the more than 6 million girls and boys who were
already out of school before the COVID-19 crisis. Gender-based violence (GBV), violence against children
(VAC), child marriage, child labor and child trafficking also witnessed an increase as the pandemic spread.
CHILDLINE (national helpline for children) received more than 92,000 emergency calls asking for protection
from distress, abuse, and violence in the first two weeks of the lockdown (2020), representing a 50% increase
from previous months7. Essential health and nutrition services were affected in many parts of the country due
to the lockdown and reallocation of resources for emergency response8 leading to supply disruptions, travel
restrictions, and reduced health worker mobilization which exacerbated these risks. The number of pregnant
women that received 4 or more Antenatal Care (ANC) check-ups in India reduced by more than 40% in April
2020 compared to the pre-lockdown period (Jan 20 - March 20). Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) check-
ups for newborns in case of home deliveries were reduced by 45% in April 2020 compared to April 2019 as
health functionaries were not doing outreach sessions due to being engaged in COVID-19 activities. The
number of immunization sessions held reduced from an average of 1,900,000 in the pre-lockdown period (Jan
20 - March 20) to a little more than 400,000 sessions in April 2020. The number of children admitted to the
Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre (NRCs) dropped drastically as the lockdown was imposed. The number of
women that received the full course of calcium supplements reduced by 40 % during the first lockdown. First
doses of Vitamin A supplements provided to children were reduced by 95%. 9 Elderly people were at a higher
risk of COVID-19 infection due to their decreased immunity and body reserves, as well as multiple associated
comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease10. Since the majority population in India depends on public services (related to health, nutrition,
education, social protection, etc.),the disruption in the provision of essential supplies and critical services
caused multiple issues.
On the demand side, households faced obstacles to accessing such services as they confronted the pandemic’s
negative impacts on livelihoods, employment, food security, and health. The pandemic caused disruptions to
both the supply of and demand for health services that persisted past the lifting of lockdown measures as
community members remained fearful of COVID-19 infection and used those services at significantly lower
rates than before the pandemic11. Also, in the initial months, there was confusion around health-related

guidelines, as there was an absence of clear and lucid communication around masking, lockdown protocols
and what constituted essential services, as well as if government-mandated health and nutrition outlets would
continue to function12. In India, more than 6,472,225 people have been affected and as of June 01, 2022, over
100,877 deaths have been confirmed across the country and continue to rise rapidly.13
India has slipped three spots from last year's 117 to rank 120 on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
adopted as a part of the 2030 agenda14. The pandemic has been an unprecedented wake-up call, laying bare
deep inequalities and exposing precisely the failures that are addressed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. India had made steady progress in newborn mortality reduction in the last five years before
COVID-19, reducing the NMR from 26 in 2014 to 23 in 2017, saving about 75,000 newborn lives each year
(source Sample Registration Survey). COVID-19 poses a danger of losing some of these gains made due to the
impact on health systems. Extra efforts will be needed in districts that are in the states with low social
development indices, high burden of malnutrition among pregnant women and children, high maternal and
child mortality rates, and a slow annual rate of decline of the mortality rates15. Similarly, COVID-19 has
adversely impacted the gains made over the years on other SGDs, including but not limited to, SDG 1-6, 8, 10,
and 11.
The Government of India’s (GoI) response to COVID-19 was pre-emptive, proactive, and graded with high-level
political commitment. The government took several preventive and mitigating measures starting with
progressive tightening of international travel, issuing of advisories for the members of the public, setting up
quarantine facilities, contact tracing of persons infected by the virus and various social distancing measures16.
Further, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Government of India drafted and shared
the Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks - COVID-19. Accordingly, public health measures and non-
pharmaceutical measures were implemented in all states/UTs. State, district, and block officials were trained
on COVID-19. Public awareness and IEC materials on prevention measures were also developed and
disseminated through various media. Training of frontline health workers such as ASHAs (Accredited Social
Health Workers), ANMs (Auxiliary Nurse Midwifery) and Anganwadi workers, training on Infection and
Prevention Control for public sector hospitals was also conducted. In addition, training on IPC for public sector
hospitals was conducted17. Since the adults and elderly were more prone to being infected with COVID-19, a
greater focus of the government response was on them (special advisories were released for protecting the
elderly) than other population groups such as children1819.
A nationwide lockdown was imposed (in March 2020) to control the spread of the disease and further

extended until July 2020. While India ramped up its health care infrastructure during this period, there was a
downward trend by the end of September 2020. India also launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on 16
January 2021. However, new variants of COVID-19 were detected, which propelled India into a second wave
in March 2021 that was much worse. By June 2021, India was again able to reduce the number of COVID-19
cases in the country. This decrease was possible because of the continued vaccination drive, massive
information campaigns, lockdowns, and people again religiously following COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior
(CAB). The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India between January and March 2022, marked by the
rise of the Omicron variant. Despite a milder setback and with no lockdown imposed, this wave too witnessed
the disruption of essential services and a lack of communication around populations eligible for the vaccines
available for use in the country at the time.

1.2 UNICEF Response Plan
From the onset of the pandemic, UNICEF India worked closely with WHO and the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, focusing its efforts on supporting coordinated action for the preparedness, containment, and
mitigation of the outbreak. UNICEF adopted a multi-sectoral approach to its response strategy, coordinating
with relevant Ministries at the national level and Departments at the state level, involved in the pandemic
response to enable policies that protect the rights of the most vulnerable, especially women and children20.
UNICEF response plan was designed in early 2020, soon after the onset of the pandemic, with two primary
goals: (a) minimizing the spread and mortality of the pandemic, and (b) mitigating its socio-economic impact
on women and children. The UNICEF response was aligned with the 2020-21 WHO Global Strategic
Preparedness and Response Plan and the 2020 and 2021 UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC)
appeal. The Response Plan was first designed in March 2020, and then regularly updated to adapt the UNICEF
response strategies and plans to the evolving pandemic progression in India. This updated version of the
UNICEF Response Plan to the COVID-19 pandemic built on the work and plans for 2020 and presented an
indicative outlook of the areas of focus, budget and targets that informed continued support to address the
direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 in India in 2021. It can be noted that UNICEF’s support to the
government is still ongoing in responding to the crisis21.
With multi-sectoral teams in 13 field offices covering over 100 districts across 24 states and union territories,
the UNICEF team comprises experts and State Consultants in health, nutrition, water and sanitation,
education, child protection, inclusive social policy, disaster risk reduction, communication for development,
and external communications and advocacy. UNICEF also built strong partnerships with academia,
professional bodies, government, and civil society organizations to respond effectively to emergencies22. A
(non-exhaustive23) list of partners captured during the RTE has been tabulated in Annexure 8.
UNICEF’s response was divided into the following six key pillars24:
20 See UNICEF Response Plan to COVID-19 Pandemic.
21 Ibid.
22 Ibid.
23 The list of partnerships (in Annexure 8) is not exhaustive. UNICEF works with multiple partners and stakeholders at the national and state level.
Given the scope of the RTE, some of these partnerships were captured using primary and secondary sources to understand how UNICEF leverages
partnerships to deliver the response efficiently manner.

Details about each pillar have been outlined in Annexure 9. It is important to note that since the UNICEF
response plan neither had a Theory of Change nor had any results framework, therefore, the causality and
impact of the UNICEF response were not evaluated as part of the RTE. The RTE focused on generating rapid
learning and thus, a retrospective ToC was not developed by the evaluation agency for the said evaluation.
1.2.1. Cost/Budget
The updated UNICEF response plan highlighted the total funding requirement for January to December 2021
as $67.8 million, against which USD 16.5 million (EURO 15 million) was through the second tranche of the
German KFW grant. The funding status was updated on an ongoing basis with the latest status shared regularly
as part of Situation reports. The UNICEF India COVID-19 Response Plan outlined the below-mentioned budget

The evaluation agency did not receive any information about the actual utilization of the proposed budget, as
a result, a cost-utilization analysis to assess the efficiency of UNICEF’s response plan was not undertaken as
part of this evaluation. This was also not outlined in the scope of work in the ToR.
1.3 Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
UNICEF India commissioned the Real-Time Evaluation (RTE) of its COVID-19 Response Strategy to assess and
improve the relevance, coverage, effectiveness, and efficiency of its COVID-19 crisis response, by providing
feedback and recommendations for improvement across the different pillars27. The ToR defined a real-time
evaluation as:
“...an evaluation that is carried out while a program is in full implementation and the RTE’s purpose if to almost
simultaneously feedback findings to the program for immediate use.”
The objectives of the evaluation are:28
• Providing feedback to the UNICEF India Crisis Management Team (CrMT) on the relevance, coverage,
efficiency, and effectiveness of its COVID-19 response.
• Identifying challenges and bottlenecks in service delivery and providing recommendations for
improvement.
• Involving partners and stakeholders in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure it is more participatory
and responsive to needs on the ground.
• Acting as a real-time lesson-learning exercise that adjusts and improves planning and performance,
allowing for ongoing correction of the current crisis response and collecting lessons for future health
emergencies.
• Identify gaps in UNICEF India’s ongoing evidence-gathering efforts and recommend suggestions.
• Collect data for use in future evaluation/s of UNICEF’s response.
The evaluation is also seen as a ‘lesson-learning’ activity that focuses on capturing the challenges and gaps in
the UNICEF response plan on a real-time basis and providing recommendations for further improvement. The
primary users of the RTE findings were UNICEF CRMT, the core group of senior members, staff and its partners
at the national and state level – to leverage the evidence generated through this evaluation on a real-time
basis to scale-up/mitigate achievements/gaps and further tweak its support based on the on learnings
generated. While the RTE focuses on examining UNICEF’s actions and inputs, where appropriate, relevant
findings may also be shared with UNICEF’s government, UN, and civil society partners involved in the COVID-
19 crisis response to increase learning, accountability, collaboration, and more effective and targeted
27 Given the fast-changing dynamics and situation, Pillars 4 and 6 were not evaluated as part of the evaluation. This was decided by UNICEF India
considering the relevance of this evaluation and its real-time nature. UNICEF India communicated the same to IPE Global.

response. It was intended that the UNICEF Core group will track how the CrMT responded to the findings and
recommendations arising from the evaluation using an action point tracking sheet which will be shared on
UNICEF India's internal COVID-19 site and reviewed during CrMT meetings every month.
1.4 Scope of Evaluation
The evaluation team assessed UNICEF’s technical assistance to support the Government of India in addressing
the COVID-19 crisis at the national, state, and district level. As highlighted in the ToR, the evaluation:
• Covered primarily the current/ongoing time period as the crisis response unfolds, but with a forward-
looking perspective to influence upcoming months of implementation.
• Focused on evaluating UNICEF’s response to the COVID-19 crisis in India to provide feedback on all six key
pillars of UNICEF’s response.
• Collected data continuously with a focus on one pillar at a time. Pillars were prioritized by UNICEF Research
and Evaluation team based on their budget. The key evaluation questions outlined in ToR guided the
development of pillar- and state-specific questions for each round of data collection; these specific
questions were developed with the help of the relevant UNICEF Field office, program specialists and the
Research & Evaluation Specialists based in Delhi.
1.5 Study Coverage and Target Respondents
The RTE study covered five states as outlined in the ToR (Annexure 6), namely Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra,
West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand. UNICEF selected these states based on the following criteria29:
• Maharashtra: Transition state with a high burden of COVID-19 cases; large migration population; urban
programming.
Figure 1: Evaluation States
• West Bengal: High burden state; the mid-level burden of
COVID-19 cases; allows for examining the intersection
between COVID-19 and DRR response.
• Uttar Pradesh: High burden state; the mid-level burden of
COVID-19 cases; promising initiatives by UNICEF.
• Jharkhand: Large tribal population; low COVID-19 cases.
• Bihar: High burden state; mid-level of COVID-19 cases; lacking
external support to the response.
1.6 Right Holders and Duty-bearers
The Right Holders community members of the UNICEF intervention
were community members, including, but were not limited to:
• the vulnerable and marginalized groups such as women,
children,
• migrants,
• people living in hard-to-reach pockets/ difficult terrain, and
• tribal populations in the selected States.
These community members, as a result of UNICEF’s support, were able to receive and access supplies and

services such as health, WASH supplies, education and child protection and social protection services, and
immunization.
The duty-bearers in question were largely in 3 categories:
• Government officials at the Central, State and District levels who were working at the planning level to
contextualize support services based on the needs of the people on the ground in the COVID-19 context,
• Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, Anganwadi workers, Frontline Workers (FLWs),
sanitation and health workers at the community level who were involved in delivering various supplies
and services,
• UNICEF India staff and engaged personnel.

2 EVALUATION APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY
2.1 Evaluation Approach
A participatory, consultative and utilization-focused qualitative approach was deployed for the evaluation to
assess UNICEF’s COVID-19 response for each pillar against the OECD-DAC criteria mentioned above. The RTE
focused on the delivery and implementation of the UNICEF India COVID-19 Response Plan indicators in five
states. Additionally, the evaluation focused on cross-cutting themes of gender and equity as these are integral
parts of UNEG norms and core focus areas of UNICEF and the ongoing work on the pandemic. Considering the
varying strategies/activities implemented in the states for each pillar, the evaluation team closely worked with
the UNICEF R&E team, Sector Specialists at the National and State levels to ensure approaches and tools were
appropriately contextualized for each state to generate comprehensive findings and recommendations. A
longitudinal-observation design was used to review the data (documents for undertaking desk review) on a
monthly/ongoing basis to provide feedback and recommendations on each of the pillars. A combination of
methods (desk review of UNICEF’s share link data covering all real-time data/ reports, qualitative interviews,
and secondary data analysis) were used for this evaluation. The primary data collection mainly relied on
qualitative methods [Key Informants Interviews (KIIs)] of different sets of stakeholders – UNICEF officials at
the National and State levels, State and District/Block Government officials and Civil Society Organizations
(CSO)/ implementation partners. The KIIs were with the key stakeholders who have been partnered with or
were involved in/responsible for designing and implementing the COVID-19 response activities. These KIIs
were undertaken virtually (using online platforms such as Microsoft Teams and telephonic calls). Face-to-face
and on-ground data collection were not feasible for this evaluation given the pandemic. The modes of data
collection were as outlined in the ToR and mutually agreed upon with UNICEF.
Below is the diagrammatic representation of the evaluation process undertaken for the evaluation of each
pillar:
Additionally, a pillar-wise evaluation framework was developed which consisted of KEQs and SEQs against
which activities, achievements and gaps were identified and reported in the ‘Gap Analysis’ sheet. Alongside,
‘Activity Mapping’ (Annexure 5) was done to identify various activities UNICEF conducted to support the state
government in addressing the situational needs using the state weekly, fortnightly, and monthly reports. This
was based on the discussions with UNICEF’s R&E team followed by consultations with the respective national-
level program teams, state teams and desk review of various documents and reports. The approach was useful
as it helped to address and identify the right set of questions and key stakeholders. A similar framework was
developed for each pillar post incorporating learnings coming out from the evaluation of an ongoing pillar.
The findings from secondary data analysis and primary data were triangulated (using secondary findings from
Gap Analysis, Activity Mapping and primary interviews) to develop this report’s Key Findings and
Recommendations.
2.2 Areas of Enquiry
The Evaluation Matrix (Table 1) mentions Key Evaluation Questions, as outlined in the ToR, defined the areas
10
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
of inquiry for the RTE and also guided the development of pillar- and state-specific questions (called as Sub-
Evaluation Questions, SEQs) for each round of data collection; these SEQs were developed with inputs from
relevant UNICEF Field office, and program specialists and the Research & Evaluation Specialists in Delhi30.
However, it is to be noted that not all questions were relevant or not a priority for all pillars and in consultation
with UNICEF teams some of the key evaluations were dropped against some of the pillars. SEQs were also
developed and contextualized to define the scope of each KEQ as per the areas of inquiry set by UNICEF (for
each pillar). These detailed pillar-specific KEQs and SEQs can be found in Annexure 1. Also, the detailed list of
document reviews and stakeholders met are in the annexures of the report.
Some KEQs were not evaluated for certain pillars. This was based on the UNICEF section team’s priorities
towards understanding what was relevant and useful for them to be evaluated at the time. These decisions
were also influenced by the real-time learnings generated from the evaluation of previous pillars. Such
decisions were made in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF India Research and Evaluation and
Section teams.

2.3 Sampling Design and Methodology
Purposive sampling was done for the selection of stakeholders for KIIs. The distribution of these interviews
across each pillar has been given below:
Table 3: Sample Size
CSO/Implementing
Pillar Total UNICEF Government officials
agencies
National State State District/Block State
Pillar 1 55 7 (13%) 6(12%) 14(24%) 16(28%) 12(22%)
Pillar 2 55 8 (15%) 10(18%) 10(18%) 17(31%) 10(18%)
Pillar 3 44 - 10(23%) 10(23%) 14(32%) 10(22%)

219 26(12%) 38(17% 54 (25%) 56(26%) 45(20%)
From the list of potential stakeholders shared by UNICEF for each pillar, purposive sampling was done based
on the KEQs and areas of inquiry set for each pillar. The evaluation agency then shared the final list of
shortlisted stakeholders with UNICEF to draw the first line of contact (intimating them about the objective and
14
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
scope of the real-time evaluation) which was then taken over by IPE Global for further scheduling of
interviews.
Additionally, at the national level, UNICEF section chiefs and any other stakeholder nomination received from
UNICEF were also interviewed for each pillar. Efforts were made by IPE Global and UNICEF R&E teams to
ensure that the sample was inclusive and representative of all levels.
Criteria for stakeholder selection: UNICEF shared a list of stakeholders who were (directly or indirectly)
involved in executing pillar-specific activities and based on the list IPE selected who were anticipated to be
able to answer questions on several topics. Community members were not included as stakeholders for this
evaluation because of (a) its rapid nature, (b) difficulties in adjusting to the virtual modes of data collection,
especially for the respondents and (c) the ongoing delay in the overall timeline due to changes in scope. Hence,
it was mutually decided by the evaluation team and UNICEF R&E team not to undertake community-level
interviews/FGDs.
Also, the ToR kept the inclusion of community members optional, keeping in mind the pandemic situation and
the difficulty of data collection at the community level.
2.4 Data Collection Method & Approach
A qualitative methodology was used to collect the primary data. Primary (KIIs) and secondary data (desk
review and secondary data analysis) collection methods were deployed. Further, tool development,
contextualization, and training of moderators also took place as part of the evaluative process. IPE Global team
undertook a 2-day moderator training before the commencement of data collection for each pillar wherein
moderators were briefed on the data collection tools, the context of the pillar-specific activities, stakeholders,
and their involvement/role in various activities. The training was undertaken interactively wherein each
component of the toolkit was discussed in detail (including goal, and informed consent), and detailed reading
of questions and mock exercises were undertaken. A debrief session was undertaken with the moderators to
discuss their doubts. UNICEF staff was also present during this training to clarify any doubts which were
addressed to them.
• Approach/Step 1: The first step undertaken by the research team at IPE Global was to conduct a desk
review of numerous evidence sources produced by UNICEF as part of its COVID-19 response. Review
materials included, but were not limited to, situation reports, rapid assessments undertaken by UNICEF,
HPM indicators32 and RAM indicators, brochures (such as Journey Through 2020, New Approaches,
psychosocial support of healthcare, Supporting RMNCH continuity), infographics, state and national
booklets, documents/guidance notes (such as POSHAN booklets and on SAM management) that showcase
change in programming strategy, weekly/monthly updates from States for different themes such as
health, WASH, RCCE, Social Protection, Education, Child Protection, RMNCHA and Nutrition, and CrMT
presentations to see how programming had adapted over time to the situation. Global UNICEF guidance
on L3 emergencies was also reviewed. The desk review assisted in identifying trends in performance, and
gaps in knowledge, formulating interview questions and interpreting findings. The desk review was
conducted continuously for each pillar to allow the evaluation team to get up to date. A detailed list of
documents referred to during this evaluation has been shared under Annexure 3.
• Approach/Step 2: KIIs were conducted virtually through online meeting platforms such as Microsoft
Teams and telephonic calls. The exact approach and platform were tailored to suit the respondents. A
total of 219 KIIs have been conducted consisting of UNICEF staff at the national and state level,
32 Human Performance Monitoring (HPM) aims to support UNICEF Country Humanitarian Programs in strengthening results-based capacity, understood
as the management of the humanitarian response of UNICEF. See https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/2161/file/PRESENTACI%C3%93N.pdf
15
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
government officials at the state, district and block levels, state level CSO and implementing partner
agencies across 5 evaluation states. KIIs with national level stakeholders (UNICEF, donors/partners, and
government) and UNICEF officials at the state level were conducted by the IPE Global Researchers whereas
KIIs with State (Government) and district/block (Government officials) level stakeholders and CSO
partners/implementing agencies were undertaken by the trained moderators of IPE Global.
• Approach/Step 3: Data was analyzed by the IPE Global researcher team using content analysis (a matrix
was developed to map the secondary data findings and responses from primary data collection against
the relevant KEQs and SEQs). Triangulation was done of primary and secondary data findings using UNICEF
data, qualitative interviews, and secondary sources for cross-checking the consistency of information. This
was done to deepen and widen the understanding thereby improving the quality of findings. It not only
facilitated the validation of data through cross-verification from different sources but also helped test the
consistency of findings obtained through primary sources and desk review.
Data were collected continuously with a focus on one pillar at a time. It is important to note that since the
evaluation was real-time in nature, modifications and changes were made on a rolling basis. The learnings
generated from each pillar were incorporated into the evaluation of the next pillar to undertake course
corrections. These include, but are not limited to:
• Undertaking additional orientation calls with UNICEF Section teams at the national level to seek clarity on
the ongoing support being provided to the government; and to understand the UNICEF section team’s
priority areas for real-time learning (Pillars 2, 3 and 5).
• Undertaking situational analysis (for Pillar 3) using secondary sources of information to gauge the coverage
of the essential health and nutrition being provided to better assess achievements and gaps.
• Undertaking a greater number of KIIs with the District/Block and CSO partners to better understand the
effectiveness and efficiency of the UNICEF response.
This was done in close consultation with the UNICEF R&E team to ensure that the findings generated were of
use and relevant to the UNICEF section teams and other stakeholders (such as government officials, partners,
and donors) involved in the COVID-19 response at large.
The evaluation did not collect data at the community level (with FLWs, teachers, health workers, SHGs, etc.)
because reaching them virtually, especially during the emergency period, was not feasible for the evaluation
agency (to conduct KIIs) as well as for the UNICEF Research and Evaluation team (to provide a list of potential
stakeholders).
2.5 Quality Assurance
Data were reported at the aggregate level, but pertinent quotes that describe a situation of interest were
included in the pillar briefs, using the type of respondents (provided they have consented to this). Data were
de-identified after analysis and stored securely by the evaluation team. Data will be destroyed four years after
the completion of the evaluation. As per the standard terms and conditions governing this contract, all data
collected for this evaluation will be the property of UNICEF. The quality checks were placed over all the key
activities of the evaluation as shown below:
16

Evaluation Report
Figure 2: Quality Assurance
2.6 Data Analysis
An in-depth analysis of primary and secondary data was carried out using the below-presented framework.
As depicted in the framework, the evaluation deployed a qualitative methodology consisting of secondary
data (Gap Analysis and Activity mapping – as mentioned previously) and primary data (KIIs). The learnings
from these two preserves of data were triangulated to construct a comprehensive picture of UNICEF’s COVID-
19 response in the selected Indian states.
Figure 3: Data Analysis Framework
The evaluation team developed an evaluation matrix as an analysis framework33 (Annexure 7- links to the
analytical frameworks are given in Annexures) and analyzed the areas of inquiry based on the pillar-specific
KEQs and SEQs. While the larger structure, areas of inquiry (KEQs), and method of triangulation remained the
same, the SEQs, specific questions (and probes) in the toolkit, stakeholder categories and their responses
changed with each pillar. Therefore, pillar-specific analysis of the data was undertaken to generate relevant
findings and recommendations. All primary data were analyzed qualitatively using content analysis and
reported by presenting overarching themes and contextual differences. The different situational needs and
33 The analytical framework was developed to analyze the responses from each stakeholder (including UNICEF officials at national and state level,
government officials at state and district level, and CSO/implementing partners) against the questions (SEQs and KEQs). An indicative template
representing the design has been attached under Annexure 7 for reference purposes. This framework was finalized in consultation with the UNICEF
Research and Evaluation team. Links to the detailed analysis framework with finding are also given in Annexure 7.
17
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
activities introduced/supported by UNICEF to address those needs were also fleshed out by the IPE Global
Research team, as were the experiences and needs of the vulnerable and marginalized groups.
Deviations in the Objectives from the ToR and Inception Phase:
• The scope initially involved the evaluation of pillars 4 and 6 of the UNICEF response plan. However, given
the ever-changing COVID-19 context, changes in the situation and priorities of the government, as well as,
based on the real-time learnings emerging from each pillar evaluated, it was advised by UNICEF to drop
pillars 4 and 6 from the scope of this evaluation since it will not add value to the real-time learning.
• It may be noted that since the Real-Time Evaluation is a lesson-learning activity, therefore a separate
section on lessons learnt has not been included in this report, to avoid repetition. Moreover, the Concept
note for Lessons Learnt Review, which was required as part of the Terms of reference document, was not
submitted/is not a part of this evaluation report. This was decided in mutual consultation with UNICEF.
Instead, based on the learnings that emerged from the pillars, an After-Action Review (AAR) workshop
was planned after the submission of the report with the UNICEF section teams to understand what
measures were undertaken by them to mitigate the challenges and which good practices were adopted
or scaled up to promote an improved response. The findings of the AAR workshop will be shared with
UNICEF India separately.
• The pillar-briefs were not shared on a monthly basis, as envisaged in the ToR due to difficulties in
conducting interviews, unavailability of officials because of priorities, delays in UNICEF’s turnaround time
due to engagement in the crisis response, the volume of documents received for undertaking desk review
(for each pillar) and changing priorities (with respect to what each KEQ should focus on evaluation for
each pillar) within UNICEF. One pillar was assessed at a time and a single brief/report was submitted
against each pillar/evaluation round. This was based on a mutual agreement with UNICEF Research and
Evaluation team.
As a result, the evaluation:
• Could not evaluate the relevance, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of pillars 4 and 6 to provide
UNICEF with real-time learnings to improve its data collection and operations during the pandemic.
• Deviation from undertaking and therefore generating monthly reports barred the evaluation from
capturing the changes (if any) which may have been incorporated by the UNICEF CrMT team to improve
UNICEF response. This would have added value to the overall evaluation in assessing UNICEF's efficiency
and effectiveness. However, this will be mitigated through the proposed After-Action Review (AAR)
workshop with UNICEF ICO and relevant section teams. The AAR will help capture measures taken by
UNICEF to improve its response based on real-time learnings generated through this real-time evaluation.
Deviations in the Scope of the Evaluation from the ToR:
• Only 4 out of 6 pillars were evaluated. (Discussed above. Refer to section 1.3)
• The activities undertaken for each pillar varied. Activity mapping was introduced from the second pillar
evaluation.
• Only one pillar was evaluated at a time (Discussed above. Refer to section 1.3) and data for only that pillar
was collected (Process flow represented in Section 2.1. can be referred to for better understanding)
• Due to the pandemic restrictions and associated risks community members were being interviewed during
assessment.
The evaluation has used OECD-DAC (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development -
18
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Development Assistance Committee) 34 evaluation criteria of relevance, coverage, efficiency, and
effectiveness. The ToR deviated from the OECD-DAC criteria and mentioned coverage as a separate DAC
criterion. The evaluation is simply drawing on the evaluation criteria outlined in the ToR. The evaluation has
assessed UNICEF’s contribution from the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020) till the evaluation of each
pillar had started i.e.,
Evaluation Pillar Pillar-specific evaluation period
Pillar 1 March 2020 - November 2020
Pillar 2 March 2020 - February 2021
Pillar 5 March 2020 - July 2021
Pillar 3 March 2020 - January 2022
Frequency of reporting: One pillar was assessed at a time and a single brief/report was submitted against each
pillar/evaluation round.
2.7 Challenges and Limitations
• Due to the ongoing pandemic, all data collection took place remotely and online mode. Therefore,
community or beneficiary-level interviews could not be conducted. To mitigate this to the extent possible,
IPE Global constructed questions for KII to understand the needs of people on the ground.
• The rapid nature of data collection and analysis meant that a scrupulous way of collecting data from various
sources was not possible. The evaluation team mitigated these limitations by triangulating the evaluation
results reported in each brief with monitoring data, field, and reports received from UNICEF (national and
state offices), and other sources to ensure that multiple sources informed the reported evidence findings.
• There have been substantial delays in scheduling interviews during the COVID-19 waves in India. The
COVID-19 waves in India affected the turnaround time of UNICEF’s R&E team and the unavailability of
section teams, government officials, and other stakeholders further extended the evaluation timeline.
Moreover, incorporating real-time learning in the evaluation approach also led to the extension of the
evaluation timeline. Frequent meetings with the UNICEF R&E team helped in planning the timelines and
simultaneous deliverables were being worked upon to mitigate this challenge to the extent possible.
• It was of paramount importance to ensure this RTE does not get in the way of the response and overwhelm
already inundated officials. It was also important to carefully formulate questions and set strict parameters
around the way the RTE is described to participants, so as not to raise expectations about what UNICEF can
do differently. Another limitation of this evaluation was that it needed to respond to the unfolding
situation; therefore, long-term planning was not possible. Response pillars for investigation and
participants were chosen in collaboration with UNICEF on a rolling basis to mitigate this challenge.
• Since the pandemic has affected the whole population, UNICEF responded to the request of the
Government of India (GoI). The GoI support on communication, supplies, and other areas was universal
and therefore no additional information on gender was available. The ToR did not mention gender, nor did
UNICEF’s reporting on activities or secondary documents cover how and to what extent UNICEF supported
gender except pillars/services focusing on specific vulnerable groups. For instance, in supporting the
awareness generation for promoting COVID Appropriate Behavior (CAB), UNICEF’s technical assistance in
developing messages targeted at all and not specific sections of the vulnerable population. Therefore, the
34 See https://www.oecd.org/dac/evaluation/revised-evaluation-criteria-dec-2019.pdf
19
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
evaluation findings, conclusion, and recommendations also reflect gender and equity as an underlying
theme, not an explicit and standalone area of inquiry. But UNICEF’s support towards women and children-
centric services (such as routine immunization, antenatal care, etc.) and the evaluation of such services, do
talk about women and children in particular.
• The evaluation agency did not receive any information about the actual utilization of the proposed budget,
as a result, a cost-utilization analysis to assess the efficiency of UNICEF’s response plan was not undertaken
as part of this evaluation. This was also not outlined in the scope of work in the ToR.
• Given the amount of crucial information, the length of the executive summary and comprehensive report
exceeds the suggested length as per the Global Evaluation Report Oversight System format. Condensing
the information in the report or executive summary may have led to the loss of pivotal information
necessary for depth for any key user.
Lastly, the KIIs were only with service providers and not with community members and, therefore, it was not
possible to identify gender dimensions during the evaluation.
2.8 Ethical Considerations
The ethical principle of ‘do no harm’ guided every aspect of this evaluation. IPE Global, as the evaluation
agency followed the ethical principles and considerations outlined in the United Nations Evaluation Group
(UNEG) Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation and the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research,
Evaluation, and Data Collection and Analysis. In addition, the recently released technical note by the UNICEF
Evaluation Office on conducting evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic was followed, as well as UNEG
norms and standards.35 As per UNICEF standards for ethical research, the evaluation agency gave special
attention to ethical considerations and put in place adequate measures for ethical oversight throughout the
evaluation period.36 During data collection, the evaluation agency ensured informed consent, respecting
people’s right to provide information in confidence and making study participants aware of the scope and
limits of confidentiality.. Special consideration was given to the treatment and storage of participants’ phone
numbers and other identifying information and how the audio recordings were collected, analyzed and shared.
This evaluation did not require IRB approval since the questions administered did no harm to the stakeholders.
This was in agreement with UNICEF, based on the requirements in the UNICEF ethical guidelines37,38.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
3 KEY FINDINGS39
The key findings presented below are presented in the following manner:
1. Each KEQ has a summative statement (put in a box) which is representative of the detailed findings (pillar-
specific). The key findings have been substantiated with examples from the pillar-specific details, and
therefore are repeated (in most cases).
2. The Summative statements are followed by detailed pillar-specific findings. These findings were generated
during the pillar-specific evaluations and summarized in this report.
3.1 Relevance
KEQ 1: To what extent are the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response in line with
government priorities?
The evaluation found that the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response were highly
relevant and fully aligned with the government priorities since UNICEF’s response plan was developed in close
consultation with the national and state governments to address their needs. The response plan was
developed in March 2020, and then regularly updated to adapt to the evolving pandemic situation and partner
government’s requests. Often, UNICEF’s activities provided supplementary support to the ongoing
government activities and helped in their bolstering and scale-up. For instance, government priorities w.r.t.
Education largely focused on enabling continuity of education. To address the government priorities, UNICEF
focused on providing support towards continuity of education through providing state-specific strategic
support towards home-based learning, preparation and mobilization of materials and content (on Diksha
portal, short videos on YouTube, Meena videos, etc.), and supported unhindered Early Childhood
Development by promoting gender-responsive parenting (through responsive parenting program).
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
The evaluation found that UNICEF’s RCCE technical support was in line with GoI’s mandate and was developed
under the guidance of the national and state Governments. UNICEF supported the development of
communication materials, virtual messages, sensitizing various stakeholders (such as front-line workers
(ASHA, and Anganwadi Workers), and NSS volunteers) and broadcasting advertisements. Based on the desk
review and KIIs, the evaluation team found that the messages complemented the Governments efforts and
helped in creating awareness of CAB and protocols and were very much relevant and important at the initial
phase of the pandemic. Later, also the support for sensitive messaging to address emerging stigma and
discrimination toward migrant workers was very relevant and was contextualized with the state's needs. These
were more evident in many places, especially in Jharkhand and West Bengal where returnee migrant workers
were facing discrimination from their community40. For example, to reduce the hype around reverse
migration, messages like “Tilak Karo, Tiraskar Nahi!” were promoted. The discussions with stakeholders
brought forth that at the request of the district government, UNICEF trained block-level stakeholders like
Pradhans on IPC preventive measures. These trainings were helpful and relevant because they not only
focused on informing about preventive measures to be taken in public spaces but also about the steps which
can be taken while at home – such as taking a bath if possible before entering the home. Along with the
support on the communication material, the vehicle or mode of communication supported and facilitated by

UNICEF – like micing, engaging and sensitizing the community and religious leaders etc. were also relevant for
reaching out to the rural and remote communities. These were reflected in our KIIs with the stakeholders.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
Along with creating awareness and support for promoting CAB, the other key priority of the Government was
at the healthcare facility (HCF) level about HCF preparedness, provision and availability of medical equipment
like PPE and oxygen concentrates), management of bio-medical waste, and WASH services and supplies (such
as masks, PPEs, thermal scanners, testing kits, sanitizers/soaps installation of foot-operated hand washing
stations at the community and facility level). In the initial phase and in the second phase there was a surge in
demand for these supplies and equipment and there was a mismatch of demand and supplies. To meet these
increasing needs and priorities, UNICEF supported the procurement of diagnostic tests and oxygen products
and complemented the government in its efforts to ramp up the capacity to test and manage COVID-19
cases41. A review of UNICEF’s progress report42 and discussions with government officials revealed that UNICEF
provided state-specific support by developing its intervention activities at the state level and mobilizing the
resources (from its local partner agencies) to meet the varying needs of the target population. For example,
in Uttar Pradesh, 16,000 N-95 masks and 1000 bottles of sanitizers and 5 lakh soaps were distributed to
vulnerable sections with the support of UNICEF’s Wash partners in 202043. Similarly, there were huge gaps in
the supply of sanitary absorbent materials hence training was imparted to adults and girls to prepare
homemade menstrual requirements in West Bengal44. All these reflect that UNICEF’s response was aligned
with the needs of the community and complemented government priorities, which were reflected in various
interviews.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children, and vulnerable communities, including case
management, and provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
This question was not been evaluated for Pillar 3, in mutual consultation with UNICEF India45. (Refer to
section 2.2)
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education: The evaluation team’s discussion with stakeholders reflects that UNICEF’s support for education
was in line with the Government’s priorities which were on enabling the continuity of education. Since the
schools were closed and the majority of the children especially in rural and children of the economically
weaker section in the cities had no/ limited access to online school education, UNICEF state-specific strategic
support was towards home-based learning (dissemination of learning content via radio, TVs, etc.), preparation
and mobilization of materials and content (on Diksha portal, short videos on YouTube, Meena videos, etc.),
support towards capacitating teachers, AWW and parents for undertaking home-based /virtual learning were
relevant and useful as mentioned by the key discussants during the interviews. Also, the academic calendars
were customized depending on the context and resources of the state as reported by a UNICEF officer in UP.
UNICEF provide support to children who were blind through podcasts and children with low or no digital access
through ‘Mohalla Classes’ across all 5 states (where a teacher would gather a group of 6-10 children to teach

45 As mentioned before, some KEQs were not evaluated for certain pillars. This was based on the UNICEF section team’s priorities towards understanding
what was relevant and useful for them to be evaluated at the time. These decisions were also influenced by the real-time learnings generated from
evaluation of previous pillars. Such decisions were made in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF India Research and Evaluation and Section
teams.

Evaluation Report
in a local setting)46. However, the Mohalla class concept was closed due to the coming in of the second wave.
Child Protection (CP): Similarly on Child protection, the government officials reported that t UNICEF activities
were aligned and responded to the request of various government departments like the Department of
Women and Child Development, Dept. of Labor & Employment, Police Department, etc. UNICEF’s support to
these Government Departments was towards monitoring and tracking children (using state-specific MIS,
publicly available government data, CSO and partner reports/data) and evidence generation, case
management, capacity building of ground staff, mobilizing resources and support from its partner networks in
identifying and providing support to the vulnerable children47. UNICEF national-level officials informed that
state offices provided resources (in the local language) to generate awareness, identify children in need
through partner networks and patching them to Child Care Institutes (CCI) or state-specific sponsorship
services. This was also confirmed by a few state officials. For instance, a UNICEF official from Jharkhand
highlighted that women's helpline number 181 - was used to identify children without parental care or even
those whose parents were in hospitals and there was no one to take care of them. These supports were
relevant and important as mentioned by a few of the stakeholders as there were incidences and reporting of
increased vulnerability of children during the pandemic.
Social Protection (SP): The government's priorities, as surfaced during interviews, with respect to social
protection pertained to providing the benefits of existing social protection schemes (such as food security,
livelihood, health, and education) to the maximum number of people (especially the vulnerable groups like
migrants, informal workers, women and children), capacitating various FLWs and government functionaries,
and efficient resource planning. UNICEF aligned its response with government priorities to ensure better
reach, access and coverage of the Government’s safety net programs by providing technical support to
improve the coverage of existing social protection schemes. This was done by providing support towards48:
• tracking and assessing the economic impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups,
• advocating on safeguarding critical social sector spending, especially those focusing on children,
• supporting continuity of regular SP delivery via review and rapid analysis of the existing SP ecosystem,
• identifying options to expand and extend cash transfers to those in need,
• advocating with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to incorporate the response action (especially focusing on
children and women) in Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDPs),
• providing training (related to resource utilization, existing social protection schemes for potential
community members, ways of availing benefits and monitoring of social services, the expanded role of
Gram Panchayats [GP]) to government functionaries, FLWs (SHGs, AWWs, ASHAs), teachers, and members
of GPs.
The evaluation found that UNICEF’s support was relevant (in the context of the points discussed above)
because many people lost jobs, had limited livelihood and income opportunities and as a result were facing
hardships; therefore, the UNICEF support to ensure effective reach and coverage of Government’s SP scheme
was useful.
Rapid assessments were undertaken by UNICEF in all 5 states to assess the local context and situation and
tailor its assistance to the needs. For instance, in UP the rapid assessment informed that the urban poor were
facing problems in accessing social security schemes due to stringent compliances and low awareness levels.
UNICEF officials in UP identified the gap and are currently in the process of developing a dashboard on social

protection where the urban poor can access the information on social schemes, they are eligible for – to ease
access and increase the uptake of benefits49. Similarly, in Maharashtra and UP community members were
facing difficulty in withdrawing/accessing the financial benefits they received50. UNICEF officials in UP
informed about advocating with the state Finance Department to set up micro-ATMs to ease access to
withdrawing money.
KEQ 2: To what extent are the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF tailored to the local
context in different states?
The evaluation found that the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF were tailored to the local
context (socio-cultural) of different states. UNICEF India followed the ROSA (Regional Office for South Asia) and
HQ guidelines (and standard indicators) to structure its COVID-19 response. The global guidelines provided a
wide array of activities and only those sections of the global guidelines were adopted that suited the Indian
context. Rapid assessments studies were undertaken by UNICEF to identify the state’s needs which were done
quickly without much rigor and were reported to be not be very comprehensive. These were accommodated in
the form of HPM indicators in UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. UNICEF supported state governments across all 5
states to develop material in the state’s local language and involved local dialects in the awareness generation
material to increase the understanding and adaptation among people. For instance, to support the
government’s need for continuity of education, UNICEF supported state governments across all 5 states to
develop material in the state’s local language which could be easily understood by the children. UNICEF also
supported the development of podcasts for children who are blind or face difficulty in watching videos due to
poor networks.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
Rapid Assessments were undertaken by UNICEF at the state level to understand the state-specific needs based
on which a diverse set of communication and engagement strategies were rolled out for creating awareness
and behavior change at the community level. These were tailored to state-specific requirements and context
(i.e., language and socio-cultural context). For instance, in the case of Jharkhand, the material was translated
into 5 tribal languages. On the contrary, many stakeholders interviewed at the district/block level informed
that translation/contextualization was not done at the district/block level and for specific communities/tribes
or groups due to paucity of time. In UP, however, the district/block officials informed that the messages were
purposely translated in a way which involved the local dialect to increase the understanding and adaptation
in the rural pockets. For example, the word ‘DIDI’ was involved in these messages because the SHG members
are called DIDI by the local people. In West Bengal, the local tribe leaders took the initiative to translate the
messages into their dialect to ensure that the messages are understood by all. In Bihar, since many SHG
members are illiterate so the state and local governments with UNICEF’s support ensured that the messages
were audio recorded in the local language/dialect, for the SHGs to understand and disseminate the same51.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention, and Control (IPC)
The evaluation found that many activities were tailor adjusted based on the state’s local context (such as
translation of IEC material per local language, support in designing posters based on local dialects and slangs,
support in suggesting awareness activities based on state’s local resources (groups of volunteers such as NSS
in Jharkhand, wada sakhi’s in UP)). UNICEF officials at the state level explained that even though UNICEF’s
broad intervention areas/themes were finalized at the national level, the underlying activities and support
49 Ibid.
50 UNICEF conducted Rapid Assessments
51 Activity Mapping (Annexure 5)
24
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
were designed/tailored at the state level to suit the state-specific context. A UNICEF official from Jharkhand
explained that only the training for frontline workers was based on national guidelines, the rest (which were
then shared with MTCs, SNCUs, labor room staff, SHGs, etc.) were designed and contextualized at the state
level keeping in mind local staff’s awareness on the virus and its preventive measures, and infrastructure and
resources to treat, etc. Furthermore, UNICEF’s supplies varied based on the needs of the state and were
aligned with the state's needs as UNICEF and state officials confirmed. The messages related to WASH
behaviors were developed locally to befit the local context52. For example, UNICEF officials in UP informed
that the series of TARA videos were developed in UP to ensure that they fit the state’s context. Government
district official in Maharashtra informed that all activities and guidelines were translated into Marathi to
ensure that a maximum number of people are able to communicate and understand them. To further
streamline the process, training material for both healthcare facility staff as well as community workers was
developed in the local language. From various sets of discussions, the evaluation team found that there was
no explicit contextualization was done to reach the most vulnerable children including those of Scheduled
Caste, Scheduled Tribe, orphaned, or out of school.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children, and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
This question was not been evaluated for Pillar 3, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF India.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education: UNICEF tailored its response to the local context in different states. For example, UNICEF supported
state governments across all 5 states to develop material in the state’s local language for easy comprehension
by the children and academic calendars were customized depending on the context of the state as suggested
by a state official.
Child Protection: UNICEF tailored its support to address the needs of children-, child labor and trafficking, child
abuse (GBV), children on the move, refugee children, and orphaned). For example, a UNICEF national-level
official informed that state offices provided resources to generate awareness, identify children in need
through partner networks, and patch them to CCI or state-specific sponsorship services. Similarly, a UNICEF
official from Jharkhand highlighted that women's helpline number 181 – was used to identify children without
parental care or even those whose parents were in hospitals and there was no one to take care of them. The
helpline number, which was promoted through ads, banners, and other channels, was used by people (anyone
– whether related to the child or not) to report such cases. Once identified further support was initiated. In
Maharashtra, the UNICEF official informed that they “worked out a system of communication with ChildLine,
particularly so people know the 1098 number. We publicize it even during the lockdown through community
posters in migrant shelters, through community radios, through AWW and other ground personnel, including
the police. So, if such children were stranded anywhere, they (or anyone on behalf of them) would contact the
helpline and be provided with relevant support (ration, bringing such children to a safe place, etc.) through the
district collector’s office.”
Social Protection: For local contextualization and state-specific assistance, UNICEF conducted Rapid
assessments study in all 5 states to understand their needs and requirements. For instance, in UP, many
migrants and workers were unable to receive ration/COVID-19 relief kits due to the unavailability of required
documents to avail of the services. UNICEF’s advocacy resulted in the release of a D.O. letter directing all DMs
to ensure that free ration kits should be given to all workers in their homes. In West Bengal, UNICEF provided
technical support to the Department of Women and Child Development & Social Work for increasing the

coverage of the Kanyashree Prakalpa (KP) Convergence scheme by submitting a technical policy note to the
state Finance Department seeking approval for the utilization of unutilized funds and continuation of KP
Convergence Scheme beyond March 2021.
KEQ 3: To what extent are the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response meeting
the needs of children and families53?
The evaluation finds that in design and reporting, children, women, and disadvantaged populations were not
explicitly covered. The IPC pillar assessment of the provision of critical supplies reflects that there was no
formal mechanism to track and trace whether the supplies reached the vulnerable communities. State and
district level officials mentioned that the UNICEF’s support was relevant in advocating for the reopening of the
health and nutrition services and preparing the guidelines and standard operating procedures which met the
needs of children and families at the later phase of the pandemic. The cessation of services during lockdown
affected, for instance, immunization, institutional deliveries, and coverage of other essential services, with
serious repercussions on maternal and child health54. UNICEF was quick to recalibrate and advocated for the
re-establishment of essential health and nutrition services..
The working mechanisms and perceptions around the same varied across different pillars and are discussed
below.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
The evaluation brought forth that in design and reporting, children, women, and disadvantaged populations
were not explicitly covered. However, during implementation, attempts were made to reach out to such
populations through various platforms and partnerships (e.g., SHGs, NSS, Wada Sakhis). Rapid Assessments
were used to understand the groups who did not respond to UNICEF’s COVID-19 response material. This
evidence-based gap analysis was further used by UNICEF for tweaking and tailoring the material/messages.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
The IPC pillar evaluation found that there was no formal mechanism to track or trace whether supplies and
services were adequately reaching the target population. UNICEF national-level officials explained that
estimates were made based on the number of states, districts, blocks and FLWs reached/trained/equipped
with services/supplies for further dissemination/distribution. UNICEF state officials informed that
photographs of staff/FLWs distributing supplies, training sessions, functional hand washing stations etc.
served as proof of the support being provided. UNICEF also leveraged the available data (WASH data, COVID-
19 cases, population density, demographics) to undertake assessment, planning and implementation of plans;
such that the most vulnerable sections and pockets are identified, and relevant support is provided. No
additional measures, outside of its functional channels, were undertaken by UNICEF to reach the hard-to-
reach population.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
State and district level officials mentioned that the UNICEF’s support was relevant in meeting the needs of
children and families at the ground level as it focused on strengthening continued access to essential health
and nutrition services through.
53 Sub-categories of vulnerable children and families (migrants, economically disadvantaged, people living in hard-to-reach pockets) varied from pillar
to pillar, depending upon the groups focused by UNICEF section teams. These largely included: children with disabilities, scheduled castes and tribes,
children on the move, street children, children without parental care (in institutions or foster care) and/or those separated from their families,
orphaned, quarantined children, out-of-school children, and victims of gender-based violence (GBV)

Evaluation Report
• advocacy (developing guidance notes for re-establishment of essential services, SAM management,
advocating for leveraging alternative channels to support continuity of services, etc.),
• assessments (outreach camps, immunization sessions held, labor rooms, etc.),
• training and capacity building of FLWS,
• technical assistance towards developing of guidelines and SoPs (standard operating procedures for the
health care providers, CAB guidelines for the healthcare providers, infant and young child feeding, SAM
community management, etc.),
• mobilizing and leveraging partnerships to mobilize resources (for example, UNICEF (Nutrition) in Bihar
mobilized development partners to identify and undertake combined advocacy for priority activities), and
• system strengthening (such as supply and procurement of cold-chain storage, quality of care, etc.).
Essential Health and Nutrition services were compromised during the initial months of the pandemic in 2020
since the institutional mechanisms of delivering services (such as schools and Anganwadis) were greatly
impacted and were not available except for the Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers which subsequently were
converted to COVID-19 isolation centers.
Community-level outreach services were temporarily stopped during the first lockdown and facility-based
services were also compromised to a large extent. Both supply and demand were affected, with service
providers fearful of facing patients while also being engaged in COVID-19 duties. Community members were
also afraid to visit health facilities. Many were unable to access services due to the unavailability of transport.
The cessation of services during the lockdown affected immunization, institutional deliveries, and coverage of
other essential services, with serious repercussions on maternal and child health. UNICEF was quick to
recalibrate and advocated for the re-establishment of essential health and nutrition services following the
lockdown at state and national levels55. For instance, national technical guidelines on immunization and
RMNCAH+N including HIV/AIDS testing, tracking and management were drafted by MoHFW with contributions
from partners including UNICEF, leading to the partial resumption of services. Following this, GoI announced
the initiation of early identification and treatment of children with acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) as a
priority action56. UNICEF also supported the care of sick newborns – for instance, when children were not
going to Malnutrition Treatment Centers (MTCs), UNICEF officials regularly went to the field to motivate
AWWs or Sahiyas to bring them to MTCs57. A state-level government official in Jharkhand explained that
UNICEF developed and implemented community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, by
introducing a home management system which was self-sustainable and acceptable to the community such
that children with severe acute malnutrition could be treated at home. UNICEF also supported the restoration
of Vitamin A supplementation round in 11 states (including the 5 evaluation states).
This question was not been evaluated for Pillar 5. Before commencing pillar 5 evaluation, which had a very
wide scope of evaluating 3 sub-sections under a single pillar, the section teams were requested to prioritize
the KEQs which would help them gain insights about the response so far, and learn about course corrections,
if any. This KEQ was ‘not prioritized/deprioritized’ by the section teams of this pillar and therefore, was not
evaluated for Pillar 5. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
KEQ 4: Is UNICEF’s COVID-19 response programming informed by evidence and guided by a clear ToC?
UNICEF's COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed using any explicit ToC. UNICEF’s Covid-19

response mainly relied on the experience of managing H1N1 and SBCC strategy. The UNICEF response also
lacked a results framework.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
)))UNICEF's COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed using any explicit ToC. The response
was developed at the onset of the pandemic and there was not much sufficient time to develop ToC. It mainly
relied on the experience of managing H1N1 and SBCC strategy. The UNICEF response also lacked a results
framework as a result of which comparative inferences and achievements could not be assessed against any
set milestones.
This question was not been evaluated for Pillars 2, 3 and 5. This was because the learning of Pillar 1
established that there was no ToC in place for the response plan Therefore, to avoid generating similar
findings for each subsequent pillar, it was mutually decided with the UNICEF R&E team to not evaluate this
KEQ for all the subsequent pillars. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
KEQ 5: To what extent is UNICEF India’s response adhering to global guidance on L3 emergencies?
UNICEF's COVID-19 response plan was aligned with the global guidance on Level-3 emergencies. However, it
was formulated before UNICEF declared COVID-19 as an L3 emergency.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
UNICEF's COVID-19 response plan was aligned with the global guidance on Level-3 emergencies. However, it
was formulated before UNICEF declared COVID-19 as an L3 emergency.
This question was not been evaluated for Pillars 2, 3 and 5. It was felt that the learnings of Pillar 1 would be
replicated in evaluations of subsequent pillars and would generate the same results rather than generating
real-time learning. Therefore, it was mutually decided with the UNICEF R&E team to not evaluate this KEQ
for all the subsequent pillars. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1).
3.2 Coverage
KEQ 1: To what extent are the key stakeholders and community members of the different approaches
covered under the six pillars being reached?
The coverage of supplies was targeted and largely reached the focus or intervention areas. Some of the
supplies as in West Bengal were diverted in case of emergency situations. However, the evaluation could not
ascertain how effectively the supplies were utilized.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention, and Control (IPC)
UNICEF’s activities under the IPC pillar targeted and largely reached focus/intervention areas and were
accessible to many of the population as has been reported by the state district officials. While overall the
responses were universal, some supplies/services were diverted to priority areas/sections in case of
emergency. For example, all states reported that while services and supplies were provided to all, migrants
were especially focused on during the migrant crisis58. UNICEF trained ASHAs on using online systems to track
migrants and visit migrant households to counsel them on home quarantine and IPC protocols.
Similarly, KII inputs informed that during floods in West Bengal additional services and supplies were directed
58 Gap Analysis
28
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
to flooded areas to curb the infection spread like support to the state government to set up portable toilets.
However, the evaluation did not find any findings/information indicating whether these toilets were accessible
to vulnerable children and children with disabilities. Moreover, children were not identified as ‘vulnerable
groups’ by the stakeholders. This is because “since the beginning focus was more on the elderly as they were
more susceptible to COVID-19. And later, the focus was more on adults and saving lives in general. In this,
children were not left out but also not explicitly covered” as reported by the state-level government official.
This question was not evaluated for Pillars 1, 3 and 5, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF
India. This question was deprioritized for the other pillars since the pandemic and the response plan affected
and respectively largely covered the whole population and not just a few groups. Moreover, UNICEF provides
technical support to the government in implementing the response activities. Assessing the overall reach
and access was being covered in the next KEQ. Therefore, the evaluation of this KEQ from other pillars was
dropped. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
KEQ 2: Is UNICEF’s COVID-19 response likely to reach/are materials accessible to vulnerable populations,
including children with disabilities, scheduled castes and tribes, children on the move, street children,
children without parental care (in institutions or foster care) and/or those separated from their families,
orphaned, quarantined children, victims of GBV, and out-of-school children?
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response reached and was accessible to the majority sections of the target population,
but not allas reported by the stakeholders especially in rural and remote areas. For instance, UNICEF officials
in UP and Bihar reported that only 25% of children had access to continued learning and large section couldn’t
access due to the unavailability of smartphones, network issues, and limited learning. However, the exact
percentage couldn’t be validated though many reports and studies on pandemic reported that a large section
of the children couldn’t have continued learning due to digital challenges.
UNICEF leveraged – direct (rapid assessments) or indirect (images of people receiving supplies/services, data
regarding reach from partner organizations at the local level) methods to understand the reach and
accessibility. For example, UNICEF officials in Maharashtra and UP informed that telephone surveys –
RapidPro – were extensively used to understand the needs of the people and to assess the coverage and
whether UNICEF’s response is reaching the target population. The government, as well as UNICEF officials in
all states, informed that WhatsApp was used exhaustively to share updates, information, guidelines, and
feedback as well as to coordinate and communicate various activities with the ground staff working at facility
and community levels.
But there was no formal or separate tracking (beneficiary level) mechanism to track whether the supplies and
services are reaching the target population and if it is reaching, then what is the actual coverage of community
members being reached? For instance, a national-level official from UNICEF explained “There is no mechanism
for us to trace whether the beneficiary has received the service/supply or not. If a UNICEF official from X state
has reported that supplies were distributed, then we have to go with that claim. So, it is only the word of
mouth or what the state offices are reporting to us.”
No new vulnerable groups were identified in the second or third COVID-19 wave in the 5 intervention states.
No major challenges were explicitly highlighted by the stakeholder in reaching the vulnerable groups.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
A combination of communication platforms such as digital media, interpersonal communication, and local
group meetings (Gram Sabha meetings, Mahila Mandal, Yuva Kendra meetings, etc.) was utilized to strategize
and disseminate COVID-19-related messaging and material59. This was evident from the review of documents
59 Activity Mapping (Annexure 5)
29
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
and corroborated during KIIs with government, partners, and civil society organizations. For wide coverage
and reach, UNICEF used both financial and non-financial partnerships to support and implement activities in
the priority districts/urban slums and utilized different existing platforms and networks to address the COVID-
19 communication need and priorities60. UNICEF was able to piggyback on their partners; local intervention
areas through the volunteers/staff of NGO/CSO directly working towards providing COVID relief to the target
population. For instance, UNICEF with PHIA-oriented ‘saathis’ in Bihar on the communication content and how
to deliver messages to the people61. Select NGOs in Maharashtra working towards the village transformation
mission have come together with UNICEF to provide masks and create awareness among people through their
local network of volunteers and other community members62.
According to the state government officials, UNICEF’s COVID-19 response largely reached every section and
community in the state and was accessible to all. However, children were not explicitly discussed while
focusing on ‘vulnerable populations’. One of the state-level respondents informed that from the beginning
there was a lot of information about the elderly being at the risk, and therefore attention on children especially
the disabled, out of school, orphaned, etc. was not much in the beginning and came in much later. The district
officials (of all states) informed that initially, messaging and communication were focused more on the urban
areas and quarantine centers. However, later villages and rural areas were also included in the communication
planning and rollout. Sudden and strict lockdown in the initial months was a key barrier to reaching out to
communities.
The KII inputs and news reports informed that during the initial lockdown phase, the major mode of
communication or messaging was through digital and mass media, which had its own limitations in reaching
all sections of society especially the poor and marginalized. Initially, the cases and impact of COVID-19 were
more in urban areas and so the focus and attention of the response was urban-centric and not much on rural
areas. Hence it took some time to develop appropriate strategies and partnerships for rural areas. Moreover,
in the initial period, the less educated/illiterate population who often fall under the vulnerable category were
difficult to reach and covered. However, later with the help of visual and audio clips/messages, they were also
covered. Given the existing network and proximity to the community, ASHA workers, SHGs, AWWs and ANMS
remained a major source of communication and mobilization. Moreover, Wada Sakhis in UP, Jeevikas in Bihar,
SBCC and VRPs in West Bengal, ASHA workers and NSS in Jharkhand are particularly active in reaching the
target vulnerable population.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
UNICEF leveraged the local networks and field channels (paramedics and doctors, SHGs, FLWs, teachers,
Municipal Staff, Wada Sakhis, Jeevikas, NSS, VRPs, janitors, scavengers, field/regional staff of various private
organizations/partners, etc.) of the government and partner organization to facilitate the distribution of
essential services and critical supplies to ensure the reach and accessibility of its support. This has been
mentioned in the UNICEF’s activity and state reports and confirmed by the state and district officials The
evaluation found that the demand/requisition for services and supplies originated from the state/district
governments and was communicated to the UNICEF state officials during monthly/bi-monthly meetings or in
form of a formal demand letter. Once received, UNICEF (along with government, and partners) mapped the
geographical area/target population and approached local partner/CSO from whom resources could be
mobilized. Once the partner agreed to provide the required sources, quality checks were undertaken. After
receiving approval from UNICEF, the partner/CSO provided the supplies/services to the district government

Evaluation Report
who further undertook the distribution of those resources to the target population. For example, an official
from Habitat for Humanity India informed that the organization supported UNICEF by conducting/contributing
to the capacity-building sessions given to the government officials, sanitation workers and community workers
focusing on WASH (how to follow guidelines and protocols given for sanitation and hygiene, how to keep
public toilets clean and operational, etc.).
There was no formal or separate tracking (beneficiary level) mechanism to assess whether the supplies and
services are reaching the target population and the actual coverage of community members being reached.
UNICEF state-level officials from UP claimed that UNICEF’s organic reach in the state was more than 1 million.
This was reported by the government district-level offices directly to the UNICEF state office in UP. But there
was no formal mechanism for UNICEF to trace/track whether supplies and services have been received by the
end consumer/beneficiary. A national-level official from UNICEF explained “There is no mechanism for us to
trace whether the beneficiary has received the service/supply or not. If a UNICEF official from X state has
reported that supplies were distributed, then we have to go with that claim. So, it is only through the word of
mouth or what the state offices are reporting to us.”
Some UNICEF state-level officials informed that they often receive images of ‘distribution-sites’ or target
populations receiving the supplies which for them serves as evidence in the absence of an institutionalized
mechanism to do the same. UNICEF’s Monthly Situational Reports (2020- 2021) mentions the conduct of
telephone surveys – RapidPro – which were also corroborated during the interviews with UNICEF officials in
Maharashtra and UP, were extensively used to understand the needs of the people and to assess the coverage
and whether UNICEF’s response is reaching the target population. Following the feedback received from the
migrants on the RapidPro platform (2020), supported by UNICEF, the Director of the Panchayati Raj
Department has written letters to the concerned departments to ensure better services to migrants as per
state directive63. Government as well as UNICEF officials in all states informed that WhatsApp was used
exhaustively to share updates, information, guidelines, and feedback as well as to coordinate and
communicate various activities with the ground staff working at the facility and community level. Interestingly,
no challenges w.r.t. the receipt of support provided by UNICEF were reported by stakeholders across all 5
states. Moreover, the respondents did not report any section/community who was left out of the UNICEF
response.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children, and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
Discussions with key stakeholders reflect that UNICEF provided support at the state level towards the
continuity of essential services to reach the most marginalized and vulnerable groups, including migrants,
Maha Dalits, tribal population, people living in hard-to-reach pockets, urban slums, and adolescent girls across
the 5 evaluation states. For example, in UP, migrants were considered/identified as the most marginalized by
a majority of respondents from the state (including UNICEF officials). Migrant children and pregnant women
were referred to appropriate immunization and institutions for deliveries, respectively, with support from
UNICEF. Associated with these efforts, was UNICEF’s support for building the capacity of staff through virtual
platforms. Around 158,000 ASHA workers were trained through the blended methodology of WhatsApp
videos and tele-calling in Uttar Pradesh64.
No new vulnerable groups were identified in the second or third COVID-19 wave in the 5 intervention states.
No major challenges were explicitly highlighted by the stakeholder in reaching the vulnerable groups.

services
Education: The rapid assessment (UNICEF 2020), as well as government officials at the national level, informed
that UNICEF’s support towards COVID-19 response was reachable and accessible to 60-70% of children in India
through various means (WhatsApp, TV, Radio, learning apps, AWW/teacher network). However, UNICEF
officials in UP and Bihar reported that only 25% of children had access to continued learning. UNICEF officials
at the national level informed that “there are no means in place to understand how many children say for
example have accessed learning content on TV or radio, how many children were able to have continued access
to digital content, etc. Only a little information/insight that we have about this is through the rapid
assessments. But we do not know how to improve access.” Post-lockdown, access was further restricted
because the mobile phone was a shared commodity in many households. As parents resumed work, the
availability of mobile phones had reduced.
The discussions with stakeholders reflected that no explicit measures were undertaken by UNICEF to increase
the coverage during the second wave since the challenges (unavailability of smartphones, network issues,
limited learning) largely remained the same. For example, a UNICEF national level official informed that “in
terms of school closures and the number of potential children needing learning assistance- it’s very similar
numbers. In terms of how children are being affected from an educational point of view – the situation has
largely remained similar.” Interestingly, UNICEF collected age and sex-disaggregated data (age and sex
indicators were captured as part of basic details while collecting data collection for rapid assessments) as part
of a larger sample, but this segregated data rendered not much use since the focus was on all children,
irrespective of their gender, during the pandemic. The evaluation did not find any targeted approach being
adopted by UNICEF for different groups of children (orphaned, out of school, etc.).
Child Protection: According to the majority of the stakeholders interviewed, UNICEF’s response reached most
of the vulnerable populations. However, UNICEF CP does not have a direct mechanism to reach vulnerable
children or track them65. A UNICEF official from Jharkhand explained that “UNICEF is not a direct implementer.
Hence, we do not have an understanding of the direct reach as such. UNICEF's role is to understand the existing
government programs and identify the means/methods to link children to them. We take the help of our CSO
partners with the paperwork - generating a database of children who have been linked to one or the other
schemes. So that is how we come to know how many children are being reached. Our main job is awareness
generation, identification and linking those in need to the available and appropriate government schemes
through on-ground partners.”
UNICEF provided support to CCI to provide services to vulnerable children66. A UNICEF official from UP
explained that they had provided extensive support to CCI functionaries about how to provide medical
supplies, how to prevent the spread of the virus in institutions if a child has tested positive then how to act,
how to seek medical help and mitigate the risk. As a result, zero deaths were reported due to COVID-19 in
CCIs. Thus, reflecting UNICEF’s support’s reach. UNICEF CP collected age and sex-disaggregated data (through
partners, and CSOs) to understand the reach and undertake steps to improve the coverage. For example, a
UNICEF official from Jharkhand explained that “This data is utilized to understand how many children are being
reached or out of these how many are girls and boys. Say, for example, if within a scheme which is for both
genders, we see that a greater number of boys are being linked than girls, then that automatically is an
indicator for us that more work needs to be done with respect to that. So as a corrective measure, we tweaked
the guidelines where we added a clause stating that a maximum of three children are to be linked and
precedence will be given to the girl child.”

Evaluation Report
Social Protection: Through its advocacy, UNICEF supported government to increase the reach and coverage of
the COVID-19 response to vulnerable populations. Even though the response was reachable to a larger
population, it was not accessible to all. For example, in Jharkhand a government state official (Jharkhand)
informed that there was an increasing number of community members being affiliated with the schemes. For
example, despite schools being closed, the benefits (cash transfers and Mid-Day Meal) are still being provided
to the children – as a result of UNICEF’s advocacy.” However, in the same state, a UNICEF official informed
that approximately 30-40% of the vulnerable population has not been able to receive cash benefits from SP
schemes due to the absence of a bank account. UNICEF has not been able to successfully advocate to ensure
that banks open a bank account in the absence of official documents. Similarly in Jharkhand rapid assessments
indicated that all male-headed households were receiving benefits, but 27% of women-headed households
were not receiving the benefits.
UNICEF officials both at the state and national levels informed that in absence of a formal mechanism to track
it was not possible for them to understand whether the support was accessible and reached potential
community members. One of the UNICEF officials mentioned, “unless we do monitoring of outcome budget
and tracking, we will not come to know what the impact of this coverage has been or whether it is reaching
the women and children or if it is not reaching then what are the reasons.” UNICEF was dependent on rapid
assessment and CSOs and implementing partners as another source to understand the reach and coverage.
For instance, a UNICEF official in Maharashtra explained that Jeevan Rath provides a good platform to
understand the ground reality and challenges faced by people in receiving/availing of SP benefits.
KEQ 3: Is UNICEF’s COVID-19 response likely to reach/are materials accessible to girls and boys equally?
Pillars 1, 2, 3 and 5
Information related to sex and age-segregated data was collected for some pillars, which have been
subsumed under the previous KEQ. This KEQ was not explicitly covered as part of the evaluation. This was
agreed upon in mutual consultation with UNICEF during the pillar-specific evaluations.
3.3 Efficiency
KEQ 1: To what extent is UNICEF allocating its resources optimally and equitably to achieve its objectives
and priorities?
The evaluation found that there was a need for increased resources (human and financial) (pillars 1, 2 and 3)
and that the available resources for reaching the target population with various services and supplies were not
adequate (pillars 1 and 2). For instance, the national level staff of UNICEF informed that the budget allocation
received by the communication departments (C4D and CAP) for undertaking RCCE activities was limited,
restricting them to undertake financial/paid partnerships for wider reach.
However, challenges in terms of restricted resources were mostly mitigated as the situation progressed and
UNICEF was better prepared/equipped with the passage of time and real-time learning. UNICEF health officials
at the national level highlighted in the initial months (March 2020) there was a lot of confusion within the UN
family – UNICEF, WHO, and UNDP global – on who does what, and what is the mechanism. The demand from
the government came to all agencies because the government was not aware, for example, that all the
ventilators were being procured by WHO, and concentrators by UNICEF, which caused confusion and affected
the overall efficiency of delivering the response. This ultimately resulted in the formation of a global portal
about the procurement UNICEF was doing. Later, the guidelines also helped in defining the roles and
responsibilities of agencies and sections within these agencies.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
Activities related to RCCE were implemented extensively across all states. The nature and spread of the
33
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
pandemic created pressure for a quick turnaround time to fulfil the demand and expectations of the
government67. However, many of the discussants expressed that the human and financial resources were not
adequate to meet the priorities and objectives of RCCE and need to strengthen. The national level staff of
UNICEF informed that the budget allocation received by the communication departments (C4D and CAP) for
undertaking RCCE activities was limited, restricting them to undertake financial/paid partnerships for wider
reach. As a result, they largely had to rely on pro-bono partnerships. Furthermore, the UNICEF staff informed
us that the team strength (internal, at the time) was low, and the staff were overworked. The funding
mechanism for communication was highlighted as an issue. Funding related to communication activities was
attached to each sector and not as a separate pot. Hence, there was no separate budget for the utilization of
communication activities.
The design did not include any mechanism for RCCE to ensure the distribution of resources for communication
outreach. However, at the state level attempts were made to cover and include hard-to-reach as well as
vulnerable populations during the rollout. Further, it was reported that financial resources were not adequate
to conduct proper micing/loudspeaker announcements at the village level, awareness campaigns, gram sabha
meetings, Mahila Mandal meetings, printing handbills for villages, etc. specially to reach out to the vulnerable
and the population living in remote areas.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
The evaluation found that more resources could have been provided/mobilized by UNICEF to improve the
efficiency of the response. One of the national level officials opined that “we were doing more with less. Even
though the resources were not ours, it was the first time such a huge amount of investments and resources
were pulled together to respond to such a crisis.” However, one of the officials from UNICEF WASH at the
national level informed that initially, because WASH was not prioritized (by the Ministry of Jal Shakti) at the
onset of the pandemic, it could not advocate for and mobilize resources to its full capacity – “Since this is a
Health-led response and a health emergency, there was a very strong focus on health. Also, in terms of donor
prioritization, most of the funding is going to Health and not necessarily to WASH, which is a challenge because
there is also a requirement for proper access to water supply for drinking and hand washing, soaps, sanitation
facilities, sewage treatments.” The respondents (government officials at the state level, UNICEF state
consultants) explained that it was through UNICEF’s support (like its technical expertise, risk knowledge and
quick turnaround time for developing in-house training material, data collection and analyzing gaps and needs)
that they were able to support the government and guide the staff at facility and community level. “U’ICEF's
support & contribution is very efficient and effective in handling this situation.” – State-level government
official.
UNICEF health officials at the national level highlighted in the initial months (March 2020) there was a lot of
confusion within the UN family – UNICEF, WHO, and UNDP global – on who does what, and what is the
mechanism. The demand from the government came to all agencies because the government was not aware,
for example, that all the ventilators were being procured by WHO, and concentrators by UNICEF, which caused
confusion and affected the overall efficiency of delivering the response. This ultimately resulted in the
formation of a global portal about the procurement UNICEF was doing. Later, the guidelines also helped in
defining the roles and responsibilities of agencies and sections within these agencies.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
According to the respondents (State level government officials, UNICEF officials at the state level and CSO
67 Guidance Note
34
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
partners), the human and financial resources allocated and facilitated by UNICEF were optimal and equitable
in achieving its objectives and priority areas. The secondary data findings also highlight that UNICEF provided
technical assistance at the state, regional and district levels. For instance, in Bihar, UNICEF technically
supported the State Health Society Bihar (SHSB) along with partners in the containment of COVID-19 in the
state. A total of three senior health consultants were deployed in the State Health Society - Emergency Cell
for day-to-day response and management. Additionally, one senior consultant was positioned in the Patna
Regional - Response Cell in the office of Divisional Commissioner Patna for technical support in the
containment of COVID-19 in urban slums68. However, there were respondents (State level government
officials, UNICEF officials and CSO partners) in Maharashtra, Jharkhand UP and West Bengal who strongly
highlighted the need for an increased human resource allocation to ensure that optimal technical assistance
is not only being provided in the aspirational districts but rather can be scaled up to cover all districts.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
This question was not evaluated for Pillar 5, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF India. (Refer
to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
KEQ 2: To what extent is UNICEF managing and delivering its COVID-19 response in a timely coordinated,
coherent, and quality way?
Evaluation of some pillars (pillars 1, 3 and 5) highlighted that the response was largely timely, coordinated,
and coherent and was delivered in a quality way, while the evaluation of other pillars (pillar 2) highlighted
that the efficiency could have been better. For instance, in the RCCE pillar (Pillar 1), in the beginning, the focus
was primarily on CAB (hand hygiene and mask usage). But with the evolving crisis, a need for promoting
sensitive messaging (related to stigma and discrimination, providing psychosocial support) was identified and
included in the response plan. The discussions with stakeholders highlighted that there was no delay in the
implementation of RCCE activities. It typically took a week for the COVID-19-related messaging and activities
to percolate down to the targeted population. However, the evaluation of Pillar 2 (IPC), brought forth that
UNICEF India’s response could have been executed faster. A major reason which had caused delays in the
supply of essential materials was UNICEF’s extensive internal processes (like processing of requests from the
government, onboarding a new partner, etc.) which were extremely time-consuming as a result the supplies
and services got delayed. For example, UNICEF West Bengal could not adequately provide soaps and
sanitizers to some vulnerable sections in the state during cyclone Amphan because in order to redirect
additional resources, internal approvals were required which took approximately 2 months. By the time the
emergency period got over.
Many respondents of this evaluation also opined that UNICEF’s efficiency improved during the second and
consequently the third COVID-19 wave, as UNICEF was well informed of the challenges and limitations of the
pandemic and was better prepared with the passage of time. For instance, (during the evaluation of pillar 5 –
Social Protection) a government official at the state level (Maharashtra) opined that “as soon as the indication
of the second wave kicked in, UNICEF pro-actively got in touch with the government and informed them about
some of the issues which according to UNICEF needed special attention - especially those relating to women
and children (such as issues of nutrition and health).”
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
UNICEF's overall COVID-19 response was executed in a timely manner and evolved with the changing scenario.
For instance, in the beginning, the focus was primarily on CAB (hand hygiene and mask usage). However, with
68 Bihar State Booklet, pp. 02
35
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
the evolving crisis, a need for promoting sensitive messaging (related to stigma and discrimination and
providing psychosocial support) was identified and included in the response plan. Most of the stakeholders
reported that there was no delay in the implementation of RCCE activities. It typically took a week for the
COVID-19-related messaging and activities to percolate down to the targeted population. Also, the
implementation of the activities happened in a phased manner and in many cases were dependent on the
situation and focus of the state. For example, in Bihar, communication activities started a bit late since initially,
the state’s focus was not much on communication.
Though the communication roll-out was timely but in absence of a monitoring system, it was difficult to track
the progress, of both the outcome (and at a disaggregated level (gender, vulnerable population, etc.) it was
difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the communication. There was no uniform monitoring mechanism
across states to track actual coverage and reach of COVID-related messaging/activities. The reported numbers
were not actual headcounts, rather, they were the estimated number based on different activities carried out
across the states including viewership/likes/comments on posts on different digital media platforms. While
UNICEF’s staff provided regular updates on activities and progress through monthly and fortnightly situational
reports, there was no formal/official feedback mechanism in place to ensure that relevant feedback from the
community and FLWs is taken into consideration for decision-making and designing activities.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
Discussion with stakeholders reflects that UNICEF India’s response could have been executed faster. A major
reason for delays in the supply of essential materials to both healthcare facilities as well as the community
was UNICEF’s extensive internal processes which were extremely time-consuming. For example, UNICEF West
Bengal could not adequately provide soaps and sanitizers to some vulnerable sections in the state during
cyclone Amphan because in order to redirect additional resources, internal approvals were required which
took approximately 2 months and by that time emergency period got over. Additionally, at the national level,
UNICEF health could not provide PPE kits to the government due to national and global scarcity (and the
absence of local manufacturers). Moreover, there were quality issues and hence UNICEF could not approve
the supply. However, this problem was resolved once the market in India picked up and local manufacturers
were able to meet UNICEF’s requirements. An official from the UNICEF donor agency informed about similar
delays due to extensive auditing of soaps – “UNICEF should be mindful of the situation we all are working in.
Such extensive auditing for soaps (had it been vaccine or any pharma product then that would have been a
different case), whether the color was blue instead of green, for example, caused an unnecessary delay in the
supply.” The synergies and interlinkages were well developed to optimize the COVID-19 response. UNICEF,
across all 5 states, streamlined the response by interlinking its partnerships with the government and service
providers depending upon the need/request UNICEF received from the government.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children, and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
According to the stakeholders, UNICEF’s response to support the continuity of essential health and nutrition
services has been timely, coordinated, and coherent. For instance, a UNICEF official in Bihar opined that
UNICEF’s support has been ‘very timely’ because “UNICEF recognized this kind of situation much ahead than
the government because UNICEF is an international organization, so it also helped us to go to the government
advocating with the limited available evidence that was first accessible to us.”
A CSO partner in Jharkhand informed that UNICEF was quick to introduce guidelines for the continuation of
IFA supplementation for women and adolescent girls in the state. “UNICEF prepared guidelines within a week
and get it approved in the next week, so within 10 days all SOPs, guidelines and directives were issued, so it
36
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
was in a very timely manner.” The respondents also informed that UNICEF’s response to support the continuity
of essential health and nutrition services was more efficient and timelier in the second and the third COVID-
19 waves as compared with the first. This was because UNICEF, as well as the government and CSOs, were
better prepared (how to leverage partnerships, how to leverage dissemination channels for delivering
essential supplies and services during restricted movement, etc.) in the second and third COVID-19 waves.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education: The majority of stakeholders at the national and state level (across all 5 states) informed that the
response largely reached those who had access to continued learning, in a timely and coordinated manner.
For example, a block-level official in West Bengal opined that the UNICEF response was timely and coordinated
because they received the translated material (into Bengali and Alchiki) every fortnight. A UNICEF national
level official explained that UNICEF’s support was largely conditional on government agreement and
processes, which sometimes delay the response activities – “For example, learning material for children and
training module is prepared and ready from UNICEF's end but the senior government official hasn’t given the
approval yet, so we cannot proceed. There is going to be a delay.” UNICEF leveraged existing partnerships with
government and CSO partners to ensure the timely delivery of the response.
Child Protection: According to the majority of stakeholders (government, CSOs and UNICEF) across all 5 states,
UNICEF largely managed and delivered its support in a timely and coordinated manner. UNICEF prepared and
launched the training model within 2 weeks of the lockdown and advocated for and prepared the guidelines
for CCIs to prevent the spread of the virus. UNICEF provided timely support to the government through the
capacity building of stakeholders involved in providing support and information about what to do and how to
do – it to the support personnel. For example, CCI functionaries (across all 5 states) were trained about how
to identify early symptoms amongst children, what steps to take if a child tested positive and how to
quarantine children within the CCI. UNICEF officials (Bihar and UP) however, highlighted that the response
could have been more efficient and timelier towards addressing the migrant crisis – with more resources and
proper ‘scenario planning’. UNICEF official in Jharkhand informed that an increased number of cases
(government and UNICEF stakeholders getting infected, family members getting infected, partner volunteers
working on the ground being infected, etc.) also delayed some activities (getting approvals from government
counterparts, volunteers not being able to reach children to connect them to a CCI, etc.) in the state.
Social Protection: Many government officials at the national and state level (across all 5 states) informed that
UNICEF’s contribution has been timely and ‘proactive’ in respect of identifying resources to provide social
protection to vulnerable populations and capacitating the support staff at the grassroots level. Subsequently,
they also highlighted that policy and planning level changes were time-consuming due to lengthy government
procedures and therefore cause some delay in the delivery of support. “UNICEF’s consultation is on time, but
its reach was slightly delayed due to governmental processes. So maybe implementation and roll-out can be
further investigated.” – Government State-level Official in Bihar
Government officials at the national level as well as UNICEF officials (national and state level) believed that
UNICEF’s response was timelier and more efficient during the second wave as compared to the first wave. For
instance, a government official at the state level (Maharashtra) opined that “as soon as the indication of the
second wave kicked in, UNICEF pro-actively got in touch with the government and informed them about some
of the issues which according to UNICEF needed special attention - especially those relating to women and
children (such as issues of nutrition and health).”
UNICEF had largely leveraged government partnerships (and to some extent CSO partnerships) to ensure the
timely delivery of the response. For instance, UNICEF Maharashtra partnered with Sigma Foundation to
37
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
generate evidence from rapid assessments which contributed to timely response planning.
KEQ 3: To what extent is UNICEF adapting its activities to become more efficient based on learning and a
changing COVID-19 context?
The evaluation highlighted that UNICEF did adapt its response (activities and support services) based on the
changing needs and situation. Shifting to the virtual mode of communication, training, and knowledge
dissemination, producing visual and audio content for awareness generation, education etc., facilitating
online meetings to plan and support the response, and facilitating WASH supplies based on the needs of the
states – are a few adaptations to mention. Moreover, knowledge management and sharing were also given
importance to promote real-time learning and adaptation of the response, for example, UNICEF used the ECM
platform to share content developed for COVID-19 activities. All case studies and reports were available on
the ECM website for UNICEF staff. Rapid Assessments also served as a source of knowledge and evidence for
learnings in the absence of a proper mechanism.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
The evaluation found that based on the evolving needs during the pandemic, communication and messaging
content, mode, and technique were modified over the period. During the lockdown phase, all training for FLWs
and SHGs were done virtually. UNICEF created WhatsApp groups for sharing messages and feedback. This
feedback was taken into consideration while developing the next batch of communication/IEC material. This
enabled UNICEF to introduce context-appropriate messages in the public domain. However, an increased
focus on behavioral change was required to ensure the effectiveness of CAB and that people follow
protocols69. The qualitative discussions with UNICEF and government officials highlighted that to promote
adaptation in the response, knowledge management and sharing mechanisms were also given importance.
For this purpose, UNICEF used the ECM platform to share content developed for COVID-19 activities. All case
studies and reports were available on the ECM website for the UNICEF staff. The Crisis Management unit was
established to address the challenges and develop actionable solutions70.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
The evaluation of this pillar informed that there was no well-established knowledge management and
knowledge sharing mechanism within UNICEF to contribute to learning and adaptation of the response. When
probed, UNICEF officials at the national and state levels stated that rapid assessments served as a source of
knowledge sharing helping them to analyze and assess the response/support so far and understand the needs
of the target population. A UNICEF national official informed that UNICEF state officials from the WASH section
had independently conducted studies to understand the response in their individual states and accordingly
assess the kind of adaptations needed. UNICEF along with WaterAid as part of its partnership conducted a
study to understand how COVID-19 had impacted WASH services in the country, how and what support was
provided, and how useful and relevant it was. This helped UNICEF advocate with the government about some
of the mainstream issues like WASH hygiene and hand hygiene and how these can be improved in India.
There was no mechanism in place for UNICEF to learn from the good practices of service providers at the
national level. UNICEF state officials also did not know/did not inform about any such method of adopting and
incorporating good practices of service providers/partners.

education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV) services
This question was not evaluated for Pillars 3 and 5, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF
India. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
However, the KII inputs informed that UNICEF’s response to support the continuity of essential health and
nutrition services was more efficient and timelier in the second and the third COVID-19 waves as compared
with the first. This was because UNICEF, as well as the government and CSOs, were better prepared (how to
leverage partnerships, how to leverage dissemination channels for delivering essential supplies and services
during restricted movement, etc.) in the second and third COVID-19 waves.
KEQ 4: Are there any inefficiencies associated with the implementation of the crisis response (e.g., low
awareness and uptake, unavailability of frontline workers and other key personnel, misunderstanding or
misuse of UNICEF’s messages etc.)?
The evaluation identified certain gaps and inefficiencies associated with the implementation of the crisis
response. These were pillar-specific and have been discussed below. These mostly dealt with the lack of
coordination, difficulty in accessing remote geographies, challenges in transitioning to digital modalities across
focus areas, and a lack of scenario analysis. However, sustained efforts were made by UNICEF to address them
and respond to an evolving situation in a dynamic fashion. For instance, the evaluation of Pillar 2 brought forth
that there was scope for improvement in the procurement and provision of critical supplies. UNICEF WASH
officials at the national level opined that UNICEF procedures for working at the L3 level needed to be eased to
allow flexibility and autonomy to the country office to amend the support parameters and guidelines to suit
the country’s context.
It Is Important to note that the secondary literature available did not highlight gaps and critical aspects. It
simply stated activities undertaken by UNICEF. Therefore, the evaluation had to largely rely on KII inputs to
understand gaps and inefficiencies.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
The evaluation found that there was an absence of a real-time MIS system within UNICEF to track the progress
of activities implemented under RCCE. This restricted UNICEF to evaluate the efficiency of overall response
(especially qualitative outputs) and the progress of outcome indicators. Disaggregated data on the reach and
coverage of vulnerable populations such as women, children, and migrants were not available, as highlighted
during qualitative discussions.
The UNICEF officials at the state level informed that given the pro-bono nature of non-financial partnerships,
there was comparatively less control pertaining to the intensity, frequency, and accountability of various
activities implemented via these partnerships. The pro-bono partnerships did not allow UNICEF to ensure that
the external agencies were prioritizing UNICEF messaging in a quality and timely manner. Given the pro-bono
nature, the external agencies often prioritized their own motives/tasks, and not aligning with UNICEF’s
priorities.
Also, certain geographies like Naxal affected/hard-to-reach areas were difficult to cover due to poor coverage
of digital media during the lockdown.
KII inputs also revealed that initially, it was difficult for FLWs, and SHGs members to operate through digital
learning platforms and understand the modules. However, later they became accustomed to and comfortable
to a certain extent with the use of the digital mode of learning. Moreover, due to the lack of personnel and
funds to hire new personnel/volunteers, existing FLWs and other stakeholders were overworked. UNICEF state
officials (Jharkhand, Bihar) were of the opinion that lack of scenario analysis and preparedness, in the
beginning, hampered the overall planning and implementation of activities efficiently.

Evaluation Report
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
The evaluation found that there was a lack of consensus between UNICEF Health and the WASH section about
the priority areas on which UNICEF should focus on w.r.t. IPC response. UNICEF’s IPC interventions could have
been more efficient had there been an improved collaboration between the two sections. UNICEF WASH
officials at the national level opined that both section teams (Health and WASH) should work more on
streamlining their internal collaboration and convergence as well as convergence with WHO to ensure that
the priority areas, as well as critical activities, are mutually identified. This was seconded by a UNICEF official
in Jharkhand. Moreover, according to UNICEF national officials, UNICEF WASH’s inputs were diluted across
different pillars and subsequent section teams (like communication, health, education, etc.). As a result, it was
unable to lead/take independent decisions (especially related to resource allocation to activities since the
response is led by other section teams) for WASH priority areas.
There is scope for improvement in providing critical supplies. According to UNICEF West Bengal, UNICEF is not
adept to respond to health calamities such as COVID-19. It should incorporate health emergency response in
its L3 response measures apart from its existing emergency responses to natural calamities.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, and provision of essential routine health and nutrition services; and Pillar 5: Access to continuous
education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV) services
This question was not evaluated for Pillars 3 and 5, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF
India. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
3.4 Effectiveness
KEQ 1: What bottlenecks exist to the efficient implementation of the crisis response? What has UNICEF not
thought about it delivering its response in each area under the six pillars?
The evaluation highlighted certain bottlenecks during the implementation of the UNICEF response – mostly
pertaining to lack of coordination across different departments, difficulties in transitioning to digital
modalities, and uncertainty/unfamiliarity with COVID-19 protocol across multiple geographies. For instance,
since the COVID-19 response was mostly health-led, convergence between Health and WASH departments
lacked in certain areas, which led to a different understanding of IPC. As a result, priority areas varied i.e.,
critical areas recognized by the WASH team were not given equal importance by the health team. There was
no mechanism in place to capture the exact reach of UNICEF’s support and interventions and therefore
limiting the implementation efficiency. Moreover, according to some officials, in the absence of a structured
platform, double counting (of community members and people provided with supplies and services) was
being done. The monitoring mechanism also lacked in capturing whether the community members were
provided with supplies only once or on a regular/continuous basis.
Major reliance was on digital and mass media for undertaking communication activities and messaging which
had its own limitations and grey areas to reach out to all sections of society. Furthermore, network
connectivity also posed a hurdle in reaching the target population.
The above discussed are a few bottlenecks to the efficient implementation of the crisis response. More pillar-
specific bottlenecks have been discussed below.
It is important to note that the challenges/limitations/bottlenecks have largely been drawn from primary
sources of information since the secondary sources (documents received for desk review) only informed about
the activities undertaken and UNICEF achievements. The secondary literature lacked limitations, and
challenges faced by UNICEF.
40
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
• COVID-19, initially, was urban-centric and there was a lack of resources and existing partnerships in urban
areas to support and implement communication activities. This resulted in a delay in the implementation
of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response.
• Major reliance was on digital and mass media for undertaking communication activities and messaging
which had its own limitations and grey areas to reach out to all sections of society. Furthermore, network
connectivity also posed a hurdle in reaching the target population.
• The restricted movement, due to the lockdown, also delayed the process of reaching out to the remote
areas and vulnerable sections of the population. UP state officials informed of the delay in budget
allocation as a barrier to the efficient implementation of the RCCE activities. This restricted them from
adhering to the set timelines/deadlines to meet the target.
• There was an absence of a comprehensive monitoring mechanism to track the progress of various
activities and generate real-time learning to modify/alter the activities. The non-availability of adequate
resources (internal) to implement communication activities had compromised the anticipated efficiency
of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. Overlap of activities (media engagement) and lack of coordination
between the C4D and CAP teams resulted in duplication of tasks and non-optimal resource use.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
• UNICEF faced difficulty in advocating with the Ministry of Jal Shakti, initially. This was primarily because
COVID-19 is a health emergency and largely led by the Ministry of Health and UNICEF faced a challenge in
advocating and mobilizing support to make the line ministries take the WASH response more seriously.
• Urban-centric support was a new domain for UNICEF in many states. UNICEF officials faced difficulty in
establishing rapport with the urban bodies and governance structure in a short span knowing that the
engagement may be short-lived. But this was quickly resolved with help of partnerships. For example,
World Vision helped UNICEF overcome this barrier in West Bengal.
• UNICEF country office did not have much flexibility to alter the global indicators in order to suit the
country’s context. For instance, the indicators lacked to extensively cover hand hygiene and hand washing
behavior which were very critical to capture as part of WASH support provided by UNICEF.
• UNICEF’s extensive reporting was communicated as a barrier. One of the national level stakeholders
explained “Our reporting requirements are absolutely waste. Anything we do we have to report on 5-6
dashboards and platforms with 5000 words in each platform. Excessive reporting is happening. One must
be realistic about what is possible and what is not possible.”
• The partner onboarding process was reported to be time-consuming at the time. This resulted in delays in
providing support in a timely manner (Refer Efficiency, KEQ 2).
• Donor reporting/ accountability often becomes an area of concern for UNICEF. With fast-changing
situations, emergency areas and pockets that require support change quickly. UNICEF facilitates resources
from donors against a specific requirement. Given the delay in procuring approval for the supply, the
emergency/need area often changes in which case UNICEF has to redirect the acquired resources. This
often becomes problematic for UNICEF as it has to explain to the donor why it rerouted the resources
from original community members to new ones.
• No mechanisms were set up to check the quality of training. Online training did not allow UNICEF officials
to capture participant interest, involvement, and whether the participant was able to understand what
41
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
was being imparted.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
• Fear among the field staff, especially during the second wave, to deliver service on the ground and
undertake household/community visits was a major challenge for coverage. Psychosocial support training
was provided to overcome this hurdle, but, according to the respondents, the coverage did not improve
during the peak of the COVID-19 wave(s).
• More focus was on COVID-19 vaccinations compared to Routine Immunization “which lowered the
efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response with respect to Routine Immunization as most of the people were
busy with vaccination duties. According to a state official, 5-6% of more coverage could have been achieved
if Medical Officers and people were not solely engaged with COVID-19 vaccination duties.”
• Along with routine immunization, basic nutrition services were hampered in some states as expressed by
some of the stakeholders interviewed. A UNICEF official in West Bengal expressed concern about nutrition
not being prioritized by the government – “Nutrition does not get the priority which it should, Anganwadi
centers are still closed, and children are not getting complementary feeding etc. We have also not been
able to monitor our response.”
• Time-consuming lengthy procedure and due diligence for seeking UNICEF’s approval on various activities
during emergencies – “UNICEF takes a lot of time for giving approval and clearing proposals in such
emergencies where a quick action and response should be made.” – CSO, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.
• Lack of human resources with required technical knowledge to support the continuity of essential services
in states.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education:
• A lot of time was spent looking for the right partners for partnerships who matched the required expertise
and skill set. Having partners’/consultants’ who could be immediately tapped into could have improved
the efficiency of the response. Many partners (including the government) did not extensively focus on the
equity-based approach that UNICEF intended. “Many partners and governments focus on achieving short-
term goals. They do not understand that if we aim at long-term planning and goals, the benefit will
automatically reflect in short-term goals/outputs. For instance, Dalits and disabled children are often
forgotten about while designing a program. Therefore, if we inclusively design the program, it will benefit
all.” – UNICEF Official (UP). A government official in West Bengal mentioned that “UNICEF is an
international organization, and their decisions and budgets are fixed at a higher level and as per their
global planning. They do not set goals taking the grassroots realities of any state or district into
consideration.”
• Low/no literacy levels among parents restricted them from supporting home-based learning for children.
In some instances, parental attitude towards children’s education was not very supportive. This hindered
continued learning as children were encouraged to engage in labor/earning activities instead of studying.
During the first wave, teachers/AWWs/CSO volunteers were not very scared of going to the field and helping
children (AWWs showing video content on their phones, teachers narrating stories using temple mic/speakers,
and providing worksheets to children with no digital access, etc.) – thus enabling some local activities for
children with no access to digital content. This was discontinued in the second wave due to the high number
42
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
of COVID-19 cases.
• TV, Radio and other modes of virtual education only enabled one-sided communication – which was not
very beneficial. This also did not allow the teachers, and organizations such as UNICEF to assess whether
children were understanding the content or not. There was no means to capture the exact learning loss.
• There was a high teacher burnout during both waves, according to UNICEF officials and the district-level
government officials. During the first wave, teachers were not efficient with the technological modes of
learning. This however reduced during the second wave as teachers became comfortable with virtual
teaching and started making video content as well. Overall pressure (due to health emergencies in the
families, and the overall worsening situation in society) resulted in high-stress levels in the second wave
resulting in a poor level of teaching and limited learning.
• No internal capacity challenges were reported.
Child Protection:
• The response plan and activities were more adversely affected in the second wave compared to the first
wave as more officials and staff or their family members got infected resulting in a shortage of manpower.
• According to UNICEF national-level officials, since the pandemic had been a health emergency there was
a lack of recognition of child protection issues as the government had not been allocating adequate
resources towards child protection, despite UNICEF’s continuous advocacy.
• UNICEF’s response could have been more effective if it had dedicated FLWs to work with. UNICEF CP
officials informed that they had to depend on the Panchayat system or school management committees
or teachers or police personnel as well as personnel identified by partners to function because there was
no paid functionary by the government for CP activities.
• Absence of a National MIS system to track children benefiting or requiring support under CP also affected
the effectiveness of the response: States like Bihar and Maharashtra have a state-specific CP MIS system
to track the number of children receiving CP services (number of children in foster homes, children on the
move receiving ration kits, etc.).
Social Protection
• A limited number of UNICEF staff also affected the delivery according to a UNICEF official, as there were
not more than 2-3 UNICEF staff members managing various interventions in multiple districts and
coordinating with government departments and CSOs. Increasing the number of human resources might
have improved the efficiency of the response.
• Even though UNICEF’s advocacy and technical assistance were timely, the delay from the government’s
end (such as delays in inter-departmental communication and coordination, delayed internal approvals,
time-taking procedures, etc.) often reduced the overall efficiency and turnaround time of COVID-19
response at both national and state level.
• In UP, the UNICEF official informed that the government was more focused on furthering its political
agenda and a lot of government resources were deployed towards the same. It was a challenge for UNICEF
to convince the government to implement UNICEF’s recommendations w.r.t. the development agenda.
• Many national and state-level services were not easily available and accessible to those who move across
borders. UNICEF had been advocating for developing a system (such as one nation one ration card) to
make the benefits agile and easily accessible by the majority of people. But the intended output had not
been achieved at the time.
43
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• One of the main challenges faced was that though there have been changes at the policy and planning
level, they did not necessarily eliminate bottlenecks at the implementation level. A UNICEF official at the
national level explained “Unlike other UNICEF programs, we do not engage at the field level to provide
benefits. So, tweaking something about the delivery system at policy level does not necessary solves
bottlenecks at ground level, such as class-based discrimination, which may hinder delivery mechanism in
rural pockets, etc.”
KEQ 2: To what extent are the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response achieved in an
equitable manner benefiting women and men, and vulnerable and minority populations?
The evaluation found that the UNICEF’s support largely benefitted the target and vulnerable population to
whom the support was reachable, but not all (as discussed in the previous section). UNICEF collected and used
sex-segregated data (wherever possible and applicable) and HMIS data to identify vulnerable
populations/pockets in a state as well as to assess different support services; based on which UNICEF
advocated to draw the government’s attention to these people/pockets. By doing so, UNICEF attempted to
achieve the intended outputs and outcomes (which were the provision of critical supplies and continuity of
services) equitably. For instance, UNICEF adopted a multi-model approach (different learning content for
children across different classes and in a different language, disseminated through different modes) to target
the different needs of children. UNICEF also provided psychosocial support (by bringing 300+ counsellors on
board) to address the emerging needs to relieve children’s stress which contributed to reduced irritation and
anger levels among children.
But at the same time, the response lacked in reaching all, effectively. For instance, the Risk perception among
young men and women was quite low and 57% of the respondents were comfortable using the same essential
services (grocery stores, public spaces, and public transport) as they used to in the pre-COVID-19 scenario.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
UNICEF’s internal HMIS data71 indicates that out of three output indicators, the target of one indicator
(Number of people engaged in COVID-19 through RCCE actions) has already been achieved while the
remaining two are ‘on track’. These numbers are just estimations and do not represent actual reach. Double
counting could be one of the limitations. In the absence of disaggregated data, it was not possible to comment
on whether communication messaging had reached ‘equitably’ the target vulnerable population. UNICEF’s
internal and other external evidence (produced by Population Council, Water Aid) suggested that RCCE
activities had not been fully translated into the desired action. Studies72 show that Risk perception among
young men and women was quite low and 57% of the respondents were comfortable using the same essential
services (grocery stores, public spaces, and public transport) as they used to in the pre-COVID scenario. Health
workers – ASHA, AWW, and ANM are the primary source of information for 41% of respondents. Significantly
higher proportions of women depend on them as compared to males. A significantly higher proportion of
female respondents depended on family members for receiving any information related to COVID-19 whereas
a significantly higher proportion of male respondents depended on social media and newspapers for the same.
However, as informed earlier, attempts were made during the implementation of activities to reach out to the
vulnerable populations using different platforms (FLWs, SHGs, Micing/Loudspeakers, Rath Yatra, community
radio, etc.).

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
According to the majority of respondents, UNICEF’s response w.r.t. IPC was ‘highly effective’ (on a scale of
highly effective, partially effective, and less effective). For example, the CSO partners in Jharkhand and Bihar
opined that UNICEF’s response met the needs of the target population as well as of service providers.
According to a CSO partner in WB, frontline workers and healthcare workers were most vulnerable during the
pandemic. And it was UNICEF’s support which helped build their capacity and informed them about the latest
information. Additionally, UNICEF was able to provide supplies (such as PPEs, hand washing stations, soaps,
oxy meters, etc.) at both HCF and community levels. According to government officials and CSO partners across
all 5 states, there was no duplication in terms of IPC-related activities in states. A block official in Jharkhand
explained that even though WHO and UNICEF both were providing support w.r.t. IPC activities (like training)
in states, there was no gap or overlap. This was primarily because, according to him, the roles of both
organizations were established.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
The respondents opined that the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response were achieved to a
major extent benefitting the vulnerable population. UNICEF officials across 5 states informed that HMIS data73
was used to identify vulnerable populations/pockets in a state as well as to assess different essential services;
based on which UNICEF advocated to draw the government’s attention to these people/pockets. By doing so,
UNICEF attempted to achieve the intended outputs and outcomes equitably. For instance, a UNICEF official
from West Bengal informed that “We regularly assess HMIS data through which we are aware of districts that
require more support and attention. This is monthly data that we receive for services like institutional delivery,
routine immunization, ante Natal care, etc. We cannot give disaggregated numbers for all population groups
but indicators such as maternal deaths we see where they are happening. And then we do focused advocacy
following which there are review meetings in which UNICEF participates. So, through our advocacy, we talk
about the most vulnerable and try to focus the government’s attention.”
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education: The majority of government stakeholders opined that UNICEF’s response was effective in meeting
the needs of those vulnerable children who were able to access its support. For example, a government official
at the national level explained that UNICEF adopted a multi-model approach (different learning content for
children across different classes and in a different language, disseminated through different modes) because
there was no ‘one size fits all’ w.r.t. education. Moreover, UNICEF also provided psychosocial support to
address the emerging needs to relieve children’s stress74. UNICEF officials in Maharashtra informed about
supporting children with no smartphones by providing stories (available in multiple languages and for different
age groups) available on a toll-free number (where children can simply call and listen to a story). In Jharkhand,
UNICEF officials informed that they received positive feedback75 from parents as well as CSO partners that
simple messages on psychosocial support provided by counsellors (with UNICEF’s support) were very helpful
for parents in engaging with their children. This resulted in reduced irritation and anger levels among children.
However, some stakeholders opined that UNICEF’s response was partially effective because it had not been
able to address the needs of 30-40% of children (as per rapid assessments and government official at the
national level) who had very limited/no access to continued learning. UNICEF official in Jharkhand opined “We
were not able to reach each and every child. The entire initiative’s reach was limited.”
Child Protection: Most stakeholders (government, CSO/partners, UNICEF) opined that UNICEF’s response was

45

Evaluation Report
effective in addressing the needs of vulnerable children however, there were some components of the
program which were partially effective. UNICEF national level official opined that “on one hand we were highly
effective in quickly developing child protection strategies, providing online training and adapting to the new
modes of functioning; But on the other partially effective in influencing the allocation of government resources,
or ensuring that CP receives extreme importance like health.” A UNICEF official at the national level informed
that orphaned children were provided fostering support by Child Welfare Committees and District Child
Protection Unit who were trained by UNICEF (informed about ways of handling children, what steps to be
taken in placing the children, etc.) across all 5 states. Moreover, UNICEF also developed migrant camp
advisories to develop a checklist to ensure that certain facilities and services are in place (such as the 1098
ChildLine number should be displayed so that children in distress/unaccompanied/faced violence could be
reported/found) for children76. UNICEF officials in Maharashtra informed that UNICEF reached the children
living in hotspot areas and containment zones with psychosocial support via faith-based organizations (who
were provided with material and resources to communicate by UNICEF).
UNICEF official in UP highlighted that effectiveness of the response towards addressing the needs of
vulnerable children cannot be properly understood in the absence of a feedback mechanism – “For example,
MHPSS was a very innovative approach to have a panel of counsellors on a pro-bono basis. But we didn’t have
a feedback system for clients to understand their experience with us or to seek their inputs/insights about how
we have provided our services and what we could have done better. Further, there were no mid-term
assessments that could help us undertake course correction (to understand and address the needs of children
more effectively)”.
Social Protection: The majority of respondents opined that UNICEF’s response had been effective in achieving
the intended outputs and outcomes. For example, a government state-level official from Jharkhand informed
that under the 15th finance commission certain provisions were introduced for GPs to use untied funds. But it
was through UNICEF’s capacity building and handholding support that they were able to better understand
the situation – what is required and how to utilize funds and provide support. Moreover, the FLWs were aware
of the schemes and through those channels, a greater number of community members received information
on SP schemes.
Some UNICEF state level officials opined that the response was more effective in achieving the intended
outputs and outcomes during the second wave, as compared to the first wave. For example, a UNICEF official
from Maharashtra explained that “The first wave was focused towards analyzing the situation and identifying
entry points to contribute towards COVID-19 response. During the transition phase (i.e., between the first and
second wave) UNICEF put mechanisms in place for tracking schemes, established alliances and generated
evidence from its pilot interventions. This evidence was used in the second COVID-19 wave to provide more
effective support. We were more confident during the second wave”.
KEQ 3: What unintended outcomes are realized that need to be reinforced or mitigated?
The evaluation found that due to the adoption of virtual modes of work, the stakeholders had become more
tech-savvy. This improved coordination among stakeholders and facilitated faster decision-making. Moreover,
the pandemic provided an opportunity for UNICEF WASH to expand its support in urban areas. UNICEF WASH
officials at the national and state levels opined that the pandemic gave a major boost to hand hygiene – an
area which UNICEF was advocating with the government to promote under SBM 2.0 and Jal Jeevan Mission.
Similarly, issues of adoption, foster care, kinship care and family-based care had emerged as important areas
and came under the limelight due to the pandemic.

46
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
This question was not evaluated for Pillar 1, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF India. (Refer
to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
There were no unintended outcomes as communicated by the UNICEF Officials at the state and national levels.
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
Respondents were informed about the following unintended outcomes of UNICEF’s response:
Positive:
• Digital mode of communication and training was adopted very well throughout the state by all
stakeholders. As a result, the connectivity among different stakeholders increased.
• Direct communication channels were established, due to the virtual modes of communication being
adopted during the pandemic, for the CSOs to be in direct touch with the government authorities. This
contributed to faster and improved coordination and communication among stakeholders. This to some
extent was facilitated by UNICEF’s support.
Negative:
• Telephonic conversations were undertaken by the doctors with pregnant women to monitor their health.
This, however, led to a neglect of physical check-ups by both the caregiver and the pregnant woman as
they were avoiding coming to the health facility, even when the risk of COVID-19/number of COVID-19
cases was low.
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education: State-level UNICEF officials highlighted that the decision-making process had improved in terms of
speed w.r.t. government approvals and decisions. Additionally, some teachers had shown the capacity of being
resource persons who could contribute towards innovative learning continuation methods and curriculum
development. Parents’ engagement with their children w.r.t. education also increased. Parents were seen
narrating stories to their children and spending more time with them.
Child Protection: The evaluation found that the issues of adoption, foster care, kinship care and family-based
care had emerged as important areas and came under the limelight due to the pandemic. KII inputs informed
that neighbors and relatives were seen coming forward to look after the children in the absence of a primary
caregiver. Also, the importance of having a strong volunteer network that could deliver CP activities on the
ground was highlighted by the pandemic.
Social Protection: No unintended outcomes (positive or negative) were informed by the stakeholders (at the
national and state levels) of this pillar evaluation. However, a UNICEF official in Maharashtra highlighted a
‘good practice’ which should be continued in the future – Developing a trusted partnership and a consortium
of partners had helped UNICEF significantly in delivering the response efficiently and effectively. These
partnerships fed UNICEF with grassroots evidence which further enabled UNICEF to undertake informed
advocacy at both state and national levels.
KEQ 4: How well is UNICEF’s response coordinated?
47
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
UNICEF’s response was largely well-coordinated externally (Pillar 1), but there were a few instances of lack of
internal coordination (Pillar 2). UNICEF actively initiated meetings and leveraged official channels such as
demand letters to government and regular emails to partner agencies and maintained transparent and timely
communication. However, the evaluation of pillar 2 highlighted a lack of internal convergence between the
UNICEF Health and WASH sections.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
Almost all respondents informed that UNICEF’s overall COVID-19 response was effective and well-coordinated.
Many respondents mentioned that there was some duplicity in the tasks/activities performed by UNICEF, its
own partners and other partners working in the state. However, that was unavoidable in an emergency. State
officials in UP informed that UNICEF, WHO, PHFI, MOU, and NSS were working in a coordinated manner,
wherein, UNICEF primarily provided technical assistance on awareness and communication-related activities.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
According to UNICEF officials across all 5 states, UNICEF’s response was well coordinated to a larger extent
with few instances of incoordination. UNICEF communicated and coordinated (internally and externally)
through channels such as regular/fortnightly/monthly meetings with state officials, emails, and demand
letters communicating the requirement, telephonic calls and WhatsApp – which helped in coordinating the
response activities with government and partner organizations, efficiently.
At the same time, the evaluation also found that there was a lack of internal coordination and convergence
between the UNICEF Health and WASH sections. One of the UNICEF WASH officials at the national level
informed us that there was a need for improved convergence between the two section teams. For example,
improved convergence to identify common priority areas under IPC. This was seconded by a CSO partner who
communicated that since many departments (UNICEF and government) were involved in IPC response, it often
resulted in one department prioritizing one aspect while the other prioritizing another, and vice-versa. This
reduced the clarity about priority areas, restricts the optimal utilization of resources and affects the efficiency
of response. Hence increased convergence among UNICEF departments/teams is recommended.
This question was not evaluated for Pillars 3 and 5, in mutual consultation and agreement with UNICEF
India. (Refer to section 2.2 and Annexure 1)
Gender and Equity
The gender equity aspect of the RTE program appears to be weak. The program did not have any gender-
specific response strategy. The discussions with stakeholders did not reveal any explicit gender focus during
implementation or gender-specific targeting for most of the pillars except for advocacy and training related to
the resumption of the reproductive and maternal child health program. This is also because UNICEF support
was in response to the specific request made by the Government of India or the State Governments. The
Government of India’s Covid response was a universal response program without any positive bias towards
gender or any group. However, from interviews and desk review it was evident that UNICEF response was
addressed to cater to the needs of the vulnerable section of the population and the population staying in
remote areas. From the desk review of documents, it was not evident how inclusive the responsive was for
the disabled persons baring instances of podcasts for blind children.
COVID-19 caused women to suffer disproportionately, whether through impact on their incomes, savings,
agency or access to healthcare. The COVID-19 crisis created compounded economic impacts that are felt
especially by women and girls- who are generally earning less, saving less, and holding insecure jobs or living
48

Evaluation Report
close to poverty. Between March and April 2020 alone, an estimated 17 million women in both the formal and
informal sectors were left jobless. Literature review suggests, COVID-19 has exacerbated pre-existing social
barriers and decreased women’s ability to access essential services. The challenges include difficulties in
accessing adequate food and nutrition, gaps in access to basic healthcare as supply chains for essential
medicines and reproductive health services are interrupted. One of the study showed that nearly 70 million
women in India lack ration cards, which grant access to the central food ration system. An IWWAGE survey
further found that of their respondents, 28% of women did not have PDS access, and 20% of women did not
have ration cards. The pandemic has had a long-reaching impact on mental health and has increased the
prevalence of oppressive manifestations of gender inequality and domestic violence.
The evaluation finds that gender concerns were reflected in the continuity of the basic services of RMNCH.
UNICEF’s advocacy and technical support have influenced the resumption of the RMNCH services and the
gradual increase in access to services. However, there has been limited data available which makes it difficult
to assess the extent to which gender concerns were integrated across all the COVID-19 priority areas. UNIECF
was also providing technical support on social protection schemes but how it supported women was not
evident. From the desk review of documents and stakeholders’ discussions it was also not very evident how
the interventions supported and addressed the gender-related priorities of caregivers, teachers, and front-
line workers. There was some evidence in the RCCE pillar of using community groups for information flow and
participation. Some UNICEF report has documented evidence of inequities such as the digital divide,
vulnerabilities of girls and boys leading to dropping out of school, increased child marriage and gender-based
violence. There was not sufficient data and information to make assessment of the gender outcome of the
interventions, and comment on the ender transformative aspect of the interventions.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
4 CONCLUSIONS
At the overall level, the evaluation found that while UNICEF’s response was largely relevant in addressing the
pandemic and supporting the government, in few areas it lacked/had gaps in its coverage and efficiency, which
ultimately impacted its effectiveness. Also given the lack of data and information it is difficult to comment the
outcome and the transformative approach of the UNICEF’s support.
The evaluation found that the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response were relevant and
aligned with the government priorities as UNICEF’s response plan was developed in close consultation with
the national and state governments to address their needs. The response plan was developed in March 2020,
and then regularly updated to adapt to the evolving pandemic situation and partner government’s requests.
UNICEF India followed the ROSA (Regional Office for South Asia) and HQ guidelines (and standard indicators)
to structure its COVID-19 response. The global guidelines provided a wide array of activities and only those
sections of the global guidelines were adopted that suited the Indian context. These were accommodated in
the form of HPM indicators in UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. The activities supported by UNICEF were tailored
to the local context of different states. Rapid assessments were undertaken to identify the state’s needs.
UNICEF’s support was moderately relevant in meeting the needs of children and families. As UNICEF was
responding to the Government’s request, the Government’s pandemic response focused on the elderly and
then on saving the lives of the adult population and children were not a focus in the initial period The cessation
of services during the lockdown affected, for instance, immunization, institutional deliveries, and coverage of
other essential services, affecting maternal and child health services. UNICEF advocated for the re-
establishment of essential health and nutrition services which were resumed after couple of months.
However, certain support services (such as education) were not reachable to many children who lacked access
to digital means or lived in hard-to-reach pockets.
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed using any explicit ToC The response was
developed at the onset of the pandemic and there was not much sufficient time to develop ToC. It mainly
relied on the experience of managing H1N1 and SBCC strategy which was not very effective with COVID. The
UNICEF response also did not have a results framework and therefore difficult to track progress and assess
achievements. A TOC and results framework would have been useful for monitoring and program
adaptation. It is also important to note that UNICEF reports only informed about the activities undertaken
and achievements but did not cover the impact, challenges and gaps. Omission in capturing the gaps and
challenges during regular monitoring and reporting is not very helpful for program correction and especially
so for a pandemic response
UNICEF’s COVID-19 response reached and was accessible to many sections of the target population, but not
all. Only 25% of children (in UP and Bihar) had access to continued learning due to the unavailability of
smartphones, network issues, and limited learning. UNICEF leveraged – direct (rapid assessments) or indirect
(images of people receiving supplies/services, data regarding reach from partner organizations at the local
level) methods to understand the reach and accessibility.
There was no uniform formal or separate tracking (beneficiary level) mechanism to assess whether the
supplies and services are reaching the target population and if it is reaching, then what is the actual coverage
of community members being reached, except for relying on what the stakeholders or officials on the ground
informed.
The evaluation found that the available resources were not adequate given the demand and need. However,
Evaluation of pillars (pillars 1, 3 and 5) highlighted that the response was timely, coordinated, and coherent
and was delivered in a quality way to a certain extent (with few gaps), while the evaluation of other pillars
(pillar 2) highlighted that the efficiency could have been better. The evaluation of Pillar 2 (IPC) brought forth
50
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
that UNICEF India’s response could have been executed faster. A major reason which had caused delays in the
supply of essential material was UNICEF’s extensive internal processes (like processing of requests from the
government, onboarding a new partner, etc.) which were extremely time-consuming as a result the supplies
and services got delayed. Also, there were challenges with respect to internal coordination which affected
efficiency of support,
Many respondents of this evaluation also opined that UNICEF’s efficiency improved during the second and
consequently the third COVID-19 wave, based on the learnings of the first wave like how to leverage
partnerships, how to leverage dissemination channels for delivering essential supplies and services during
restricted movement, etc.). and was better prepared with the passage of time.
UNICEF adapted its response (activities and support services) based on the changing needs and situation, in
an effort to be efficient and effective. Shifting to the virtual mode of communication, training, and knowledge
dissemination, producing visual and audio content for awareness generation, education etc., facilitating online
meetings to plan and support the response, and facilitating WASH supplies based on the needs of the states –
are a few adaptations to mention. Moreover, knowledge management and sharing (leveraging the ECM
platform and conducting Rapid Assessment) were also given importance to promote real-time learning and
adaptation of the response.
The evaluation identified certain gaps and inefficiencies associated with the implementation of the crisis
response. These mostly dealt with a lack of coordination, difficulty in accessing remote geographies,
challenges in transitioning to digital modalities across focus areas, and lack of scenario analysis. However,
efforts were made by UNICEF to address them and respond to an evolving situation
The evaluation found that UNICEF’s support largely benefitted the target and vulnerable population, but not
all. UNICEF collected and leveraged sex-segregated data (wherever possible and applicable) and HMIS data to
identify vulnerable populations/pockets in a state as well as to assess different support services; based on
which UNICEF advocated to draw the government’s attention to these people/pockets. By doing so, UNICEF
attempted to achieve the intended outputs and outcomes (which basically was the provision of critical supplies
and continuity of services) equitably. However, UNICEF did not have any gender-responsive strategy and
gender differentiated target was not explicit or observed during implementation for most of the pillars except
for the resumption of the reproductive and maternal child health program. In absence of any outcome data
difficult to comment on the gender outcome or gender transformative aspect of the program.

Evaluation Report
5 RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations below were drafted during the evaluation of each pillar and are therefore pillar
specific77. These were drafted and shared with UNICEF on completion of each pillar-specific evaluation. These
recommendations are for UNICEF ICO, UNICEF R&E and CrMT team’s consideration. These can further be
disseminated to UNICEF section teams, for their reflection and consideration. Since this is a real-time
evaluation, almost all recommendations were for immediate actions (or prioritization) with some having
short and long terms implications as well (for system strengthening). Below, is a compilation of
recommendations, previously shared.
Overarching Recommendations:
• UNICEF's internal reporting mechanism mostly reported on the progress and activities. The reporting
systems did not capture the challenges, gaps, unaccomplished goals/targets, and bottlenecks. Capturing
the challenges and gaps would help UNICEF in making course corrections and risk mitigation. (Priority
High- responsible UNICEF State and country office)
• There is also a greater potential for more internal coordination, streamlining processes and joined-up
approaches internally and with other UN agencies which would avoid delays relating to decision-making
and the provision of services. This will help both sections in advocating for common goals, resource
planning and streamlining the response. (Priority- Medium Term; Responsible -UNICEF Country Office)
• It was suggested that UNICEF should increase its field/on-ground presence (through local-level
partnerships at the state level or linkages with communities and establishing feedback mechanisms) such
that it is more informed of ground-level challenges of delivery, the effectiveness of its support and ways
of working of partner agencies. It is also important to streamline the process and systems to effectively
respond to the pandemic with respect to procurement and partnerships. (Priority Medium term –
Responsible UNICEF Country office)
• It is also important for UNICEF to develop a results framework with targets and timelines for all its
programs, including emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This would help UNICEF to monitor
progress, track achievements and report. UNICEF has no formal mechanisms in place to understand the
actual reach, coverage, impact and outcome of its support. It is suggested that UNICEF deploy a system to
capture the real-time reach of its support to further improve informed planning and advocacy at national
and state levels. Also, it is important to report on the budget spent and measure the cost efficiency and
effectiveness of its support. (Priority High, Responsible UNICEF Country office)
• To improve the relevance and effectiveness of the response, UNICEF should develop a formal feedback
system to receive inputs from clients/stakeholders and partners about UNICEF’s support and services
provided. This would help in understanding what worked and what did not and how UNICEF should
improve its response to become more relevant and effective. (Priority- Medium Term; Responsible – Child
protection and respective sections)
• On partnerships, UNICEF should carefully consider whether partnerships should be paid or pro-bono and
ensure clear agreements and accountabilities in pro-bono partnerships, which are monitored and
tracked. Also, UNICEF should continue to focus on developing more trusted partnerships and a
consortium of partners who could fed UNICEF with evidence from the grassroots level. This may help
UNICEF significantly in planning and delivering the response efficiently and effectively. (Priority-Medium;
77 Since pillar evaluations were undertaken at different time periods of the pandemic, the recommendations reflect the same. There may be some
recommendations which may have been acted upon by UNICEF after the pillar-evaluation was concluded, and not be relevant in the current dynamic
and ever-changing situation.
52

Responsible- State offices and Respective Sections)
• It is important to have a gender and equity strategy to ensure the program delivery is inclusive and gender
sensitive. The gender and equity strategy were missing, and there was no gender differentiated targeting
done during implementation though many literatures and reports suggested that the burden and impact
of Covid was more on women because of various aspect. Also, as the entire UN system is obliged to
conduct evaluations that mainstream gender and human rights therefore it is expected that the program
design and intervention also has explicit gender and equity strategy inbuilt within the program design.
(Priority – High; Responsible -Country Office)
Pillar-Specific Recommendations:
The pillar wise recommendations given below were shared and accepted by UNICEF during the pillar wise
assessment conducted in 2020 and 2021. This is compilation of the recommendations that were shared after
completion of the pillar wise assessment to help UNICEF to improve their program response.
Pillar 1: Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE)
Unless separately mentioned responsible for acting on the recommendations is the C4D
• RCCE needs to move toward achieving actual behavior change, to close the knowledge-behavior gap,
among the community members. There is a need for social behavior change strategy, particularly in
emergencies. Messaging and strategy around COVID-19 appropriate behaviors need to be reviewed and
regularly updated, with the evolving situation – taking into account, particularly the current message
fatigue. (Priority – High)
• Response preparedness needs to be strengthened. To improve planning and implementation it is
recommended a COVID-specific ToC (and perhaps pandemic-specific ToC) is developed for RCCE;
especially as the next phase begins on vaccine communication. (Priority Medium term)
• Given the changing context of COVID-19, regular training of FLWs/partners are important so that updated
information could reach the community. (Priority High)
• Improvements should be made in more strategic planning and better internal coordination between
sections/teams (C4D and CAP). (Priority High)
• UNICEF should develop and use monitoring mechanisms for behavior change/action level data. Mapping
appropriate digital platforms against the targeted population is important to reach out to the masses and
vulnerable populations effectively and equitably. It is important to set up a community feedback
mechanism to get continuous feedback on the activities implemented. This will also aid UNICEF in
understanding the state-specific evolving needs of the community.
• HPM indicators should be tightened a bit more such that they include a unified operational definition,
levels of reporting from the state, coverage/reach of communication package and the subsequent impact
on the ground. (Priority- Medium term ; Responsible- Country office)
• The current design of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response (at the state level) and the nature of the emergency
does not allow to focus on children and women explicitly. The HPM indicators should allow for the
collection of disintegrated data defining the vulnerable groups in the state and providing subsequent
numbers.
Pillar 2: Provision of critical medical and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies and services and
improving Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)
• UNICEF should focus on improving convergence between Health and WASH sections at both national as
53
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
well as state levels to focus on identifying common priority areas. This will help both sections in advocating
for common goals, resource planning and streamlining the response. (Priority- High; Responsible health
and WASH)
• UNICEF WASH’s inputs are currently diluted across different pillars and subsequent section teams (like
communication, health, education, etc.). As a result, it is unable to lead/take independent decisions
(especially related to resource allocation to activities since the response is led by other section teams) for
WASH priority areas. Hence, UNICEF WASH should be given the lead/more autonomy to provide more
relevant support. (Priority- High; Responsible WASH and Country Office)
• UNICEF should work towards tweaking/easing its internal processes (such as onboarding new partners,
and mobilizing resources from a local vendor at the state level). Though UNICEF has a different way of
responding to different levels of emergencies – L1, L2 and L3 and has established mechanisms and roles
in place to loosen up the processes (if needed) depending upon the level of emergency. However, even
then it was not conducive and appropriate to the given need and circumstances. These mechanisms should
be revisited and amended (if need be) to ease the internal processes (and the time it takes) to improve
the efficiency of the response. (Priority- High; Responsible – Senior management in Country Office and
Procurement Division)
• UNICEF should introduce layered auditing and quality assurance compliance protocols for various essential
supplies. For example, it should have extensive auditing and quality assurance for supplies like oxygen
concentrates or PPEs (or pharmaceutical-related supplies) but less exhaustive audit and quality assurance
procedures for supplies like soaps, especially while partnering with big and renowned donor companies
working at the national level. This will help in increasing the turnaround time of providing support and
reducing donor fatigue throughout the process. (Priority High; Responsible Procurement Division)
• UNICEF should increase its field/on-ground presence (through local-level partnerships at the state level or
linkages with communities, and establishing feedback mechanisms, institutionalizing, and scaling up state-
level partnerships) such that it is more aware of the practicality of the implementation of different
activities, way of working of partner agencies and donor priorities. This will help UNICEF to advocate with
the government in an improved and more relevant manner. (Priority- Medium term; Responsible -Country
and state offices)
• There should be more flexibility around HPM indicators in the monitoring mechanism. UNICEF India office
should have more autonomy to amend the HPM indicators based on global guidelines such that it better
captures the priority areas based on the country’s context. For example, if the UNICEF country office wants
to incorporate more parameters to capture hand hygiene (to assess hand hygiene behavior) in its HPM
indicators, then it should have the power to tweak the language and parameters of indicators to make
them more relevant. Moreover, in case a certain indicator is not useful for capturing the Indian context,
then the country office should have the autonomy to remove the same. (Priority Medium term;
Responsible Country Office and HQ)
• Hand hygiene and hand washing behavior are a major focus area of SBM 2.0 and JJM. The pandemic has
pushed hand hygiene and hand-washing behavior into the limelight. UNICEF must hold on to this
opportunity and focus on advocating more with the ministry to allocate funds and promote good hand
hygiene behavior in future. (Priority Medium term; Responsible WASH Division)
• In terms of the ongoing and current situation, UNICEF Health should come forward to play an active role
and converge with the UNICEF communication team to fight the misinformation around the COVID-19
vaccine and promote its benefits. This will help the government to seek voluntary participation (to be
vaccinated) from the people. At the same time, UNICEF WASH should converge with the UNICEF
54

Evaluation Report
communication team to promote the continuous use of CAB. Due to message fatigue, people have become
relaxed and do not use masks or maintain social distancing. UNICEF WASH should contribute towards
developing new strategies to promote IPC behavior. (Priority- High; Responsible – WASH, Health and C4D)
Pillar 3: Provision of adequate health care for women, children and vulnerable communities, including case
management, provision of essential routine health and nutrition services
• Service providers as well as the community members/people were scared to visit the field and facility,
respectively, during the COVID-19 waves. UNICEF should further generate awareness of the importance
of the continuity of essential services and safety measures (following CAB) to ensure that people continue
to visit the facilities and that the service providers do not hesitate in going to the field. Priority- High;
Responsible Health and C4D)
• More focus is being given to COVID-19 vaccinations as compared to Routine Immunization. UNICEF should
advocate more to ensure that the focus on the continuity of routine immunization persists with
government, the service providers and people. (Priority- High- Responsible- Health Division)
• Since COVID-19 is a health emergency, the government’s focus on prioritizing nutrition is comparatively
less (as a result, Anganwadi Centers are still closed). UNICEF Nutrition section should undertake advocacy
to bring the government’s attention to nutrition under the umbrella of essential services. (Priority
Medium; Responsible Nutrition Section)
• Virtual health consults have been widely leveraged during the pandemic. This has resulted in a neglect of
physical check-ups by both the patient (especially in the case of pregnant women) and service providers.
UNICEF should emphasize the importance of promoting physical check-ups during the training and
capacity-building sessions, supported by UNICEF, conducted for FLWs. (Priority – High; Responsible
Health)
• UNICEF should continue to monitor the HMIS data frequently to understand the real-time coverage, gaps
and achievements which could be either reinforced or mitigated. This has helped the CSO partners and
government to understand the ground situation and introduce relevant activities to support the continuity
of essential services. (Priority- High- Responsible- Health)
• UNICEF should continue to strengthen community-based and more permanent mechanisms such as PRIs
and SHGs to ensure continuity of services – through providing technical support in strengthening their
capacities - which may contribute to a more sustainable health - system strengthening with a more
capacitated and informed staff for emergencies with restrictions on the movement of people. (Priority-
High; Responsible-State Offices)
Pillar 5: Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection, and gender-based violence (GBV)
services
Education:
• UNICEF officials at the state level spent a considerable amount of time searching for partners (with the
required expertise) to bring on board. To reduce the time being taken, UNICEF must maintain a state-
specific partners pool which should immediately be tapped into by the program teams depending upon
the nature of the crisis and subsequent requirements. (Priority – Medium- Responsible; State Offices)
• UNICEF is utilizing the available (sex and age disaggregated) data to focus more on and identify ways of
improving access to continued learning. It is recommended that UNICEF utilize this data to undertake age
and gender-appropriate decisions which will contribute towards inclusive policy decisions in the long run.
(Priority- Medium term; Responsible- Education Section)
55
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Child Protection:
• The overall working capacity of UNICEF was reduced due to a greater number of officials being infected
with COVID-19, especially during the second wave. UNICEF should update and maintain its existing rooster
pool which would enable program teams to quickly hire consultants with the required knowledge and skill
sets to support the smooth and efficient implementation of response activities. (Priority – High;
Responsible Country office and each Section)
• UNICEF in Bihar and Maharashtra has supported the government in developing and implementing MIS
which was successfully used to track and monitor children receiving services under CP. UNICEF should
advocate to develop a similar MIS at the national level to track the children and monitor the response in
an improved manner. (Priority – Medium term; Responsible -State and Country office)
UNICEF should strengthen the existing government systems (Panchayats, School Management Committees,
Teachers, Police personnel, etc.) on which it relies to implement CP activities. Additionally, UNICEF should
focus on developing and strengthening its CSO/volunteer network to implement CP-related activities on the
ground. UNICEF should continue to leverage this partnership further to advance the Child Protection agenda.
(Priority- High; Responsible- State Office and Child Protection Section)
Education and Child Protection:
MHPSS has emerged as a strong forte of UNICEF which was recognized by the majority of stakeholders,
especially government officials at the national and state level. Therefore, it is recommended that UNICEF
should focus on strengthening and scaling up the same.
At present, UNICEF has no formal mechanisms in place to understand the actual reach and coverage of its
support. It is suggested that UNICEF deploy a system to capture the real-time reach of its support to further
improve informed planning and advocacy at national and state levels. (Priority- High; Responsible-
Respective Sections and Monitoring and Evaluation Section)
Social Protection:
• UNICEF lacked a nuanced understanding of bottlenecks at the implementation level which impacts the
relevance and effectiveness of its support at the planning level. UNICEF should explore mechanisms to
understand implementation procedures and gaps to undertake more informed advocacy and provide
better technical assistance. (Priority- High; Responsible – Social protection section and State Offices)
• The unavailability of official documents or IDs barred many potential community members from availing
of social protection benefits. UNICEF should continue advocating to develop a mechanism (where benefits
could be linked to a single identity card) with the government through which community members could
receive benefits in the absence of relevant documents. This may also allow community members who
move across borders to seek benefits. (Priority- Medium term: Responsible – State and Country office)
• To improve the coverage, the government should allocate more financial resources toward SP services
and scale up UNICEF’s successful pilot interventions. For this, UNICEF should continue its advocacy to
ensure that the benefits reach the last mile people. (Priority- medium Term- Responsible- State Offices)
• Social protection is a comprehensive theme which requires UNICEF officials to coordinate the response
with multiple stakeholders (ministries and departments), therefore, to improve the efficiency and delivery
of services, UNICEF should increase its human resources at the state level. (Priority- medium term;
Responsible-Country and state offices)

persons are lack of support and co-ordination with DCPU, CWC not formally appointing support
persons, threat from the abuser as must often they are powerful and influential, difficult to
reach hard to reach area as there is no transportation support, district official unaware of who
is a support person and what is their role and thus they do not extend necessary support, non-
co-operation from police. The key findings were shared with JHALSA as well.

emphasized need of generating evidences.
• - Child Protection: Coping with COVID 19 Webinar: UNICEF partnered with Jadavpur
University to organize a webinar on 17 September 2020 to address child protection
vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic to find out ways in which students and youth

Child Marriage in Lockdown 2020- An analysis of cases prevented from Child marriage in
selected districts of West Bengal
CP section of UNICEF West Bengal with the support of partner organizations, prepared an
analytical report on the perceptions and triggers of child marriage among adolescents and their
families, particularly during the lockdown period in the 12 UNICEF supported districts, where
a child marriage has taken place or been prevented between March to June 2020 through
direct interviews. Loss of livelihood, poverty, reduced marriage expenses during lockdown,
safety concerns, gender discrimination acted as major reasons for families to get their
daughters married off in an early age. The analysis also suggested a significant percentage of
the cases were of supposed runaway child marriages, in which the girls attempted to escape
with their partners.
• - Child Marriage Scenario in West Bengal- An Analysis of Data, Drivers and Strategies: Child
marriage remains pervasive in West Bengal. As per NFHS-5, 41.6 per cent of women aged
20-24 were married before the age of 18. An in-depth report on data, drivers and strategies
has been prepared capturing analytical data on child marriage scenario in the state, along
with existing evidences on drivers and learnings from UNICEF’s past interventions. The
analysis shows that child marriage and its drivers are complex and vary within and across
the districts. There’s also indication that whilst a multi-sectoral approach to address child
marriage is needed, greater acknowledgement of adolescent sexuality as well as
development of parental skills is needed to address increasing cases of elopement. The
role of gender norms in shaping adolescent realities and protecting them from child
marriage, violence and other exploitations is of paramount importance and lessons learnt
show that work around social norms is not enough. Experience shows that interventions
directly addressing the pervasive issues of gender discrimination, unequal gender roles and
power dynamics are of significance for meaningful change to happen and to transform
rigidly held gender norms. The analysis synthesizes all available evidences in the context
of WB and presents some of the strategic shifts and way forward for programming to
address the issue of child marriage.

Annexure 8: List of Partnerships leveraged by UNICEF to deliver support/response
In order to provide relevant and effective support to the government in responding to the pandemic, UNICEF
leveraged its existing and new (financial and non-financial) partnerships with government bodies, multilateral
organizations, Not-for profits, NGOs and CSOs, and private sector. During this evaluation, few of these
partnerships were captured. A list and nature (if applicable) of partnership has been outline below.
Name of the Nature of partnership (if applicable and captured during the RTE to the
Stakeholder/Partner extent possible)
Government Union UNICEF partnered with the Union Ministries relevant for each section team, for
Ministries and State example, WASH section worked in close collaboration with Ministry of Jal Shakti
Departments, local (erstwhile Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation), Health section
government bodies and collaborated with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Education section
other government bodies collaborated with Ministry of Education, and so on. Similarly, at the state level,
UNICEF state consultant worked with government departments to align the
priorities of the response plan with that of government priorities and provide
support in an effective manner across various sector specific areas.
• The partnership with local government bodies helped UNICEF deliver the
response/support at the ground level. For example, the local bodies helped
in facilitating the capacity building session for FLWs, SHGs and other
community volunteers (such as NSS).
• - UNICEF’s partnership with the Judiciary was 'very important' and helped
UNICEF to deliver its response in a timely and coordinated manner. The
Supreme Court (SC) was quick to consider UNICEF's advocacy and evidence
to issue judgements and orders which promoted child protection measures
in the country.
Multilateral agencies such UNICEF rolled out its response plan using the existing networks of WHO,
as WHO, UNFPA, UNDP, UNFPA, UNDP field offices and their staffs. It provided an opportunity to work
BMGF etc. closely with state governments in building capacities of health care staff as well
as in developing State Health Investment Plans.
Non-Financial partnerships UNICEF established non-financial partnerships with various NGOs/CSOs to
with NGOs and CSOs (PHIA, address the COVID-19 need and priorities (related to communication and
Aga Khan messaging, supply, and procurement of essentials, etc.). Through these
Foundation, Nav Bharat partnerships UNICEF was able to reach the target vulnerable population given
Jagriti Kendra, KARRA their proximity to the community and local network/relationship with the
Society) people. Moreover, the non-financial partnerships were useful (in terms of
reach) as UNICEF was able to piggyback on their local intervention areas
through the volunteers/staff of NGO/CSO directly working towards providing
COVID relief to the target population. For instance, UNICEF with PHIA oriented
‘saathis’ in Bihar about the communication package and how to deliver
messages on ground to the people.
• In Jharkhand, Action Aid identified volunteers who have good spoken skills
towards sympathizing people and UNICEF trained them to provide Mental
Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) support
• - In UP, UNICEF partnered with NIMHANS to bring on board mental health

etc.)
• In Bihar, Bikramshilla supported UNICEF in redeveloping the textbooks with
more child friendly and easily understood content for children.
• In Bihar, to orient and equip sanitation workers in rural areas, existing
partnership with Aga Khan Foundation was leveraged.
• -At national level, UNICEF partnered with ChildLine to provide psychosocial
support to children and their families. UNICEF provided training to the
ChildLine staff.
• - In West Bengal, UNICEF partnered with West Bengal Doctors Forum
(WBDF) for strengthening public health measures for COVID-19 prevention
and supporting MNCH care in urban slums
Partnerships for evidence UNICEF leveraged its partnerships with organizations such as IDInsight,
generation WaterAid, Population Council, etc. to draw on the evidence generated through
independent assessments undertaken by such organizations/agencies.
• UNICEF West Bengal informed that Oxfam shared pictures of onground
activities (supplies being handed over to target population) and monthly
reports with UNICEF. These reports were assessed by UNICEF state office
to identify gaps and potential intervention areas.
• UNICEF Maharashtra partnered with Sigma Foundation to generate
evidence from rapid assessments which contributed towards timely
response planning.
• - Additionally, UNICEF also leverages photographs of staff/FLWs
distributing supplies, training sessions, functional hand washing stations
etc. shared by partner organizations (like Hindustan Unilever) working in

Appropriate guidelines through these channels to the ground-level staff
who was directly delivering the service.
The above-mentioned list of partnerships is not exhaustive in nature. UNICEF works with multiple partners and
stakeholders at the national and state level. Given the scope of the RTE, some of these partnerships were
captured using primary and secondary sources to understand how UNICEF leverages partnerships to deliver
the response in an efficient manner.

Annexure 9: UNICEF’s Response Pillars
The Response Plan was first designed in March 2020, and then regularly updated to adapt the UNICEF response
strategies and plans to the evolving pandemic progression in India. This updated version of the UNICEF
Response Plan to the COVID-19 pandemic builds on the current work and plans for 2020 and presents an
indicative outlook of the areas of focus, budget and targets that will inform our continued support to
addressing the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 in India, in 2021.
The multi-sectoral response will be built on the following key pillars:
Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)
In 2020, the RCCE response has relied and will continue to rely on the following key components:
1. Development of risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) capacity building materials. In
close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and WHO, a set of risk communication and capacity building
materials and modules will continue to be developed and adapted to increase awareness and knowledge
of front-line functionaries and civil society networks. UNICEF will also facilitate the development of digital
tools, broadcast messaging and information on COVID-19 in support to Government of India through:
1.1 Social mobilization through health frontline functionaries and multiple engagement platforms. Given
their proximity to the community, frontline workers (such as Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, Anganwadi
workers etc.) remain a major source of information. A set of social mobilization interventions will be
developed which is envisioned to be scaled up to community level through partners and by leveraging
of government resources. Other platforms will include the Social Mobilization Network (SMNet
established since Polio Eradication Program), School Management Committees, Panchayati Raj
Institutions (PRIs), tribal collectives, youth associations and a coalition of humanitarian NGOs which
will be crucial to reduce panic and educate communities on the do’s and do nots related to COVID-
19. This intervention will also strengthen infection, prevention and control interventions in schools,
health facilities, markets, and other public spaces. Another important intervention would be to
engage celebrities and influencers such as film/ Bollywood personalities actors, sportspersons, faith
leaders, policymakers, media persons and medical fraternity will also be engaged across the board to
raise awareness on key behaviors.
1.2 Capacity building and orientation of state/district workforce and village task forces including WASH
personnel to ensure response, infection prevention and control in communities. Virtual capacity
building and/or face to face trainings will be organized among a select cadre of health
promotion/education, district officers, local government members, municipal officers, public health
engineering department, and water and sanitation department to increase their knowledge and skills
on risk communication, infection prevention and control in communities and high-risk public spaces
in UNICEF-supported states. These capacity building measures will be linked to the existing Behavior
Change Communication (SBCC) cells for the overall goal of Health Systems Social strengthening in
Risk Communications – a particularly weak area at the district level. This capacity development and
mobilization will not only be limited to health networks but will include other important stakeholders
such as Swachhagrahis/Sanitation workers, National Disaster Management Authority workforce,
youth groups and PRIs etc.
2. Gender-responsive local and folk media: Local and Community Radio with their community listening clubs
play a pivotal role in disseminating information, dispelling myths, influencing public opinion, and
documenting change at the local level. Over 200 radio stations (including local FM radio) will be engaged
to provide regular “credible” messaging and engagement with the community. Folk media such as street
theatre and Pico projector screenings on key practices will be used to target rural communities.
303
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
3. Public Communication, Advocacy and Social Media Plan that does not perpetuate gender stereotypes on
caregiving will be implemented. This will include a) promotion of positive messages including official
information across digital media channels b) engagement with influencers including Members of
Parliament and faith leaders across religions, through informative roundtables and online panel
discussions in the media c) developing innovative content in multiple languages towards raising awareness
and facilitating behavior change d)utilization of social listening tools to gather insights on misinformation
and public enquiries to further inform content production and counter misinformation and social stigma
e) capacity building of media professionals to produce informed content f) engaging adolescents and
young people to raise awareness, where the most positive actions will be amplified across platforms and
developing content to highlight COVID-19 related issues that affect children, including those related to
their health, hygiene, education, protection, nutrition.
4. Monitoring and documentation of the communication interventions will be conducted in partnership with
WHO and partners as per state RCCE plans adapted in line with National RCCE strategy. Open-source
platforms such as Rapidpro (mobile-based communication feedback mechanism) will be used to generate
awareness and organize quick assessments of people's knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19.
Sophisticated social listening, surveys through social media channels and detailed analytics reports will be
produced to track and monitor effectiveness.

le
R 1.1. How do stakeholders at national, state and local level engage with children, women,
.1
adolescents and youth to reinforce positive behaviors and reduce negative behaviors?
What are the key barriers to carry out these activities and how it is been addressed?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF’s RCCE response is in line with the Government needs and priorities. The response
was developed in consultation or based on guidance received from National and State
Government
▪ The first batch of COVID-19 messaging material and capacity development manuals focused
on COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior (CAB) were reviewed and released in January 2020.
Capacity development workshops were undertaken. Most stakeholders informed that the
COVID-19 related messaging and community engagement activities was timely and started in
April 2020 with the onset of the pandemic.
▪ In the initial period communication was more on building awareness and on COVID preventive
behavior and action. It was much later the need for COVID sensitive and messaging on
emerging stigma and discrimination and psychosocial support was realized. Soon after, virtual
discussions were organized with the state level officials and UNICEF resource persons
highlighting the need to promote COVID sensitive messaging, especially with the influx of
migrants to their native states. For example, quotes like “Tilak karo, Tiraskar Nahi!” were
promoted.
▪ For reaching to children, women, adolescents UNICEF supported in developing tailored
communication packages for urban areas, Front Line Workers (FLWs), Self Help Groups (SHGs),
and CSO partners keeping in mind the socio-cultural context.
▪ UNICEF established non-financial partnerships with various CSO/NGO partners and used pro-
bono services of mass media (TV) for wide reach and coverage on preventive messaging and
appropriate behavior and contributed towards government efforts to reduce adverse social
impact of the pandemic. However, due to non-financial and pro-bono services, limited priority
was given to undertake activities or telecast messages in peak hours with intensity.
1.2. What considerations are kept in mind while designing the RCCE activities? How those are
aligned with the government's priorities and plans?
Key Findings:
▪ The Joint Response Plan is guided by the priorities and requests of Government of India and
takes into consideration several strategic and guidance documents and information issued by
Government of India. The JRP endeavors to support Government of India’s efforts to
strengthen key areas like surveillance (through the Integrated Health Information Platform)
and contact tracing, hospital preparedness for management of COVID-19 including infection
prevention and control. Further, it also aims at supporting the government efforts to minimize
social impact through risk communication and community engagement, and facilitate
operational and clinical research.
▪ The plan is being rolled out using the existing networks of WHO, UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF
319
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
field offices and their staffs. It provided an opportunity to work closely with state governments
in building capacities of health care staff as well as in developing State Health Investment
Plans.
▪ The UNICEF response plan is designed to primarily address two major issues: minimizing the
spread and impact of the outbreak on the population with a focus on women and children,
and ensuring that essential services for women and children are adapted to the context and
accessible during and after the pandemic.
▪ UNICEF worked very closely with the MoHFW and WHO primarily focusing efforts towards
supporting coordinated actions for the preparedness, containment and mitigation of the
outbreak. In doing so it has provided technical assistance in developing the material and
communication strategy to ensure that the activities adhere to the government guidelines and
respond to its containment strategy.
▪ The RCCE activities were driven by evidence-based approach towards creating a new
framework of communication (engagement, monitoring and evaluation) keeping in mind the
lockdown and urban-centric nature of the pandemic.
▪ Therefore, the RCCE activities are well aligned with Government needs, state priorities and
developed in consultation with the National/ State Governments and other key partners
(WHO, BMGF, PHFI, etc.). In terms of implementation of activities and dissemination of
material, UNICEF reviews and finalizes the communication material which is then shared with
the state governments who consequently participate in contextualizing this material based on
their needs. In most states the IEC officers, technical group of health consultants and
community mobilization officers primarily lead this process.
1.3. To what extent is UNICEF India’s response adhering to global guidance on Level-3
emergencies? How are these adjustments made to the global guidance on Level-3
emergencies to suit the Indian context?
UNICEF COVID-19 response plan is aligned with the global guidance on Level-3 emergencies.
However, it was formulated before UNICEF declared COVID-19 as an L3 emergency.
KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ACTIVITIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY
UNICEF TAILORED TO THE LOCAL CONTEXT IN DIFFERENT STATES?
2.1. Which activities under RCCE are contextualized based on social economic and cultural
context of the states to target women and children and vulnerable population?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF state officials informed rapid assessments were undertaken at the state level to
understand the state specific needs. Whereas the first round focused on understanding the
economic and social aspects, the second round put more emphasis on understanding the need
and current status of behavioral change in the state. The second round revealed that the risk
perception among people is as low as 0.1%.
▪ A diverse set of communication and engagement strategies were rolled out for creating
awareness and behavior change at community level. These were tailored to specific state
requirements and context (i.e. language and socio-cultural context). UNICEF officials informed
that the IEC material and messaging content was translated into state, block and community
specific languages. For instance, in case of Jharkhand, the material was translated into 5 tribal
320
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
languages.
▪ However, many stakeholders interviewed at district/block level informed that
translation/contextualization was not done at the district/block level and for specific
community/tribe or group due to paucity of time.
▪ In UP however, the district/block officials informed that the messages were translated in a way
which involved local dialect. This was purposely done to increase the understanding and
adaptation in the rural pockets. For example, the word DIDI was involved in these messages
because the SHG members are called DIDI by the localities.
▪ In West Bengal, the local tribe leaders took initiative to translate the messages in their dialect
to ensure that the messages are understood by all.
▪ Many SHG members in Bihar were not literate. Hence, the state and local government ensured
that the messages were audio recorded in the local language/dialect in order to the SHGs to
understand and disseminate the same.
2.2. How are the RCCE activities are adapted to the capacities and enabling environment of
service providers and implementing partners? What kind of adjustments are made by
UNICEF during its implementation? How frequently service provided are being oriented
on COVID-19 and provided with handholding support?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF provided technical support in planning, capacity building of - FLWs, SHGs,
Swacchagrahis, NGOs, municipal corporations, and local groups etc. - on content and materials
development of COVID-19 related communication and messaging. UNICEF also directly
supported implementation of activities in select urban slums and rural areas through CSO
partners and select NGOs (with direct reach with target population).
▪ Capacity building of partners was undertaken only once using online mode. Shortcomings with
respect to connectivity and duration of training were reported.
KEQ-3: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN AS PART OF UNICEF’S COVID-19
CRISIS RESPONSE MEETING THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES?
3.1. Do the support and activities adequately address inclusion of disadvantaged, marginalized
and vulnerable community (SC/ST/minority)? In what ways UNICEF activities meet the
needs of children and families during the COVID-19 crisis?
Key Findings:
▪ In design and reporting, children, women, and disadvantaged populations were not explicitly
covered. However, during implementation, attempt has been made to reach out to such
populations through various platforms and partnerships (egs. SHGs, NSS, Wada Sakhis,).
▪ UNICEF encouraged the state officials and FLWs to assess the marginal/vulnerable population
by identifying the groups who did not respond to UNICEF’s COVID response material. This
evidence based gap analysis was further used by UNICEF for tweaking and tailoring the
material/messages

Key Findings:
UNICEF's COVID-19 response plan and activities were not developed using any explicit Theory of
Change (ToC). It mainly relied on the experience of managing H1N1and SBCC strategy.

1.1. What mode of communication is being utilized to implement RCCE activities? How it is being
ensured that the messages are percolated down to the targeted vulnerable population?
What is the plan to mitigate propagation of myths and misconceptions on COVID related
message?
Key Findings:
▪ A combination of communication platforms such as Media (TV, community radio, print media),
Digital (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok), IPC (Door to door, Rath Yatra, community
engagement through celebrities, faith leaders, NSS, FLWs, SHGs, MCDs, etc.) were used for
community reach out on Covid preventive messaging. Recently, local group meetings (Gram
sabha meetings, Mahila Mandal, Yuva Kendra meetings, etc.) are being utilized to strategize and
disseminate COVID-19 related messaging and material.
▪ For wide coverage and reach UNICEF used both financial and non-financial partnerships. UNICEF
used partnerships to support and implement activities in the priority districts/urban slums and
utilized different existing platforms and networks (SHGs, FLWs, Municipal Staff, Wada Sakhis,
Jeevikas, NSS, VRPs, etc.) for messaging. UNICEF also established non-financial partnerships with
various NGOs/CSOs (PHIA, Aga Khan Foundation, Nav Bharat Jagriti Kendra, KARRA Society) to
address the COVID-19 communication need and priorities. Through these partnerships UNICEF’s
was able to reach the target vulnerable population given their proximity to the community and
local network/relationship with the people. Moreover, the non-financial partnerships were
useful (in terms of reach) as UNICEF was able to piggyback on their local intervention areas
through the volunteers/staff of NGO/CSO directly working towards providing COVID relief to the
target population. For instance,
✓ UNICEF with PHIA oriented ‘saathis’ in Bihar about the communication package and how
to deliver messages on ground to the people.
✓ Select NGOs in Maharashtra working towards village transform mission have come
together with UNICEF to provide masks and create awareness among people through their
local network of volunteers and other community members.
1.2. How UNICEF’s COVID-19 response (material, information) reaches the vulnerable population
such as (i) children with disabilities, (ii) scheduled castes and tribes,(iii) children on the move,
(iv) street children, (v) children without parental care (in institutions or foster care) and/or
those separated from their families, (vi) orphaned, (vii) quarantined children, (viii) victims of
GBV, and (ix) out-of-school children?
322
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Key Findings:
According to the state officials, UNICEF’s COVID-19 response largely reached every section and
community in the state and was accessible to all. However, children were not explicitly discussed
while focusing on ‘vulnerable populations’. One of the state level respondents informed that
from the beginning there was a lot of information about the elderly being at the risk, and
therefore attention on children especially disabled, out of school, orphaned, etc. were not much
in the beginning and came in much later.
• The district officials (of all states) informed that UNICEF supported messaging and
communication activities from the start of the pandemic April 2020. Initially, messaging and
communication was focused more on the urban areas and quarantine centers. However, later
villages and rural areas were also included in the communication planning and roll out.
• Sudden and strict lockdown in the initial months was a key barrier for reaching out to
communities. During the initial lockdown phase, the major mode of communication or
messaging was through digital and mass media, which has its own limitations in reaching all
sections of the society especially the poor and marginalized. Initially the cases and impact of
COVID-19 was more in urban-areas and hence it took some time to develop appropriate
strategies and partnerships, especially for rural areas.
• Moreover, in the initial period the less educated/illiterate population who often fall under the
vulnerable category were difficult to reach and covered. However, later with the help of visual
and audio clips/messages, they were also covered.
• UNICEF’s COVID-19 response activities heavily rely on the frontline functionaries and other
engagement platforms to undertake social mobilization. Given the solid network and
proximity to the community, ASHA workers, SHGs, AWWs and ANMS remain a major source
of communication and mobilization. Moreover, Wada Sakhis in UP, Jeevikas in Bihar, SBCC
and VRPs in West Bengal, ASHA workers and NSS in Jharkahnd are particularly active in
reaching the target vulnerable population.
• The CSO and implementing partners working with children and women, informed that they
made efforts to ensure that children receive proper care, masks, food (in form of dry ration),
and become aware of COVID appropriate behavior. In doing so, they oriented the parents and
caregivers of these children.
• In Jharkhand, Gram Sabha and Mahila Mandal meetings were used as platform to interact
with local communities and spread awareness. ASHA workers were engaged with adolescents
through the Yuva Maitri Kendra program and oriented them on COVID appropriate behavior.
Additionally, paid and unpaid volunteers were deployed by the block level officials to digitally
disseminate UNICEF provided IEC material/messages. The CSO &implementing partners
mentioned about organizing online Children’s Parliament session to create awareness on
COVID appropriate behavior.
• In UP, NSS actively participated in communications and messaging. Wada Sakhis, through
Hello Didi program, contributed immensely in creating awareness at household and
community level. It was informed that print material is not as effective as digital since people
do not spend time to read.

Key Findings:
▪ Activities related to Risk Communication and Community Engagement were implemented
extensively across all states. Some of these include, but are not limited to:
✓ Trainings to FLWs, SHGs and other personnel involved in COVID-19 response at the
ground level
✓ Messaging and information dissemination through various digital print means as well as
through deploying local level taskforce (SHGs, FLWs, etc.).
✓ Several awareness activities including messaging, micing/loudspeaker announcements,
in-person awareness, household visits, etc.
✓ Routine immunization, polio programs, and other healthcare programs of the state were
postponed in order to ensure that all of state’s manpower could be fully utilized for
COVID-19 relief activities.
✓ Providing masks and soaps in quarantine centers as well as installing hand washing units
in select areas.
▪ The nature and spread of the pandemic created pressure for quick turnaround time to fulfil
the demand and expectations from the government However, many of the discussants
expressed that existing resources (human and financial) were not adequate to meet the
priorities and objectives of RCCE.
✓ The national level representative of UNICEF informed that the budget allocation received
by the communication departments (C4D and CAP) for undertaking RCCE activities is
limited, restricting them to undertake financial/paid partnerships for wider reach. As a
result they largely have to rely on pro-bono partnerships.
✓ Furthermore, the UNICEF representative informed that the current team strength
(internal) is low and the current staff is overworked. The lack of financial resources does
not allow the C4D and CAP teams to hire additional human resource.
▪ Funding mechanism for communication was highlighted as an issue. Funding related to
communication activities are attached to each sector and not as separate pot. Hence, there is
no separate budget for utilization for communication activities.
1.2. What mechanisms are in place for RCCE to ensure distribution of resources to the vulnerable
and hard-to-reach population?
Key Findings:
▪ The design does not include any mechanism for RCCE to ensure distribution of resources for
communication outreach.
▪ However, at the state level attempts were made to cover and include hard to reach as well
as vulnerable population during the roll out. Further, it was reported that there is
requirement of additional resources to conduct proper micking/loudspeaker announcements
at the village level, awareness campaigns, gram sabha meetings, Mahila Mandal meetings,
324
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
printing handbills for villages, etc. specially to reach out to the vulnerable and population
living in remote areas.
KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT IS UNICEF MANAGING AND DELIVERING ITS COVID-19 RESPONSE IN A
TIMELY COORDINATED, COHERENT AND QUALITY WAY?
2.1. Are the activities rolled out in a planned manner adhering to the timelines? What
adjustments, if any, are made in the acitivities to address the evolving needs and context
of the target population?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF's overall COVID-19 response was executed in a timely manner and evolved with the
changing scenario.
▪ For instance, in the beginning the focus was primarily on CAB (hand hygiene and mask usage).
However, with the evolving crisis a need for promoting sensitive messaging (related to stigma
and discrimination, providing psychosocial support) was identified and included in the
response plan.
▪ UNICEF has worked closely with the Government of India and its various departments such as
the State Health Department, Ministry of Rural Development (Panchayati Raj Institution),
Department of Education and provided technical support for development of COVID-19
related communication messaging.
▪ Most of the stakeholders reported that there was no delay in implementation of RCCE
activities. It typically takes a week for the COVID-19 related messaging and activities to
percolate down to the targeted population. Also, the implementation of the activities
happened in a phased manner and in many cases was dependent on the situation and focus of
the state. For example, in Bihar, communication activities started a bit late since initially, the
state’s focus was not much on the communication.
▪ Digital means were used extensively for preventive messaging. Digital means to spread
messages made the whole process quick and easy but it had its own limitation.
2.2. What is the mechanism internally and externally in place to track the progress of outcome
indicators?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF’s internal monitoring mechanism track progress on RCCE under three HPM indicators:
✓ Number of people reached on COVID-19 through messaging on prevention and
access to services,
✓ Number of people who participate in COVID-19 engagement actions
✓ Number of people sharing their concerns and asking questions/clarifications for
available support services to address their needs through established feedback
mechanisms
▪ However, it was opined by the UNICEF officials that even through HPM indicators help in
understanding the broader reach of the RCCE activities, they are not useful to understand
whether the coverage/output is translating into behavioral change/outcomes.
2.3. How does UNICEF generate data on the knowledge, attitudes and perspectives of the
325
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
following categories (i) both women and men?
(ii) among vulnerable populations (children with disabilities, scheduled castes and tribes,
children on the move, street children, children without parental care)? (iii) What are
constraints and opportunities of improvement pertaining to these groups?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF used internal and external (Other organizations like Population Council, Water Aid, ID
insight, WHO, etc.) data/reports to develop learning and good practices to strengthen and
improve the overall efficiency of COVID-19 response and activities.
▪ There is absence of monitoring system to track the progress of outcome (behavior change)
indicators at an overall and at diaggregated level (gender, vulnerable population, etc.) which
makes it difficult to evaluate the extent of effectiveness of the communication strategy. There
is no uniform monitoring mechanism across states to track actual coverage and reach of
COVID-related messaging/activities. The reported numbers are not actual headcount. Rather,
they are the estimated number based on different activities carried out across the states
including viewership/likes/comments on posts on different digital media platforms. Further,
exhaustive disaggregated data is not available for all activities.
2.4. How well the synergies and interlinkages between government and implementation
partners' activities have been established to optimize the COVID-19 response? What are
the overlaps that reduce the efficiency of the RCCE pillar?
Key Findings:
▪ According to the UNICEF national level official, even though large number of partners (WHO,
UNDP, BMGF, ILO, CARE PHFI etc.) are working and supporting implementation of RCCE
activities, there is a clear demarcation of the activities which are supported/implemented by
each partner. As lead, UNICEF effectively coordinates with its partners every week on the
prevention of stigma and discrimination communication, COVID-19 response and measures to
strengthen local-level partnerships.
▪ The national level UNICEF officials reported an overlap between activities (media related) and
inadequate coordination (between C4D and CAP teams) which effects to a certain extent the
optimal utilization of resources.
2.5. What is the mechanism (Frequency, monitoring platform etc.) to ensure the quality of
activities undertaken by the stakeholders? How the identified bottlenecks and corrective
measures are accounted and addressed to enhance the quality of preparedness and
response for COVID-19?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF’s staff provide regular updates on activities and progress through monthly and
fortnightly situational reports, which are useful.
▪ However, there is no formal/official feedback mechanism in place to ensure that relevant
feedback from the community and FLWs are taken into consideration for decision making and
designing activities.
▪ UNICEF has also conducted several assessments (U-reports, assessment related to stigma and
discrimination, State specific rapid assessments, community based monitoring, etc.) to
326
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
generate evidence and learning related to Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception. These findings
have often been utilized to modify or tailor content and messaging.
▪ For instance, UNICEF national level official informed that in the beginning UNICEF worked
around hypothesis drawn from external assessments (independent assessments undertaken
by external agencies like IDInsight, local NGOs focusing on the impact of various activities
undertaken by the government and its partners like UNICEF) – 1) Are
COVID workforce stigmatized? 2) How do people feel living near to and using same essential
services as someone who is a member of COVID workforce or has recently travelled?
The findings of rapid ‘baseline assessment’/first round informed that it was not the workforce
which was stigmatized but rather those who have recovered from COVID. Therefore, the focus
of interventions ad messaging then shifted from CAB to fighting stigma and discrimination as
well.
KEQ-3: TO WHAT EXTENT IS UNICEF ADAPTING ITS ACTIVITIES TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT
BASED ON LEARNING AND A CHANGING COVID-19 CONTEXT?
3.1. What is the knowledge management and sharing mechanism within UNICEF? What are the
innovations adopted to address the evolving crisis? How well the support and activities are
flexible in adjusting to the local needs?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF uses the ECM platform to share content developed for COVID-19 activities. All case
studies and reports are available on the ECM website and available for UNICEF staff.
▪ The Crisis Management unit was established to address the challenges and develop actionable
solutions.
▪ During the lockdown phase, all training for FLWs and SHGs were done virtually. UNICEF created
WhatsApp groups for sharing messages and feedback. These feedbacks are taken into
consideration while developing the next batch of communication/IEC material.
▪ Thus, Based on the evolving needs, communication and messaging content, mode and
technique, has modified over the period of time. This has enabled UNICEF to introduce context-
appropriate messages in public domain. However, an increased focus on behavioral change is
required in order to ensure the effectiveness of CAB and that people follows protocols.
KEQ-4: ARE THERE ANY INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRISIS
RESPONSE (E.G. LOW AWARENESS AND UPTAKE, UNAVAILABILITY OF FRONTLINE WORKERS AND
OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, MISUNDERSTANDING OR MISUSE OF UNICEF’S MESSAGES ETC.)?
4.1. What are the reasons for lower update of RCCE activities/service? In certain geographies and
population?
Key Findings:
▪ There is an absence of real time MIS system to track progress of activities implemented under
RCCE across all states. This restricts UNICEF to evaluate the efficiency of overall response
(especially qualitative outputs) and progress of outcome indicators.
▪ Disaggregated data on reach and coverage on vulnerable populations such as women, children,
migrants (number of migrants coming into a state, number of migrants in quarantine center,
327
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
number of COVID-positive patients, and recovered patients) is not available.
▪ There was comparatively less control pertaining to intensity, frequency, and accountability of
various activities implemented using the non-financial partnerships (given the pro-bono nature
of engagement).
These pro-bono partnerships do not allow UNICEF to ensure that the external agencies are
prioritizing UNICEF messaging in a quality and timey manner. Given the pro-bono nature,
the external agencies often prioritize their own motives/tasks, and not aligning with
UNICEF's priorities.
It was difficult to reach out certain geographies like naxal affected/hard-to-reach areas due to
poor coverage of digital medium particularly during the lockdown.
Initially, it was difficult for FLWs, SHGs members to operate through digital learning platforms
and in understanding of the modules. However, now they are accustomed and comfortable
to a certain extent on use of the digital mode of learning. Moreover, due to the lack of
personnel and funds to hire new personnel/volunteers, existing FLWs and other stakeholders
are overworked. UNICEF state officials (Jharkhand, Bihar) were of the opinion that lack of
scenario analysis and preparedness, in the beginning, hampered the overall planning and
implementation of activities efficiently.

Key Findings:
▪ COVID-19, initially, was urban centric and there was a lack of resources and existing
partnerships in urban areas to support and implement communication activities. This resulted
in delay in implementation of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response.
▪ Major reliance was on digital and mass media for undertaking communication activities and
messaging which has its own limitations and grey areas to reach out to all sections of society.
Furthermore, network connectivity has also posed a hurdle in reaching the target population.
▪ The restricted movement, due to lockdown, also delayed the process of reaching out to the
remote areas and vulnerable section of the population.
▪ UP state official informed of delay in budget allocation as a barrier in the efficient
implementation of the RCCE activities. This restricts them in adhering to the set
timelines/deadlines to meet the target. The state officials further informed that many time they
had to “go out of the way” to arrange budget, ensuring the continuity in implementation
process.
▪ Capacity building was undertaking only once using virtual means. Several shortcomings such as
connectivity issues, lack of participation, and duration of training sessions were reported. Given
the changing context of COVID, regular trainings with updated focus areas of UNICEF’s overall
response strategy is necessary. There was absence of comprehensive monitoring mechanism to
track the progress of various activities and generate real time learning to modify/alter the
activities.
▪ The non-availability of adequate resources (internal) to implement communication activities
328

have compromised the anticipated efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response.
▪ Overlap of activities (media engagement) and lack of coordination between C4D and CAP team
has resulted in duplication of tasks and non-optimal resource use.
KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE INTENDED OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF UNICEF’S RESPONSE
ACHIEVED IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER BENEFITING VULNERABLE POPULATION?
2.1. How the bottlenecks are identified and addressed to achieve the outcomes equitably for the
vulnerable population?
Key Findings:
UNICEF’s Internal M&E reporting data indicates that out of three output indicators, the target of
one indicator (Number of people engaged in COVID-19 through RCCE actions) has already been
achieved while the remaining two are on track. These numbers are just estimations and does not
represent actual reach. Double counting could be one of the limitation.
Since disaggregated data is not available, it is not possible to comment on whether communication
messaging has reached ‘equitably’ to the target vulnerable population. However, as informed
earlier, attempts were made during the implementation of activities to reach out to the vulnerable
populations using different platforms (FLWs, SHGs, Micing/Loudspeakers, Rath Yatra, community
radio, etc.).
UNICEF’s internal and other external evidence (Population Council, Water Aid) suggests that RCCE
activities have not been fully translated into the desired action.
The studies suggested that
I. Risk perception among young men and women was quite low.
II. 57% of the respondents were comfortable using the same essential services (grocery store,
public spaces, and public transport) as they used to in the pre-COVID scenario.
III. Only 2% of respondents reported social distancing as a means of reducing risk from COVID-19
while accessing the same services.
IV. Health workers - ASHA, AWW, and ANM are the primary source of information for 41% of
respondents. Significantly higher proportions of women depend on them as compared to
males.
V. A significantly higher proportion of female respondents depended on family members for
receiving any information related to COVID-19 whereas a significantly higher proportion of
male respondents depended on social media and newspapers for the same.
329

Evaluation Report
VI. TV is the most trusted medium for attaining COVID-related information among respondents,
followed by the newspaper, radio, and WhatsApp. In urban slums, 94% of respondents relied
on the radio. 76% of respondents reported that they are frequently washing hands at home.
The main reason behind this was ‘fear of Coronavirus’ (77%) followed by ‘precautionary
measure to protect oneself against the virus’ (69%). Further, it was interesting to note that
67% of the total respondents wanted more information on hand hygiene (especially hand
washing).
KEQ-3: HOW WELL IS UNICEF’S RESPONSE COORDINATED?
3.1. How UNICEF coordinates across sectors (multi-sectoral convergence) and its field offices and
implementing partners for smooth collaboration and cross learnings
Key Findings:
▪ Almost all respondents informed that UNICEF’s overall COVID-19 response is effective and well-
coordinated. Many respondents mentioned that there is some duplicity in the tasks/activities
performed by UNICEF, its own partners and other partners working in the state. However, that
is unavoidable in an emergency situation. State officials in UP informed that UNICEF, WHO, PHFI,
MOU, and NSS are working in a coordinated manner. UNICEF’s intervention is primarily in
providing technical assistance on awareness and communication related activities.
▪ In Maharashtra, UNICEF is working with Tech Mahindra and Jeevan Rath to develop video
messages with celebrities, provide medical support and hygiene kits at the district level. UNICEF
is actively working with MCDs and local level governments to promote CAB while following the
national guidelines.
▪ At local level UNICEF is working with health workers, faith leaders, FLWs, SHGs, Sahiya Sathi
(Jharkhand), Wada Sakhis (UP), Nirmal Banga Cell (WB), and VRPs (WB) to promote COVID
Appropriate Behavior.
▪ The majority of CSOs/implementing partners informed that working with UNICEF has provided
their work ‘a great boon’ as UNICEF’s work is well recognized and it helps them explain their
messages with various stakeholders, easily.
KEQ-4: WHAT ARE THE KEY CHALLENGES FACED?
Key Findings:
330
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
External Challenges:
▪ It is becoming increasingly difficult for the authorities and FLWs to ensure people comply with
COVID-19 Appropriate Behavior (CAB). There is an extensive message fatigue and confusion
among communities. Hence, appropriate messaging/communication content and strategy needs
to be introduced and regularly updated or revised with the evolving situation
▪ According to some district officials, the timelines set and communicated by the state (after
discussions with UNICEF) for implementation of various activities and submission of reports are
‘unreal’.
▪ Since the training of local level personnel involved in COVID-19 response has only been
undertaken once; it was reported that they often fail to provide the most updated information
to the target population. Additionally, they are unable to answer the questions of people. This
often results in the dissemination of misinformation as well.
▪ In some states, it is difficult for the ground level personnel to reach the remote areas (especially
remote and Naxalite areas).
▪ Illiteracy often poses as a hurdle in reaching people as they are unable to
understand/comprehend the written messages. Hence, audio-visual messages and in person
counselling/orientation work best.
Internal Challenges:
▪ Limited human and financial resources at state level poses a barrier in efficiently managing and
implementing the RCCE activities.
Additionally, a general limitation around the availability of evidence (external and internal) to
systematically assess the behavioral change also limits the evaluation of UNICEF's RTE response.

priorities wherein technical assistance was provided to tailor the messaging and communication
material to the local context. The response which initially focused on promoting COVID Appropriate
Behavior (CAB) later included stigma and discrimination along with psychosocial support under its
spectrum of focus to provide relevant information and material to the vulnerable population in a
timely manner. In doing so, UNICEF leveraged both existing and new financial as well as non-
financial partnerships.
The response however lacked Theory of Change and brought forth internal as well as external gaps
in terms of coordination, resources, and IEC content. It also falls short of assessing qualitative
indicators (such as BCC) while determining the impact of the plan. Hence, it is imperative that a
social behavior change strategy be developed and ‘real time’ evidence should be shared with an
increased coordinated and informed approach, as well as new messages ways of communicating
the message be introduced to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of response plan. Increase in
number of trainings/orientations/meetings (internally as well as externally) can contribute towards
ensuring that the latest and most relevant information is communicated in a more timely manner.
This may also optimize the resource utilization.
Despite the limitations, UNICEF with its unique yet strong position to support the government, is
able to execute the response plan in a timely and coherent manner ensuring social mobilization of
vulnerable target population during the crisis.

material.
▪ Messaging and strategy around COVID-19 appropriate behaviors needs to be reviewed and
regularly updated, with the evolving situation – taking into account particularly the current
message fatigue.
▪ Response preparedness needs to be strengthened. To improve planning and implementation
it is recommended a COVID-specific ToC is developed for RCCE; especially as the next phase
begins on vaccine communication.
▪ Knowledge management and communication need to be strengthened to generate learnings
in terms of, what worked well, what did not, and why?
▪ Given the changing context of COVID, regular training of FLWs/partners are important so that
updated information could reach out to the community.
▪ At the same time, UNICEF should facilitate the unburdening of the system used to disseminate
messages – that is a key risk moving forward.
▪ Improvements can be made in more strategic planning and better internal coordination
between sections/teams (C4D and CAP).
▪ UNICEF can develop and use monitoring mechanisms for behavior change/action level data.
▪ Mapping of appropriate digital platforms against the targeted population is important to reach
out the masses and vulnerable population effectively and equitably.
▪ Continuation of research is important to generate the evidence to support evidence based
planning and implementation of COVID-19 response.
▪ It is important to set up a community feedback mechanism to get continuous feedback on the
activities implemented. This will also aid UNICEF in understanding the state specific evolving
needs of the community.
▪ Increase in human and financial resource at ground level across all states to be able to improve
overall efficiency and effectiveness of the response; allocate a specific budget for
communication activities held by CAP themselves.
▪ UNICEF should carefully consider whether partnerships should be paid or pro-bono. Ensure
clear agreements and accountabilities in pro-bono partnerships, which are monitored and
tracked.
▪ According to UNICEF state officials, HPM indicators should be tightened a bit more such that
they include a unified operational definition, levels of reporting from state, coverage/reach of
communication package and subsequent impact on ground.
▪ The current design of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response (at state level) and the nature of the
emergency does not allow to focus on children and women explicitly. The HPM indicators
should allow for collection of disintegrated data defining the vulnerable groups in the state and
providing subsequent numbers.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Executive Summary:
UNICEF India as part of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Joint Response Plan (JRP) provides support to
Government of India in its efforts to contain the spread, mitigate risks and strengthen management for COVID-
19. In doing so, it adopted a multi-sectoral approach to address the issue, which focused on six pillars, including
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC).
We have undertaken real-time evaluation of IPC pillar to understand the relevance, coverage, effectiveness
and efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response w.r.t. infection, prevention and control (IPC). A qualitative
research method was deployed to assess the current response plan by capturing the support provided at
national, state and sub-district levels, perception of different stakeholders (across 5 states), identify gaps in
the support provided, and recommend ways to strengthen its response. In doing so, both primary and
secondary sources of data were used to collect and analyze data over a period of ~6 weeks. For primary data
collection KIIs and FGDs were undertaken with respondents across 5 states. Review of documents included
UNICEF India response plan, COVID JRP India, Monthly situational reports, Fortnightly Field Updates-State wise
status, Summary of CrMT Meetings, Rapid assessment and other evaluation reports.
The top level findings of this evaluation suggest that UNICEF’s response was largely ‘relevant’ in providing
health and WASH related support to the government in all 5 states especially in the fast changing scenario of
the pandemic. UNICEF’s response was aligned with government priorities throughout the course of its support.
UNICEF with its efforts was able to reach vulnerable sections as well as hard-to-reach pockets with essential
services and critical supplies like PPE kits, oxygen concentrates, soaps, and sanitizers. UNICEF’s adaptive
capacity (e.g. continue adapting guidelines and reorienting people, adoption of virtual mean of service
delivery, development of online system to track migrants) played a strong role in providing relevant response
to the government The evaluation highlighted that UNICEF’s response was ‘highly effective’ in streamlining
the support by developing interlinkages between the government and service providers. It mobilized partner’s
resources to meet the priorities of government and needs of target population which included ensuring
hospital preparedness, undertaking assessments, providing support in capacity building of healthcare workers
and community workers; and procuring and providing critical health and WASH supplies.
However, some of the shortcomings/bottlenecks identified during the course of this evaluation include:
• At the onset of pandemic WASH was not recognized as priority area by the Ministry of Jal Shakti precisely
because this was a health-led emergency. As a result, initially, UNICEF WASH faced difficulty in advocating
and mobilizing WASH resources.
• Convergence between Health and WASH department lacked in mutually identifying priority areas varied
i.e. important and critical areas recognized by WASH team were not given equal importance by health
team. This also posed as barrier in optimum utilization of resources.
• UNICEF response lacked a well-structured and systematic real-time monitoring mechanism to monitor its
COVID-19 response.
• Services and supplies could have been delivered faster. UNICEF’s internal processes of seeking/giving
approvals was highlighted as a barrier to its responsiveness.
• UNICEF faced problems in initial months in facilitating support due to shortage of
manufacturers/producers to procure quality supplies from. Restrictive movement during lockdown and
UNICEF’s time taking internal processes contributed to the problem.
The evaluation suggests that a significant amount of funds were raised to support supply related to health
however UNICEF Health’s role was limited to procuring and providing the same to the government at the
336
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
national level. Even though UNICEF’s response provided effective support to the government in strengthening
the response, substantial gains can be achieved by introducing certain corrective measures which have
potential to further strengthen UNICEF’s response w.r.t. IPC. Some of these include:
• UNICEF WASH’s inputs are currently diluted across different pillars and subsequent section teams (like
communication, health, education, etc.). As a result it is unable to lead/take independent decisions
(especially related to resource allocation to activities since the response is led by other section teams) for
WASH priority areas. Hence, UNICEF WASH should be given lead/more autonomy to provide more relevant
support.
• UNICEF should work towards tweaking/easing its internal processes (such as on-boarding new partner,
mobilizing resources from local vendor at state level). UNICEF has different way of responding to different
levels of emergencies – L1, L2 and L3. It has established mechanism and roles in place to loosen up the
processes depending upon the level of emergency. These mechanisms should be revisited and amended
(if need be) to ease the internal processes (and time it takes) to improve the efficiency of the response.
• UNICEF can introduce a layered auditing and quality assurance compliance protocols for various essential
supplies. This will help in increasing the turnaround time of providing support and reducing donor fatigue
throughout the process.
Limitation(s):
• UNICEF spent significant amount of resources on supply and procurement (S&P) of health supplies such
as PPE kits, oxygen concentrates, and oximeters. The procurement and supply were more centralized at
the national level hence State UNICEF health officials did not have much reflection of S&P.
• Many stakeholders within UNICEF and outside UNICEF from Health at the national level were not available
for IDIs due to their commitment in vaccination drive. However, we could manage FGDs with the UNICEF
national health and S&P teams to understand the IPC response. Hence, limited prospective were captured.

1.1. What are the government priorities for IPC pillar? How are UNICEF activities aligned with
R
the government's priorities and plans? How is UNICEF India’s response adhering to
government guidelines on IPC?
.1
Key Findings:
▪ Government priorities for IPC pertained to inclusive coverage, promoting COVID Appropriate
Behavior, capacity building (for both healthcare staff as well as community workers), conducting
assessments (at healthcare facility level about HCF preparedness, provision and availability of
medical equipment like PPE and oxygen concentrates), management of bio-medical waste, and
WASH services and supplies (such as installation of foot-operated hand washing stations at
community as well as facility level). A Government state level official informed that government
guidelines for COVID are majorly drawn from NHM and WHO and that the major focus has been
on controlling the spread and ensuring that COVID appropriate measures were taken to ensure
the same. Therefore, the provision of masks, PPEs, thermal scanners, testing kits, oxygen
concentrates, sanitizers/soaps and awareness about social distancing, trained healthcare
facility as well as community staff, etc. were some of the critical aspects relating to
government’s priority.
▪ UNICEF’s response was in line with the global guidelines as well as national government’s
priorities and needs. A joint response plan was developed (WHO and UN partners) to guide and
prioritize the requests of Government of India while taking several strategic and guidance
documents and information issued by Government of India into consideration.
▪ To ensure that UNICEF’s response is aligned with the government priorities, UNICEF India
conducted regular meetings with the government to discuss the changing situation, activities,
gaps and their expectations. These meetings guided UNICEF to plan the response/activities
which cater to government priorities and are agreed upon mutually. For example, UNICEF India
procured diagnostic tests and oxygen products, to support the GoI in its efforts to ramp up
capacity to test and manage COVID-19 cases. Similarly, to ensure safe and continued hand
washing in facilities and communal places, UNICEF India developed compendium of designs for
installing hand washing stations which were COVID adjusted along with providing guidelines for
their usage. Furthermore, UNICEF provided technical support in training about how these can
be produced locally and where these can be placed to ensure maximum efficiency as well as
coverage.
▪ One of the UNICEF national level officials explained that UNICEF does not operate
independently. Each and every target and activity is discussed and identified with the
government. Hence by design, UNICEF’s response is bound to and was aligned with government
priorities.
▪ Along with the government, UNICEF’s response was also aligned with the partner and donor
agencies. For example, a national level respondent from HUL explained that WASH and hand
hygiene were the first few areas which were recognized as a preventive measures for curbing
the spread of COVID. While the government, WHO and other agencies were still figuring out the
usage, disposal and other guidelines for supplies like masks, it was already established that hand
washing is a very critical aspect. Keeping this in mind, HUL and UNICEF came together to support
338
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
the government in ensuring that people have access to soaps to ensure safe and proper hand
washing.
▪ It is interesting to note that according to UNICEF WASH officials at national level, WASH was not
considered a priority area in the initial month of pandemic. It was a challenge for them to
advocate about importance of WASH and hand hygiene with Ministry of Jal Shakti. Since COVID-
19 is a health led emergency hence according to MoJS, responding to COVID-19 did not fall in
its purview. It was only until later when the research indicated that sanitation and hand hygiene
were primary preventive measures to curb the spread. Once recognized, UNICEF was able to
advocate and mobilize government’s support for WASH activities to fight the pandemic.
▪ To further understand UNICEF’s response w.r.t. IPC, respondents at state level (government
officials, CSO and UNICEF state level staff) were asked to rate UNICEF’s response on a scale of
very relevant, partially relevant and not relevant. Out of 33 respondents who responded,
majority of them rated UNICEF’s response as ‘very relevant’. This is because UNICEF provided
state specific support by developing its intervention activities at state level and mobilizing the
resources (from its partner agencies) to meet the varying needs of target population. For
example, a health official in UP explained that it was extremely critical (especially in the initial
months) to make sure that the service providers/healthcare staff were well versed with IPC
protocols and UNICEF played a “very relevant role in supporting the whole spectrum of IPC
activities ranging from advocacy to supplies”. Moreover, in Uttar Pradesh UNICEF provided
trainings to block level stakeholders like Pradhans on IPC preventive measures on request of
the district government. These trainings were helpful and relevant because they not only
focused informing about preventive measures to be taken in public spaces but also about the
steps which can be taken while at home – such as taking a bath if possible before entering the
home.
▪ However, very few respondents opined that UNICEF’s response was ‘partially relevant’. For
example, in Jharkhand UNICEF’s response was perceived as partially relevant because the state
lacked local manufacturers of supplies like mask and sanitizers and restricted movement during
national lockdown worsen the situation in Jharkhand.
1.2. How UNICEF does provides technical assistance to support the implementation and
monitoring of identified measures under the IPC action plan as part of its COVID-19
response? What are the different activities undertaken to provide support towards
improving IPC services? What considerations are kept in mind while designing these
activities?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF official at national level informed that UNICEF’s niche is on capacity development,
developing of guidelines, SoPs, providing critical supplies, developing IEC material, imparting
training, supporting government with planning, for e.g. designing and preparing village action
plan.
▪ In the initial months, both UNICEF and WHO supported the government in developing
guidelines for IPC for both Health (at facility level) as well as WASH (at community level) staff.
To ensure that the support was relevant to the changing situation, UNICEF along with WHO and
government released 4-5 versions of these guidelines (between March and October 2020).
These health and WASH staff were oriented about the updated guidelines in form of refresher
trainings. UNICEF provided technical support in these sessions.
339
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
▪ UNICEF supported the training and capacity building (another priority area for the government)
of government officials at state, district as well as block level along with healthcare staff in
facilities (especially doctors and nurses), and FLWs, SHGs as well as other community level
workers. Moreover, trainings for MTCs, SNCUs, labor rooms, staff, respective units, block level
stakeholders (Pradhans), sanitation supervisors, ASHA and other frontline workers, mothers
and children, and psychological training through psychiatrists were supported by UNICEF across
5 states.
▪ UNICEF also works with local water quality labs and local self-help groups to support the
government by training them in the production of essential supplies during COVID, such as hand
sanitizers, soaps.
▪ According to government officials, UNICEF’s CSO and implementing partners as well as UNICEF’s
national level partner agencies like WHO and WaterAid, UNICEF played an essential role in
facilitating the supply of critical and essential health and WASH supplies across all 5 states.
Supplies of masks, soaps and sanitizers were of primary importance at both healthcare facility
and community level whereas, the supply of PPEs, pulse oxy meters and oxygen concentrates
provided major support to the HCFs across states. For example, UNICEF procured 328 RT-PCR
and RNA Extraction Thermo Fisher test kits and supplied it to the Indian Council of Medical
Research, procured 100,000 PPE kits and 552,000 N95 masks and supplied it to the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, and 100,000 PPE kits through Supply Division in Copenhagen
Denmark to support GoI (July-August 2020). Similarly, 16,000 N-95 masks and 1000 bottles of
sanitizers and 5 lakh soaps were distributed to vulnerable sections with support of UNICEF’s
Wash partners in Uttar Pradesh. Hand washing models had been scaled up in all 5 states. There
were huge gaps in the supply of sanitary absorbent materials hence training was imparted to
adults and girls to prepare homemade menstrual requirements in West Bengal.
▪ Assessments regarding hospital preparedness were undertaken by UNICEF’s Health section in all
5 states. For example, UNICEF health official at national level informed that UNICEF undertook
assessments to assess the situation of hospital preparedness and provided support in all 5 states
through its existing healthcare channels to ensure that COVID-wards were setup, normal
services, which a women and child may need, were restructured in terms of protocol, guidelines,
and spaces in the facilities.
▪ UNICEF helps with communication related activities such as contributing towards developing
IPC related posters, videos to curb misinformation, promoting puppeteering videos (TARA) for
360 degree approach to capacity building in Uttar Pradesh; Maharashtra had the overloaded
issue of migrant workers and their safety, for which Jeevan Rath (inter-agency group) came into
action and helped in the setting up of 300 targeted washroom requirements, also mobilized by
Hindustan Unilever.
KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ACTIVITIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY UNICEF
TAILORED TO THE LOCAL CONTEXT IN DIFFERENT STATES?
1.3. Which activities under IPC are contextualized based on social economic and cultural context
of the states to target women and children and vulnerable population?
Key Findings:
▪ All activities were tailor adjusted based on state’s local context. The technical assistance
focused on covering all sections of society including women, children and vulnerable
populations. When probed, UNICEF officials at state level explained that even though UNICEF’s
340
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
broad intervention areas/themes were finalized at the national level, the underlying activities
and support was designed/tailored at the state level to suit the state specific context. A UNICEF
official from Jharkhand explained that only the trainings for frontline workers were based on
national guidelines, the rest (like which were then shared with MTCs, SNCUs, labor room staff,
SHGs, etc.) were designed and contextualized at state level keeping in mind the parameters
such as – how well the staff is aware about the virus and its preventive measures, how patients
can be treated and protected in COVID wards, etc.
▪ Furthermore, while the health supplies were mainly routed through/supplied at the national
level resulting in UNICEF’s limited control to cater to state specific needs, the WASH supplies,
on the other hand, varied based on the needs of the state and were provided directly at the
state level. For instance, in West Bengal anaerobic toilets were placed in slum areas because
public toilets had been destroyed by the cyclone. The ‘adjustment of supplies’ was more
focused on WASH related support as compared to health because majority of health supplies
were directly provided to GoI and not state governments. As a result, UNICEF did not directly
procured and supplied essential medical material based on state specific needs. Rather it was
done at the national level.
▪ UNICEF India followed the ROSA and HQ guidelines (and standard indicators) to structure its
COVID response. According to a UNICEF national level official, the global guidelines provided a
wide array of activities. However, only those sections of the global guidelines were adopted
which “suited the Indian context and made sense.” These were accommodated in the form of
HPM indicators in UNICEF’s COVID-19 response. In terms of supplies, there were additional
procurement of soaps, sanitizers; local SHGs were mobilized to meet the needs of states during
pandemic.
▪ UNICEF’s support in promoting communication and messaging was also planned at state level.
The messages related to WASH behaviors were developed locally to befit local context. For
example, UNICEF official in UP informed that the series of TARA videos were WASH funded and
these videos were developed in UP to ensure that they fit the state’s context. Government
district official in Maharashtra informed that all activities and guidelines were translated in
Marathi to ensure that maximum number of people are able to communicate and understand
them. To further streamline the process, training material for both healthcare facility staff as
well as the community workers was developed in the local language.
1.4. How are IPC activities adapted to the existing capacities and enabling environment of
service providers and implementing partners? What kind of adjustments are made by
UNICEF during its implementation?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF state officials across all states confirmed that the existing capacities in terms of financial
resources, technical support provided by partners and logistical and infrastructure capability of
the state were sufficient to undertake IPC activities. When further explored, it was mentioned
by UNICEF state official in Jharkhand, that funds from Aayushman Bharat and DFMD were
generously used by the state to meet the needs. Moreover, aspirational districts had their
separate funds which were also used for COVID response by the state.
▪ Jharkhand government state official informed that the state governments were directed to
utilize the ‘contingency fund’ to meet any financial gaps. Hence, funds were not a matter of
concern. Moreover, the official informed that since most of the activities were happening
online, hence all funds were directed towards procuring and distribution of supplies to the
341
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
target population. However, in terms of supply, the need to produce essential supplies locally
(in Jharkhand) was highlighted. In a pandemic where movement is restricted, initially, it became
difficult for the state to procure supplies. Hence local production should be promoted.
▪ UNICEF, state governments and local partner agencies were quick to adopt new means of
service delivery – like virtual trainings. All the capacity building sessions (for healthcare staff,
government functionaries, FLWs, etc.) took place online through video conferencing platforms
like Zoom. For example, the UNICEF state official in Uttar Pradesh explained that ‘UNICEF
partnerships’ played a very crucial role in this area. BMGF-assisted TSU, UNICEF and WHO
worked in very close collaboration with the NHM team of Quality Assurance and the
Directorate. Modules and guidelines were prepared pertaining to IPC during COVID and these
were delivered through the online modes. The three partners have teams in the field-,
divisional- and district-level. They were all at the frontline with the government delivering these
trainings, sometimes on online mode and sometimes face-to-face.
▪ To meet the needs, state infrastructure such as school buildings, educational institutes were
used as quarantine center and centers to provide medical assistance. For example, government
state official in Maharashtra informed that school buildings and educational institutes were
used to store material or as quarantine centers and hence, infrastructure and logistics did not
pose as a barrier to smooth implementation of IPC activities.
▪ UNICEF state level official in UP also informed that many activities were done in-house by
UNICEF to meet the needs of the situation. For e.g.: UNICEF used to hire agencies to make
training videos but due to limitation of time and resources and the urgency of quick turnaround
time, the content was prepared quickly even if the overall quality of the video had been
compromised. There were regular (monthly) refresher trainings on IPC and the new guidelines
from the central and state-level were adapted.
▪ When probed about the adjustments made by UNICEF during implementation, a UNICEF
national level official explained that by design UNICEF India does not supply materials and
equipment. This is because unlike other countries, GOI is self-sufficient for undertaking the
supply to the states and further to the target population. Moreover, there are several other
agencies working in the same space who undertake supply and procurement of health and
WASH material. Hence, to avoid duplication, UNICEF India does not support with supplies.
However, during the pandemic, UNICEF did come forward to procure and supply critical
material, equipment and services. Since UNICEF usually does not involve in supply hence it does
not have the kind of resources to do so even during the pandemic. Thus UNICEF's role was
restricted to advocating with the government, mobilizing resources from donors/partners and
developing a robust plan for the distribution of in-kind supplies/resources such that the most
vulnerable sections of society are catered. For instance, UNICEF collaborated with the Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare, State authorities and UNDP to install oxygen generating plants in
31 facilities in four Indian states to strengthen the treatment of COVID-19 patients who are in
moderate, severe and critical category. UNICEF received 1 crore soaps from HUL. UNICEF
developed a distribution plan (with several logistics in place) along with the government to
ensure that the supplies reach where they are required.
▪ Moreover, UNICEF health official at national level informed that all existing healthcare support
channels of UNICEF across 24 states and 41 aspirational districts through which it used to
provide support to stat government in pre-COVID times, were rerouted to execute/support
COVID activities. For example, UNICEF’s huge social mobilization network – polio eradication
342

network – was leveraged and its activities were repurposed to support COVID activities like
setting up COVID wards, disseminating guidelines, etc.

CRISIS RESPONSE MEETING THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES?
1.5. Do the services and supplies adequately reach the disadvantaged, marginalized and
vulnerable population? What are the barriers faced? What are the measure undertaken to
reach hard-to-reach and vulnerable population?
Key Findings:
▪ There is no formal mechanism to track or trace whether supplies and services are adequately
reaching the target population. UNICEF national official explained that an estimate is taken
based on number of states, districts, blocks and FLWs reached/trained/equipped with
services/supplies for the purpose of further dissemination/distribution, assuming that each
trained/equipped personnel will reach out to certain number of target population (maximum
10 people) with relief supplies/service. Additionally, UNICEF state officials informed that
photographs of staff/FLWs distributing supplies, training sessions, functional hand washing
stations etc. are shared generously by FLWs as well as partner organizations (like HUL) working
in the field, as proof of the ongoing work.
▪ UNICEF national officials informed that they work (to provide supplies) through government
functionaries and existing structures (i.e. channels which were used to support government
during pre-COVID times) to understand the most affected areas and vulnerable sections; and
its needs. Post which, UNICEF leverages the existing/available data (Kayakalp assessments,
WASH data, COVID cases, population density, demographics) to undertake assessment,
planning and implementation of plans as well as monitoring; such that most vulnerable sections
and pockets are identified and relevant support is provided. No additional measures, outside of
its functional channels, are undertaken by UNICEF to reach hard-to-reach population.
▪ At national level, UNICEF officials informed that “even though UNICEF managed to import some
of the supplies (like PPE) from other countries when there was excessive shortage of critical
supplies; we still couldn’t ensure that supplies reach different states in time due to the closed
state borders and restricted movements.” However, this problem was resolved once the
lockdown and restrictions on movement were lifted. Furthermore, since UNICEF was providing
supplies (especially health) to the central government who was then sending these supplies
further to respective states, there was no mechanism for UNICEF to track whether these
supplies were adequately reaching disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable population.
▪ However, in states with presence of local manufacturers, UNICEF was able to mobilize resources
locally. In such cases, UNICEF along with state departments analyzed secondary data which
indicated that areas with high density, poorer population, and lesser access to WASH facilities
had maximum number of cases. For instance, in Maharashtra major focus was given to toilet
operators and toilet cleanliness. UNICEF provided support in training community toilet
operators and leverage supply to ensure that they would be able to keep the public toilets clean
while at the same time protect themselves. Similarly in UP, UNICEF along with local network of
partners supported the state government in setting up the quarantine centers and providing
technical support in trainings, ensuring that proper guidelines were provided and followed;
ahead of the return of migrants to the state.

e
v
o
C 2.1. Who are the stakeholders involved and community members covered under the IPC pillar?
Are there any specific groups (socio-economic profile) that are being targeted by this pillar?
.2 Key Findings:
▪ According to the government officials, as well as UNICEF officials and partners, IPC pillar did not
target any specific group (socio-economic or geographical). UNICEF’s COVID-19 response largely
targeted and reached focus/intervention areas/communities; and was accessible to all. Hence
community members included anyone and everyone who was provided with essential services
and critical supplies. However, time and again the provision of services was prioritized for
vulnerable population. So while the response on one hand targeted all sections at all times, some
supplies/services were diverted to priority areas/sections in case of emergency. For example, all
states reported that while services and supplies were provided to all, migrants were especially
focused on during the migrant crisis. Additional services/supplies were diverted to avert the
spread.
▪ Similarly, during floods in WB additional services and supplies were directed to such areas to
curb the infection spread. For example during cyclone Amphan in West Bengal, UNICEF
supported state government to set up portable toilets.
▪ The district officials in UP, Bihar and Jharkhand, identified migrants and floating population as
the most vulnerable sections. Also, people living in disaster prone areas were more vulnerable
than others.
▪ According to UNICEF state official in UP, migrants were most affected and ensuring IPC measures
in the quarantine centers for them was a big challenge given the limited supplies and services at
the time. UNICEF supported in this situation by implementing an online system to track the
migrants coming into the state, moving from institutional quarantine to home quarantine.
UNICEF trained ASHAs who used this online tracking system to track migrants so they knew
where each migrant was. Focus visits were made to migrant households to explain the SOPs of
home quarantine and to counsel on the IPC measures. More than 3.1 million migrants were
tracked through that system by ASHAs with UNICEF’s support. The visits to the migrant
households played a critical role in preventing spread of infection from the migrants to the other
population in the rural areas right in the beginning which was a big apprehension.
▪ A State level official in Jharkhand suggested that males have been affected more than women
probably due to higher movement for search of work. The older age groups and people with co-
morbid conditions were also reported by UNICEF state official in UP to be vulnerable. Similarly,
in case of Bihar, population living in border area and Maha-Dalit communities living in extreme
rural pockets and where infrastructure in not adequately available to provide the essential
supplies and services; were identifies as vulnerable. However, under IPC pillar, attempts were
made to reach out to them with essential supplies and critical services.
▪ UNICEF state official in Maharashtra opined that people living in slum areas and using public
toilets and public water stations are the most vulnerable, especially when most of the people
often do not wear a mask or maintain social distancing norms. Also, according to UNICEF officials
(Maharashtra and WB), those sanitation workers or hospital cleaning staff who are collecting and
disposing waste without protecting themselves and following guidelines are vulnerable. To
address this, UNICEF supported in providing trainings (guidelines and protocols for CAB) to the
cleaning staff at HCF and community level.
345

▪ UNICEF official in West Bengal informed that migrant population often do not carry official
papers with them which are required for the release of supplies/or to procure services. Hence,
the release of supplies and provision of services often gets delayed.
KEQ-2: IS UNICEF’S COVID-19 RESPONSE LIKELY TO REACH/ARE MATERIALS ACCESSIBLE TO
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES, SCHEDULED CASTES AND
TRIBES, CHILDREN ON THE MOVE, STREET CHILDREN, CHILDREN WITHOUT PARENTAL CARE (IN
INSTITUTIONS OR FOSTER CARE) AND/OR THOSE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES, ORPHANED,
QUARANTINED CHILDREN, VICTIMS OF GBV, AND OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN?
2.2. How are essential services and critical supplies being provided under the IPC pillar? How is it
being ensured that the services and supplies are accessible to the targeted vulnerable
population? Is there any variation in the supplies/services with the evolving crisis? What
challenges emerged in ensuring the access to vulnerable target population and how were they
mitigated?
Key Findings:
▪ The demand/requisition for services and supplies originates from the national/state/district
governments. These are communicated to the UNICEF national/state officials during monthly/bi-
monthly meetings or in form of formal demand letter. Once received, UNICEF (along with
government, partners) maps the geographical area/target population and approaches local
partner/CSO from whom resources could be mobilized. Once the partner agrees to provide the
required sources, quality checks are undertaken. After receiving approval from the UNICEF,
partner/CSO provides the supplies/services to the district government who further undertakes
the distribution of those resources to the target population. In case of health supplies, UNICEF
procures supplies from its partners and delivers the same to the line ministry from which it had
received the demand. For example, in October 2020, UNICEF procured 3,015 oxygen
concentrators for management of COVID 19 positive individuals with support of German
Government. Following its agreement with Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the
concentrators were handed over to HLL Lifecare Ltd (a Government of India Enterprise) for
further distribution across 19 States/ UTs.
▪ UNICEF leveraged the local networks and field channels (paramedics and doctors, SHGs, FLWs,
teachers, Municipal Staff, Wada Sakhis, Jeevikas, NSS, VRPs, janitors, scavengers, field/regional
staff of various private organizations/partners, etc.) of the government and partner organization
to facilitate the distribution of essential services and critical supplies. For example, in Jharkhand,
World Vision supported UNICEF by conducting Kayakalp training of healthcare providers in which
the main objective was to orient paramedics about the hospital premises upkeep on sanitations
and hygienic practices based on Kayakalp and Swachh Swasth Sarvatra (SSS) guidelines.
▪ UNICEF national level official informed that for the intervention in urban slums, UNICEF tried to
embark the government and also went proactively in direct service delivery in urban slums, partly
with UNICEF’s scarce resources to pioneer initiatives, but majorly leveraging NGO partners,
municipal corporations and other stakeholders to address the needs in the urban areas for
WASH. UNICEF state level official from UP claimed that UNICEF’s organic reach in the state was
more than 1 million. This was reported by the government district level offices directly to UNICEF
state office in UP.
▪ But there is no formal mechanism for UNICEF to trace/track whether supplies and services have
been received by the end consumer/beneficiary. A national level official from UNICEF explained
“There is no mechanism for us to actually trace whether the beneficiary has received the
service/supply or not. If a UNICEF official from X state has reported that supplies were distributed
346
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
then we have to go with that claim. So it is only word of mouth or what the state offices are
reporting to us.”
▪ Some UNICEF state level officials informed that they often receive images of ‘distribution sites’
or target population receiving the supplies which for them serves as an evidence in the absence
of an institutionalized mechanism to do the same. UNICEF Maharashtra and UP informed that
telephone surveys – RapidPro – were extensively used to understand the needs of the people
and also to assess the coverage, whether UNICEF’s response is reaching to the target population.
▪ Government as well as UNICEF officials in all states informed that WhatsApp was used
exhaustively to share updates, information, guidelines, and feedback as well as to coordinate
and communicate various activities with the ground staff working at facility and community level.
▪ Interestingly, no challenges w.r.t. the receipt of support provided by UNICEF were reported by
stakeholders across all 5 states. Moreover, the respondents did not report any
section/community who was left out of UNICEF response.

.3
▪ According to majority of UNICEF Health and WASH officials at both national as well as state
level, the resources provided by UNICEF as well as mobilized from the partners for IPC were
sufficient to undertake IPC activities in states. One of the national level officials opined that
“we were doing more with less. Even though the resources were not ours, but it was the first
time such huge amount of investments and resources were pulled together to respond to such
a crisis.”
▪ However, one of the officials from UNICEF WASH at national level informed that initially,
because WASH was not prioritized (by Ministry of Jal Shakti) at the onset of the pandemic, it
could not advocate for and mobilize resources to its full capacity – “Since this is a Health-led
response and a health emergency, there was a very strong focus on health. Also in terms of
donor prioritization, most of the funding is going to Health and not necessarily to WASH, which
is an issues because there is also a requirement for proper access to water supply for drinking
and hand washing, soaps, sanitation facilities, sewage treatments. If WASH services are not
present in health facilities, communities, slums, hotspots, camps and shelters, it creates a
major issue, especially around hand washing and access to soaps. The resources could have
been more for the WASH team to do a better job.”
▪ UNICEF state official in Jharkhand, WB and Maharashtra explained that since the
dissemination of supplies and distribution of services is undertaken by the district
government, the cost of distribution is also borne by the government. For example, UNICEF
health anchored the procurement of 3,015 Oxygen Concentrators along with Humifier bottles
through Supply and Procurement Division, which were handed over to the MoHFW for further
dissemination across 19 states and union territories.
3.2. How efficient are the mechanisms in place for IPC ensuring the accessibility of services and
distribution of critical supplies to the vulnerable and hard-to-reach population?
Key Findings:
▪ According to UNICEF state officials and the government officials across all 5 states UNICEF’s
response mechanism to provide services and supplies under IPC to vulnerable population was
largely efficient. When probed further, the respondents explained that it was through UNICEF’s
support (like its technical expertise, risk knowledge and quick turnaround time for developing
in-house training material, raising funds for procuring health supplies, data collection and
analyzing gaps and needs) that they were able to support the government and guide the staff
at facility and community level. “UNICEF's support & contribution is very effective in handling
this situation.” – Government official.
▪ At both national and state level, UNICEF receives demand from the central/state government
against which it provides support (through mobilizing resources of partner
organizations/networks). In doing so, UNICEF provides the required services/supplies to the
central/state government who then further disseminates these to states/districts. There is a
well-established system of processing and the demand. However, UNICEF health and WASH
348
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
officials at national level informed that initially they faced difficulty in doing so because
initially they received demands from various points of contact within the line ministries which
posed as barrier in systematically processing the same. However later contact persons for
different departments were assigned and clear communication took place between them.
▪ UNICEF health officials at national level highlighted that initially (March 2020), there was a lot
of confusion within the UN family – UNICEF, WHO, UNDP global – on who does what, what is
the mechanism. The demand from government came to all agencies because the government
was not aware of, for example, that all of the ventilators were being suddenly procured by
WHO, concentrators by UNICEF; which caused confusion and affected overall efficiency of
delivering the response. This ultimately resulted in formation of a global portal about the
procurement UNICEF was doing. Later, the guidelines also helped in defining roles and
responsibilities of agencies and sections within these agencies.
KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT IS UNICEF MANAGING AND DELIVERING ITS COVID-19 RESPONSE IN A
TIMELY COORDINATED, COHERENT AND QUALITY WAY?
3.3. Are the services and supplies reaching the healthcare and other facilities within the set
timelines? What adjustments, if any, are made to improve the IPC in healthcare facilities?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF India’s response could have been executed faster. A major reason which had caused
delays in supply of essential material to both healthcare facilities as well as community was
UNICEF’s extensive internal processes (like processing of requests from the government,
auditing for quality assurance and giving approval to the donors to release supply, on-
boarding a new partner, etc.) which are extremely time consuming as a result the supplies
and services got delayed. For example, UNICEF WB could not adequately provide soaps and
sanitizers to some vulnerable sections in the state during Amphan because in order to redirect
additional resources, internal approvals were required which took approximately 2 months.
By the time emergency period got over.
▪ Additionally, at national level, UNICEF health could not provide PPE kits to the government
and “felt tremendous challenge” due to national and global scarcity (and absence of local
manufacturers). Moreover there were quality issues and hence UNICEF could not approve the
supply. However, this problem was resolved once the market in India picked up and local
manufacturers were able to meet UNICEF’s requirement.
▪ An official from UNICEF donor agency informed about similar delays due to extensive auditing
of soaps. According to the donor, “UNICEF should be mindful of the situation we all are
working in. Such extensive auditing for soaps (had it been vaccine or any pharma product then
that would have been a different case), whether color was blue instead of green for example,
caused an unnecessary delay in the supply.”
▪ UNICEF state official in Jharkhand informed that the state faced delays in the initial months
due to lack of supplies. With the restricted movement due to lockdown and no local
manufacturers of supplies like masks in the state, some programs like LaQshya (quality
assurance in labor), Kayakalp program, etc. got delayed. As a result, the state could not
achieve its target of ensuring compliance in 72 facilities. The state could only cover 5-6
facilities till September 2020.
▪ Interestingly, no stakeholder informed of any measures taken/adjustment made to improve
the internal processes to expedite the processes.

Evaluation Report
3.4. How is institutionalized capacity building being carried out by UNICEF as a part of COVID-19
response plan? How frequently are the stakeholders being oriented?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF provided technical assistance towards building capacity of the existing manpower
working at facility as well as community level. This included government officials at state,
district and block levels, healthcare workers (doctors, paramedics, caregivers of village
quarantine center), sanitation workers (toilet cleaners, plumbers, janitors, scavengers, etc.),
community level workers (like FLWs, SHGs), urban local bodies (municipalities), rural bodies
(panchayats), bio-medical waste treatment agencies, as well as local groups in the state (NSS,
Sahiyas, Jeevikas, Boy Scouts, government school teachers, etc.) UNICEF also supported the
local manufacturing of essential supplies like sanitizers and masks through building the capacity
of SHGs and water quality labs for undertaking local production.
▪ The initial trainings (March-April 2020) were undertaken with government officials at state and
district levels along with healthcare staff. These trainings were undertaken virtually using
online platforms like Zoom and Google Meets. In Jharkhand, WhatsApp groups and Facebook
live sessions were also extensively used to reach the staff and general public with CAB
guidelines and protocols.
▪ With the changing context, UNICEF along with the government and WHO released fresh
guidelines time and again which were relevant to the new evidence and research. A UNICEF
national level official informed that till date 4-5 versions of COVID guidelines have been
released (the last was released in the month of September – October 2020). These were
provided to the healthcare staff and community workers in the form of refresher trainings.
These trainings were conducted as and when the guidelines (i.e. the original guidelines and
subsequent versions) were released (with each stakeholder category). Under IPC pillar, apart
from orienting healthcare and community workers about CAB related communication and
messaging, trainings also focused on informing them about the protocols and guidelines to be
followed to protect themselves as well as COVID-appropriate practices to be carried out at HCF
and community level, how to use hand washing stations, etc. For example, in WB the technical
sessions of training which were led by UNICEF health consultants focused on basic
epidemiology of COVID-19 on infection prevention (standard precautions, additional
precaution, videos on use of PPE, triage) wherein special emphasis was given on Triage since
most of the peripheral health facilities were completely devoid of proper triaging and isolation
wards.
▪ The frequency of trainings slightly varied across states depending upon requests of
state/district governments. For example, in Uttar Pradesh UNICEF provided trainings to block
level stakeholders like Pradhans on IPC preventive measures on request of the district
government.
▪ UNICEF health official at national level and few respondents at district level informed of facing
technical issues with the platforms as it allowed very limited number of participants to
participate in a single session. However, later the states obtained commercial/professional
access wherein 500-800 participants could participate in a single session.
▪ Government officials in Bihar and UP informed that training modules (mostly animated to
promote ease of understanding) were developed at state level using WASH sector funds along
with UNICEF’s communication team. For example, UNICEF UP’s TARA series were developed at
350
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
state level to inform the facility and community level staff about the usage of hand washing
station and promote hand hygiene.
▪ UNICEF also utilized its NGO network in states to facilitate trainings and capacity building
sessions. For example, district official in Jharkhand communicated that UNICEF’s NGO partners
also conducted trainings and capacity building sessions locally to inform the field staff at facility
and community level about COVID appropriate protocols. An official from Habitat for Humanity
India (HHI) also informed of supporting UNICEF by providing trainings to the local community
staff on COVID guidelines shared by UNICEF and WHO. Such channels were leveraged by
UNICEF India to increase the reach and coverage of trained staff in the states.
▪ Almost all UNICEF officials at state level highlighted the following drawbacks of online/virtual
training:
✓ Many facility and community level workers (especially in extreme rural/backward pockets)
faced a problem of network connectivity while joining/attending these sessions. Some
workers were also reported of not owning a smartphone which would allow them to
participate in such training sessions. This problem was however resolved when workers
started coming together in one place to attend such sessions.
✓ There was no mechanism to check whether participants were interested and were actively
listening to these sessions. The absence of physical demonstrations and connect was a
major challenge for both trainers as well as the participants. For example, UNICEF Health
official at national level informed that “now for us it is difficult to track how many of them
have actually attended the training or have not just connected their devices but are not
listening or how many ASHAs have actually been trained”.
3.5. How well the synergies and interlinkages between government and service providers'
activities have been established to optimize the COVID-19 response? What are the overlaps
that reduce the efficiency of the IPC pillar?
Key Findings:
▪ The synergies and interlinkages were well developed to optimize COVID-19 response. UNICEF,
across all 5 states, streamlined the activities by interlinking its partner resources with the
government and service providers depending upon the need/request UNICEF received from
the government. For example, in Jharkhand, to provide training, UNICEF Jharkhand partnered
with Medical college through which IPC training and gynaecology, obstetrician related training
was imparted to meet the government priorities. Similarly, UNICEF WB (WASH) partnered with
PHED which is responsible for providing drinking water whereas, for urban areas, UNICEF
established partnership with Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Additionally, to facilitate capacity
building, medical camps holding, advocacy, and awareness generation in the state UNICEF
leveraged its new partnership with West Bengal Doctor's Forum who provided its services to
meet the government needs.,.
▪ Similarly, in Bihar, UNICEF (Health) partnered with India Association of Paediatricians and
National Neurology Forum for capacity building of various stakeholders, particularly for new-
born care. The Federation of Obstetrician and Gynaecologist conducted conferences for IPC
services to orient about COVID-19 management in HCFs. To orient and equip sanitation workers
in rural areas, existing partnership with Aga Khan Foundation was leveraged. These
partnerships have been established for more than 2 years and are particularly functioning for
mentoring support in the field of service delivery and IPC services.
351
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
▪ At national level UNICEF worked with WaterAid India who rated its partnership 4/5 (1 being
lowest and 5 being highest). According to WaterAid official, UNICEF has a strong
communication network with the government and holds technical expertise in advocating with
the government. This compliments WaterAid work who has a strong field/community presence
and supports in implementation and facilitation of activities on the ground level. However, the
official suggested that this partnership can further be improved if UNICEF increases its field
presence wherein it is more aware about the implementation modalities and can accordingly
advocate at the national/sub-national level.
▪ UNICEF national level respondent informed that while administering the response donor
answerability often becomes an area of concern for UNICEF. With fast changing situation,
emergency areas and pockets that require support change quickly. UNICEF facilitates resources
from donor against a specific requirement. Given the delay in procuring approval for the supply,
the emergency/need area often changes in which case UNICEF has to redirect the acquired
resources. This creates a tiff with donor where UNICEF has to explain why it rerouted the
resources from original community members to new ones.
▪ There were no overlaps reported by any partner (government /private).
3.6. What is the mechanism (frequency, monitoring platform etc.) to ensure the quality of
healthcare and WASH services undertaken by the stakeholders under this pillar? How the
identified bottlenecks and corrective measures accounted and addressed to enhance the
quality of preparedness and response for COVID-19?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF official at national level informed that UNICEF does not have a systematic real-time
monitoring mechanism to monitor quality of COVID-19 response (w.r.t. both health and WASH).
UNICEF mainly relied on existing Results Assessment Module (RAM), Situational reports and
rapid assessment(s) to seek insights about healthcare and WASH activities being undertaken
by different stakeholders across all states, and about the coverage – number of stakeholders
oriented/trained, number of supplies distributed, etc. For IPC pillar, there are 2 HPM indicators,
namely - population reached with critical WASH supplies (like soaps, masks, sanitizers, etc.) and
provision of services (like continuation or development of new WASH services such as hand
washing stations) on which progress (in terms of number of people who received
service/supplies) was reported by state offices. There was no disaggregated (especially on
women, children and other vulnerable sections) data available to monitor UNICEF’s response.
▪ To set the targets, UNICEF conducted a baseline assessment in March 2020 to collect the initial
numbers across all states for analyzing the current situation in the states. Based on these
figures, UNICEF set the targets for all indicators. Progress report on these targets (numbers)
were collected via state offices on monthly/fortnightly basis.
▪ UNICEF officials (WB and Bihar) informed of having a state specific reporting mechanism to
seek insights about on-ground activities. For example, UNICEF WB informed that Oxfam shared
pictures of on ground activities (supplies being handed over to target population) and monthly
reports with UNICEF. These reports were assessed by UNICEF state office to identify gaps and
potential intervention areas. These are also shared with the Government of West Bengal.
Similarly, UNICEF Bihar informed about ‘monitoring matrix’ wherein it feeds the progress of all
activities. This data is collected from partner agencies in ‘monthly review meetings’. But there
was no mechanism to assess the quality of UNICEF’s support.
352
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
▪ Challenges with monitoring and reporting:
✓ UNICEF officials at national as well as state level informed that excessive data collection,
data processing, and reporting (numbers being collected and reported to HQ and ROSA,
state level HPM reports, SitReps, rapid assessments, internal meetings and feedback calls
with state colleagues, etc.) was being done. This was recognized as a barrier since a lot of
time was being spent in reporting.
✓ Even though UNICEF’s targets of reaching people with services and supplies was achieved,
a national level official informed that there was no mechanism in place to cross check or
track whether the target population has actually received the intended benefits.
✓ According to another UNICEF national level official the barrier also lies with the HPM
indicators – “Issue is with the language and the kind of indicators that were being recorded.
That was the biggest back and forth. My biggest recommendation is that let us use the
indicators where we can do the monitoring; let us not have the indicators where we have to
invariably have to create an assumption model for reporting.” This also decreases the
efficiency of the work and overall response.
KEQ-3: TO WHAT EXTENT IS UNICEF ADAPTING ITS ACTIVITIES TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT
BASED ON LEARNING AND A CHANGING COVID-19 CONTEXT?
3.7. What is the knowledge management and sharing mechanism within UNICEF? What are the
steps undertaken for resource management to address the evolving crisis? In what ways
UNICEF learns from the good practices of service providers responding to COVID-19
situation in similar context?
Key Findings:
▪ There is no well-established knowledge management and knowledge sharing mechanism
within UNICEF. When probed about this, UNICEF’s stakeholders at national and state level
stated that rapid assessments served as a source of knowledge sharing helping them to analyze
and evaluating the response so far and understanding the needs of target population.
Approximately, 24 Rapid Assessments have been conducted by 15 UNICEF state offices, where
all the state officials felt the need of having some data to understand hand hygiene and other
WASH services and behaviors. Rapid Assessments were conducted along with SPME section.
▪ A UNICEF national official informed that UNICEF state officials from WASH section had
independently conducted studies to understand the response in their individual states. There
are 6-7 reports from state offices outlining the response which have helped understand the
situation in these states. These reports were shared with the state governments and partner
agencies as well to guide future course of action, at state level. However, this type of learning
process in not uniform in nature across all states.
▪ UNICEF along with WaterAid as part of its existing partnership, is conducting a study to
understand how COVID has impacted WASH services in the country, how and what support was
provided, and how useful a relevant was it. This will help UNICEF advocate with the government
about some of the mainstream issues like WASH hygiene and hand hygiene and how these can
be improved in India.
▪ There is no mechanism in place for UNICEF to learn from the good practices of service
providers. UNICEF national level official informed that “there is no such mechanism at national
level.” UNICEF state officials also did not know/did not inform about any such method of
adopting and incorporating good practices of service providers/partners.

KEQ-4: ARE THERE ANY INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRISIS
RESPONSE (E.G. LOW AWARENESS AND UPTAKE, UNAVAILABILITY OF FRONTLINE WORKERS AND
OTHER KEY PERSONNEL, MISUNDERSTANDING OR MISUSE OF UNICEF’S MESSAGES ETC.)?
3.8. Are there any inefficiencies associated with UNICEF's COVID-19 response? How could these
be mitigated?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF WASH officials at national level opined that both section teams (Health and WASH)
should work on their internal collaboration and convergence as well as convergence with WHO
to ensure that the priority areas as well as critical activities are mutually identified. This was
seconded by UNICEF official in Jharkhand. Even though internal coordination mechanism was
well established between the health and WASH section at national level, it did not convert
efficiently in certain cases at the operational level. For example, UNICEF WASH official at
national level explained that there were instances when they were not consulted, and in certain
areas of collaboration (like advocating with the Health ministry for increased number of WASH
indicators to be included in the HCF assessment) the collaboration was not very strong.
▪ Interestingly, this issue was not recognized/highlighted by UNICEF health section stakeholders.
▪ Moreover, according to UNICEF national official, UNICEF WASH’s inputs are currently diluted
across different pillars and subsequent section teams (like communication, health, education,
etc.). As a result it is unable to lead/take independent decisions (especially related to resource
allocation to activities since the response is led by other section teams) for WASH priority areas.
3.9. Is there scope for improvement in providing IPC related support? If so, then in which areas
and how can this be improved (to fit geographical and cultural context)?
Key Findings:
▪ There is scope for improvement in providing critical supplies. According to UNICEF officials at
national level, UNICEF procedures for working at L3 level should be eased such that it allows
flexibility and autonomy to the country office to amend the support parameters and guidelines
to suit the country’s context. The official explained that “there are roles to loosen up processes
in place that's why we have L1, L2 and L3 - levels of emergency. But despite that the processes
are too complicated to responds to calamities. That is something which should be looked at
closely. If we want to be more efficient, at the country level, we have to be more flexible in terms
of kind of indicators or response work we are doing because the way indicators came and were
standardize by HQ it was felt that it was a good opportunity. And the recommendation is that
country office should have flexibility to tweak the indicator language, because once you do that
it gives state colleagues a scope to report back. I feel that the indicators needs to be bit more
flexible.” Another UNICEF national level official stated that “At present, UNICEF systems are not
at all responsive to respond to pandemics. Our internal system are not conducive to
partnerships.”
▪ According to UNICEF UP whereas on one hand UNICEF response has shown achievements in
advocacy, procurement of critical supplies, support in formulation of guidelines, capacity
building, supportive supervision and monitoring; on the other hand there are areas, for
example, internal processes which can be improved to reduce the internal processing time and
improve turnaround time to provide support.

UNICEF's extensive reporting was communicated as a barrier. One
of the national level stakeholder explained Our reporting

platform. Excessive reporting is happening. One has to be realistic

There is no mechanism in place to capture the exact reach of
UNICEF's support and interventions. Moreover, according to
some officials, in the absence of a structure platform, double
counting (of community members and people provided with
supplies and services) was being done. The monitoring
mechanism also lacked in capturing whether the community
members were provided with supplies only once or on
regular/continuous basis.

KEQ-2: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE INTENDED OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF UNICEF’S
RESPONSE ACHIEVED IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER BENEFITING VULNERABLE POPULATION?
4.2. In what ways has UNICEF’s COVID-19 response was effective in addressing the current
needs? How the bottlenecks are identified and addressed to achieve the outcomes
equitably for the vulnerable population?
Key Findings:
▪ UNICEF’s internal assessment data indicates that out of three output indicators, the target of
two indicator (Number of
people reached with critical)
has already been achieved
while the remaining one is
on track. These numbers are
just estimations and does
not represent actual reach.
▪ According to majority
respondents, UNICEF’s
response w.r.t. IPC was ‘highly effective’ (on a scale of highly effective, partially effective and
less effective). For example, the CSO partners in Jharkhand and Bihar opined that UNICEF’s
357
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
response met the needs of target population as well as of service providers. According to a
CSO partner in WB, frontline workers and healthcare workers were most vulnerable during
the pandemic. And it was UNICEF’s support which helped build their capacity and informed
them about latest information. Additionally, UNICEF was able to provide supplies (such as
PPEs, diagnostic test kits, oxygen concentrators, hand washing stations, soaps, oxy meters,
etc.) at both HCF and community level.
▪ According to government officials and CSO partners across all 5 states there was no
duplication in terms of IPC related activities in states. A block official in Jharkhand explained
that even though WHO and UNICEF both were providing support w.r.t. IPC activities (like
trainings) in states, there was no gap or overlap. This is primarily because, according to him,
the roles of both organizations were clearly established.
▪ A UNICEF national level official also emphasized the fact that the demand was so huge that
there was no scope of duplication or overlap. According to the national level official, every
organizations’ support and contribution towards resources was very important to meet the
demand and provide the support on continuous basis.
▪ However, according to some respondents, UNICEF’s response was ‘partially effective’. For
example, a UNICEF national level stakeholder opined that UNICEF did not effectively utilize
100% of its capacity. Rather it has only used 60% resources to fight the crisis. This is primarily
because the other 40% resources were not equipped (technically, lack of readily available funds
to provide direct supply, etc.) to effectively contribute. However, according to the UNICEF
national level official, the 60% resources which were at work performed with 100% efficiency.
“We could have reach 100 % people but we did not. Out of 100% of our capacity we could do
60% because the other 40% was not equipped to help whether technically or the HR or lack of
funds to directly supply the material. But could we have done better with that 60%? No. Their
efficiency was 100%. With overall restrictions - we could only put 60% of our capacity at work.”
▪ In the absence of a systematic monitoring mechanism to provide real-time evidence of
UNICEF’s COVID 19 response, the RapidPro assessments have contributed to certain extent in
gaining understanding of the on-ground status in terms of reach of UNICEF’s response. Some
of the key results are as follows:
▪ Maharashtra (June 8, 2020 to September 13, 2020)
▪ Uttar Pradesh (10 June 2020)
358
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
▪ The Rapid Assessment in West Bengal revealed the following:
✓ Similarly, the rapid assessment results from UNICEF Jharkhand highlighted its achievements
in achieving intended outputs. For example, the report indicated that between July and
September 2020, a total 3500 Jalsahiyas were trained in UNICEF supported districts. In
addition to the training, refresher training of 825 Jalsahiyas was done in the month of August,
2020 on IPC towards hand washing, safe handling of drinking water maintaining physical
distancing while fetching drinking water. Moreover a total of 125 COVID sensitive hand
washing units were installed in health facilities with support from UNICEF (Orbia funds) in two
districts.
KEQ-3: What unintended outcomes are realised that need to be reinforced or mitigated?
4.3. What are the positive and negative unintended outcomes of the IPC pillar? What is the
plan for reinforcement and mitigation of the unintended outcomes respectively?
Key Findings:
▪ No negative unintended outcomes were communicated by the UNICEF Officials at state and
national level. Rather, they informed that UNICEF WASH was trying to expand its support in
urban pockets. This pandemic has given them the opportunity to do so and has rather
accelerated intervention and partnerships in this direction.
▪ UNICEF WASH officials at national and state level opined that the pandemic has given a major
boost to hand hygiene – an area which UNICEF was advocating with the government to
promote under SBM 2.0 and JJM. According to them hand hygiene and hand washing behavior
should remain in the limelight in the post-COVID era and this pandemic has given them an
opportunity to convince the government to allocate more funds, infrastructure and facilities
which will bring about behavioral change in the hand hygiene behavior of the people – a
critical component of WASH.

KEQ-4: How well is UNICEF’s response coordinated?
4.4. How UNICEF coordinates across sectors (multi-sectoral convergence) and its field offices
and implementing partners for smooth collaboration?
Key Findings:
▪ According to UNICEF officials across all 5 states, UNICEF’s coordination mechanism is well
established. Internally, UNICEF section teams communicate through meetings on fortnightly
or monthly basis. Both sections have internal focal points who undertake the coordination for
their area, both with government and other partners, with the UNICEF state offices, SNPs,
Health, Education and SBCC. Externally, UNICEF largely communicates and coordinates
through channels such as regular/fortnightly/monthly meeting with state officials, emails, and
demand letters communicating the requirement, telephonic calls and WhatsApp. These
meetings were also conducted on fortnightly basis earlier and later on monthly basis. In these
meetings they discussed about the areas where UNICEF’s assistance was required (such as
providing health supplies, undertaking assessments, providing WASH supplies, etc.)
▪ Both Health and WASH sections within UNICEF have their respective line ministries to work
with – Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the line ministry for UNICEF Health, while
UNICEF WASH closely works with Ministry of Jal Shakti, Ministry of Education, Ministry of
Panchayati Raj Institution and Ministry of Urban Development. The roles and responsibilities
are divided based on which line ministry UNICEF is working with and the area of responsibility.
While Health team externally coordinated for the procurement of health related critical
supplies on the request of the Ministry, the WASH team does not procure for the Ministry and
instead provide technical assistance. They coordinate in terms of in-kind support of private
sector but do not necessarily do a lot of procurement, with the exception of providing
handwashing stations and hygiene materials through procurement at the state-level and local-
level since it was easier to source material locally due to the lockdown.
UNICEF WASH often coordinated externally while providing technical assistance in terms of
establishing guidelines, SOPs, training materials about how the sanitation works is to be done,
how to protect sanitation workers, how the contaminated sanitary products (gloves, masks,
clothes etc.) should be properly handled, etc.
▪ At state-level there is direct communication between WASH and Health section teams. In case
of conflict national level WASH/Health teams are approached who mediate the issue by
communicating with national counterpart.
▪ A need for improved internal convergence between UNICEF Health and WASH sections at
national level was highlighted. One of the UNICEF WASH section officials at national level
opined that there is a need for improved convergence between the two section teams. For
example, improved convergence to identify common priority areas under IPC. This was
seconded by a CSO partner who communicated that since many departments (UNICEF and
government) are involved in IPC response, it often results in one department prioritizing one
aspect while the other prioritizing another, and vice-versa. This reduces the clarity about
priority areas, restricts optimal utilization of resources and affects efficiency of response.
Hence increased convergence among UNICEF departments/teams is recommended.
▪ According to a UNICEF national level official, recently, UNICEF WASH has been closely
communicating and coordinating its response with Health team to divide and document roles
and responsibilities, contributing towards streamlining the support. For example, the
procurement for oximeters, vaccines, PPEs for health workers will be led and coordinated by
360
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
the Health team, while the procurement of soaps, sanitizers is led by the WASH team.
▪ In Maharashtra, platforms like Jeevanrath came in handy to coordinate the response. This
platform enabled the organizations and partners to upload the information about their work
w.r.t. COVID-19 and hence helped in keeping up with who is doing what, such that duplication
could be avoided.
▪ In UP, control rooms played a very important role in coordinating the response. UNICEF state
official informed that they would conduct regular meetings (called control room meetings)
with AECS to discuss the demand/requirements of the government. In these meetings they
would draw up a plan of action and share the same with the government. For example,
guidelines, training modules, etc. were developed as part of these meetings.

and community level staff, promote CAB w.r.t. IPC such as hand hygiene and provide services
and supplies tailored to suit the local context.
▪ The response was relevant and highly effective in catering to the states’ needs in terms of
providing technical assistance (in conducting assessments, facilitating supplies – especially
heath specific critical supplies including PPEs and oxymeters, providing inputs in/conducting
trainings, and providing inputs in communication/IEC material such as awareness videos) and
providing in-kind resources (like soaps). In doing so, UNICEF leveraged existing and new
partnerships (wherein it deployed local networks of FLWs and resources of partners/service
providers). Moreover, UNICEF’s adaptive capacity (e.g. continue adapting guidelines and
reorienting people, adoption of virtual mean of service delivery, development of online
system to track migrants) to provide relevant and effective support to the government has
strengthened the overall response.
▪ However, there is a lack of real time monitoring mechanism to understand whether the
support provided by UNICEF was relevant, effective and adequate in nature which restricted
potential changes or improvement in the response to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
Also, UNICEF’s internal reporting system does not capture any disaggregated level data
(gender, vulnerable population, etc.) which makes it difficult to track the reach of services
and supply among the vulnerable population. Additionally, the absence of a real-time
beneficiary/local service provider feedback mechanism does not allow UNICEF to align its
advocacy with the nuances of on-ground/implementation activities carried out by partner
agencies.
▪ The response brought forth internal as well as external gaps. Internally, there was a need for
improved convergence between UNICEF’s Health and WASH teams w.r.t. identification of
priority areas which affected efficiency of the overall response. Furthermore, the design did
not allow to amend the assessment and monitoring parameters (like common indicators) to
understand whether the on-ground activities are being captured efficiently. The response
also brought forth disadvantages of UNICEF’s internal (time consuming) processes (like
processing of requests from the government, auditing for quality assurance and giving
approval to the donors to release supply, on-boarding a new partner, etc.) which has
negatively affected UNICEF’s responsiveness.
▪ Apart from that, externally, there were lacks in provision of critical supplies during the onset
of the pandemic due to the national lockdown. These however were resolved once the
restrictions on movement were lifted. The lockdown period was also difficult in terms of
providing trainings through online platforms since there was no mechanism in place to assess
the quality of trainings and participant’s understanding. Hence, it is imperative that a more
coordinated and informed approach be adopted with better supportive internal processes,
to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of response plan.
▪ Despite the shortfalls, UNICEF with its unique yet strong position to support the government,
has been able to execute the response plan in a timely and efficient manner ensuring capacity
building (of FLWs/service providers/partners) as well as supporting the provision of essential
services and critical supplies to the vulnerable target population during the crisis.

▪ UNICEF WASH’s inputs are currently diluted across different pillars and subsequent section
.6
teams (like communication, health, education, etc.). As a result it is unable to lead/take
independent decisions (especially related to resource allocation to activities since the
response is led by other section teams) for WASH priority areas. Hence, UNICEF WASH should
be given lead/more autonomy to provide more efficient support.
▪ UNICEF should work towards tweaking/easing its internal processes (such as on-boarding new
partner, mobilizing resources from local vendor at state level). UNICEF has different way of
responding to different levels of emergencies – L1, L2 and L3. It has established mechanism
and roles in place to loosen up the processes depending upon the level of emergency. These
mechanisms should be revisited and amended (if need be) to ease the internal processes (and
time it takes) to improve the efficiency of the response.
▪ UNICEF can introduce a layered auditing and quality assurance compliance protocols for
various essential supplies. For example, it can have extensive auditing and quality assurance
for supplies like oxygen concentrates or PPEs (or pharmaceutical related supplies) but less
exhaustive audit and quality assurance procedures for supplies like soaps, especially while
partnering with big and renowned donor companies working at national level. This will help in
increasing the turnaround time of providing support and reducing donor fatigue throughout
the process.
▪ UNICEF should increase its field/on-ground presence (through local level partnerships at state
level or linkages with communities via its local networks in states, and establishing feedback
mechanisms, institutionalizing and scaling up state level partnerships) such that it can be more
aware about the practicality around implementation of different activities, way of working of
partner agencies and donor priorities. This will help UNICEF to advocate with the government
in an improved and more relevant manner.
▪ In the absence of real-time monitoring mechanism, a community-based feedback mechanism
can be used in an institutionalized manner (wherein monthly/quarterly rapid assessments are
undertaken with some common denominators assessed across all states) to understand the
relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response w.r.t. IPC.
▪ A quick quality assessment or recall test can be introduced to assess the quality of virtual
trainings being imparted. This will also help UNICEF in understanding whether the participants
were actively involved during the training session and were able to grasp what was being
informed.
▪ There should be more flexibility around HPM indicators in monitoring mechanism at global
level. UNICEF India office should have more autonomy to amend the HPM indicators based on
global guidelines such that it can better capture the priority areas based on country’s context.
For example, if UNICEF country office wants to incorporate more parameters to capture hand
hygiene (to assess hand hygiene behavior) in its HPM indicators, then it should have the power
363
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
to tweak the language and parameters of indicator to make them more relevant. Moreover,
in case if a certain indicator is not useful for capturing the Indian context, then the country
office should have the autonomy to remove the same. At national/state level UNICEF should
also plan its assessments such that different assessments (intra-state as well as inter-state)
have some common denominators to ease the process of aggregating the findings and
drawing actionable conclusions at state and national level.
▪ UNICEF should reduce its current reporting structures/portals to only 1. Reporting same
information across various portals consumes additional time and resources. There should be
only 1 portal/platform for all state specific reporting.
▪ Enormous amount of resources were spent in procuring health supplies by UNICEF health
section, however its role was limited in dissemination of supply since it was routed through
the national government. Therefore it is also important for UNICEF health section to advocate
and develop a strategy plan for the supply and dissemination along with the government to
ensure that provided supplies were distributed as per the needs of state and reached on time.
▪ Hand hygiene and hand washing behavior is a major focus area of SBM 2.0 and JJM. The
pandemic has pushed hand hygiene and hand washing behavior into the limelight. UNICEF
should hold on to this opportunity and focus on advocating more with the ministry to allocate
funds and promote good hand hygiene behavior in future.
▪ In terms of ongoing and current situation, UNICEF Health should come forward to play an
active role and converge with UNICEF communication team to fight the misinformation
around COVID vaccine and promote its benefits. This will help the government to seek
voluntary participation (to be vaccinated) from the people. At the same time, UNICEF WASH
should converge with UNICEF communication team to promote continuous use of CAB. Due
to message fatigue, people have become relaxed and do not use masks or maintain social
distancing. UNICEF WASH can contribute towards developing new strategies to promote IPC
behavior.

365
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Introduction:
• UNICEF India, as a part of the COVID-19 Joint Response Plan (JRP), provides support to the Government of
India in its efforts to contain the spread, mitigate the risks and strengthen the management of COVID-19.
In doing so, UNICEF has adopted a multi-sectoral approach, which focuses on six pillars, including,
supporting the provision of continued access to essential health and nutrition services (Pillar 3).
• IPE Global conducted a real-time evaluation of the Pillar-3 to understand the relevance, coverage,
effectiveness, sustainability and efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response with regard to continuity of
essential Health (Routine immunization, promotion of institutional delivery services, care of sick new-
borns and essential new-born care) and Nutrition (Complementary feeding, SAM Management and IFA
supplementation to pregnant women and adolescent girls) services.
• The objectives of the evaluation were to:
- Assess the relevance, coverage, efficiency, sustainability and effectiveness of UNICEF India’s COVID-
19 response
- Identify challenges and bottlenecks in the support provided towards service delivery and suggest
recommendations for immediate improvement
- Involve partners, stakeholders and community members in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure
it is more participatory and responsive to needs on the ground
- Identify and fill gaps in evidence generation; collect data for future evaluation of UNICEF’s response
• The Continuity of Health and nutrition services pillar was examined at the state level to understand the
needs and responses in different contexts. Five states were covered: Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttar
Pradesh (UP) and West Bengal (WB).
• The evaluation covered the period from the start of the pandemic (March 2020) to January 2022.
Methodology:
To evaluate UNICEF India’s COVID-19 response (for Pillar 3 of the Response Plan), IPE Global Limited adopted
a qualitative analysis approach. An Analytical Framework was developed to guide the evaluation of Pillar 3
(Annexure 3). Both secondary and primary data (Key informants interviews) were analyzed to evaluate the
relevance, coverage, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response.
IPE Global undertook an extensive desk review of the documents (Annexure 1) shared by UNICEF (health and
nutrition section teams). In addition to this, IPE Global also undertook an ‘Activity Mapping’ exercise to
understand the state-specific situation, activities and support provided by UNICEF. For this purpose, State
Level (weekly, biweekly, fortnightly and monthly) updates (April 2020 – August 2021) were studied extensively
to understand how UNICEF’s support progressed since the beginning of the pandemic, to ensure continuity of
the essential health and nutrition services.
Further, Key Informant Interviews were undertaken with respondents across 5 intervention states (Interviews
with UNICEF officials at the state level (10), Interviews with state government officials (10), civil society
organization (CSO) partners (10), and district/block level stakeholders (14)) to understand their perceptions
and opinions about the relevance, coverage, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of UNICEF India’s
COVID-19 response.
Information from both primary and secondary data were triangulated to synthesize the Key Findings and
produce recommendations.
Limitations:

o The reports and documents (such as state booklets, Nutrition Program Strategy note, etc.) studied for
this evaluation largely pertained for the period starting from March 2020 to May 2021 (May 2021
being considered as the cut-off date for the desk review).
o There were very few nutrition reports which informed about the coverage of essential nutrition
services, how and when these services were resumed and what challenges were faced by UNICEF,
especially during the second COVID-19 wave (February – April 2021).

Situational Analysis:
The Corona Virus Disease struck India at the end of January 2020, with the first case being reported in Kerala,
which led to a National Lockdown from 23rd March to 31st May 2020. As a result of the National Lockdown, all
the key RMNCH+A services came to an abrupt halt. Compared to services in 2019, there was a significant gap
in the rollout of services.
The number of pregnant women that received 4 or more Antenatal Care (ANC) check-ups in India reduced by
more than 40% in April 2020 compared to the pre-lockdown period (Jan 20 - March 20). Home Based Newborn
Care (HBNC) check-ups for newborns in
case of home deliveries were reduced by RMNCH+A Services

imposed. The number of women that
received the full course of calcium
supplements reduced by 40 % during the first lockdown. First doses of Vitamin A supplements provided to
children were reduced by 95%. 78
Both demand and supply factors affected the rollout of services. Government and private hospitals refused
non- COVID services during lockdown; police restricted movement on roads and Front Line Workers (FLWs)
were fearful of facing patients and were engaged in COVID-19 response due to which they were unable to do
outreach sessions. Community members were also reluctant to visit health facilities due to the fear of
contracting the virus.79

and community members such as tele-health, immunization and ANC sessions with a fewer number of
community members and increasing the number of outreach sessions and home visits by ASHAs. Village Health
& Nutrition Day/ Urban Health & Nutrition Day (VHND) sessions were permitted with a limited number of
community members attending in allotted times.80 In May 2020, these guidelines were revised, and services
were permitted in green zones & buffer zones which were areas surrounding the containment zones. 81 On
31st May 2020, the lockdown was lifted in 6 unlock phases until 30th November. All RMCNH+A services were
provided in the unlock phases in buffer zones.
In April & May 2021, RMNCH+A services were disrupted again after the outbreak of Delta Variant of COVID-
19 virus, due to which 35 of 36 states & UTs imposed lockdowns. But owing to the guidance note released by
the Government of India on April 14th, 2020, the services were not disrupted in the same severity as the
lockdown in March 2020.
The number of pregnant women that received 4 or more ANC check-ups decreased by 10% in May 2021
compared to March 2021. Newborns that received 6 HBNC visits in case of home deliveries and the number
of immunization sessions held, both reduced marginally in May 2021 when compared to the data in preceding
months but was almost double compared to April 2020 as the rollout of RMNCH+A services was not
discontinued for lockdown 2021.82 Although NRCs were asked to function in the guidelines released by the
Government of India (GoI) and management of SAM children was continued, admissions in NRCs remained
low.83 State specific situational analysis of essential services are available in Annexure 2.
Key Findings
Relevance:
KEQ 1: To what extent are the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response meeting
the needs of children and families at the ground level?
• UNICEF’s support was relevant in meeting the needs of children and families at the ground level as it
focused on strengthening the provision of continued access to essential health and nutrition services
through advocacy (developing guidance notes for re-establishment of essential services, SAM
management, advocating for leveraging alternative channels to support continuity of services, etc.),
monitoring (outreach camps, immunization sessions held, labor rooms, etc.), training and capacity building
(training of medical officers, Anganwadi, ASHA, ANMs, labor room staff, SAM management staff, etc.),
technical assistance towards developing of guidelines and SoPs (standard operating procedures for the
health care providers, COVID Appropriate Behavior (CAB) guidelines for the healthcare providers, infant
and young child feeding, SAM community management, etc.) mobilizing and leveraging partnerships to
mobilize resources (for example, UNICEF (Nutrition) in Bihar mobilized development partners to identify
and undertake combined advocacy for priority activities), and system strengthening (such as supply and
procurement of cold-chain storage, quality of care, etc.).
• Essential Health and Nutrition services were compromised during the initial months of the pandemic in
2020. One of the UNICEF officials (Nutrition) explained that “When COVID-19 struck, people were clueless
and panicky and the government also introduced lockdown. All the institutions like schools and anganwadis
were closed. So all the institutional mechanisms of delivering services were not available except for the
Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers because those were like treatment facilities for children with severe
acute malnutrition, and those were sporadically open, but subsequently, they were converted to COVID

isolation centers. So institutional mechanism of delivering nutrition, services were greatly impacted.”
Community-level outreach services were temporarily stopped during the first lockdown and facility-based
services were also compromised to a large extent. Both supply and demand were affected, with service
providers fearful of facing patients while also being engaged in COVID-19 duties. Community members were
also afraid to visit health facilities. Many were unable to access services due to the unavailability of transport.
The cessation of services during lockdown affected immunization, institutional deliveries and coverage of
other essential services, with serious repercussions on maternal and child health. There has, also, been an
increase in maternal and neonatal deaths in some districts compared to the same period in the previous year
(WB State Booklet, pp. 09).
• UNICEF was quick to recalibrate and advocated for the re-establishment of essential health and nutrition
services following the lockdown at state and national levels. For instance, national technical guidelines on
immunization and Reproductive, Maternal, New-born, Child and Adolescent Health and Nutrition
(RMNCAH+N) including HIV/AIDS testing, tracking and management were drafted by MoHFW with
contributions from partners including UNICEF, leading to the partial resumption of services. Following this,
GoI announced the initiation of early identification and treatment of children with acute malnutrition
(SAM and MAM) as a priority action (UNICEF National Booklet, pp. 26.)
• According to the stakeholders (State, district and block level government officials, CSO and implementing
partners), the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response were ‘relevant’ in
meeting the needs of children and families at the ground level. For instance, a district level stakeholder in
Jharkhand opined that “Yes, UNICEF’s support was in line with the needs of children and the most
marginalized families. It was through UNICEF’s support that supply and procurement of essential supplies
could be met since there was a shortage of some instruments in labor rooms. Moreover, UNICEF’s support
contributed towards cold chain strengthening as they did regular training for cold chain handlers and also
on effective vaccine management. They also supported in care of sick newborns – for instance, when
children were not coming to Malnutrition Treatment Centers (MTCs), they regularly went to the field to
motivate AWWs or Sahiyas to bring them to MTCs. They have similarly focused on institutional deliveries
as well. So definitely it met the needs of children and marginalized on the ground.”
Similarly, a state-level government official in Jharkhand explained, “it is highly relevant because UNICEF
developed and implemented community-based management of severe acute malnutrition, which is a need of
the day because with the COVID 19 situation there was a need of a home management system which is self-
sustainable and also acceptable to the community so that children with this severe acute malnutrition can be
treated at home and not be debarred from the family.”
• With the COVID-19 outbreak, the importance of creating Real-Time Data Management (RTM) systems that
are resilient to emergencies became critical. UNICEF supported the piloting and deployment of several
modelling tools which were snowballed to the states. These tools were used by the states for planning
and forecasting the use of commodities and resources for the COVID-19 response. For instance, in Uttar
Pradesh, using Open Data Kit (ODF) and Management Information Systems (MIS) data, 3,135,826 migrants
were line listed and counselled on the preventive measures and quarantine protocols and subsequently
linked to the COVID-19 surveillance system. 8,414 migrants with symptoms of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI)
and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) were identified. (UNICEF National booklet, pp. 22)
• Moreover, UNICEF also supported the restoration of vitamin A supplementation round in 11 states
(including the 5 evaluation states). Following the continued efforts of UNICEF, the Ministry of Women and
Child Development issued the operational guidance in November 2020 with the directive on the national
restoration of Anganwadi services. Recognizing the importance of nutritional services, national and state-
370

Evaluation Report
level guidelines were released by the government to resume operations safely. The guidance informed
states to restore essential nutrition services including supplementary nutrition, growth monitoring,
counselling and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services.(UNICEF National booklet, pp. 27)
KEQ 2: To what extent is the structure of UNICEF's response plan (pillar-wise) relevant in effectively
providing COVID-19 support?
• All UNICEF officials across 5 states opined that the current structure of the response plan is relevant in
providing COVID-19 support. UNICEF officials explained that the current COVID-times called for a multi-
thematic approach and hence a collaboration across sectors was a prerequisite to addressing the
pandemic. “I believe it is relevant. COVID-19 response is a multi-sectoral responsibility. Since we are
supporting both preventive and curative aspects of the support services, without the collaborative effort
of all the departments, this would not have been possible.”
Coverage
KEQ 3: Who are the most marginalized and vulnerable being covered under this pillar and how are they
being reached? What were some of the challenges, if any?
• Stakeholders across the 5 states highlighted the following groups or sections of the population as most
vulnerable and marginalized w.r.t. essential health and nutrition services:
• In Bihar, the respondents (state, district and block level government officials, CSO partners) informed that
migrants, Maha Dalits and those living near the border are most vulnerable. For instance, a district-level
respondent informed that “outreach in hilly and border areas is weak because of poor infrastructure and
facilities and hence people living in those areas are most marginalized.”
• In Jharkhand, the tribal population and those living in hard to reach pockets were identified as most
vulnerable. A State-level government officials explained that “population in hard to reach pockets are
considered as most vulnerable because they usually do not have access to all the health services easily.
They either have to travel a long distance or they have to climb mountains as the geographical area of
Jharkhand is not good.”
• Similarly, in Maharashtra, the tribal population, as well as those living in urban slums, were recognized as
most marginalized by the respondents (government officials at state and district level, UNICEF officials,
CSO partners) because of hard-to-reach pockets and high burden on facility-based health and nutrition
services, respectively.
• In UP, migrants were most marginalized, according to a majority of respondents. A UNICEF official
explained that “Migrant population was most marginalized and difficult to track. During the peak of the
pandemic or the waves of the pandemic, we have not been able to move to the field. So, while we do our
best to monitor remotely, it is not the same as really going out there and seeing how the interventions are
being implemented in the field. While there are systems for name-based tracking of community members,
those systems are not fully functional.”
• In West Bengal, the respondents (government officials at state, district and block level, CSO partners)
informed that adolescent girls were the most marginalized as most of them were victims of early marriage
due to the pandemic. “Children of migrant workers and teenage girls were most marginalized because the
parents think that in the COVID-19 situation they will not have to organize a feast for the people of the
village, which is a custom, so they married off their daughters. The percentage of child marriage and
pregnancy among teenagers has increased from 8-9% to 20-30%.” – CSO partner.
• No new vulnerable groups were identified in the second or third COVID-19 wave in the 5 intervention
371
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
states.
• UNICEF provided support at the state level towards the continuity of essential services to the above-
mentioned marginalized groups. For instance, in UP, migrant children and pregnant women who were
identified were referred to appropriate immunization and for institutional deliveries respectively.
Associated with these efforts included building the capacity of staff through virtual platforms. Around
158,000 Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers were trained through the blended methodology
of WhatsApp videos and tele-calling in Uttar Pradesh (National Booklet, pp 23).
• In Jharkhand, a UNICEF official informed that “During the first wave there was a lot of migration and we
tried to map all the migratory population with some data which was available with government and they
were put in the quarantine facilities once they came to Jharkhand. UNICEF connected these quarantine
facilities with nearby health facilities. Medical officers and nurses were trained to go to those facilities and
inquire about pregnant women and children under 5. People in quarantine were also informed about
nearby health facilities where they can access vaccination services or delivery services.”
• No major challenges were explicitly highlighted by the stakeholder in reaching these vulnerable groups.
KEQ 4: Was support for RMNCHA during COVID-19 accessible to vulnerable populations (including newborn
children, young children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, SAM children, migrant children, etc.)?
• At an overall level, UNICEF's support towards continuity of essential health and nutrition services was
reachable and accessible to target vulnerable populations. For instance, the secondary literature
informed:
• 1.48 million Healthcare providers trained in detecting, referral and appropriate management of COVID-19
cases (Brochure – A journey through 2020, pp. 8)
• 19.7 million children and women received essential healthcare, including prenatal, delivery and postnatal
care, essential new-born care, immunization, treatment of childhood illnesses and HIV care in UNICEF
supported facilities (Brochure – A journey through 2020, pp. 8)
• 102,400 children (6-59 months) admitted for treatment of SAM (Brochure – A journey through 2020, pp.
8)
• 1.3 million Health functionaries had been oriented through online training and programs. They were
instrumental in working towards implementing national and state-level plans at the ground level (Brochure
– New Approaches, pp. 1).
• Similarly, at the state level, UNICEF has been reaching the target vulnerable population. For instance:
• In Maharashtra, a total of 1,532 children less than 2 years were immunized through 43 outreach camps
organized by Doctors For You (DFY) between 15 July and 15 September 2020 (Maharashtra State Booklet,
pp 09)
• In UP, 14,531 migrant children below two years were identified and linked with immunization services.
502 pregnant women identified and linked with ANC (Antenatal Care) and delivery care (State Booklet, pp
04)
• The data that is available in public domain as well as government data sources informed UNICEF about the
reach and coverage of various essential services. A UNICEF official in UP explained “UNICEF does not
implement any program on its own. These are government programs that the government functionaries
delivered, and we provide technical assistance. So, in that sense, whenever a government program is
reaching the beneficiary is, we assume that the UNICEF responses also reach the end-user or the
372
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
community members.”
Similarly, in WB, UNICEF district monitors in High Priority Districts (HPDs), collected information on RMNCH+A
services from facilities and community level through onsite visits, telephonic interviews and from secondary
data to understand the status of RMNCH+A services and activities, to identify the major gaps and challenges
and give appropriate feedback at different levels. (WB State Booklet, pp 12)
• UNICEF officials informed that since UNICEF does not directly implement any government programs, it is
not involved in collecting sex and age segregated data. However, it supports the government in the
implementation of various activities and therefore, supports in concurrent monitoring of such data sets.
• UNICEF officials across 5 states informed that no new mechanisms were put in place to expand the reach
and coverage during the second and the third COVID-19 wave in states because the support activities were
already at scale – “When we say expand the coverage, the thing is that it the programs are already being
implemented at scale. The guidelines, plans or monitoring mechanisms were already for the second wave.
During the first wave, for services to resume or to be back on track even to 80% of what they were pre-
pandemic, it took us almost two to three months. But during the second wave, we already had all these
systems in place. So be it the guidelines, plans or monitoring mechanisms, we had it all in place already for
the second wave.” – UNICEF Official (UP)
Efficiency
KEQ 5: To what extent is UNICEF allocating its resources (human, financial, other) optimally and equitably
to achieve its objectives and priority areas?
• According to the respondents (State level government officials, UNICEF officials at the state level and CSO
partners), the human and financial resources allocated and facilitated by UNICEF are optimal and equitable
in achieving its objectives and priority areas.
“Our work is to advocate for the rights of the children and provide Technical Support at the state level and also
in a few districts. We are not into supplies. Even during the crisis, these kinds of activities have not been allowed
to continue even from the government, and also from our internal understanding. So, therefore, if we are not
into the business of supplies, then I do not think that HR is a concern. And also financial resources because if
we are not procuring something by ourselves then for what we need financial resources.” – UNICEF official
(Nutrition)
The secondary data findings also highlight that UNICEF provided technical assistance at State, Regional and
District levels. For instance, in Bihar, Technically supported SHSB along with partners in containment of COVID-
19 in the state. A total of three senior health consultants are deployed in the State Health Society - Emergency
Cell for day to day response and management. Additionally, one senior consultant is positioned in the Patna
Regional - Response Cell in the office of Divisional Commissioner Patna for technical support in containment
of COVID-19 in urban slums (Bihar State Booklet, pp. 02).
• However, there were respondents (State level government officials, UNICEF officials and CSO partners) in
Maharashtra, Jharkhand UP and WB who strongly highlighted the need for an increased human resource
allocation to ensure that optimal TA is not only being provided in the aspirational districts but rather can
be scaled up to cover all districts. For example, one of the state-level government officials from Jharkhand
opined “I do not think that the human resources allocated by UNICEF for the rollout of its COVID-19
response activities w.r.t. continuity of Routine Immunization are sufficient. For example, currently, 24
districts are taken and UNICEF has given like 5 regional coordinators only, so it will be good if people will
be available at district level also so that they can reach till grassroots level.”
• Moreover, most of the respondents opined that UNICEF is efficiently utilizing its resources to achieve its
373
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
objectives. For instance, a CSO partner in Jharkhand elaborated that “the human and financial resources
are being used efficiently by UNICEF. One thing which is good in Jharkhand state, is most of the agencies
who work in their respective geographical location do not duplicate things. So UNICEF also does the same
thing. So UNICEF has its few districts, where they put their resources and efficiently utilize the resources.”
KEQ 6: To what extent is UNICEF managing and delivering RMNCHA during COVID-19 in a timely,
coordinated, coherent, and quality way?
• According to the stakeholders, UNICEF’s response to support continuity of essential health and nutrition
services has been timely, coordinated and coherent. For instance:
• A UNICEF official in Bihar opined that UNICEF’s support has been ‘very timely’ because “UNICEF recognized
this kind of situation much ahead than the government because government at that point of time was not
focusing on RMNCHA services, even getting guidance from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was
very difficult. But as UNICEF is an international organization and we have very close linkages with the
different UN agencies and other development partners, we had early access to technical information. It
also helped us to go to the government advocating with the limited available evidence that was first
accessible to us. So therefore we have reached out to the government with appropriate guidance, adaptive
mechanisms to support the government”
• A CSO partner in Jharkhand informed that UNICEF was quick to introduce guidelines for the continuation
of IFA supplementation for women and adolescent girls in the state. “UNICEF prepared guidelines within
a week and get it approved in the next week, so within 10 days all SOPs, guidelines and directives were
issued, so it was in a very timely manner.”
• The respondents also informed that UNICEF’s response to support continuity of essential health and
nutrition services was more efficient and timely in the second and the third COVID-19 waves as compared
with the first. This is because UNICEF, as well as government and CSOs, were more prepared in the second
and third COVID-19 waves across all 5 states.
“With prior experience from 1st wave, the response was immediate in 2nd wave. We already had a mock drill
around November’2020 & it helped a lot. Timing & quality both were maintained as we were well prepared for
the situation. Moreover, before sometime when there was hype around paediatric COVID-19 wave in news we
were well prepared for new-born care & we are continuously watching the situation.” – A block-level official in
Bihar
• UNICEF provided timely support to the government through capacity building of stakeholders including
but not limited to medical officers, healthcare providers, ANMs, ASHAs, AWW, ICDS functionaries, and
supervisors.
• These capacity building sessions focused on providing support and information about what to do and how
to do it. For instance, a UNICEF official from West Bengal informed that UNICEF supported capacity
building sessions on – “how to adopt CAB in the labor room. Also, for immunization apart from the training
on LAQSHYA, there was supervisory hands-on training through the Society of midwives. For immunization,
we have also provided cold chain training. We've also had training sessions for urban immunization and
outreach. These were hands-on face-to-face training for healthcare workers to strengthen urban health
and nutrition days or urban outreach services. For newborn care, we provided quality assurance for
capacity buildings of home base newborn childcare. All this was done to ensure that services are delivered
in a COVID-Appropriate and timely manner on the ground.”
• UNICEF, WHO and MoHFWhave built the capacities of more than 300 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
and 542,180 National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers to reach communities with information and advice
374
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
on the importance of right behavior to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection.
• The training was provided once or twice (annually). A UNICEF official in UP informed that “For
complementary feeding, we do one-time capacity building across 55 districts at the district level.
Subsequently, I would say 20% of UP’s blocks have been reached by us on SAM, complementary feeding
through our teams. One training was face to face and the rest were online, this is annual.” These training
were conducted virtually/online, especially during lockdown phases in 2020 and 2021. Some UNICEF
officials informed that off-line training was resumed during the latter half of 2021 however, with the
coming in of the third wave, UNICEF has again shifted to the online modality.
• UNICEF officials informed about using Google forms (which were shared with the participants' post-
training sessions) to assess their understanding and quality of such sessions. However, a majority of the
stakeholders opined that online training sessions were not as effective as off-line training sessions,
especially for essential health and nutrition services which involve a component of demonstration (due to
the inability to check whether the respondents are actually attending or they have simply joined the
meeting and are distracted).
KEQ 7: What role has partnership played in the efficient rollout of UNICEF's support to continuity of services
during COVID-19?
• UNICEF leveraged partnerships (both financial and non-financial) across all 5 states as well as at the
national level to promote timely delivery of its support. For instance, UNICEF (WB) partnered with West
Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF) for strengthening public health measures for COVID-19 prevention and
supporting MNCH care in urban slums (WB State Booklet, pp. 16). Similarly, a UNICEF official in Bihar
informed that UNICEF partnered with Patna Medical College and Hospital and leveraged its pre-existing
partnership with Centre for Excellence for SAM Management to support the government by disseminating
COVID-Appropriate guidelines through these channels to the ground-level staff who was directly
delivering the service.
• The state-level respondents as well as CSO partners across all 5 states opined that UNICEF has played an
active role in leveraging and facilitating partnerships to efficiently roll out its support towards continuity
of services. For example, a CSO partner in Jharkhand informed that “partnership with UNICEF has led to
increased and better responsiveness to the disruption of Nutrition services in the intervention area/state
because when an individual organization speaks about a topic or a subject, its effect is minimal. When 3 to
4 organizations come together on the same platform with the same understanding and speak, then the
effect is much more visible. UNICEF was able to do that.”
• UNICEF has a system in place to monitor the outputs of these partnerships to ensure the efficiency of its
response. For example, a UNICEF official in Bihar explained that for the ‘existing partnerships’ indicators
of performance were in place against which the outputs were assessed – “With the existing partnerships
there were like indicators of performance, for example, how many capacity development training they
could do on COVID appropriate behaviors.” However, for the new partnerships, a real-time monitoring
system was put in place – “For the new partnerships, we had a real-time monitoring system. We look at
the data and we go back to the partners if the service coverage is not improving from the previous month’s
data. That is something we continuously did. And along with this, we have a system of weekly calls with
the partners to continuously follow up on activities. To see things were moving in the right direction at the
right pace, feedback mechanism was established and also the data system through a real-time monitoring
system.”
• Moreover, the outputs of financial partnerships were measured against the set indicators while no such
system was in place for non-financial partnerships. A UNICEF official from Jharkhand explained that “For
375
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
financial partnerships, there is a document where all the deliverables and indicators are mentioned. For
non-financial partnerships, it was difficult to measure what they did in the field. We provided them
information but their work was not monitored or measured by UNICEF.”
• No challenges were highlighted by external partners (government as well as CSO across all 5 states) with
respect to the partnership with UNICEF. However, a UNICEF official in Jharkhand brought forth that due
to dearth of qualified personnel (since many people were fearful of going to the field), UNICEF and its
partners had to recruit ‘whoever they could’ which impacted the efficiency – “there was a dearth of the
required qualified personnel, if they were available, they were not ready for field job because of fear of
COVID. Due to this, we hired whoever we could, and more training was needed due to which additional
funds had to be given to NGOs to ensure recurrent training. Also, not all NGOs could hold capacity building
sessions so wherever needed UNICEF officials such as myself and our consultants trained to get the job
done decently.”
KEQ 8: What bottlenecks exist to the efficient implementation of the crisis response? How far has been
UNICEF’s strategy successful in addressing the challenges?
• Stakeholders (government, UNICEF, CSO – across all 5 states) highlighted the following bottlenecks:
Programmatic Challenges:
• Fear among the field staff, especially during the second wave, to deliver service on the ground and to
undertake household/community visits. Psychosocial support training was provided to overcome this
hurdle, but, according to the respondents, the coverage did not improve during the peak of COVID-19
wave(s) – “Major challenge was breaking of outreach services, VHND services, RI & pregnant women
vaccination. Left out numbers were increasing & the major reason was fear of staff for going in the field.
Psychosocial training was organized for it which lessens the hamper. In my view it must be continued as it
boosts the efficiency of our staff.” – Block official, Bihar
• Lack of understanding the ramifications of not focusing on RMNCHA services – “those who are at the helm
of affairs if they have not understood the ramifications of this, they have not prioritized this particular
activity during the period of COVID-19. I think that has been the significant gap, although UNICEF at the
national level, other development agencies like BMGF and others at the national level, have always
highlighted this to the government and departments. Similarly, we have also continued to highlight at the
state level.” – UNICEF official, Bihar
• More focus on COVID-19 vaccinations as compared to Routine Immunization – “The major challenge was
increased focus on COVID-19 vaccinations that has lowered the efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response
with respect to Routine Immunization as most of the people were busy with the vaccination duties. 5-6%
of more coverage could have been achieved if Medical Officers and people were not engaged with COVID-
19 vaccination duties.” – State official, Jharkhand
• A UNICEF official in WB expressed concern about nutrition not being prioritized by the government –
“Nutrition does not get the priority which it should, Anganwadi centers are still closed. Also, we need to
look at what will be the challenges after the pandemic is over. If we compare data from 2020 to 2021,
children are not getting complementary feeding etc. I think the political environment in West Bengal is also
an issue due to which Anganwadi centers are still closed. We have also not been able to monitor our
response.”
• Loss of jobs/employment and subsequent loss of income has resulted in nutritional deficiency among
newborns. Despite UNICEF’s efforts towards spreading awareness for complementary feeding, if the
family does not have money to purchase food, then UNICEF’s advocacy is not relevant/effective.
376
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• Additional responsibilities on the ground-level staff have resulted in a capacity burnout – “double burden
on a health worker is another challenge. They go out for COVID-19 vaccinations, and they are also
responsible for maintaining routine services.”- UNICEF Jharkhand
Internal Challenges:
• Time-consuming lengthy procedure and due diligence for seeking UNICEF’s approval on various activities
during the emergencies – “UNICEF takes a lot of time for giving approval and clearing proposals in such
emergencies where a quick action and response should be made.” – CSO, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.
• Lack of human resources with required technical knowledge to support the continuity of essential services
in states.
Effectiveness
KEQ 9: How and to what extent is UNICEF adapting its activities to become more effective based on emerging
learnings and the changing COVID-19 context?
• Many respondents opined that UNICEF adapted its activities to become more effective based on emerging
learnings and the changing COVID-19 context. For instance, a block-level official in Bihar explained that
during the first COVID-19 wave there was a complete lockdown and all activities were halted. However,
during the second wave, field activities and other activities like training were continued through digital
platforms to ensure delivery of essential services – “Adaptation of digital platform to ensure that, unlike
the first COVID-19 wave, services are not completely halted during the second COVID-19 wave.”
• Similarly, a UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that “UNICEF has that scope to allow flexibility into
the programming with respect to the current scenarios. The mandate given to UNICEF in Maharashtra is
to support tribal immunization because but when we realize that urban population is an issue for
Maharashtra, UNICEF allowed us to support that. We have the liberty to choose the geography to program
in. there are macro guidelines on how we can utilize funds thematically but we are not tied up.”
• In UP, UNICEF officials informed that between COVID-19 waves two and three, UNICEF was supporting
offline training. To ensure that the training and services do not get disrupted, they prepared an online
training module to support training for the facility-based newborn care, as a backup – “COVID-19 cases
can surge anytime, so immediately after the 2nd wave, we developed an online module for the facility-
based newborn care training. Although it is ideal to conduct skill-based training face-to-face but to avoid
any disruption, we prepared an online module as a backup. So I would say that we are learning with each
COVID-19 wave and we are adapting ourselves accordingly.”
KEQ 10: To what extent are the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response achieved in an
equitable manner benefiting vulnerable populations?
• The respondents opined that the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response were achieved to
a major extent benefitting the vulnerable population. For example, a CSO partner in Jharkhand explained
that the Home Based Delivery mechanism introduced by UNICEF effectively met the needs of the most
marginalized during the pandemic – “Home Based Delivery was the most effective activity that has
effectively met the needs of the most marginalized in the intervention area/state and ensured that services
continued to be delivered. Because that was a very unique strategy because it ensured that services like
Complementary feeding, and IFA supplementation to pregnant women and adolescent girls in the
intervention area/state continued in some form or another as dry ration was distributed to them. Home-
cooked hot meals were being provided to children without any interruption/disruption because the field
377
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
staff and FLWs were capacitated to counsel and guide people regarding this.”
• Many government officials at the state and district level across all 5 states opined that the UNICEF’s
support towards strengthening the capacities of the facility, institutional and community level staff has
immensely contributed towards achieving intended outputs and outcomes. For instance, a state-level
government official in WB informed that “The capacity building and training imparted by UNICEF was the
most effective as they provided quality training, frequently. Moreover, UNICEF adapted the content of
these sessions to ensure that relevant information is communicated. Through that people knew what has
to be done in a COVID-appropriate manner to ensure service-continuity for the vulnerable population”
• UNICEF officials across 5 states informed that HMIS data was used to identify vulnerable
population/pockets in a state as well as to monitor different essential services; based on which UNICEF
advocates to draw the government’s attention to these people/pockets. By doing so, UNICEF attempts to
achieve the intended outputs and outcomes equitably. For instance, a UNICEF official from WB informed
that “We regularly monitor HMIS data through which we are aware of districts that require more support
and attention. This is monthly data that we receive for services like institutional delivery, routine
immunization, ante Natal care, etc. We cannot give disaggregated numbers for all population groups but
indicators such as maternal deaths we see where they are happening. And then we do focused advocacy
following which there are review meetings in which UNICEF participates. So, through our advocacy, we talk
about the most vulnerable and try to focus government's attention.”
KEQ 11: To what extent has UNICEF been effective in advocating with the government on specific gaps,
responses, and strategies?
• All respondents (government officials and UNICEF officials at the state level across all 5 states) opined that
UNICEF’s advocacy has been ‘very effective’ and ‘vital’ with the government to address specific gaps,
responses and strategies. For instance, a state-level government official in Jharkhand opined that
“UNICEF's advocacy towards ensuring continuity of SAM Management was effective in Jharkhand as
without UNICEF’s advocacy, community-based SAM Management was not possible.”
• Similarly, a UNICEF official in Bihar explained that “because the government was not in a mood to
immediately listen to us so, we started developing appropriate guidance notes for different essential
services. For example, if IFA has to be given because the schools are closed, then what could be the best
modality? So we did a lot of brainstorming and came up with draft guidance notes which were also shared
with other development partners in the state. Gradually we got in touch with the departments, and they
also recognized that the pandemic is not going away and these kinds of restrictions will also continue. As
a result of UNICEF’s advocacy, the government showed an inclination towards essential services and
discussed media reports, dropping of immunization and institutional deliveries, etc. So, when the
government also started sitting and discussing, we presented all these alternate delivery mechanisms to
them.”
• A UNICEF official in Jharkhand informed that since the pandemic the frequency of cross-sectoral meetings
was increased to ensure that all sections were aware of the on-ground situation and best practices and
could subsequently undertake more effective advocacy – “Usually we had biannual meetings but during
COVID-19 we were having weekly meetings, a lot of cross-sectoral sharing was happening at a much faster
pace than in pre-COVID times. People were sharing what's happening – for instance, if there is something
that I am trying to advocate that Jharkhand should do and if I can show that XYZ state has already done it,
it becomes much faster and more effective because it is evidence-based. It was more of like a menu of
possibilities, but depending upon the state, context, possibilities, funding resources we picked up what is
possible, what is not and of course what government approved or not. So advocacy was done in an
378

Evaluation Report
evidence-based effective manner.”
• A UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that they did not put in any ‘special efforts’ towards advocacy
since that is what they have been doing i.e. gathering evidence and producing guidelines –“We regularly
work with the government, so no special efforts were made towards increasing advocacy. The bureaucrats
are aware of the programming environment and changes in the environment. So, it takes minimum efforts
to convince decision-makers for that matter. When we told the government that the urban population
needs to be focused on, the government agreed. We have been able to leverage the support of municipal
corporations for immunization. We advocated for home-based kangaroo mothercare, and Maharashtra is
the state which came up with those guidelines in the country. So I would say that our advocacy has been
very effective.”
KEQ 12: What have been some of the unintended outcomes (positive and negative) of UNICEF’s response
that need to be either reinforced or mitigated?
• Respondents informed about the following unintended outcomes of UNICEF’s response:
Positive:
• Digital mode of communication and training has been adopted very well throughout the state by all
stakeholders and hence connectivity has increased.
• A direct link/connectivity has been established for the CSOs to be in direct touch with the government
authorities with help of UNICEF’s facilitation towards improved coordination across different
stakeholders.
Negative:
• Telephonic conversations with pregnant women to monitor their health have led to a neglect of physical
check-ups by both the caregiver and the pregnant woman as they are now avoiding coming to the health
facility, even when the risk of COVID-19/number of COVID-19 cases is/are low.
• Moreover, A CSO respondent in Jharkhand opined that the continuous monitoring of the Health and
Nutrition essential services by UNICEF should be continued to understand the gaps, areas/districts which
require more attention and focused as well as customized support.
Sustainability
KEQ 13: How has UNICEF used/leveraged its pre-existing mechanisms (partnerships and institutions) to
ensure continuity of services?
• UNICEF has leveraged pre-existing mechanisms like partnerships with medical institutions, development
partners, institutions like the Centre for Excellence, etc. to ensure continuity of services. For instance,
UNICEF in coordination with Medical colleges of Bihar (Patna Medical College and Nalanda Medical
College) and National Neonatology Forum (NNF) Bihar Chapter, conducted two rounds of training on
comprehensive newborn care services for medical officers and staff nurses of SNCU and NBSU.
• A UNICEF official in UP informed that Labor Room MIS was put in place of which the government has the
complete ownership, which according to the UNICEF official, will sustain even after the pandemic to fulfil
the existing gap in the evidence – “One is the Labor room MIS. That is something that will sustain, and that
the government now has complete ownership of, and which was a gap area, even pre-pandemic. This is a
gap area across the country, not just in UP. It has the potential of replication across other states also and
it will be very important data on the delivery care services being provided at the government institutions,
which affects not just the maternal mortality but also newborn mortality and stillbirths.”
379

Evaluation Report
• However, another UNICEF official in UP informed that no new mechanisms were created to ensure
continuity of services. Rather, work on existing programs was done in a manner to suit the COVID-19
context – “There are already predefined programs under which our services are provided. All the guidelines
are in place. All the networks like FLWs and SMNet pre-existed and have been very important assets for us.
It was only a modification of guidelines, building capacity, doing monitoring to ensure that those guidelines
were implemented in a manner which suited the current COVID-19 context.”
• A UNICEF official in Bihar opined that there is a need to strengthen the existing mechanisms, such as
Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Self-Help Groups (SHGs), which are community-led and more
permanent – “we have to think of alternate and sustainable mechanisms and that can be achieved through
empowering the Community institutions. I think there is no substitute for that for example, Panchayati Raj
institutions are permanent under our Constitution. So, if we continue to empower them, drive their focus
to these kinds of services, I think that could be a better sustainable mechanism in the delivery of services.
Social capital that has been formed through self-help groups in Bihar can be continued to be strengthened
to focus on delivering health and nutrition services. If we can continue to focus on them as a sustainable
institution, reaching to the most marginalized will become more effective in a sustainable manner.”
Recommendations:
• Service providers as well as the community members/people were scared to visit the field and facility,
respectively, during the COVID-19 waves. UNICEF should further generate awareness on the importance
of continuity of essential services and safety measures (following CAB) to ensure that people continue to
visit the facilities and the service providers do not hesitate in going to the field. (KEQ 1, 7 & 8)
• More focus is being given to COVID-19 vaccinations as compared to Routine Immunization. UNICEF should
advocate more to ensure that focus on continuity of routine immunization persists with government,
service providers and people. (KEQ 8)
• Since COVID-19 is a health emergency, the government’s focus on prioritizing nutrition is comparatively
less (as a result, Anganwadi Centers are still closed). UNICEF Nutrition section should undertake advocacy
to bring the government’s attention to nutrition under the umbrella of essential services. (KEQ 8)
• Virtual health consults have been widely leveraged during the pandemic. This has resulted in a neglect of
physical check-ups by both the patient (especially in the case of pregnant women) and service providers.
UNICEF should emphasize the importance of promoting physical check-ups during the training and
capacity building sessions. (KEQ 12)
• UNICEF should continue to monitor the HMIS data frequently to understand the real-time coverage, gaps
and achievements which could be either reinforced or mitigated. This has helped the CSO partners and
government to understand the ground situation and introduce relevant activities to support the continuity
of essential services. (KEQ 12)
• UNICEF should continue to strengthen community-based and more permanent mechanisms such as PRIs
and SHGs to ensure continuity of services – which would result in a more sustainable system
strengthening. (KEQ 13)

Institutional deliveries had increased as the lockdown in 2020 was lifted, but due to the lockdown in 2021 and
a high number of COVID-19 cases, which led to further hesitance among the community members and
engagement of FLWs in COVID-19 mitigation activities, the number dropped by more than 50% in May 2021

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 crisis in India
Key Findings – Pillar 5: Support Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection and
Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services
Introduction (Education and Child Protection):
• UNICEF India, as a part of the COVID-19 Joint Response Plan (JRP), provides support to the Government of
India in its efforts to contain the spread, mitigate the risks and strengthen the management of COVID-19.
In doing so, UNICEF has adopted a multi-sectoral approach, which focuses on six pillars, including,
Education, Child Protection and Social Protection (Pillar-5).
• IPE Global conducted a real-time evaluation of the Pillar-5 to understand the relevance, coverage,
effectiveness and efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response with regard to Education, Child Protection and
Social Protection101.
• The objectives of the evaluation were to:
- Assess the relevance, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of UNICEF India’s COVID-19 response
- Identify challenges and bottlenecks in service delivery and suggest recommendations for improvement
- Involve partners, stakeholders and community members in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure
it is more participatory and responsive to needs on the ground
- Identify and fill gaps in evidence generation; collect data for future evaluation of UNICEF’s response
• The Education, Child Protection and Social Protection pillar was examined at both the national and state
level to understand the needs and responses in different contexts. Five states were covered: Bihar,
Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.
• The evaluation covered the period from the start of the pandemic (March 2020) to May 2021.
• Both primary (key informant interviews) and secondary data (desk review) sources were used.
o The review of documents included UNICEF’s India (revised) Response Plan, COVID JRP India, Procedure
on Corporate Emergency Activation for L3, Monthly Situation Reports, Fortnightly Field Updates-State-
wise status, Summary of CrMT Meetings, rapid assessments and evaluation reports
o For Education and Child protection, key informant interviews and focus group discussions included:
• Interviews with UNICEF representatives (5 national level, 8 state level)
• Interviews with national donors/partners (2)
• Interviews with national government officials (1)
• Interviews with state government officials (12), civil society organization (CSO) partners (10), and
district/block level stakeholders (8).
101 IPE Global submitted a separate report focusing on Social Protection findings. This report only focuses on Education and Child Protection.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Key Findings (Education & Child Protection):
KEQ 1: To what extent are the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response are
relevant and in line with government needs and priorities?
• UNICEF revised the COVID-19 response plan in accordance with the emerging needs and is aligned with
government priorities for both Education and Child Protection (CP).
• Government priorities w.r.t. Education largely focused towards enabling continuity of education. UNICEF’s
support was in line with government priorities and focused on providing support towards continuity of
education through providing state-specific strategic support towards home-based learning (dissemination
of learning content via radio, TVs, etc.), preparation and mobilization of materials and content (on Diksha
portal, short videos on YouTube, Meena videos, etc.), supported unhindered Early Childhood
Development by promoting gender responsive parenting (through responsive parenting program),
preparation of materials for risk communication behavior (such as COVID Appropriate Behavior (CAB)),
developed alternative academic calendar (with NCERT), developed SoPs/guidelines for safe school
reopening and provided support towards capacitating teachers, AWW and parents for undertaking home-
based /virtual learning.
Similarly, for CP, UNICEF provided overarching support to various government departments like the
Department of Women and Child Development, Dept. of Labor & Employment, Police Department, etc. by
contributing towards monitoring and tracking children (using state-specific MIS, publically available
government data, CSO and partner reports/data) and evidence generation, case management, strengthening
the capacity of ground staff, mobilizing resources and support from its partner networks as well as advocating
and identifying ways of providing support to the vulnerable children.
• Majority of stakeholders (government, UNICEF, CSO/partners) considered UNICEF as a ‘contributing
player’ towards fulfilling the government priorities and needs w.r.t. Education and CP. For instance,
government official (Education) at national level opined that UNICEF not only highlighted the gaps and
areas which required government’s attention but also provided potential solutions – such as digital
content like Meena videos, training to the teachers, AWWs and supporting parents to promote learning
environment at home.
A UNICEF official (CP) in Jharkhand explained that UNICEF is the only agency that provided technical assistance
as well as handholding support to the state government For instance, COVID indicators were added to the
existing inspection module of the Child Care Institutes (CCIs). Virtual capacity building modules were
developed to train and capacitate the functionaries, police personnel.
• Most of the stakeholders mentioned UNICEF’s support has been ‘relevant’ in contributing towards
government priorities w.r.t. Education and Child Protection. For example, a district level official from West
Bengal explained that “in the wake of the inability to go to school, the audio and video files shared by
UNICEF are extremely helpful in making the children school ready. The learning content in these
audio/video files focuses on learning through/about materials which are easily available at household
(utensils, vegetables, etc.)”
A UNICEF (CP) official from Bihar explained that the response was relevant because UNICEF not only brought
in knowledge, information and services but also supported virtual modes of working and brought in
innovations, how to do work differently, how to continue providing services, etc.
• The response was relevant (in terms of contributing towards government priorities) across both waves.
However, UNICEF officials (Education and CP) across all 5 states believed that it was more relevant and
concrete in the second wave as compared to the first wave because they felt more confident and better
395
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
prepared during the second wave owing to the fact that the first wave gave them exposure and
understanding of the situation. For example, a state level UNICEF official (UP) explained that the “first
wave was more about understanding, assessing the situation and looking out for ways to help people in
these difficult times. But till the time wave two came in we were better prepared, we knew what the
lockdown period would look like, we had systems in place and it was more about easing the
implementation for government and looking at various roll-out mechanisms that could be suggested.”102
KEQ 2: To what extent are the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF tailored to the local
context in different states?
Education:
• UNICEF tailored its response to the local context in different states. UNICEF supported state governments
across all 5 states to develop material in the state’s local language which could be easily understood by
the children. Additionally, a UNICEF state level official from UP informed that the academic calendars have
been customized depending upon the context of the state.
• UNICEF attempted to tailor its response to meet the needs of vulnerable children across all 5 states (such
as children belonging to economically weaker sections, children with disabilities and special needs, girl
children, and children living in rural and hard to reach pockets (tribal areas). For example, a government
official at the national level informed that UNICEF has been supporting development of podcasts for
children who are blind or face difficulty in watching videos due to poor networks.
• UNICEF also attempted to provide support to children with low or no digital access through ‘Mohalla
Classes’ across all 5 states (where a teacher would gather a group of 6-10 children to teach in a local
setting). But the concept was short lived due to the coming in of the second wave.
Child Protection:
• UNICEF tailored its support to address the needs of children (including children who are (potential) victims
to child marriage, child labor and trafficking, child abuse (GBV), children on the move, refugee children
and orphaned), across all 5 states. For example, UNICEF national level official informed that state offices
provided resources (in local language) to generate awareness, identify children in need through partner
networks and patching them to CCI or state specific sponsorship services.
• While there were no new groups of the vulnerable population identified during the second wave, the
number of vulnerable children increased during the second wave. For instance, UNICEF national level
official informed of increased number of orphans needing support services due to COVID. Similarly,
UNICEF official from Jharkhand highlighted that women helpline number 181 - was used to identify
children without parental care or even those whose parents were in hospitals and there was no one to
take care of them. The helpline number, which was promoted through ads, banners and other channels,
was used by people (anyone – whether related to the child or not) to report such cases. Once identified
further support was initiated.
• In Maharashtra, the UNICEF official informed that they “worked out a system of communication with
ChildLine, particularly so people know the 1098 number. We publicize it even during the lockdown through
community posters in migrant shelters, through community radios, through AWW and other ground
personnel, including the police. So if such children were stranded anywhere, they (or anyone on behalf of
them) would contact the helpline and be provided with relevant support (ration, bringing such children to

a safe place, etc.) through the district collector’s office.”
Coverage
KEQ 3: Is UNICEF’s COVID-19 response likely to reach/are materials/services accessible to vulnerable
populations?
Education:
• The rapid assessment as well as government official at national level informed that UNICEF’s support
towards COVID-19 response was reachable and accessible to 60-70% of children in India through various
means (WhatsApp, TV, Radio, learning apps, AWW/teacher network). Moreover, UNICEF officials in UP
and Bihar reported that only 25% of children had access to continued learning.
• UNICEF official at national level informed that “there are no means in place to understand how many
children say for example have accessed learning content on TV or radio, how many children were able to
have continued access to digital content, etc. Only a little information/insight that we have about this is
through the rapid assessments. But we do not know how to improve access.”
• Post lockdown, the access was further restricted because the mobile phone is a shared commodity in
many households. As parents resume work, the availability of mobile phones has reduced. For example, a
block level official from Jharkhand highlighted that “if a household has one mobile, boy child would have
a chance to use it, over the girl child.” A CSO partner in West Bengal also brought forth that priority is given
to the education of elder siblings as compared to younger since their education is considered ‘more
important’.
• No explicit measures were undertaken by UNICEF to increase the coverage during the second wave
because the statistics and indicators were largely similar across the two waves – “the number of children
under various indicators were same across both waves. For example, in terms of school closures and the
number of potential children needing learning assistance- it’s very similar numbers. In terms of how
children are being affected from an educational point of view – the situation has largely remained similar.”
– UNICEF national level official.
• Interestingly, UNICEF collected age and sex disaggregated data (age and sex indicators are captures as part
of basic details while collecting data collection for rapid assessments) as part of a larger sample, but the
focus was to given to increase the access to continue learning irrespective of gender. A UNICEF official
from Maharashtra informed “The idea was to understand whether the children have access to learning or
not rather who has got more access (younger or older children, girl or boy children) using the age and sex
disaggregated data.”
Child Protection:
• According to the majority of stakeholders, UNICEF’s response was reaching the most of the vulnerable
population. However, UNICEF CP does not have a direct mechanism to reach vulnerable children. It relies
on available data/evidence (rapid assessments, CSO partners and limited government data available on
public portals) to understand whether the support has been made available by the government or CSO
partners to the children. A UNICEF official from Jharkhand explained that “UNICEF is not a direct
implementer. Hence, we do not have an understanding of the direct reach as such. UNICEF's role is to
understand the existing government programs and identifying the means/methods to link children to them.
We take the help of our CSO partners with the paperwork - generating a database of children who have
been linked to one or the other schemes. So that is how we come to know how many children are being
reached. Our main job is awareness generation, identification and linking those in need to the available
and appropriate government schemes through on-ground partners.”
397
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• UNICEF’s support is reaching the children through its services. For example, UNICEF provided support to
CCI to provide services to vulnerable children. A UNICEF official from UP explained that they have provided
extensive support to CCI functionaries about how to provide medical supplies, how to prevent the spread
of the virus in institutions if a child has been tested positive then how to act, how to seek medical help
and mitigate the risk it. As a result, zero deaths were reported due to COVID in CCIs. Thus reflecting
UNICEF’s support’s reach.
• UNICEF CP also collects age and sex disaggregated data (through partners, CSOs) to understand the current
reach and undertake steps to improve coverage. For example, a UNICEF official from Jharkhand explained
that “This data is utilized to understand how many children are being reached or out of these how many
are girls and boys. Say, for example, if within a scheme which is for both the genders, we see that more
number of boys are being linked than girls, then that automatically is an indicator for us that more work
needs to be done in respect to that. So as a corrective measure, we tweaked the guidelines where we added
a clause stating that a maximum of three children are to be linked and precedence will be given to the girl
child.”
Efficiency
KEQ 4: To what extent is UNICEF allocating its resources optimally and equitably to achieve its objectives
and priority areas?
Education:
• A national level UNICEF official explained that since COVID was a health emergency UNICEF’s majority
fundraising was for health and life saving services. However, in the second wave Education section did
receive more resources, internally. “The first wave was more about mobilizing resources from partners
and redirecting the existing government resources. But for us, it is not necessarily an issue of
monetary/human resources. Since the schools are closed, delivery is the main challenge – how do you best
utilize the existing resources to reach vulnerable groups?”
• UNICEF official in Bihar informed of recently receiving more funds (post informing about the requirement)
after an internal meeting with the India country office.
• UNICEF official in UP highlighted a lack of resources. “We have 30 thousand students with blindness and if
we want them to have learning access then one must provide digital devises (tablets), internet connection,
etc. The state does not have the resources to do that. We have some resources but they are not enough to
reach all children.”
Child Protection:
• Majority of UNICEF officials at the state level (across all 5 states) informed about the lack of human
resources which hindered the efficiency of UNICEF’s response to achieve its objectives. For example, a
UNICEF official in Maharashtra explained that “CP support is not so much about money. It's about having
people with know-how and the correct knowledge to guide the technical support which the government
expects from UNICEF. If we had a slightly larger team, we would have been able to work more efficiently.
Especially during the crisis, where new issues of online security, pornography and online trafficking put
children at risk – a new generation and kind of human resource is required to tackle and also provide
technical assistance to the government to tackle such issues.”
Similarly, a state level government official in Jharkhand pointed that UNICEF could have improved its efficiency
if it deployed more officials at state level to plan and support CP services. “There is only one CP official at the
time who is delivering the support to the state government in a timely manner. UNICEF’s response could have
been more efficient if there were more number of specialists working at the state level.”
398
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• A UNICEF national level official informed that the problem does not lie with the availability of resources;
rather it is to choose the right modality of implementation to reach vulnerable children. “For example, the
child marriage program – it was not a matter of people or resources, but rather, how we actually continue
our child marriage programming (which heavily relies on face to face interactions, on-ground work with
collectors), how will that be fit for purpose in a context where mobility is limited, where community groups
cannot be called upon?”
KEQ 5: To what extent is UNICEF managing and delivering its COVID-19 response in a timely, coordinated,
and quality way?
Education:
• Majority of stakeholders at the national and state level (across all 5 states) informed that the response
largely reached those who had access to continued learning, in a timely and coordinated manner. For
example, a block level official in West Bengal opined that UNICEF response was timely and coordinated
because they received the translated material (into Bengali and Alchiki) every fortnight.
• A UNICEF national level official explained that UNICEF’s support is largely conditional to government
agreement and processes, which sometimes delay the response activities – “For example, learning
material for children and training module is prepared and ready from UNICEF's end but the senior
government official has not given the approval yet, so we cannot proceed. There is going to be a delay.”
Similarly, a UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that “delays were only with respect to government
not be able to absorb as much as needed to happen in as fast time as possible. Until the government
releases a guideline for school reopening, for example, I cannot do anything because I do not know what
the right thing to do is.”
• UNICEF also provides timely support to the government through capacitating the teachers and
government officials (about CAB, how to utilize the digital means and content with the child, Mental
Health and Psychosocial Support, etc.) as well as parents (sensitizing them about GBV under responsive
parenting program) to promote distance/home-based learning across all 5 states. A block level official
from WB informed “UNICEF prepared ECCE module which they took us through during the trainings and
informed us how we can engage both parents and children in the learning activities – such as giving a cloth
to the child with multiple not to develop his/her counting skills, mind and body coordination.” The block
level official also mentioned that such training was provided twice a month during the first wave and once
a month during the second wave.
• UNICEF leveraged existing partnerships with government and CSO partners to ensure timely delivery of
the response. UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that UNICEF in partnership with Pratham
introduced books in Hindi which were used by teachers of Hindi medium schools to read out stories to
children, virtually. UNICEF in Jharkhand partnered with ICRW to introduce stories that highlighted the
concept of gender equality. Similarly, Quest Alliance is supporting UNICEF Jharkhand by providing practice
worksheets for out of school children, or those children who have limited/no access to digital content. In
Bihar, Bikramshilla supported UNICEF in redeveloping the textbooks with more child friendly and easily
understood content for children.
• UNICEF UP informed about the development of a new Consortium of CSO/NGOs being headed by Dept.
of Education for school re-opening, foundational learning, etc. UNICEF will be responsible for providing
technical support and developing the ToR of this consortium to promote improved implementation.
Child Protection:
• According to majority stakeholders (government, CSOs and UNICEF) across all 5 states, UNICEF largely
399
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
managed and delivered its support in a timely and coordinated manner. For instance, a UNICEF official
(Bihar) informed that as soon as the lockdown was announced in March 2020, UNICEF prepared and
launched the training model within 2 weeks, advocated for and prepared the guidelines for CCIs to prevent
the spread of the virus.
• UNICEF provided timely support to the government through capacity building of stakeholders involved
(such as CCI functionaries, counsellors, police personnel, juvenile justice board, Social Work members,
child welfare committee members, etc.). These capacity building sessions focused on providing support
and information about what to do and how to do – to the support personnel. For example, CCI
functionaries (across all 5 states) were trained about how to identify early symptoms amongst children,
what steps to take if a child is tested positive and how to quarantine children within the CCI.
Similarly, UNICEF national official as well as ChildLine representative informed that ChildLine staff was trained
on how to tackle distress calls, what information to provide to those in need (such as helpline numbers), how
to provide psychosocial support to the children calling them.
• UNICEF officials (Bihar and UP) however, highlighted that the response could have been more efficient
and timely towards addressing the migrant crisis – with more resources and proper ‘scenario planning’ –
“We did not anticipate this intensity of reverse migrants and that is where we struggled in providing quick
support to such huge number at the same time. So there was some delay there. It could have been much
easier if we would have done scenario planning (i.e. anticipating for the worst case) during the first wave.
We did not anticipate that the crisis would continue for so long. And hence, we were not fully prepared to
tackle such huge influx at once.” – UNICEF official (UP)
• UNICEF official in Jharkhand informed that increased number of cases (government and UNICEF
stakeholders getting infected, family members getting infected, partner volunteers working on the ground
being infected, etc.) also delayed some activities (getting approvals from government counterparts,
volunteers not able to reach children to connect them to a CCI, etc.) in the state.
• UNICEF attempted to maintain and check the quality of its training session. UNICEF national level official
informed that UNICEF conducts a pre- and post- training assessments to understand how much the
participants were able to understand. However, the majority of officials informed that the online training
sessions are not as good as face-to-face session (due to the inability to check whether the respondents
are actually attending or they have simply joined the meeting and are distracted).
• UNICEF also leveraged partnerships (largely non-financial partnerships) across all 5 states as well as at the
national level to promote timely delivery of its support. For instance, in Jharkhand, Action Aid identified
volunteers who have good spoken skills towards sympathizing people and UNICEF trained them to provide
Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) support. UNICEF official in UP informed of partnering
with NIMHANS to bring on board mental health experts who trained and guided the on-ground staff
(police personnel, social workers, counsellors, etc.) toward providing mental health support to children.
• According to UNICEF national level official, the response was more efficient during the second wave as
compared to the first wave. – “HPD (Humanitarian Program Document) that we have was approved, and
that made things easier because we had the required budget. And I think that has enabled very quick
partnerships to take place and quick response if we are properly prepared. For example, we wanted to give
ChildLine the PPE kits and that was approved immediately.”
• UNICEF’s partnership with the Judiciary helped UNICEF to deliver its response in a timely and coordinated
manner. A UNICEF national official also highlighted that the partnership with Judiciary to be ‘very
important’ because the Supreme Court (SC) was quick to consider UNICEF's advocacy and evidence to
400
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
issue judgements and orders which promoted child protection measures in the country. For example,
through UNICEF's advocacy, SC released order which allowed 60% of the children in CCIs to be released
and sent back to their homes in order to avoid a further spread of the pandemic in institutions. “Judiciary
also has passed the order on the lookout for children who have lost one or both parents. So that is a new
order which was based on some of the recommendations that UNICEF has provided.”
KEQ 6: What bottlenecks exist to efficient implementation of the crisis response? How far has been UNICEF’s
strategy successful in addressing the challenges?
• Stakeholders (government, UNICEF CSO – across all 5 states) highlighted the following bottlenecks:
Education:
Partnerships:
- A lot of time was spent looking for the right partners for partnerships who matched the required expertise
and skill set. Having partners’/consultants’ who could be immediately tapped into could have improved
the efficiency of the response.
- Many partners (including government) do not extensively share the kind of equity based approach which
UNICEF has. “Many partners and government focus on achieving short term goals. They do not understand
that if we aim at long term planning and goals, the benefit will automatically reflect in short term
goals/outputs. For instance, Dalits and disabled children are often forgotten about while designing a
program. Therefore, if we design the program in an inclusive manner, it will benefit all.” – UNICEF Official
(UP)
- A government official in West Bengal mentioned that “UNICEF is an international organization and their
decisions and budgets are fixed at a higher level and as per their global planning. They do not set goals
taking the grassroots realities of any state or district into consideration.”
Programmatic challenges:
- Low/no literacy level among parents restricts them from supporting home-based learning for children. In
some instances, parental attitude towards children’s education is not very supportive. This hinders
continued learning as children are encouraged to engage in labor/earning activities instead of studying.
- During the first wave, teachers/AWWs/CSO volunteers were not very scared of going to the field and
helping children (AWWs showing video content on their phone, teachers narrating stories using temple
mic/speakers, providing worksheets to children with no digital access, etc.) – thus enabling some local
activities for children with no access to digital content. This was discontinued in the second wave due to
the high number of cases.
- TV, Radio and other modes of virtual education only enable one-sided communication – which is not very
beneficial. This also does not enable the teachers, organizations such as UNICEF to assess whether children
are actually understanding the content or not. There is no means to capture exact learning loss.
- High teacher burnout during both waves. During the first wave, teachers were not efficient with the
technological modes of learning. This however reduced during the second wave as teachers became
comfortable with virtual teaching and started making videos as well. Overall pressure (due to health
emergency in the families, overall worsening situation in the society) resulted in high stress level in the
second wave.
No internal capacity challenges were reported.
Child Protection:
401
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Programmatic Challenges:
- Lack of human resources was more intensive in the second wave as compared to the first wave. This is
because almost every other UNICEF/Government officials and other stakeholders were infected (or their
family members were infected) which adversely affected the working capacity. Moreover, during the first
wave, people were not so scared to step out of their homes if need be (for instance, if the child is to be
placed in a foster home then someone physically has to do that). Hence there was a huge human resource
crunch to carry out response plan and subsequent activities.
- Lack of full recognition of child protection as a critical service. According to UNICEF national level official,
since the pandemic has been a health emergency, the government has not been allocating as many
resources as it should towards issues to child protection, despite UNICEF’s continuous advocacy.
- UNICEF’s response could have been more effective if it had a dedicated FLWs (like AWW and ASHA for
Education and Health activities) to work with. UNICEF CP had to depend on the Panchayat system or school
management committees or teachers or police personnel as well as personnel identified by partners to
function because there is no paid functionary by the government for CP activities.
- Absence of National MIS system to track children benefiting or requiring support under CP. States like
Bihar and Maharashtra have a state specific CP MIS system to track the number of children receiving CP
services (number of children in foster homes, children on the move receiving ration kits, etc.).
Internal challenges:
- Lack of human resources with required technical knowledge to support the government
- Time-consuming lengthy procedure and due diligence for hiring consultants to support in providing
technical assistance.
Effectiveness
KEQ 7: To what extent are the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response achieved benefiting
vulnerable population?
Education:
• Majority of stakeholders opined that UNICEF’s response was effective towards meeting the needs of those
vulnerable children who are able to access its support. For example, a government official at the national
level explained that UNICEF adopted multi-model approach (different learning content for children across
different classes and in a different language, disseminated through different modes) because there is no
one size fits all w.r.t. education. Moreover, UNICEF also provided psychosocial support (through bring
300+ counsellors on board at the national level and recording their voices with appropriate content for
children) to address the emerging needs to relieve children’s stress.
• UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed about supporting children with no smartphones by providing
stories (available in multiple languages and for different age groups) available on a toll free number (where
children can simply call and listen to a story). In Jharkhand, UNICEF official informed that they received
positive feedback from parents as well as CSO partners that simple messages on psychosocial support
provided by counsellors (with UNICEF’s support) were very helpful for parents in engaging with their
children. This resulted in reduced irritation and anger levels among children.
• However, some stakeholders opined that UNICEF’s response was partially effective because it has not
been able to address the needs of 30-40% of children (as per rapid assessments and government official
at the national level) who had very limited/no access to continued learning. UNICEF official in Jharkhand
opined “Response was partially effective as far as reach is concerned. We were not able to reach each and
402
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
every child. The entire initiative’s reach was limited.”
• UNICEF national level official particularly highlighted that UNICEF could have done more to address the
needs of vulnerable children – “I think we potentially could have done more. UNICEF is advocating for a
lot of things which are important - for example bringing in more support for children with disabilities. But
it also depends on the government to take those things up. What is a priority according to government - it
will focus on that. For example, the responsive parenting program is something that clicked with the
government and they scaled it up. So perhaps, we need to advocate more for other important areas as
well.”
Child Protection:
• Most stakeholders (government, CSO/partners, UNICEF) opined that UNICEF’s response was effective
towards addressing the needs of vulnerable children however, there were some components of the
program which were partially effective in achieving the intended outputs and outcomes. UNICEF national
level official opined that “on one hand we were highly effective in quickly developing child protection
strategies, providing online training and adapting to the new modes of functioning; But on the other
partially effective in influencing the allocation of government resources, or ensuring that CP receives
extreme importance like health.”
• A UNICEF official at the national level informed that orphaned children were provided fostering support
(placing the orphaned children in foster homes) by Child Welfare Committees and district Child Protection
Unit who were trained by UNICEF (informed about ways of handling children, what steps to be taken in
placing the children, etc.) across all 5 states. Moreover, UNICEF also developed migrant camp advisories
to develop a checklist to ensure that certain facilities and services are in place (such as 1098 childline
number should be displayed so that children in distress/unaccompanied/faced violence could be
reported/found) for children.
• UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that UNICEF reached the children living in hotspot areas and
containment zones with psychosocial support via faith based organizations (who were provided with
material and resources to communicate by UNICEF).
• UNICEF official in UP highlighted that effectiveness of the response towards addressing the needs of
vulnerable children cannot be properly understood in the absence of feedback mechanism – “For example,
MHPSS was a very innovative approach to have a panel of counsellor on pro-bono basis. But we did not
have a feedback system from clients to understand their experience with us or to seek their inputs/insights
about how we have provided our services and what we could have done better. Further, there were no
mid-term assessments that could help us undertake course-correction (to understand and address the
needs of children more effectively)”.
KEQ 8: To what extent is UNICEF adapting its activities to become more effective based on learning and a
changing COVID-19 context?
Education
• Majority of respondents informed that UNICEF has been adapting its support to be more effective. For
instance, UNICEF official in Maharashtra informed that books were not very relevant and effective in times
like this. Thus, UNICEF quickly came up with digital material to suit the needs of children as per changing
context. Similarly, UNICEF introduced the module of Kendra Pramukh where teachers could undertake
home visits to administer learning to some extent. “UNICEF provided them with proper training to inform
them about how they can collect, analyze data and come up with the solution - collect data about access,
how many children do not have access to technology, what can be done to reach them.”
403
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
• UNICEF official in Jharkhand explained that UNICEF adopted the modalities through which it was providing
support. For instance, UNICEF started with providing digital content through apps like digi-school; but at
the same time UNICEF broad-based the approach by including TV and Radio and then further adding
network of CSO into providing support to a larger number of children.
• Government officials (state and district level) across all 5 states largely opined that UNICEF has been quick
in adapting to the virtual mode of functioning to become more effective during the pandemic. For
example, a block level official in Jharkhand informed that “UNICEF had quickly adopted the virtual modes
of functioning. These were quite new things for us and they did very well train us on how to use the virtual
modes.”
Child Protection:
• Majority of government officials across all 5 states particularly highlighted UNICEF’s support and ability to
quickly adapt virtual means of delivering the support. “UNICEF is adapting its support related activities
with the changing scenario. They’ve been quick in providing online training and facilitating online meetings
to plan and support the response.” – Government official at the state level (Maharashtra)
• UNICEF official in UP mentioned that UNICEF conducts internal workshops, discussions as well as
debriefs/brainstorming sessions at the state level to discuss the support so far and steps to be taken. This
is one of the mechanisms through which UNICEF learns from its challenges and adapts the support
activities to suit emerging needs. However, the official also mentioned that this is not sufficient and there
is a need to bring in external parties (partners) on board in this process to make it dynamic and to
understand how relevant and effective UNICEF’s response has been.
• UNICEF has been quick to identify the need for mental health and psychosocial support and adapted its
response to provide support towards the same. “For instance, UNICEF came up with MHPSS material,
training modules, and installing whole mental health and psychosocial support structure, both for the
government systems and for communities. And now we are going to do it with the entire school system
(teachers to promote their self-care, and also transfer that to parents and children.)” – UNICEF official in
Maharashtra
KEQ 9: What unintended outcomes are realized that need to be reinforced or mitigated?
• Stakeholders (UNICEF officials, government officials and CSO/partners) identified the following positive
unintended outcomes:
- Stakeholders (Education and CP) at different levels have become more tech-savvy which in-turn has
enhanced their skills to deliver virtually on their duties during the crisis.
- Earlier a government used to spend a lot of money in organizing face-to-face training. Pandemic has
brought forth that virtual modes can be adopted for training.
- Frequent conversation and different stakeholders coming together to discuss the situation and a way
forward have resulted in improved communication, partnerships and strong team building.
Education:
- State level UNICEF official highlighted that decision making process has improved in terms of speed w.r.t.
government approvals and decisions.
- Some teachers have shown the capacity of being resource person who can contribute towards innovative
learning continuation methods and curriculum development
- Parents’ engagement with their children w.r.t. education has increased. Parents have been seen narrating
404
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
stories to their children and spending more time with them.
Child Protection:
- Issues of adoption, foster care, kinship care and family based care have emerged as important areas and
which have come under the limelight due to the pandemic. Neighbors and relatives were seen coming
forward to look after the children in the absence of primary caregiver.
- Importance of having a strong volunteer network that could deliver CP activities on the ground has been
highlighted by the pandemic.
Recommendations
Education:
- UNICEF officials at state level spent considerable amount of time searching for partners (with required
expertise) to bring on-board. To reduce the time being taken, UNICEF can maintain a state-specific
partners’ pool which can immediately be tapped into by the program teams depending upon the nature
of crisis and subsequent requirements. (KEQ 6)
- The findings indicated that support provided by UNICEF towards continued learning has reached 60-70%
children. UNICEF should introduce new strategies to reach/ provide access to continued learning to the
remaining 30-40% children. (KEQ 3)
- UNICEF is utilizing the available (sex and age disaggregated) data to focus more on and identifying ways
of improving access to continued learning. It is recommended that UNICEF utilize this data to undertake
age and gender appropriate decision which will contribute towards inclusive policy decisions in the long
run. (KEQ 3)
Child Protection:
- The overall working capacity of UNICEF reduced due to more number of officials being infected with
COVID, especially during the second wave. UNICEF should update and maintain its existing rooster pool
which would enable program teams to quickly hire consultants with required knowledge and skill sets to
support smooth and efficient implementation of response activities. (KEQ 4)
- Partnership with Judiciary has helped in expediting government’s decision making process and has
resulted in quick actions. UNICEF should continue to leverage this partnership further to advance Child
Protection agenda. (KEQ 5)
- UNICEF in Bihar and Maharashtra has supported the government in developing and implementing MIS
which was successfully used to track and monitor children receiving services under CP. UNICEF should
advocate to develop a similar MIS at national level to track the children and monitor the response in an
improved manner. (KEQ 6)
- Kinship care has received government’s attention during the pandemic. UNICEF should leverage this
opportunity to advocate and advance kinship care agenda. (KEQ 9)
- UNICEF should strengthen the existing government systems (Panchayats, School management
Committees, Teachers, Police personnel, etc.) on which it relies to implement CP activities. Additionally,
UNICEF should focus towards developing and strengthening its CSO/volunteer network to implement CP
related activities on ground. (KEQ 6)
- To improve the relevance and effectiveness of the response, UNICEF can develop a formal feedback
system to receive inputs from clients/stakeholders and partners about UNICEF’s support and services
provided. This would help in understanding what worked and what did not and how UNICEF can improve
405
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
its response to become more relevant and effective. (KEQ 7)
Education and Child Protection:
- MHPSS has emerged as a strong forte of UNICEF which was recognized by majority stakeholders, especially
government officials at national and state level. Therefore, it is recommended that UNICEF should focus
on strengthening and scaling up the same. (KEQ 5, 7 and 8)
- At present, UNICEF has no formal mechanisms in place to understand actual reach and coverage of its
support. It is suggested that UNICEF deploy a system to capture real-time reach of its support to further
improve informed planning and advocacy at national and state level. (KEQ 3)

Evaluation Report
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 crisis in India
Key Findings – Pillar 5: Support Access to continuous education, social protection, child protection and
Gender-Based Violence (GBV) services
Introduction:
• UNICEF India, as a part of the COVID-19 Joint Response Plan (JRP), provides support to the Government of
India in its efforts to contain the spread, mitigate the risks and strengthen the management of COVID-19.
In doing so, UNICEF has adopted a multi-sectoral approach, which focuses on six pillars, including,
Education, Child Protection and Social Protection (Pillar-5).
• IPE Global conducted a real-time evaluation of the Pillar-5 to understand the relevance, coverage,
effectiveness and efficiency of UNICEF’s COVID-19 response with regard to Education, Child Protection103
and Social Protection.
• The objectives of the evaluation were to:
- Assess the relevance, coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of UNICEF India’s COVID-19 response
- Identify challenges and bottlenecks in service delivery and suggest recommendations for immediate
improvement
- Involve partners, stakeholders and community members in shaping UNICEF’s crisis response to ensure
it is more participatory and responsive to needs on the ground
- Identify and fill gaps in evidence generation; collect data for future evaluation of UNICEF’s response
• The Education, Child Protection and Social Protection pillar was examined at both the national and state
level to understand the needs and responses in different contexts. Five states were covered: Bihar,
Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and West Bengal (WB).
• The evaluation covered the period from the start of the pandemic (March 2020) to May 2021.
• Both primary (key informant interviews) and secondary data (desk review) sources were used.
- The review of documents included UNICEF’s India Response Plan, COVID JRP India, Procedure on
Corporate Emergency Activation for L3, Monthly Situation Reports, Fortnightly Field Updates-State-
wise status, Summary of CrMT Meetings, rapid assessments and evaluation reports
- For Social Protection, key informant interviews and focus group discussions included:
• Interviews with UNICEF representatives (3 national level, 5 state level)
• Interviews with national donors/partners (1)
• Interviews with national government officials (1)
• Interviews with state government officials (8), civil society organization (CSO) partners (3), and
district/block level stakeholders (1).
103 IPE Global has submitted a separate report focusing on Education and Child Protection findings. This report only focuses on Social Protection.

Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
Key Findings (Social Protection):
Relevance:
KEQ1: To what extent are the activities undertaken as part of UNICEF’s COVID-19 crisis response in line with
government needs and priorities?
• UNICEF revised its COVID-19 response plan in accordance with the emerging needs and is aligned with
government priorities for Social Protection (SP) which included providing the benefits of existing social
protection schemes (such as food security, livelihood, health, and education) to the maximum number of
people (especially the vulnerable groups like migrants, informal workers, women and children),
capacitating various FLWs and government functionaries, and efficient resource planning.
• UNICEF aligned its response with government priorities by providing technical support to improve the
coverage of existing social protection schemes by tracking and assessing the economic impact of COVID-
19 on vulnerable groups, advocating on safeguarding critical social sector spending especially those
focusing on children, supporting continuity of regular SP delivery via review and rapid analysis of existing
SP ecosystem, identifying options to expand and extend cash transfers those in need, advocating with
Ministry of Panchayati Raj to incorporate the response action (especially focusing in children and women)
in Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDPs); and providing training (related to resource utilization,
existing social protection schemes for potential community members, ways of availing benefits and
monitoring of social services, expanded role of GPs) to government functionaries, FLWs (SHGs, AWWs,
ASHAs), teachers, and members of Gram Panchayats (GPs).
• Most of the stakeholders (government, UNICEF officials, CSOs/Implementing partners) considered
UNICEF’s response to be largely ‘relevant’ in contributing towards government priorities w.r.t. SP. A
government official at the national level opined that UNICEF’s support was relevant because UNICEF brings
forth the best global practices, which are crucial for improving implementation processes and delivery
systems for a developing country like India. A state level government official in Jharkhand explained that
“UNICEF provides relevant support which can be implemented on the ground in time of need. UNICEF did
evidence based advocacy at the top level which impacted policy decision in an informed manner and also
provided training to the people who had no idea what and how to deliver support on the ground. It
supported the government in identifying the resources which can be utilized to provide social protection to
people in time of need.”
• Majority of stakeholders (government, UNICEF, CSO/partner) considered UNICEF as a ‘contributing player’
(especially in WB and Jharkhand where it is uniquely placed as the only multilateral agency and nodal
agency, respectively towards providing technical support) towards fulfilling government priorities w.r.t.
SP. For instance, UNICEF national level official informed that the Ministry of Panchayati Raj valued
UNICEF’s contributions and specifically requested UNICEF to provide support towards improving the
livelihood opportunities for people, especially migrants, those returning from urban areas and those
recovering from COVID – helping potential community members to meet compliance, identifying the low
labor-driven work which people can undertake.
• Almost all respondents opined that the response was relevant in terms of contributing towards
government priorities across both COVID waves in India. According to a UNICEF official at the national
level the first wave was more about evidence generation and letting the government know the current
status; whereas the second wave, focused mostly on implementation and bringing efficacy; and improving
409
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
the monitoring of the overall delivery mechanism.104
KEQ 2: To what extent are the activities and technical assistance provided by UNICEF tailored to the local
context in different states?
• UNICEF’s response was tailored in terms of providing support to vulnerable groups based on the emerging
needs and local context of states. Rapid assessments were undertaken by UNICEF in all 5 states to assess
the local context and situation and tailor its assistance as per the needs. For instance, in UP the rapid
assessment informed that urban poor were facing problems in accessing social security schemes due to
stringent compliances and low awareness levels. UNICEF officials in UP identified the gap and are currently
in the process of developing a dashboard on social protection where urban poor can access the
information on social schemes they are eligible for – to ease the access and increase the uptake of benefits.
Similarly, in Maharashtra and UP community members were facing difficulty in withdrawing/accessing the
financial benefits they received. UNICEF official in UP informed about advocating with the state Finance
Department to set up micro-ATMs to ease access in withdrawing the money.
• UNICEF in states like UP, Bihar and Jharkhand supported the state government to address reverse
migration crisis by tracking the migrants and identifying government resources and schemes which could
be utilized to provide support (in cash and in kind). For instance, in UP, many migrants and workers were
unable to receive ration/COVID relief kits due to unavailability of required documents to avail the service.
UNICEF’s advocacy resulted in the release of a D.O. letter directing all DMs to ensure that free ration kit
should be given to all workers in their homes.
• In West Bengal, UNICEF provided technical support to Department of Women and Child Development &
Social Work for increasing the coverage of Kanyashree Prakalpa (KP) Convergence scheme by submitting
technical policy note to the state Finance Department seeking approval for utilization of unutilized funds
and continuation of KP Convergence Scheme beyond March 2021.
• UNICEF official in Jharkhand informed that continued benefits w.r.t. food kits were provided to support
economically vulnerable groups, as a result of UNICEF’s advocacy. Free ration/food kits were provided
through schools, take-home rations through Aanganwadi, additional 5 kg food grains to ration cardholders
through the public distribution system. Those of who did not have ration cards were provided ration of
10kg rice and 1 kg pulses through Mukhiya/Ward Councilor.
Coverage
KEQ 3: Is UNICEF’s COVID-19 response likely to reach/are materials accessible to vulnerable populations?
• Through advocacy UNICEF supported government to increase the reach and coverage of the COVID-19
response to the vulnerable populations. For instance, a government state level official (Jharkhand)
informed that “We see the increasing number of community members being affiliated with the schemes.
For example, despite schools being closed, the benefits (cash transfers and Mid-Day Meal) are still being
provided to the children - as a result of UNICEF’s advocacy.”
• UNICEF officials (national and state level) informed that in the absence of a formal mechanism to
understand whether the response is reachable and accessible to potential community members, rapid
assessments had helped to inform UNICEF’s response to some extent. For example, a UNICEF official
(Jharkhand) explained that “The first round of rapid assessment indicated that 50% households enrolled
under National Food Security Act were receiving the benefits of the state targeted public distribution
104 Some findings have been colour coded (in blue) to indicate a difference/similarity/critical fact about the two COVID-19 waves in India which
may/may not have impacted UNICEF’s COVID-19 response.
410
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
system. The second round of rapid assessments indicated that all male-headed households were receiving
benefits but 27% women-headed households were not receiving the benefits. So, unless we do a monitoring
of outcome budget, we will not come to know what has been the impact of this coverage or whether it is
reaching the women and children or if it is not reaching then what are the reasons.”
CSOs and implementing partners act as another source to understand the reach and coverage. For instance,
UNICEF official in Maharashtra explained that Jeevan Rath provides as a good platform to understand ground
reality and challenges faced by people in receiving/availing SP benefits.
• The inability of the government to scale up UNICEF’s successful pilot interventions in a sustainable
manner, due to lack of fiscal resources, pose as challenge in increasing the reach of SP benefits –“UNICEF
can pilot some interventions, but the onus is on the government to institutionalize and scale it in a
sustainable manner. The lack of fiscal space has been a major challenge for government both at the
national and state level, as a result, the devolution to the last mile happened to a limited extent.”
• Even though the response was reachable to a larger population, it was not accessible by all. For example,
in Jharkhand, UNICEF is currently working with the state government on monitoring outcome budget to
understand the reach of its support and identify bottlenecks. A UNICEF official informed that
approximately 30-40% of the vulnerable population has not been able to receive cash benefits from SP
schemes due to the absence of having a bank account. UNICEF has not been able to successfully advocate
to ensure that banks open a bank account in the absence of official documents.
• Technical support was requested by national and state governments after the first wave to improve the
coverage of social protection schemes. UNICEF provided support through training to members of GPs,
developing materials promoting CAB, developing material for tele-counselling, etc. on special request
from the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
Efficiency
KEQ 4: To what extent UNICEF’s technical advisory and advocacy at the state level has been useful in
delivering enhanced allocation for the GPs to meet the needs evolving out of crisis?
• UNICEF’s Social Protection section’s advocacy does not focus on delivering towards enhanced allocation
for GPs. A UNICEF official at the national level informed that “We advocate to make existing systems more
child and gender specific. For example, we are advocating with the government to make GPDP more child
and gender specific by introducing guidelines which focus on enhancing benefits for women and children.”
• Interestingly, a UNICEF official at state level (WB) opined that “GPs are already receiving funds and the
utilization is not more than 60% or 65%. Why would you give them more money? UNICEF provides support
towards increasing the capacity of GPs which will enable them to utilize funds and carry out their
responsibilities efficiently. The whole idea was that if you have capacity only then you’ll be able to plan
budget and expenditure.”
• According to a UNICEF official in UP, a lot of resources have been pumped into GPs by the national and
state government enabling them to undertake development initiatives (such as developing quarantine
centers, labor rooms, etc.). However, there is a need to advocate for more untied funds to undertake SP
related activities –“15th Finance commission has 60% tied funds for health and sanitation which is good
for taking up CAB, vaccination drive, etc. but not for SP activities. There is a need to advocate for prompting
more untied funds because COVID recovery has to be part of the Panchayat agenda and this does not mean
only vaccinating and promoting CAB. There is a range of social protection issues across the state that need
to be addressed using more untied funds at GP level.”
KEQ 5: To what extent is UNICEF managing and delivering its COVID-19 response in a timely and coordinated
411
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
manner?
• Many government officials at national and state level (across all 5 states) informed that UNICEF’s
contribution towards COVID-19 response has been timely and ‘pro-active’ (w.r.t. identifying resources
which can be tapped into to provide social protection to vulnerable populations and capacitating the
support staff at the grassroots level to carry out support activities). Subsequently, they also highlighted
that policy and planning level changes are time consuming due to lengthy government procedures and
therefore cause some delay in delivery of support. “UNICEF’s consultation is on time but its reach was
slightly delayed due to governmental processes take some time from the government’s end. So maybe
implementation and roll-out can be further looked into.” – Government State level Official in Bihar
• Government officials at the national level as well as UNICEF officials (national and state level) believed
that UNICEF’s response was more timely and efficient during the second wave as compared to the first
wave. For instance, a government official at the state level (Maharashtra) opined that “as soon as the
indication of the second wave kicked in, UNICEF pro-actively got in touch with the government and
informed them about some of the issues which according to UNICEF needed special attention - especially
those relating to women and children (such as issues of nutrition and health).”
• UNICEF also provided timely support to the government through capacitating government functionaries
and FLWs at the grassroots level. These training focused on informing them about different schemes,
especially those benefitting women and children, suggesting ways of utilizing untied funds at GP level,
informing about compliance/ways of availing benefits and enhancing the overall understanding of
functionaries/FLWs/GPs towards social protection. These training are often conducted on a monthly/two-
monthly basis. For example, UNICEF in Jharkhand trained the PRI on 15th Finance Commission resource
planning and utilization of resources for children, women, migrants and their families; as well as trained
400 master trainers who later helped 8000 MNREGA laborers in identifying schemes under which the
laborers can seek benefit.
• Majority of stakeholders (government, UNICEF and CSOs/partners) informed that these training have been
very useful in understanding the situation as well as ways of providing on-ground support to the target
population on time. For example, a state level official in Bihar explained that “UNICEF has supported in
developing the IEC materials and undertaking training of the government functionaries towards building
their capacity to tackle and roll-out the increased responsibilities. These training have been helpful because
they informed about what to do and how to do it. They had helped functionaries at local level comprehend
the situation in a better manner and hence respond efficiently.”
• UNICEF had largely leveraged government partnerships (and to some extent CSO partnerships) to ensure
timely delivery of the response. For instance, a state level UNICEF official (Jharkhand) explained that
“UNICEF is providing support to government to prepare and monitor outcome budget (with an explicit
focus on child and gender budgeting). For this, UNICEF partnered with the Department of Planning and
Poverty Learning Foundation (CSO partner). Without partnerships, one cannot think of UNICEF
programming.” Similarly, UNICEF Maharashtra partnered with Sigma Foundation to generate evidence
from rapid assessments which contributed towards timely response planning.
KEQ 6: What bottlenecks exist to efficient implementation of the crisis response?
• Following challenges were highlighted by the stakeholders (government officials, UNICEF officials,
CSO/partners) that have affected the efficiency of UNICEF’s response w.r.t. social protection:
Internal challenges:
- Need for increased human resources – A national level UNICEF official explained that there are not more
412
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
than 2-3 UNICEF staff members managing various interventions in multiple districts and coordinating with
government departments and CSOs. Increasing the number of human resource may improve the efficiency
of the response.
External and programmatic challenges:
- Even though UNICEF’s advocacy and technical assistance is timely, yet the delay from government’s end
(such as delay in inter-departmental communication and coordination, delayed internal approvals, time
taking procedures, etc.) often reduce the overall efficiency and turnaround time of COVID-19 response at
both national and state level.
- In UP, the UNICEF official informed that the government is more focused upon furthering its political
agenda and a lot of government resources are deployed towards the same. It is a challenge for UNICEF to
convince the government to implement UNICEF’s recommendations w.r.t. development agenda.
- Increased number of officials being infected with COVID within the government departments led to some
delays in decision making.
- A UNICEF official at the national level informed that many national and state level services are not easily
available and accessible to those who move across borders. UNICEF has been advocating for developing a
system (such as one nation one ration card) to make the benefits agile and easily accessible by the majority
people. But the intended output has not been achieved so far.
- Since social protection majorly engages at the policy and planning level, hence, changes introduced in
policy do not necessarily eliminate bottlenecks at the implementation level. A UNICEF official at the
national level explained “Unlike other UNICEF program, we do not engage at field level to provide benefits.
So tweaking something about the delivery system at policy level does not necessary solves bottlenecks at
ground level, such as class based discrimination, which may hinder delivery mechanism in rural pockets,
etc.”
- UNICEF’s advocacy has not resulted in quick amendment in the policies to address the crisis situation as it
takes a lot of time and majorly depends on government’s priority. For example, a national level UNICEF
official informed that UNICEF’s advocacy (to improve horizontal coverage) with the Ministry of Women
and Child Development has not been successful in easing the procedures and compliances associated with
Pradhan Mantri Matri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY).
Effectiveness
KEQ 7: To what extent are the intended outputs and outcomes of UNICEF’s response achieved in an
equitable manner benefiting vulnerable population?
• Majority of respondents opined that UNICEF’s response has been effective in achieving the intended
outputs and outcomes. For example, a state level official from Jharkhand informed that under the 15th
finance commission certain provisions were introduced for GPs to use untied funds. But it was through
UNICEF’s capacity building and handholding support that they were able to better understand the
situation – what is required and how to utilize funds and provide support. Moreover, the FLWs were aware
of schemes and through those channels, more number of community members received information on
SP schemes.
• Some UNICEF state level officials opined that the response was more effective in achieving the intended
outputs and outcomes during the second wave, as compared to the first wave. For example, UNICEF
official from Maharashtra explained that “The first wave was focused towards analyzing the situation and
identifying entry points to contribute towards COVID response. During the transition phase (i.e. between
413
Real Time Evaluation of UNICEF's Response to the COVID-19 Crisis in India
Evaluation Report
first and second wave) UNICEF put mechanisms in place for tracking schemes, established alliances and
generated evidence from its pilot interventions. These evidences were used in wave two to provide more
effective support. We were more confident during the second wave”
• Some stakeholders (government and UNICEF) opined that the response could have been more effective if
UNICEF had greater understanding about implementation (mechanism and bottlenecks). A UNICEF official
at the national level explained “a guideline for state or national government or strategy for training and
an action plan will only support to a certain level. A lot of nuances of implementation get missed in planning
because you are unaware of it. The extent of involvement in implementation has to significantly increase
if we want to make a difference.”
• Interestingly, a UNICEF Official (WB) opined that “One can check whether the support has been able to
achieve intended outputs and outcomes only if there has been an impact evaluation assessing the whole
population against set parameters. We are just advocating and providing technical assistance for
strengthening the ways through which SP policies can reach people. Whether these policies have been able
to meet needs of people, we do not know.”
KEQ 8: To what extent is UNICEF adapting its activities to become more effective based on learning and a
changing COVID-19 context?
• According to stakeholders (government, UNICEF and CSO partners), UNICEF has been adapting its
response to become more effective, based on analysis of existing data (available government data on
public portals) and evidence that it generates – through rapid assessments and its NGO/CSO partners. For
example, a government state level official in Maharashtra informed that “even before the national
government came up with the idea to give INR 10L to the orphans, it was UNICEF who came up to the Dept.
of Women and Child Development with the idea of supporting such children under the Juvenile justice Act
2016. So that set us in the patch of taking the decision.”
• UNICEF has only utilized the findings from rapid assessments and those which it had received from its CSO
partners to learn about the evolving needs and adapt its activities to provide support.
KEQ 9: What unintended outcomes are realized that need to be reinforced or mitigated?
• No unintended outcomes (positive or negative) were informed by the stakeholders (at national and state
level) of this evaluation.
• However, a UNICEF official in Maharashtra highlighted a ‘good practice’ which should be continued in the
future – Developing a trusted partnership and a consortium of partners has helped UNICEF significantly in
delivering the response in an efficient and effective manner. These partnerships have fed UNICEF with
grassroots evidence which has further enabled UNICEF to undertake informed advocacy at both state and
national level.
Recommendations:
• Findings indicate that UNICEF lacks a nuanced understanding of bottlenecks at the implementation level
which impacts relevance and effectiveness of its support at planning level. UNICEF should explore
mechanisms to understand implementation procedures and gaps in order to undertake more informed
advocacy and provide better technical assistance. (KEQ 7)
• Unavailability of official documents or IDs barred many potential community members from availing SP
benefits. UNICEF should continue advocating to develop a mechanism (where benefits could be linked to
a single identity card) with the government through which community members could receive benefits in
the absence of relevant documents. This may also allow community members who move across borders

to seek benefits. (KEQ 3 and 6)
• In order to improve the coverage, the government should allocate more financial resources towards SP
services and scale up UNICEF’s successful pilot interventions. For this, UNICEF should continue its advocacy
to ensure that the benefits reach the last mile people. (KEQ 3)
• To improve the SP services at GP level, UNICEF should identify and advocate ways through which GPs can
receive and utilize more untied funds. (KEQ 4)
• SP is a comprehensive theme which requires UNICEF officials to coordinate the response with multiple
stakeholders (ministries and departments), therefore, to improve efficiency and delivery of services,
UNICEF should increase its human resources at state level. (KEQ 6)
• Government processes often delay decision making and a subsequent delay was reflected in the reach of
benefits to potential community members. UNICEF should identify ways to reduce the involvement of
more number of departments/ officials in decision making. This may contribute towards quick actions.
(KEQ 6)
• UNICEF should continue to focus towards developing more trusted partnerships and a consortium of
partners who have fed UNICEF with evidence from grassroots level. This may help UNICEF significantly in
planning and delivering the response in an efficient and effective manner. (KEQ 9)
• UNICEF’s (handholding) support towards capacitating the GPs to undertake their responsibilities in an
improved manner – was appreciated by the government (at national and state level). UNICEF should
continue providing support in this domain. (KEQ 5)
• UNICEF should advocate for developing a provision (related to relaxing the conditionality) in policy itself
which can be utilized during any emergency or unseen circumstances. (KEQ 6)
