Executive Summary
ObjectiveoftheAdolescentEmpowermentProgram(AEP) TheAEPoperatedinfourdistricts
of four states (Sibsagar in Assam, Visakhapatanam in Andhra Pradesh, Purulia in West Bengal
and East Singbhum in Jharkhand) and set out to cover 50% of the adolescent population in each
of these districts. The program’s goal was to empower adolescents and make them “agents of
change” for themselves and their communities, simultaneously making their surrounding aware of
andresponsivetotheirrightsandneeds. Forthesame,theprogramworkedalongthreepillars.
The goal of Pillar I was to empower adolescents through activities, including the formation of
adolescent groups, that increased their knowledge and encouraged dialogue with their peers to
enable an understanding of issues particular to their age group, and to remove barriers to their
agencyandconfidence. Dependingontheactivity,maleandfemaleadolescentswithintheagesof
10to19weretobereached,bothinandoutofschool. PillarII wastargetedmorebroadlytowards
communities, especially influential community members and leaders, and parents of adolescents.
Theseadultswereunderstoodasthefoundationthatframestheknowledge,agencyandconfidence
of these adolescents, and targeting them would ensure a modification in the social norms and
traditionsthatholdadolescentsback. Lastly,measuresunderPillarIII,focusedonpublicservices
and authorities. The knowledge of and access to services would enhance adolescents’ physical
and mental well-being, and help them overcome any external barriers to their empowerment. The
programwasactivefrom2015to2019,withactivitiesintensivelyimplementedfrom2017to2019,

Objective of the Evaluation In order to assess the impact of the AEP, an independent mixed-
methods evaluation of the program was undertaken. The evaluation aimed to answer questions
related to implementation fidelity, as well as relevance, effectiveness, and impact of the program
on adolescents’ lives in India. It assessed whether or not the program improved adolescent lives,
eventuallyincreasingschoolretentionorenrollment,promptinglatermarriagesanddelayingearly
pregnancy. Of particular interest for the impact evaluation were the intermediate outcomes which
outlined the potential channels through which the desired changes were to occur. These were
developed following the Theory of Change (ToC), according to which, the program was to raise
awarenessandknowledgeonadolescents’rightsandstrengthensupportivecommunitystructuresto
facilitatetheirempowerment. Theprogram’seffectivenessforkeystakeholderssuchasadolescents,

parents and communities as a whole was to be tested through its effects on attitudes towards
adolescent’ empowerment and gender norms, changes in social norms and practices within the
community, as well as improved provision, access to, and enforcement of services and rights.
With this being a flagship program, with the eventual aim to scale up the intervention, the lessons

EvaluationMethodology Theevaluationfollowedamixed-methodsdesign,leveragingandcom-
biningquantitativeandqualitativedatatoanswerevaluationquestions. Thequantitativecomponent
was designed as a randomized control trial. Out of 82 program-eligible blocks in the sample, 42
(treatment) blocks were allocated to receive a set of foundational interventions, including adoles-
cent girls groups, or the Basic Package. The remaining 40 blocks served as a comparison (or
control) group, that received no intervention. In a second-stage of randomization, 480 villages
in the program blocks were equally divided into 4 groups, and assigned into the Plus Package,
which included additional activities on top of the Basic Package. As part of the Plus Package,
villages where assigned to (a) additional parents groups, (b) additional adolescent boys groups, or
(c)additionalparentsandadolescentsboysgroups. Thelastsetofgroupofvillageswereassigned

This evaluation relied on census data as a baseline, and on data collected between March and
October 2021 in 72 sampling blocks as the endline. While the program included 82 blocks, the

Within the mixed-method set up of the AEP endline evaluation, the qualitative component com-
plemented the larger quantitative component, providing additional in-depth qualitative insights to
answerparticularevaluationquestions. Inthisline,thequalitativecomponentfocusedonquestions
related to implementation fidelity, relevance, and effectiveness, while the quantitative component
largely addressed the questions on effectiveness and impact. The qualitative component used a
detailed desk review of primary documents, in addition to key informant interviews, in-depth in-

FindingsandImplications Implementationfidelity: TheAEPevaluationleveragedendlinesurvey
data,projectmonitoringdataandprojectdocumentationtoassessthereachandscopeofactivities
implemented as part of the AEP. Based on the endline survey data, implementation reach in
treatment areas was modest: in 46% of villages none of the respondents reported awareness of
the implementation of any AEP activities within their villages. However, triangulating information
frombothprojectmonitoringdataandendlinesurveydata,theAEPreachedamuchlargershareof
treatmentvillages(94%). Projectmonitoringdataalsorevealsthatthereachandscopeofprogram

All in all, program awareness among respondents was low. Only 16% of respondents (including
adolescent, parents and community leaders) were aware of any AEP activity, and remember the
name of the implementing organization, within their villages. Low levels of awareness among
respondents also hint that the intensity of program implementation was modest, although recall
bias could have reduced reported levels of program awareness if respondents forgot about specific
activitiesimplementedintheirvillagesinthepastfouryears. Amongthosewhowereawareofthe
implementation of AEP activities in their village, a majority participated in these activities (86%)
andall(100%)participantsreportedtheyweresatisfiedwiththeactivities.
Overall impact and final outcomes: The evaluation results show that at the aggregate program
level, the AEP had very limited impact on all final outcomes. At the state-level, however, program
effectspresentanassortedpicture.

in qualitative interviews reported a general decrease in child marriage rates over the past decade.
However, in line with quantitative evidence, they mentioned this may not have been necessarily
5
associated with the AEP. Despite these declines in child marriages, participants felt that a longer
program duration - particularly in Assam’s tea gardens - could have yielded additional decreases
in child marriage rates. A few participants stated that the government’s (Kanyashree) scheme also

reasons emerged as an important factor driving child marriage in both qualitative and quantitative
evidence.

(88.3%). Likewise, the AEP is associated with a 2.1 percentage point (pp) increase in current
schoolattendanceamongolderadolescentboysandgirls(aged15to23)(81.2%),whencompared
to adolescent boys and girls of the same age in control areas (79.1%). The share of adolescent
girls aged 10 to 14 who reported to attend secondary education was also 3.1pp higher in treatment
areas, when compared to the share of adolescent girls of the same age in control areas. Finally,
the program also had positive effects when considering formal years of education. An increase in
0.3 years of formal education is found among adolescent boys and girls in treatment areas, when
considering results from all states combined. This increase is statistically significant for both girls
andboys. Atthestatelevel,moresignificantresultsarefound:
Final outcomes at state level: The AEP adopted differing program modalities to fit the context in
which it was operating. Therefore, it is useful to examine the impact of the AEP on each state
separately. TheprogramledtopositiveeffectsinseveraloutcomesforthestatesofAndhraPradesh

was stronger for adolescent girls aged 10 to 19 than for adolescent boys, at 4.2pp and 1.6pp,
respectively. In terms of education effects, no statistically significant effects on school attendance
rates were found for adolescent girls in any age group within treatment areas of the state. It is

In Assam, the AEP is associated with a higher incidence of child marriage among adolescent girls
aged 10 to 19, when compared to adolescent girls of the same age in control areas. On average,
6
4.3% girls in program areas reported being married of early, compared to 1.5% in non-program
(a difference of 2.8pp). Among adolescent girls aged 18 to 21 in treatment areas, the program is
also associated with higher child marriage rates (7.2pp). The overall low rates of reported child
marriageinAssam,inbothtreatmentandcontrolareas,mayhaveinfluencedtheseresults. Interms
of schooling, the AEP had a positive impact on school attendance rates among adolescent boys
and girls in treatment areas. Attendance was 3.8pp higher in program areas, compared to school
attendance rates of adolescent boys and girls of the same age in control areas (∼88%). Focusing
onlyonadolescentgirlsaged10to19,theincreaseinschoolattendanceissmaller(3.2pp)andonly

In Jharkhand, the AEP is associated with a 2.5pp lower incidence of child marriage rates among
adolescent boys and girls aged 10 to 19 (2.7%), when compared to adolescent boys and girls of
the same age in non-program areas (5.2%). This reduction is not statistically significant when
considering program effects on adolescent girls alone. The program is also associated with a
considerable, statistically significant, increase in schooling rates for adolescent girls aged 10 to
19 (6.2pp). That is, while 81.9% of adolescent girls in non-program areas reported they attended
primaryorsecondaryeducation,88.1%didsoinprogramareas.

“Basic” versus “Plus” program activities At an aggregate level, increasing program intensity
through Plus package activities did not have any additional impact on child marriage, early preg-
nancy and school enrollment. However, when disaggregating the results by the three treatment
arms(boygroup,parentsgrouporboysandparentgroups),villageswithparentsgroupinaddition

Intermediate outcomes: Adolescent empowerment, social norms, communication, and service
provision Intermediate outcomes were envisioned in the Theory of Change of the AEP as impact
pathways to shape final outcomes. All in all, the evaluation finds the AEP increased awareness of
childrightsamongrespondentsintreatmentareas,whiletheimpactonotherintermediateoutcomes
wasmorelimited.
In relation to adolescent empowerment, the AEP shows positive effects in terms of supporting
7
awarenessofchildrightsamongadolescents,parentsandcommunityserviceproviders. Theshare
of respondents in program areas that were aware of child rights was 25.1%, relative to 17.7%
in comparison areas - a 7.4pp improvement. This improvement was even more notable when
comparing very poor respondents in program versus non-program blocks (+9.7%). However,
improvementsinotherareasofadolescentempowermentwereverylimitedornon-existent. Inthis
sense,improvementsintermsofconfidencewereonlyobservedamongadolescentgirlsinAndhra
Pradesh. Inthestateprogramareas,59.3%ofadolescentgirlsreportedtheyfeltconfidentindoing
daily activities by themselves, while 46.7% did so in non-program areas. No impact is observed
in terms of improved well-being, self-efficacy or active support when comparing adolescents in
treatmentandcontrolareas.
Overall, the AEP had a limited effect in supporting communication outcomes. The program had
a small, positive effect (2.2pp) on the share of situations involving intergenerational dialogue that
adolescentboysandgirlsengagedin. Thispositiveeffectwasstrongerwhenfocusingonadolescent
girls alone (2.8pp) and on older adolescent girls in particular (4.2pp). Likewise, intragenerational
dialogue increased among older adolescent girls (2.2pp). Qualitative evidence supports positive
program effects in terms of improved communication among adolescents and parents that partici-
patedinthem.
At the aggregate level, evidence from quantitative data hints that the program did not significantly
shape social norms surrounding child marriage or equal opportunities for girls and boys. Only
when looking at program effects on male respondents, a small decrease in agreement with child
marriage is observed (2pp). In qualitative interviews, respondents who took part in the program
noted positive changes in regards to their attitudes about equality. This includes learning about
treating girls and boys equally in relation to their educational pursuits and becoming more aware
oftheimportanceofprovidinggirlstheopportunitytoattendschoolforthesamelengthoftimeas
boys. However, respondents felt equality between girls and boys was something “people just say”
andthat,“inreallife,it’snottrue”. Allinall,itseemslikeincreaseawarenessofadolescentrights
andequalityprincipleswerenotenoughtoshapesocialnorms.
Impacts for service provision reflect changes under the Pillar III of the program. Considering
results from all states, community leaders in program villages were slightly more likely to report
an improvement in access to community services (4.7pp). Likewise, access to Child Protection
Committees (CPCs) was improved in program areas (8.4pp). However results differ by state and
a large majority, namely 78.7% of community leaders, reported that CPCs were not present in
8
their village. Finally, the AEP is associated with a small increase in the government services that
adolescent girls were aware of (2.0pp) and could access (+2.1pp), when compared to adolescent
girls in comparison areas. This increase was higher when considering adolescent girls in Andhra
Pradesh, who showed an increase of 6.4pp in the share of government services they knew and of
5.0ppintheshareofservicestheycouldaccess.
The change in some of the intermediate outcomes, especially at the community level, suggest that
the program activities did push adolescents towards the path of becoming “agents of change”,
althoughthiseffortdidnottranslateatthelastmile,withintheimpactleveloutcomes.
Relevance, key informants frequently reported a strong integration and explicit alignment of AEP
programming with existing government goals, schemes and initiatives. In addition to ensuring
the AEP’s alignment with international frameworks such as the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of the Child (UNCRC), they emphasized that the AEP had been well integrated with existing
government activities. However, in spite of the apparently close integration and ownership by the
government, many study participants felt they were incapable of continuing program activities in
the absence of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and/or UNICEF support and guidance.
According to them, this was due to lacking financial support, lack of knowledge and training as
well as limited motivation among facilitators and group members. Together with this, the wide
variety of contexts and conditions that the intervention needed to adapt to may have lowered
its impact. In many cases, the adaptations eventually undertaken were dependent on individual
initiative and responsiveness to feedback and good monitoring. As discussed below, this was not
always optimal. The local factors that required adaptation related to language, culture, religion,
security situation, need for inclusiveness and much more. This means that apart from increased
responsiveness, greater participation in program design and flexibility of intervention may help
provide the necessary adaptability to account for the immense diversity of local contexts.Finally,
despitegenerallypositiveassessmentsofthemonitoringmechanismsinplacethroughouttheAEP,
one District Officer requested stronger coordination and more regular meetings between AEP and
other service providers in order to ensure transparency in data sharing, for instance in relation to
adolescenthealthcareseekingbehavior,intheabsenceofwhichserviceproviders“aremissingthe
opportunity of giving the service to those adolescents who are actually referred or who actually
needtheservice”(DistrictOfficer2,WestBengal).

• Createastrategyfortheeffectiveengagementofparentsandadolescentboysinchildmarriage

gender and availability barriers for the participation of boys and parents in child prevention

• To avoid variation in reporting, the evaluation team recommends the development of a
toolkit for programs targeting child marriage of (qualitative and) quantitative research tools,
techniques and standardized indicators for monitoring changes in knowledge, practices and
genderequitableattitudes.
• Embeddingsustainabilityofprogramsasakeyaspectoffutureprogrammingisimportant,for
instance, by embedding programmatic approaches into existing government schemes based
on representative and rigorous evidence. It is also important to develop and implement an

• A workshop targeted a building capacity of UNICEF program staff at country and regional
level, and potentially key Implementing Partner (IP) would ensure the understanding and
use of highly rigorous evaluation approaches, such as randomized control trial and quasi-
experimentalmethods.
Limitations ItisworthnotingthattheevaluationoftheprogramstartedrightbeforetheCOVID-
19 worldwide outbreak at the end of 2019, and experienced several hardships due the prolonged
lockdowns that followed. Even though the evaluation process successfully adapted to the new
10
conditions, data was collected a significant time after the end of the program. COVID-19 could
thus have diluted some of the effects between the end of program implementation and September
2021, particularly due to recall bias. This is particularly relevant for the implementation reporting
from respondents. Likewise, the pandemic has been shown to have significant adverse impacts
on the schooling, health and well-being of adolescents, affecting the intended outcomes of the
program. Asamitigationstrategy,theevaluationhasassessedimpactoneducationoutcomesfrom
different angles, including changes in current and past school attendance or in attitudes towards

Another deviation is that program implementation focused on a small subset of treatment blocks
inAndhraPradesh. Inthisstate,adolescentandparentgroups,andmid-mediaactivitieswereonly
implementedinfivestates,twoofwhichareincludedinthesample. Sinceimplementationinthese
blockswasdecidedforstrategicreasons,itishardtodisentanglethereasonsforthisselectioninto
treatment. Moreover, seven blocks were dropped from the endline during sampling, because of
their relative small size. Since these blocks represent 0.5% of the overall number of villages in
Andhra Pradesh, results for the state are likely to be unaffected by this change. However, given
the deviations in the sample on top of the significant changes in program implementation, results
in Andhra Pradesh should thus be considered with caution. It is difficult to measure the extent of
bias in the results, and if it leads to lower or higher effects for the outcomes. To account for the
implicationsofthesechangesonresultsattheaggregatelevel,mainoutcomeswerealsocalculated
excluding Andhra Pradesh, as a robustness checks. All in all, evaluation results for final outcomes
holdwhenexcludingfromtheanalysistreatmentandcontrolareasofAndhraPradesh.
Finally, the program was implemented by several local implementing partners across and within
states, with differing approaches. Together with this, implementation intensity varied during the
timetheprogramwasimplemented. Inthisline,programintensityvariedbetweenandwithinstates,
and over time. The multiplicity of implementation approaches pose complications to accurately
assess the aspects of the AEP that ,ay have led to changes, or lack thereof, in outcomes of interest

Introduction
I. General Context of the Program
Adolescence is a period of physical, social and psychological development during which young
peopleexperienceandadaptnewrolesintheirfamiliesandcommunities. Thisperiodoftenentails
thelossofmanyprotectivestructuresendowedtoadolescentsintheirchildhood. Asaconsequence,
it is often a time of great vulnerability.1 Nonetheless, for many years, this stage of life has not
receivethedeservedinterestwithinpolicy.
Relevance of the Problem This is especially so for adolescent girls, whose rights and needs
have been reportedly widely abused or ignored (???). Rigid gender norms, discrimination, abuse,
and poverty can render girls significantly more vulnerable to negative physical and psychological
health outcomes (?). As the largest country in South Asia, and home to 240 million adolescents
between the ages of 10 to 19 (?), India presents evidence towards the unique set of challenges and
vulnerabilities that adolescents in poverty, particularly girls, face. UNICEF reports that adolescent
girls in India are six times more likely to being married off, than adolescents boys (?). The
negative consequences of child marriage are far-reaching. Early marriage is associated with lower
educationalandnutritionaloutcomesforadolescentgirls,andwithhigherratesofearlypregnancy
(??). Likewise, a misconception exists that girls in marriage are protected from violence while in
fact, married adolescents are particularly vulnerable to domestic abuse (??). This adds to a broad
arrayofadditionalnegativeimpactsofchildmarriagecoveredextensivelyintheliterature. Studies
show that married adolescents exhibit a higher prevalence of poor reproductive health (?), higher
exposure to Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) (?), and are less likely to deliver in health care
centers(?). Thelikelihoodofmaternalmortalityisincreasedaswell(?).

andeducationopportunities,UNICEFstressestheperpetualcyclesofpovertypromotedthroughthe
practice of child marriage. Mothers that were excluded from education attainment from an early
age, and faced a high incidence of disease, and often feel the financial burden that forces the
practiceofchildmarriageontothenextgeneration(?). Consequently,childmarriageisrecognized
as a violation of human rights, and its eliminations is included in target 5.3 of the Sustainable
Development Goals. Even less policy attention has been paid to males, who also suffer from rigid
gender norms, but more indirectly. Expectations by society form gender roles and may encourage
men to use violence to maintain authority in the family, and control women and girls within the
family(?). Likewise,earlymarriageisalsoassociatedwithlowereducationalandhealthoutcomes
for boys (?). In this sense, addressing entrenched gender norms that support early marriage is key
toachieveanimprovementinwell-beingforbothgenders.
Over the past 30 years, India took several legal steps to strengthen the legislative and policy
frameworks supposed to protect adolescents from child marriage. In 1992, it acceded to the
Convention on the rights of the child, and in the following year, ratified the Convention of the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. National efforts began in 2006 with
theProhibitionofChildMarriageActsettingthelegalageofmarriageto18. In2013,Indiadrafted
theNationalActionPlantoPreventChildMarriage. Morerecently,individualstates,amongthem
Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Bihar, have proposed strategy plans and roadmaps for the prevention
of child marriage (?). Furthermore, the government set up programs such as Conditional Cash
Transfer(CCT)schemesinthe1990s,totackledifferentcausesforearlymarriages.2
In line with many such reforms, the probability of a girl in South Asia marrying before the age of
18 has dropped from 50 to 30% over the last 10 years (?). These have been especially expedient
in India, where child marriage rates especially for girls under 15 have declined (?). While it is
true that the situation for very young Indian girls is slightly improving, child marriage continues
to be a major problem. In fact, the latest National Family and Health Survey (NFHS-5) finds that
23% of women aged 20 to 24 were married before the age of 18. Roughly 7% of adolescent girls
between 15 and 19 were already mothers or pregnant at the time of the survey (?). Eventually,
adolescent girls have often little control over when and to whom they will be married. Rather, for
many girls life is dictated by a combination of patriarchal societal norms, monetary concerns, and
negotiationsbetweenparentsandin-laws. Additionalconsiderationsofprestigeandhonorarealso

COVID-19 and Adolescents In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rights and entitlement of
adolescents are particularly at risk, especially those based in rural, poor areas. A policy brief by

schoolclosuresincreasedtheirprobabilityofnotattendingeducation,gettingmarriedoff,andmore
unintended pregnancies.(?; ?) After India began lifting restrictions, cases of child labor showed a
steady rise, representing a barrier for school enrollment and consistent attendance (?). COVID-19
has also increased the risk of child marriage. During the onset of the pandemic, Childline 10983
experienceda50%increaseintheirregularcallvolumes(?). Almost10,000callsrequiredChildline
1098 staff intervention, with 30% of these calls related to child protection issues, including child
marriage. During 2020 alone, interventions by social workers from childline stopped nearly 898
child marriages during this pandemic (?). In this line, the analysis from ? and ? reveal that the
lockdown also disrupted anti-child marriages programs and new financial burdens increased the
incidence of child marriage (?; ?). This, plus the rise in the incidence of child abuse and violence
during lockdown, is likely to lead to an increase in child pregnancy. With this considerable threat
to the progress made within the past decades, key players in the area of adolescent empowerment
would need to redouble their efforts, to ensure that these rights and liberties of adolescents are

II. The Program
Overall Aim and Approach In 2015, UNICEF and IKEA Foundation (IKEAF) launched the “Im-
proving Adolescents’ Lives in South Asia” program, with interventions in India, Pakistan and
Afghanistan. The overall aim of the program implementation was to contribute in developing a
model feasible for later scale-up in South Asia, drawing on the experiences and lessons learned
from the three countries. The “Improving Adolescents’ Lives in India”, or AEP as named in India,
was based on a three pillar approach: The first one focused on adolescents to make them agents
of change for themselves and their communities. The second pillar targeted families, communi-
ties and decision makers so that they protect adolescents from right abuses, while improving the
dialogue between them. The third pillar was centered on public authorities and services such that
they upheld the adolescents’ rights, and ensure their protection, health and education. While the
pervasive approach in development programs has been to engage communities as a homogeneous
construct, or to engage girls and women alone, this project additionally addressed the boys, men
andleadersasstakeholdersintheprocessofchange.
Geographical Scope The AEP operated in four states: In Andhra Pradesh (southeast India), the
neighboringstatesofWestBengalandJharkhand(eastIndia)andinAssam(northeastIndia).

In West Bengal, the program was implemented in the district of Purulia, where 20% of the state’s
poorest villages are located (?). In 2019, the rate of women aged 20 to 24 years who married
werebeforetheageof18wasparticularlyhighwith37%,incomparisontothenationalaverageof

In Jharkhand, the district of East Singhbhum (adjacent to Purulia) was covered under the project.
While similar to Purulia, in that around 20% of the approximately 2.2 million inhabitants are
adolescents (?), the rate of women aged 20 to 24 years who were married before the age of 18 in
2019wasmuchlowerwith19.8%(?).

SAG program for female empowerment in 2010 to address fundamental needs for a holistic growth
of adolescent girls in terms of health, education and employment. Since then, the implementation
through training in vocational skills and exposure to public services and leadership development
hasaimedtoimprovehealth,delaypregnancyandreducematernalandinfantmortality.
Finally, in the state of Assam, the interventions were implemented in the district of Sibsagar. In
2019, within the rural areas of Sibsagar, the rate of women aged 20 to 24 years who were married
before the age of 18 was 27.9%, while women aged 15 to 19 pregnant or with child were around
12.8% (?). In addition to the implementation of the SAG scheme in this state, in 2017, the Assam
government introduced the Swami Vivekananda Assam Youth Empowerment Scheme to provide
traininginentrepreneurshipskillsdevelopmentandfinancialassistance.

Linking Program Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Via the three-pronged
approach, the program intended to bring the targeted population closer to fulfilling the United
Nations (UN) SDG 5 and 4, i.e., in the areas of gender equality and women’s empowerment, and
education. It particularly aimed to eliminate harmful practices against women, such as child and
forced marriage, in accordance with target 5.3 of the SDGs. Regarding education it strengthens
SDG4.7to“ensurethatalllearnersacquiretheknowledgeandskillsneededtopromotesustainable
development, including, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-

violence”. Overall, the program directly reached 85,573 adolescents and 850,000 other direct
beneficiaries(?).
II.A Program Activities, Stakeholders and Expected Changes
Theprogramfollowedthethree-pillarapproachoftheoverallSouthAsiaProgramToC. Following
this, outputs and outcomes were defined around three pillars: Pillar I on adolescents, Pillar II
on stakeholders (parents and communities) and Pillar III on service providers. The strategies
of the program aimed at enabling adolescents to protect themselves and enhancing supportive
community structures through awareness raising, capacity building, and mobilization of relevant
stakeholders. Through these channels, the program was expected to have an impact in reducing
child marriage, increasing secondary education enrollment and decreasing adolescent pregnancy.
Theprogramincludedinformationdisseminationthroughmediaoutletssuchasradios,printmedia,
and television, as well as capacity building activities geared toward adolescents, their parents, and
othermembersofthecommunity. Throughthesevariouschannels,theinterventionsaimedtoshape

The goal of Pillar I was that adolescents become agents of change for themselves and their com-
munities. Adolescents of between the ages 10-19 were targeted as part of the AEP. Depending
on the activity, male and female adolescents in and out of school were to be reached. Pillar II
was targeted more broadly towards communities, especially influential community members and
community leaders, as well as parents of adolescents. Measures under Pillar III focused on public
services and authorities.Figure 1.1 summarizes the ToC, displaying its activities, expected outputs,

Chapter1: Introduction 7
Pillar I: Adolescents The Basic Package under the first pillar includes media outreach and ad-
vocacytoengageadolescentsthroughmid-andmass-mediachannels. Mid-mediacoversactivities
such as street plays, games-based activities, miking, community festivities, video screenings, and
other infotainment, often in combination with Inter-Personal Communication (IPC) engagement.
Mass media tools such as TV, internet, mobile phones, and applications are used to reach ado-
lescents on a broad scale. These channels are expected to disseminate information regarding
adolescents’ rights, gender equality, violence, health, child marriage, and other topics to adoles-
cents. The adolescents are actively engaged to create this content themselves. Additionally, under
the Basic Package intervention, girls groups are formed and strengthened, girls receive training
on different topics through groups or other channels, and peer educators are trained to become
self-sufficient in spreading this knowledge with their peers. Thereby, the broad-based awareness
activities through media are complemented with gender-specific knowledge and tools to empower
adolescent girls. Adolescents, and specifically girls, should gain an increased sense of empower-
mentandself-efficacynotonlythroughtheincreasedknowledgeabouttheirrightsandwell-being,
butalsothroughtheskillstotackleinjusticetowardsthemselves,theirpeers,ornuisancesinherent

ucators. Consequently,adolescentsthatfeelempoweredandsupportedbytheirpeersmaybecome
more active in protecting themselves and their peers from harm and, therefore, make communities
safer and more child-friendly. As an additional driver, the Plus activities include engagement
of boys through adolescent boys’ groups and skills development tailored towards changing their
attitudes and behaviors towards girls, and equally becoming change agents for adolescents in their
communities. Given that gender norms are manifested in social interactions and carried onto the
next generations, educating and engaging boys is an important step towards gender equality. In
thissense,theseadditionaleffortstochangeboys’understandingandawarenessofgender-specific

Pillar II: Parents and Communities Similar to the media outreach activities with adolescents,
parents and community members were to be sensitized and engaged in community-level advocacy
and IPC events. Specifically, advocacy and awareness-raising was targeted towards influential
community members and leaders to facilitate changes in community structures and enabling a
protective environment for adolescents. These activities are expected to increase knowledge and
understanding of adolescents’ topics among parents and communities as a whole, which in turn
should influence attitudes towards gender norms, adolescents’ agency, and views towards child

The evaluation scope did not cover an assessment of all OECD DAC criteria, specially leaving
out evaluative judgments on coherence and efficiency of the program. The evaluation was guided
by a Theory of Change developed jointly with UNICEF. In particular, it defined and guided the
outcomes and assumptions as well as the hypotheses tested in the impact assessment (Section II.
for reference). The criterion Effectiveness is covered under Section II., while Relevance and
Impact/EffectivenessarecoveredunderSectionsIII.andV.Thetimelineoftheimpactevaluation
covers a period from the onset of program activities (2015) to the endline survey (2020/21). The
evaluation measured the impacts two years after the official end of the AEP in 2019, although the
end of specific program activities may have varied. Finally, the geographic scope covers four
districts of four states in India (Sibsagar in Assam, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Purulia in
WestBengalandEastSingbhuminJharkhand). Changesinscopeovertimeincludedtheinclusion

Global Evidence and Contributions This study adds to a growing body of evidence on how to
reduce child marriage. In support of this goal, research has identified a number of channels to
delay early marriages and consequential pregnancy. Programs focusing on enhancing education,
adolescent empowerment and financial incentives have been successful in achieving this goal.8
However, interventions that only provide financial incentives or empower girls may not suffice to
triggerchangeiftheydonotenableasupportenvironmentandopportunitiesforadolescents. Rigid
gender norms, discrimination, abuse, and poverty can render girls significantly more vulnerable
to negative health, educational and economic outcomes (?). In that sense, evidence underpins the
importanceofleveragingholisticapproachestotacklechildmarriage. Childmarriageisentrenched
in deeply rooted social norms. A study conducted by ? refers to the level of complexity of several
types of approaches to tackle child marriage (such as empowerment, community engagement,
schooling, and economic interventions) in order to assess whether an intervention was successful
or not. Instead of single interventions with indistinguishable components, the authors shift to
multi-componentprogramsandfoundthatempowermentapproachescombininglifeskills,further
trainingorsocialmobilization,werethemosteffective.
A closely related study to the current evaluation is the impact evaluation of a girls’ empowerment
program in Bangladesh by ?. This study investigates the Kishoree Kontha (KK) program, which
consists of a basic intervention package on community mobilization, education support and social
competency training. On top of the basic package, several treatment arms including interventions
on financial literacy, access to savings, and economic incentives are incorporated into the pro-
gram. Key long-term outcomes under study are the age at marriage and educational attainments,

Chapter1: Introduction 11
while intermediate outcomes include girls’ negotiation and decision-making skills, their aware-
ness, knowledge and attitudes, as well as savings, mobility and income generation activities. To
assess implementation fidelity, they further consider awareness and participation in the programs,
attendance and frequency of participation, and continuation of groups after the formal program
has ended. The program was run in four six-month cycles between December 2007 and August
2010 and program effects were measured four and a half years after program completion. The
authors come to the conclusion that in their setting, the small financial incentive were a powerful
drivertoincreasetheageofmarriage. However,theyalsofoundthatwhileempowermentactivities
may complement the impact of the incentive, they are ineffective by themselves. These results
suggestthattheunderlyingcontextandconditioningfactorsofchildmarriagearecrucialtoidentify

AlsoinBangladesh,theBALIKAprogramaimedtodelaymarriageandimprovelifeopportunities
for girls in rural areas with high rates of child marriage. The program worked with adolescent
girls aged 12 to 18 and provided them with a basic package of basic lifeskills and community
activitiesto raiseawareness onchildmarriage. Inaddition tothis, villagesweredivided intothree

gender rights awareness and mentoring support to empower girls. The program was implemented
in treatment communities during 18 months and program effects were measured at the end of the
program. The recent study of ? reveals that the program reduced child marriages in adolescents
below 18 years old significantly in all complement packages relative to control areas. The study
demonstrated that working with communities to develop holistic programs that build skills among
girlscanreducetheprevalenceofchildmarriageinshorttime.
Programsthatcombineawarenessraisingactivitieswithactivitiestoenhancecommunicationskills
among adolescents have also received increasing attention. In this sense, a relatively new body

skills in order to enable an intergenerational dialogue.9 For instance, in an Randomized Control
Trial(RCT),? foundthattraininggirlsinnegotiationskillsinZambialedtomoreparentalinvestment
in their daughters’ education. The program was administered through 6 two-hour sessions over
two months and program effects were measured yearly over the ensuing four years. While this
study found little evidence of changes in intergenerational dialogue, it found positive effects in
intragenerational dialogue among peers, especially amongst girls. Findings also from ? show that
in a context where parents and children have different preferences over educational investments,
household members can learn non-cognitive skills that facilitate strategic cooperation, helping
familiesgetclosertotheefficientfrontier.
Typically, programs addressing gender disparities have focused their efforts in targeting primarily
girls and women for being a more vulnerable population. The effects of these interventions,
however, depend on their target group, and the common approach of these programs has been
to involve communities as a homogenous actor and/or to engage girls and women solely (?). In

this light, causal evidence show gaps regarding further contributions of engaging boys and men in
adolescent empowerment programs. Societal preferences such as traditional gender norms, strong
beliefsaboutthebenefitsofmarryinggirls,andsocialconservatismareprevalentissuesassociated
with high levels of child marriage. For that reason, directly targeting boys’ and men’s preferences
at a young age could generate promising value. Findings from ? and ? reveal numerous benefits

accordingly, the main outcomes of interest included a gender attitude index, an aspirations index,
and a gender-equitable behavior index. They found positive effects on attitudes accompanied with
changes in behavior. However, educational and career aspirations were unaffected. In this sense,
? draw an important conclusion: Empowering adolescents does not necessarily mean it will be
feasible for them to translate this empowerment into changes, it requires an ability to change.
Therefore,itisrelevanttobringboysandmenonboard.
TheevaluationofanempowermentprograminIndianschoolsconductedby? targetingadolescent

CHAPTER
Methodology
This chapter describes the methodology of the evaluation. The evaluation was designed following
a mixed-methods approach, combining a core quantitative component with a smaller qualitative
research component. The core of the evaluation design follows a quantitative, experimental ap-
proach using an RCT at two levels (blocks and villages) to address the main evaluation questions.
This quasi-experimental approach allows to observe differences between treatment and control
groups, and to derive causal inferences from them. The evaluation is primarily based on endline
quantitative and qualitative data, collected two years after program completion. The study design
allowstoassessprogramimpactbasedonendlinedifferencesinkeyoutcomesbetweencontroland

Inrecentyears,mixed-methodresearchmethodologieshavegainedinpopularityamongresearchers

quantitativemethodscanbemanifold: notonlydoessuchacombinationpromotecomplementarity
betweendifferingresearchframeworks,methodsand toolsinimpactevaluations,drawingontheir
strengths and overcoming their weaknesses, it also serves study development, as the results of
one approach are used to develop the methodology of the other (?). Another important feature of
mixed methods is the systematic use of between-methods triangulation to enhance the reliability
and validity of estimates obtained from varied sources, providing a deeper understanding of the
processes through which program outcomes and impacts are achieved and ensuring the inclusion
ofmultipleperspectives,particularlythoseofthemostvulnerablegroups(?).
EvaluationQuestions
The evaluation was guided by a set of evaluation questions, aligned with evaluation objectives, and
designed to address the evaluation criteria of impact/ effectiveness, relevance and implementation
fidelity. The quantitative component focused on addressing questions relating to impact/ effectiveness
Chapter2: Methodology 14
and implementation fidelity. The qualitative component focused on addressing questions relating to

CausalEvidenceandRCTs:
A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a method of impact evaluation in which all eligible units in a
sample are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. In this case, adolescents, parents and
communityleadersintreatmentvillages/blockswereassignedtothetreatment(AEP),whilerespondents
in control areas were not. Random assignment ensures that control and treatment groups are equal in
both observed and unobserved characteristics. This means that both groups are very similar, and thus
comparable, before the obset of the program. That is to say, the only difference between the treatment
and control groups, is their exposure to the intervention itself. This allows to identify the impact that
can be directly attributed to the program by comparing treatment and control groups after program
implementation.

Acrucialelementforthecredibilityofeveryimpactevaluationisthecomparabilityofthetreatment
group to the control group. If the control group systematically differs from the treatment group
any comparison of their outcomes would reflect a combination of the true treatment effects with
the impacts of such systematic differences on the outcome variable. The most credible estimation
approach ensures that treatment and control groups have identical distributions of observed (i.e.,
age,gender,educationorhousingquality)aswellasunobservedcharacteristics(i.e.,deepbeliefsor
attitudesthatarehardtocapture). Toavoidsystematicdifferencesinobservedcharacteristics,aran-
domized assignment to treatment and control groups was implemented. Randomized assignment,
under the law of large numbers, implies that treatment and control groups do not systematically
differ in observed or unobserved characteristics, thereby ensuring comparison between similar
groups. The scope of this study not only assesses whether the program worked in improving the
main outcomes, but also includes an assessment of which component or which modality is most
successful. Thus, a two-stagerandomization was applied, wheretheAEPimplementation wasran-
domizedattheblocklevel,andthreedifferentprogrammodalitieswithintheAEPwererandomized
atthevillagelevel.
The UNICEF interventions aimed to achieve behavioral changes in many outcomes and norms that
are hard to capture in one single indicator only. For this reason intermediate outcomes were
includedintheanalysistoassessintendedchangesalongthetheoryofchange.3

beneficiaries in these blocks complied with this treatment assignment. That is, some target beneficiaries in blocks
assigned to the treatment group may not have received the treatment. Treatment assignment can be different from
so-called treatment compliance for different reasons. For instance, target beneficiaries could have not taken-up AEP
activities because they were not aware of them, they were not invited to participate or they were not interested or
availablefordoingso.

Chapter2: Methodology 17
I.B.1 BasicPackage
In the first step, the effects of the intervention were captured through the randomization of the
interventions at the block-level within each state. Randomization of treatment assignment was
carried in 2015, involving different organizations.4 At endline, following the sampling deviations
outlined in Section I.C, data was collected from 37 of the 42 treatment blocks, and 35 of the 40
controlblocks,byrandomattritionoflowpopulationblocksandremovalorurbantreatmentblocks.
I.B.2 AdditionalPlusActivities
Randomizing at the block level has the disadvantage that the effective sample (of clusters) is
rather small, implying reduced statistical power to detect impacts. Even though, a larger number
of villages is included in the sampling, the number of clusters in terms of blocks (the level of
treatment assignment) is only 42 versus 40. In order to increase statistical power and to enhance
therichnessoftheevaluation,theUniversityofMannheimsuggestedtoimplementtreatmentarms,
atthevillagelevel. Thepurposewas(1)toincreaseintensityofimplementationinsomeareasand
(2) through the introduction of experimental variation, to learn about the impact of different types
ofparticipationmodesontheoutcomesofinterestand(3)increasethenumberofclustersfrom82
to700.
Anadditionalsecond-stagerandomizationwith700villageswasthuscarriedoutin2015,beforethe
onset of the program, to understand the extent to which specific interventions were more effective
than others, and whether the Basic Package was sufficient to bring about the desired changes. In
this second-stage, additional activities on top of the Basic Package were randomly allocated by
the research team to certain villages across the four states. The treatment arms were designed and
definedsolelybyUNICEFstaff.
Thissecond-stagerandomizationwascarriedatthevillage-level. Inthecontrolblocks,220villages
were randomly selected to act as the pure control group. In addition, a sample of 480 villages in
treatment blocks was randomly assigned to one of four same-sized arms. Thus, four modalities of
interventions were implemented as part of the Adolescent Empowerment Program at the second-

and the remaining groups where, additionally: (b) parents groups were initiated, (c) adolescent

four different treatment arms were compared to the control group, which received no treatment.
Likewise, outcomes of treatment arms (b), (c) and (d) (Plus Package) were compared vis-a-vis the
treatmentarm(a).

I.C Sample Deviations from the Original Design
While the original evaluation design included 82 blocks, (42 treatment and 40 control), the final
evaluation includes 72 blocks as a result of changes in the endline sample. Table 2.1 outlines
the final sample achieved, by state. Sample changes, together with their implications for the
interpretationsofresultsareoutlinedbelow:
1. Exclusion of Urban Blocks While the majority of blocks to be included in treatment and
control groups were rural, the evaluation sample included three urban blocks in Andhra
Pradesh(GajuwakaUrban,PedagantyadaandVisakhapatnamUrban)andoneurbanblockin
WestBengal(Purulia(M)).5Thesewereexcludedfromthesamplefortwoparticularreasons:

it became clear that identifying treated slums within these urban areas will prove to be
unfeasible,duetouncleardemarcationofthetreatedareaswithintheoverallurbancenter,or
anyclearmethodtomaptheadolescentsthatweretreatedintheseareas. Theinclusionofthe
urban blocks would have made the balance of covariates at baseline improbable, implying
a failure in randomization, given that urban areas are larger, more densely populated, and
have a differing access to services that affect program outcomes, such as schools or health
infrastructures. Therefore, at the inception mission a decision to remove the urban blocks
was made. This implies that out of the 42 treatment blocks, only the 38 rural blocks were
kept.
• ImplicationsforResultsTheexclusionofurbanblocksentailsthatresultsforthestate,

2. Random Attrition of Small Blocks in Andhra Pradesh. During the data collection, the

inAndhraPradesh. TheAndhraPradeshsamplecomprisedalargenumberofblocks(40after
theremovalofurbanblocks)withheterogeneoussizes,includingsevensmallblockswithless
than 15 villages, representing less than 0.5% of all villages in Andhra Pradesh. Due of their
small relative size, compared to the other blocks, these blocks were assigned a negligible
selection probability (below 0.5). As a result, no villages for the final sample were drawn
from seven small blocks in the state (Visakhapatnam (Rural), Narsipatnam, Yelamanchili,
Paravada, S.Rayavaram, Padmanabham, Payakaraopeta). The total number of blocks from
APreducedto33intheendlinesample.
• Implications for Results There can be a few causes for concern regarding this drop
of small blocks. In the first case, the validity of the results to the overall population is
questionable, i.e. external validity. This evaluation considers average treatment effects
inthecontrolandtreatmentpopulations. Asaresult,excludingsevenblockswithvery
small populations is unlikely to affect estimates to a great degree. These blocks would
represent a small number of observations in a representative sample, given their small
relative size. Secondly, it can be that the removal of small blocks, can lead to attrition
bias in the estimation. This random attrition of blocks was equally distributed among
treatmentandcontrolgroupsandwasnotsystematicinonegroup(fourintreatmentand
three in control), therefore unlikely to cause any attrition bias in the average outcomes
of the two groups. Moreover, within the treated areas, this drop did not imply that
blocks with heavy implementation, as reported within the MIS data, were kept while
blocks with lower intensity of implementation were dropped. Rather two out of the
fiveimplementationblockswerealsodroppedaspartofthisrandomattrition. Further,
baselinestatisticscomparingtheremaining33blocksshowthatcovariatesarebalanced
between the two groups. Therefore, even within the smaller sample, the two groups
remained comparable and do not introduce biases. Additionally, to control for any
Chapter2: Methodology 20
differences at baseline, the final analysis includes covariates that would improve the
precision of the estimation. The share of clusters that attrited in the sample is not very
large, and amounts to less than 10% of the overall blocks. In terms of population, it
amounts to a much more negligible share. Therefore, all likely threats to the internal
validity of the results so not appear to be present, and the results likely remained
unthreatened. Finally, the removal of these seven (and the aforementioned three urban
clusters) may lead to the reduction of power. Section A.II.C shows that this is not the
case, and the loss of power in the case of nearly all outcomes is nearly negligible. 6

entail that results should be considered cautiously for this state. Implementation was not
uniform across the all blocks in the state, with adolescent and parent groups focusing in a
small subset of all blocks of the state. Since the implementation blocks was decided for
strategic reasons, it is hard to disentangle the reasons for this selection into treatment. We
cannot be certain whether the blocks more (or less) likely to succeed were selected, which
can affect the results in opposing directions. Selection of districts more likely to succeed
would likely show better results of the program. As a result if this unclear selection bias, a
clean, rigorous causal interpretation of program effects within all blocks of the state is not
possible. The endline data collection included all blocks, regardless the high intensity of
implementation,toensurethattheresultscanbeasunbiasedaspossible.

Village-level Deviations: Based on MIS data, implementation compliance with treatment arms

I.E Estimation Strategy
This section introduces the estimation strategy to identify the program’s effects. The estimation
analysiswasconductedattheblocklevel(firstrandomizationstep)andatthevillagelevel(second
randomizationstep). Atbothlevels,twodifferentmethodswereused: Intention-to-TreatEffect(ITT)
and Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). The ITT estimator measures the impact of treatment
assignment, i.e., it compares units assigned to the treatment with units assigned to the control
group, disregarding actual program delivery or uptake. Contrarily, the LATE estimates the effect
of the treatment only for compliers, i.e., for those units that were assigned to and also received the
treatment. In the case of full compliance, i.e., all units assigned to the treatment and none of the
unitsassignedtothe controlgrouptakeuptheintervention,these estimatorswouldyieldthesame
result. However, as described above, actual implementation did not always follow assignment,
leadingtodifferencesbetweenthetwoestimators. Inthegivencaseofimperfectcompliancethere
is a trade-off between the results: Only comparing outcomes in the treatment with the control
group (i.e., measuring ITT) may underestimate the actual effect of the treatment. On the other
hand,theLATEestimateonlyprovidesinsighttoasubgroupofthepopulation,namelytheso-called
compliers. The ITT estimator is, despite being lower in size, more credible since it is not biased
by reasons of why the program has been implemented and/or taken-up in some areas rather than
others. Still,lookingatbothmeasurescanenrichtheunderstandingofprogrameffects.
The estimation of the ITT was conducted first. To do this, the two levels of randomization were
considered: First by comparing the outcomes of those who were randomized into the treatment
group in the Basic Package activities (𝑅 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑐 = 1) with those who were in the control (𝑅 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑐 = 0).
Secondbycomparingtheoutcomesofthosewhowererandomizedintothetreatmentgroupinthe
Plus Package activities (𝑅 𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑠 = 1) with those who were in the control (𝑅 𝑝𝑙𝑢𝑠 = 0), whereby three

(i.e.,controlvillagesfromtreatmentblock).9 Thesearemeasuredbythegeographicalarea(village),
i.e., program assignment is done by at the block or village level and not at the individual level.
The various ITTs are captured in the 𝛽 parameters: 𝛽 1 is the treatment effect for the Basic Package

implicationisthattheITTcanbelowif,forsomereason,theprogramdidnotreachthebeneficiaries.
In some interventions, the discrepancy between the intended treatment status and actual one can
be largefor various reasons.14 To identifycompliers, individuals that wereactually reached bythe
program, respondents were asked whether any of the following events with or about children and
adolescents had taken place in their village in the last four years: Training or workshop, group
sessions, trainings restricted to a selected group of participants, group games, public gathering
or sports events. Then, respondents were asked about the formal name of this event, training
or workshop. Respondents who were aware of at least one event implemented by UNICEF, an
implementing partner15, or an event focusing on a topic related to the Adolescent Empowerment
Programwereidentifiedascompliers. Moredetailedinformationonprogramimplementationand

With the help of a two-stage least squares (2SLS) the LATE is identified. To do so, each of
the 𝑅 variables referred to in equation 2.1 above are - in the first stage - used to predict actual
implementation, i.e., 𝐷ˆ. In the second stage then, this value is used to estimate the LATE, i.e., the

Finally,asindicatedinthesamplingsection(SectionIII.),theestimationconsideronlyindividuals
who had the chance to be exposed to the program, e.g., those who were adolescents when the

II. Qualitative Evaluation Design
The AEP evaluation follows the mixed-methods approach of concurrent triangulation design for
impact evaluation. The methodology relies heavily on quantitative methods, employing primarily
surveydatacollectionandeconometricanalysis(seeSectionI.forfurtherinformation). Integrating
the quantitative data with qualitative data strengthens the design by honing in on a smaller sample
to more thoroughly explain the statistical relationships found in the quantitative data. This is
done through purposive sampling from the main population, ensuring representation of the key
stakeholders and target groups, taking into account the heterogeneity of activities implemented in
thefourstates. Aconcurrentdesignlendsitselftoevaluationsthathavelimitedtimeresourcesand
aim to triangulate data from several sources. It involves simultaneous but separate collection and
analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, adopting the techniques traditionally associated with
each data type.16 The resulting data sets are then converged to compare and contrast or validate
and expand quantitative results with qualitative findings (?). In this study, the qualitative findings
are triangulated and integrated with the quantitative results to address the evaluation questions
concerning implementation fidelity and effectiveness. The evaluation question on relevance was
addressed exclusively through the use of qualitative methods. Figure 2.1 is adopted from ? to

Targeting Three different respondent types were targeted and administered a different question-
naire. That is, a separate questionnaire was developed for each respondent type: A questionnaire
foradolescents(adolescentquestionnaires(AQ)),aparentofadolescentquestionnaire(parentques-
tionnaire (PQ)) for parents, and a community leader questionnaire (community leader question-
naire (CLQ)) for community representatives. In a household roster, respondents were additionally
askedabouteachhouseholdmemberandaboutsiblings/offspringwhonolongerliveinthehouse-
hold.
Target households were households where adolescents of the (current) age group 10 to 23 resided
or had resided in the past four years, i.e., considering that the individuals were adolescents when
the program took place (in the following, adolescents always refer to this age group). Details on
the sampling approach can be found in Appendix A.II.B.1. The overview below summarizes the
differenttypesofindividualsthatweretargetedpervillage:
• 7Adolescentquestionnaires(AQ)
• 2Parentofadolescentquestionnaires(PQ)
• 1Communityleaderquestionnaires(CLQ)
Foradolescents,theageeligibilitycriterionwaschosensoastoincludethegroupofyoungpeople
that were adolescents at some point during program implementation and, therefore, eligible to
participate in program activities, hence 10- to 23-year old respondents were sampled due to their
eligibility for the program during its implementation. Depending on their age, adolescents and
young adults were targeted by and, therefore, exposed to the program for a different duration of
time. For this reason, and also to capture the impact of the program on its beneficiaries with
more power, the random draw of the adolescent among all household members aged 10 to 23 was
weighted to account for this difference in program exposure. For parents, the eligibility criteria
was having at least one child aged have at least one child aged 10 to 23. Likewise, a community
leaderwastargetedineachvillage.
Sampling of Villages During the endline sampling, villages were randomly selected from blocks.
AppendixA.II.B.1providesanoverviewofthenumberofvillagessampledineachstatebytreatment

The number of villages to be randomly selected from each block was defined by the number of
villagesbytreatmentarmandthenumberofvillagesperblock. Thesamplingprobabilityofvillages
wasproportionatetoblocksize. Thatis,villagesinbiggerblocks(thosewithmorevillages)hada
highersamplingprobability. Throughthisapproach,agreaternumberofvillageswasselectedinto
treatmentarmsfromblockswithmorevillages.
SamplingwithinVillagesSinceinthecontextofIndianoreliablehouseholdlistingwasavailable
and the available census dated back to 2011, enumerators followed a random walk sampling
Chapter2: Methodology 31
approach. In this procedure, enumerators walked from a central point in the village, e.g., the
religioussiteorschool. Afteratleasta5minutes’walkawayfromthecentralpoint,theenumerator
stopped at every third household as per their interview plan. Before the actual interview started,
several screening questions were asked, in order to ensure that a household was eligible (i.e., if
therewasatleastoneadolescentoroneparentofanadolescentinthehouseholdthatwouldbeable
toanswertheinterview).
Inaddition,basedontheirsamplingsheet,theenumeratorsconsideredtheeligibilityofthehouse-
hold by stratification of the sample on the gender, where about 43% of the adolescent sample
was male and around 57% female. No such distinction was made for the parents of adolescents
since these were randomly selected by the survey tool, after completion of the household roster.
Furthermore,toaccountforthelargerangeofadolescents,afurtherstratificationwasmadebythe
age of the adolescent. 2 out of the total 7 adolescents to be interviewed are to belong to the age
group, 10 to 14. This distinction was to ensure that the differential impact between the two age
groupscouldbeestablished.

Timing of Survey Given the need to respond to the changes COVID-19 situation, data collection
took place in different waves between February and October 2021. Data collection was conducted
firstinJharkhandbetweenFebruaryandMarch2021. OnceCOVID-19restrictionspermitted,data
collection was conducted in Assam, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, between September and
October2021. DatacollectioninAndhraPradeshwasalsohaltedforseveraldayswhenthetropical

QuestionnaireTheendlinequestionnaires(threequestionnaires,oneforadolescent,oneforparents,
and one for community leader) captured key characteristics of respondents and program goals.
Questionnaires began with screening questions concerning the economic status and presence of
female/male adolescents in the household - key information to meet the sampling criteria. Then,
theadolescentandparentquestionnairesincludedahouseholdrostertocapturebasicdemographic
information about all household members. After this, questionnaires included modules to capture

informationonoutcomesofinterestforthisevaluation(SectionO.V.).
The adolescent and parent questionnaires were built following a parallel structure, i.e., the same
questions were asked to adolescents and to the parents (with reference to the behavior of their
randomly selected adolescent child). The community leader questionnaire collected key leaders’
and village characteristics. All questionnaires were subject to several rounds of revisions with the
IPsandUNICEF. ThequestionnairesweretranslatedintoAssamese,Bengali,HindiandTelugu.
Following a pre-household roster used for the listing, a household head or a knowledgeable adult
provided answers on the whole household by answering a household roster. Applying an out-of-
household roster, basic information was obtained from the household head about adolescents who
movedoutfromtherespectivehouseholdinthepastfouryears. Here,questionsaboutthemarriage
statusofthechildren,educationallevels,andchildren,amongstotherswereasked. Thehousehold
rosterrespondentalsoansweredquestionsaboutbasiccharacteristicsofthehousehold. Thiscovered
the number of rooms, type of toilet, ownership of refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave oven,

were asked about the child. In a participation module, the aim was to better understand if and
howtheprogramwasimplemented. Adolescentsandparentswereaskedwhethertheywereaware
of the activities, whether they participated in them, and additional information on the activities.
The survey continued with modules on actions taken and self-efficacy, on protection and safety,
and on personality and wellbeing. Following, the adolescents were asked questions regarding
discussions of the adolescents with parents, religious leaders and others, in which situations
the adolescent’s opinion is taken into consideration, whether the adolescent experienced corporal
punishmentandsimilarquestions. Amoduleonmarriageincludedquestionsregardingthemarriage
status,arrangedmarriages,plansofgettingmarriedorengagedandforhavingchildren,mainreasons
for marriage and similar questions. Final modules of the main questionnaire included information
on role models, where respondents’ opinions regarding certain statements regarding adolescents
and expected behavior of men and women were asked about. This was followed by questions on
attitudesaboutmarriageandeducation,askingabouttheopinionwithrespecttocertainstatements
regardingadolescentsandexpectedbehaviorofmenandwomen.
III.B Qualitative Methods
Tocomplementthequantitativefindings,weusedindividualqualitativecasesstudiestoinvestigate
key issues pertaining to the AEP’s implementation fidelity, effectiveness and relevance. This
involved conducting key informant and in-depth interviews with a variety of stakeholders and AEP
participants.
Chapter2: Methodology 34
Key Informant Interviews (Key Informant Interview (KII)) are qualitative, in-depth interviews
with individuals selected for their first-hand knowledge about an aspect of the program being
evaluated (?). They can provide valuable contextual information that deepens our understanding
of the political, economic and social setting within which the program was implemented. Based
on a stakeholder mapping prepared by the research team (see Table A.2 in the Appendix), a
final list of key informants was developed in close consultation with UNICEF India. To assess
implementers’ training and knowledge of the interventions as well as delivery modalities and
fidelity to program design, priority was given to capturing the perceptions of individuals involved
in planning, implementing and otherwise supporting the AEP activities on site. To this end, we
consultedcommunitymobilizers,AnganwadiWorkers(AWWs)and/orAccreditedHealthActivists
(ASHAs)aswellasCPCandSchoolManagementCommittee(SMC)membersatthecommunitylevel.
We also consulted high-level representatives of UNICEF India Country and State Offices, district-
level officials as well as implementing partner staff who could provide an institutional perspective
and/orbackgroundinformationontheprogram. Incombinationwithathoroughdeskreview,their
testimonies were particularly relevant when addressing questions on program implementation and
relevance.
In-Depth Interviews (In-Depth Interviews (IDIs)) are one-on-one guided interviews that aim to
elicitdepth(ratherthanbreadth)ofinformationthroughconversationwithindividualrespondents.
Interviewing Adolescent Girls Group (GG) and ABG members as well as peer educators enabled
us to assess the knowledge gained by adolescent beneficiaries as well as the extent to which -
and how - they integrated and adopted their learnings into their attitudes and behaviors. They also
helpedusidentifydemand-sideconcerns,issuesandbarriers. Theinterviewsweresemi-structured,
relyingonacombinationofbothopenandclosedquestions. Thus,theresearchteamhadsufficient
control of the structure of the data collected while allowing for additional relevant data to be
shared by the respondents. In each village, we attempted to interview an equal number of female
and male adolescent group members (provided both GGs and ABGs exist in the respective village).
DisaggregatingIDIrespondentsbyageandgenderhelpedustopayspecialattentiontotheneedsand
vulnerabilities of adolescent girls and boys as well as younger and older adolescents. Conducting

Data Collection In total, we included 162 people in the qualitative component of the study. In
August 2020, when COVID-19 restrictions prevented us from doing face-to-face data collection,
weremotelyinterviewed(viaphone,MicrosoftTeamsandSkype)32IPs,UNICEFstaffatstateand

country level, district officials and other key informants suggested by UNICEF. Between February
and March 2021, once restrictions had eased, the data collection team conducted face-to-face
interviews in four rural villages in each state with 56 adolescent boys and girls aged 16 to 21, 45
frontlineworkersand29parents.
Fourvillagesperstatefromamongeachstate’streatmentarmswererandomlyselected. Following
the initial random selection, UNICEF state offices reviewed the sample to ensure the program had
indeed been implemented in those locations and to assess the feasibility of a field visit based on
the COVID-19 and security situations. In cases where villages had to be removed, a replacement
was again randomly selected. The sampling framework for adolescents and parents aimed for
approximately equal representation of female and male respondents. Adolescents included in the
sample represented part of the adolescent groups formed with the support of UNICEF, either as
regularmembersoraspeereducators. Inallreportingofthestudy,wehaveanonymizedthenames

Analysis MAXQDA software was used to code the data and to elaborate on categories and sub-
categories (coding system) in order to analyze it. We analyzed all transcripts by interpreting text
segments related to the same code and contrasting data from each interview with other interviews
toidentifytrends,similaritiesandcontradictions.

III.D Ethical Considerations and Integration of Gender
Thissectiondiscussesethicsanddataqualityassurance.
Ethical Considerations This impact evaluation follows the United Nations Evaluation Group
Ethical Guidelines. There is no conflict of interest; the evaluation is conducted independently by
C4ED. The impartiality standard is also followed, and the results are presented in an unbiased
manner, with a goal to transparently describe the program’s strengths and weaknesses. The
credibility of the evaluation is granted by the employed methodology as well as the data quality
assuranceprocessthroughoutthedatacollectionandmultipleroundsofthereviewprocessassured
that the data collection firmly adheres to the principles of the conduct of research laid out in the
UNICEF procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children. To address the ethics of the entire
research process, ethical clearance was acquired from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
the University of Mannheim before C4ED was involved in the impact evaluation of the program.
ApprovalforthestudywasgrantedinMay2015. InSeptember2020,theIRBfurtherapprovedthe
start of the endline data collection. Additionally approval from the IRB at the Catalyst Foundation
inIndiawasapprovedinJuly2020.
Prior to engaging respondents for data collection, C4ED follows a thorough informed consent
procedure for participation in the study. This includes providing prospective respondents with the
opportunity to ask questions and to terminate data collection without repercussions at any time.
For respondents under 18 years of age, parental informed consent had to be acquired together
with an adolescent’s assent indicating their willingness to take part in the interview. C4ED keeps
all participant data confidential by encrypting and/or removing from the data any identifying

and interview grids were adapted to the local context with the help of UNICEF. Moreover, all the
enumerators and qualitative researchers received training on basic ethics and, in particular, ethical
behaviorduringtheinterviewprocess.
COVID-19 The highest priority of C4ED is the health and safety of staff, field teams, and the
communities in which we work. Together with UNICEF India, the country situation was critically
assessed and necessary measures implemented to protect staff and respondents (in line with all
nationalguidelinesandrestrictions). Datacollectionwasonlyconductedwhentheepidemiological

COVID-19 assessments. Enumerators were asked to isolate if any COVID-19 symptom was
detected.
III.E Data Quality Assurance
Quantitative Component Before the start of data collection, questionnaires were extensively
piloted and fine-tuned to ensure their relevance for the local context. Field teams were trained on
the different questionnaire modules and survey ethics by the research team at C4ED. During data
collection, real-time checks were conducted to assure high-quality data. Those checks included,
i.a., average interview duration, response distribution of key outcome variables and outliers. The
progress of completed interviews by day and enumerator was closely monitored during the full
period of data collection. Additionally, back checks as well as spot checks of a random sample
wererealized. Incasethatanysuspiciouspatternsweredetected,themostconvenientactionswere
taken to improve data quality. Finally, interviewer assignment to villages were independent of the
treatment status of the villages. During analysis and report writing, peer reviewers and UNICEF
reviewedtheworkingdocumentstoassurequality. Inthiscourse,draftfindingswerealsopresented
to UNICEF ROSA and UNICEF India to provide feedback. Likewise, the Pre-analysis Plan (PAP)
for the evaluation was presented and discussed with reference group composed of UNICEF ROSA
and UNICEF India staff from different sections, including the independent Evaluation Sections of
bothoffices. Qualityofresultsarealsoassuredapplyingdifferentrobustnesschecks(e.g.,running
different regression specifications, multiple hypothesis testing). All flagged interviews - due to
suspicious data quality - were excluded from the main analysis. All estimations include fixed
effectsforeachenumerator.
Qualitative Component The qualitative evaluation team ensured high-quality data collection
through regular and rigorous quality assurance at every stage. Prior to beginning data collection,

III.F Limitations
Deviations from the Original Evaluation Design in Andhra Pradesh Given deviations in the
sampleandinprogramimplementationoutlinedinSectionsI.CandI.D,resultsinAndhraPradesh
should be considered with care. Adolescent and parent groups were only implemented in a small
subsetoftreatmentblocksinthestate,comparedtotheoriginaldesign. Theremainingblocksonly
received a “light-touch” implementation, implying that the effect in those areas would be muted,
compared to the treatment in the 5 blocks with intense implementation. Since implementation
in these chosen blocks was decided for strategic reasons, it is hard to disentangle the reasons for
this selection into treatment. Also, seven small blocks were dropped from the sample because of
their relatively small size during sampling (0.5% of all villages), although the relative small size
of these blocks entails that results for the state are likely unaffected by this change. To account for
the implications of these changes on results at the aggregate level, Section A.III.E.2 in Appendix
A.III.E shows results for main outcomes excluding Andhra Pradesh. All in all, evaluation results
for final outcomes hold when excluding from the analysis treatment and control areas of Andhra
Pradesh.
Low Power in Key and Intermediate Outcomes The power calculations with the block level design
(including 82 or 72 blocks) shows that certain indicators are heavily underpowered. For instance,
pregnancy, and many adolescent empowerment outcomes, and parent related indicators all have
power values that lie below the normally accepted threshold of 80%. The village level design was
suggested as a work-around to allow more power to these indicators (as can be seen in the power
tablesatvillagelevel). Howeverlowimplementationfidelityforthesecondlevelofrandomization
Chapter2: Methodology 39
implied that this design has to be modified at endline, to stick to block level analysis. This low
power cannot be countered with a higher sample size, as additional power calculations (during
inception stage) showed that even much larger sample sizes than in the current study would not be
abletoincreasepowertoasufficientlevelfortheseoutcomes.
LowImplementationFidelityatSecond-levelofRandomizationInordertoacquiremorepower
forkeyoutcomes,andalsotounderstandwhichmodalitiesmightyieldhigherimpactonoutcomes,
thesecond-levelofrandomizationwasproposedinallfourstates. Ascanbeseenintheimplemen-
tation section, there was low implementation fidelity, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh,
while Assam was not sufficiently close either. In order to still capture the effects of the Plus
Package a larger sample of treatment arms village were included from the states of West Bengal
and Jharkhand. However, given the absence of implementation in a large majority of villages, the
effectsfromthePlusPackageanalysisontheentiresamplemaybeunderstated.
Inability to implement LATE Estimation In order to tackle the problems with implementation
fidelity, LATE or an instrumental variable estimation might be an alternative. Here we first regress
the treatment status (self reported in our case) on treatment assignment, and thereafter regress the
outcomes on the treatment assignment (predicted values from the first stage).18 Given that overall
reportedtreatmentstatus(evenwiththemostopen-endeddefinitionofAEPimplementation19)was
only as high as 32%, we expect considerable bias with the LATE estimates. However, the validity
oftheinstrument(treatmentstatus)isquestionableinthiscase,asevidencebythelowF-testvalue.
This implies that we cannot be certain that the instrument is strong enough. Additionally, none of
the first stage results are significant, implying that none of the treatment status variables are able
to predict the treatment assignment, implying that the second stage is not feasible. Therefore, the
evaluationteamisalsounabletoreliablyestimateresultsfromaLATEestimationtoaccommodate
concerns related to selection bias in the sample, arising from partial compliance of treatment
assignment. With slightly higher reported implementation values, LATE would have been an
appropriatestrategy,however,thelongperiodbetweentheendoftheprogramandtheendlinedata
collection severely reduced the possiblity to use this approach to account for issues with partial
complianceandITTestimation.

MISdataisonlyavailableattheGPlevel. Inthesestates,implementationcompliancewithtreatment
arms at the village-level cannot be accurately measured. In Assam, Jharkhand and West Bengal,
conversations with IPs revealed that parents and boys groups were implemented in Plus Package
villages, although not necessarily in all, and in a small number of Basic Package villages. To
address these limitations, the evaluation team, together with UNICEF, modified the sampling
design to include additional villages in states areas where the original design had been followed.

Implementation Intensity, Implementation Approach and Timing of Measuring Outcomes
The intensity of implementation changed during the period of program implementation and the
overalldurationofthemainimplementationphasewasshort,about2,5years(summer2017toend
of 2019). Moreover, the program was implemented by several local implementing partners across
and within states, with differing approaches. In this line, program intensity varied between and
within states, and over time. To change deeply rooted social norms and traditions a longer period
ofimplementationmayneedtoberequired,atleastthiswastheoriginalconcern. Thediversityof
implementation approaches across and within states poses complications to accurately assess the
aspects of the AEP that led to changes, or lack thereof, in outcomes of interest of the evaluation.
Although the evaluation is still able to find whether the combination of these implementation
approaches was able to cause change or not. In this case, the results from the Plus package
estimationsaremorereliableinestablishingtheeffectofparticularprogrammodalities,overother
modalities.
SamplingFrameThesamplingframewasbasedonthelistofcensusvillagesforthe2011census.
Insomecases,thislistwasinaccurate,e.g.,thevillagewasnotinhabited. Inothercases,thevillage
could not be found. Six villages in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, and West Bengal were replaced for
thesereasons. Inothercases,villageswerelocatedbutonlyafterconsiderableeffort.
Marriage Rates Reported rates of adolescent marriage and pregnancy were lower than expected.
Despite significant communication with the field team on this matter, rates remained low. The
nature of the survey, i.e., its focus on child marriage and related issues, combined with the fact
that it is illegal to marry under the age of 18 could have led respondents to underreport adolescent
marriages. To account for this, the evaluation considered other indicators on adolescent marriage
such as “Adolescent has a friend of his/her age and gender that is married”. However, no changes
inprogrameffectswereobservedwhenusingthesealternativeindicators.
COVID-19TheevaluationoftheprogramstartedrightbeforetheCOVID-19worldwideoutbreak
at the end of 2019, and experienced several hardships and delays due the prolonged lockdowns
that followed. Even though the evaluation process successfully adapted to the new conditions,
data was collected a significant time after the end of the program. This is very likely to have
caused issues related to recall within the data. This bias is mostly relevant for the self-reported
implementation data, while other intermediate and higher level outcomes are unlikely to suffer
from it. We do observe low reported implementation in our data, with the highest such indicator
allowing 32% implementation. A more conservation but likely indicator yields only around 11%
self-reportedimplementation. Amoredilutedeffectonthemainandintermediateoutcomescanbe
Chapter2: Methodology 41
as a result of COVID-19. The pandemic has also been shown to have significant adverse impacts
on the learning, health and wellbeing of adolescents. COVID-19 could thus have diluted some of
program effects between the end of program implementation and September 2021, when data was
collected. COVID-19 lockdowns had a particularly negative effect in education access, preventing
many adolescents from attending schools. To account for this, the evaluation considers schooling
rates using different indicators, including current school attendance, past school attendance20, and
attitudestowardseducation.
Missing Baseline Data A drawback of the evaluation was the absence of high quality baseline
data within the treatment units, i.e. all 82 blocks. While the current evaluation uses the Census
2011 as a basis, this data is not the latest for all outcomes, such as access to schools, and other
public utilize. . Additionally, other sources of biases, that could have that would be necessary
to check for differences in access to the health centers, digital media and communication access
were not captured, which affect program outcomes. The information on adolescent empowerment
outcomes at baseline, for instance were missing and derived from a much smaller baseline survey
done in 2016. A larger baseline survey would have allowed a much more accurate representation
ofadolescentandparentoutcomes.
QualitativeComponentDuetolimitedresources,thequalitativecomponentwaslimitedinscope
at endline. Findings from the qualitative component of the evaluation by their very nature cannot
be generalized to an entire population or to other settings. In order to nevertheless strengthen the
reliability of the results, the sampling methodology ensures the inclusion of a variety of affected
groups. To maximize the internal validity of the evaluation findings, the qualitative component
usesavarietyofdatasources.
III.G Outcome Indicators
Outcome indicators for this study have been developed to address evaluation questions relating
to final and intermediary outcomes, together with implementation fidelity and relevance. These
indicators were designed to capture changes provoked by the AEP through the different phases
outlined in the Theory of Change. These include main outcomes outlined in the Theory of
Change - child marriage, early pregnancy, and education; intermediary outcomes, indicators on
implementation fidelity and qualitative outcomes. An exhaustive list of indicators used as part
of this evaluation, together with details of how these were constructed is provided in Appendix
O.IV.A.

in case of absence, a knowledgeable adult to provide answers on the whole household by answering a

• Marriage: To capture the child marriage incidence, the household head was asked about the age
ofallhouseholdmembers,and,fewquestionslater,whetherthishouseholdmemberwasmarried.
SeeTable3.5forthemainmarriageresults.
• Pregnancy: In order to capture the prevalence of child pregnancy, we asked the household head
abouttheageofallhouseholdmembers,and,fewquestionslater,whetherthishouseholdmember
has any children to whom she has given birth, conditional on them being a female and being
married, widowed,ordivorced. Weadditionallyaskedabouttheageoftheoldestchildtheyhave

• Education: To capture educational information, we asked the household head about whether
household members were currently attending any school or education institution. See Table 3.12
forthemaineducationresults.
Tocaptureprogrameffectsondifferentadolescentagegroups,mainoutcomeindicatorswereconstructed
for adolescents in different age brackets. To construct these indicators, young adults (up to 23) were
consideredsincethesewereadolescentsatthetimeofprogramimplementation(2015-2019). Formarriage
and pregnancy, age brackets for main outcomes refer to age at the time of marriage or pregnancy,
adolescents may now be older (up to 23) based on years since marriage. The different age brackets
consideredformainoutcomesare:
• Adolescentsaged10to19-UNICEFDefinitionofadolescent.
• Adolescentsaged10to17-Illegalageofmarriageforbothgirlsandboyswherechildmarriageis

• Adolescentsaged15to17-Illegalageofmarriageforbothgirlsandboyswherechildmarriageis

• Adolescentsaged18to21-Illegalageofmarriageforboysandlegalforgirls.
ImplementationFidelityToassesstheextentandscopeofprogramimplementation,theevaluation
also considers different program compliance indicators. Compliance indicators stem from two
sources, which are triangulated to assess program implementation from different angles: (1)
Program monitoring data from the QPMS and (2) the participation module administered as part
of the endline survey and questionnaires with community leaders. This information is used to
investigate if the AEP was conducted as planned in terms of coverage (i.e., if activities were
implementedinareasthatwereassignedtotreatmentandnoprogramactivitieswereadministered
tocontrolareas),intensity(i.e.,thesharerespondentsineachvillagewhoreceivedtheintervention),
andduration(i.e.,programactivitiesfinishedwhenplanned).
Chapter2: Methodology 43
Intermediate Outcomes Intermediate outcomes were conceived in the Theory of Change as
potential drivers of change. They are closely aligned with program activities, capturing changes
in adolescent well-being, communication, social norms and service provision. Information to
assess changes within different sub-topics of these intermediate outcomes was collected through
surveys with adolescents, parents, and community leaders and through the qualitative component.
Sub-topics in relation to adolescents’ empowerment, include indicators that identify adolescents’
awareness of their rights and healthy practices, their self-efficacy (e.g., confidence, agency, and
aspirations), as well as peer-group and parents’ support. Additionally, to identify the role of
additional activities with boys (plus package), we examine if these activities have led to a change
inboys’andattitudestorelevanttopics,especiallytowardsgendernorms. Sub-topicsinrelationto
socialnormsincludechangesinsocialnormsandpractices,genderegalitarianviewsordisapproval
of violence, discrimination and child marriage. Sub-topics in terms of communication consider
changes in communication competence, intergenerational and intragenerational dialogue. Finally,
the capacity, access to and awareness of adolescent-relevant government services as well as their
uptakeareinvestigated.
Final Outcomes The final outcomes are measured in three main indicators: Adolescents being
married,adolescentswhoareenrolledinschool,andadolescentgirlswhowereeverpregnant.
Qualitative Outcomes Qualitative outcomes were developed through qualitative content analysis
toprovidenuancedtofindingsfromthequantitativecomponentandtoaddressevaluationquestions
in relation to the relevance of the program. Using MAXQDA, a qualitative content analysis of
the transcribed and translated KIIs was conducted. Qualitative content analysis here refers to the
“subjective interpretation of the content of text data through the systematic classification process
ofcodingandidentifyingthemesorpatterns”(?,p. 1278). Inlinewithdirectcontentanalysis,the
codes were developed mainly deductively by drawing from the ToC as well as from the qualitative
evaluationmatrix. Additionally,somecategoriesweregeneratedinductivelybasedoninsightfrom
transcribed interviews. All interviews were coded by a coder of the C4ED office in Mannheim in
close cooperation with surveyors who conducted the interviews. To ensure the anonymity of the
KIs,identifyinginformation(suchasnames,workplaceorjobtitle)wasomittedorenciphered.
III.H Integration of Gender and Equity in the Methodology
Gender and equity belong to the core topics of the AEP. Consequently, the impact evaluation
addressed these subjects at various stages, both in the quantitative and qualitative components.
This section summarizes to what extent and how gender and equity were considered in the design
andanalysisoftheevaluation.

or on reproductive health for adolescent girls, main and intermediary outcomes of interest in the
evaluation. To observe gender-disaggregated results for all outcomes, the sample was stratified on
gender,whereabout43%oftheadolescentsamplewascomposedbymalesand57%byfemales. A
gender-balanced sample allowed to conduct a heterogeneity analysis by gender, estimating results
for adolescent boys and girls separately. This same exercise was repeated for parents. Likewise,
equitywasconsideredintheheterogeneityanalysis,whichanalyzedresultsforpoorandverypoor
individualsseparately. TheanalysisalsoincorporatedgenderaspartoftheITTandLATEestimation,
includinggenderasbasicexogenousindividual-levelvariable. Finally,genderandequitywerealso
considered in the quantitative data collection tools. Several questions about gender attitudes as
wellasreproductivehealthpracticesforgirlswereincludedinthequestionnaire. Thesedatapoints
were used to answer evaluation questions relating to early pregnancy or gender egalitarian norms
andattitudes.
Qualitative Considerations about gender and equity were equally included in the sampling ap-
proach and analysis for the qualitative component. The qualitative component purposely sampled
individualsfromvulnerablegroupstoanalyzeequityinprogrameffects. Todothis,theevaluation
team approached community leaders in pre-selected villages and asked to nominate individuals
who faced social, political or economic marginalization, paying special attention to gender equity
components. Together with this, IDI respondents were disaggregated by age and gender allowing
topayspecialattentiontotheneedsandvulnerabilitiesofadolescentgirlsandboys.
Likewise, the groups for the FGDs were carefully composed to maximize respondents’ willingness
to openly express their opinions, considering social norms and power relationships (for instance,
separatingbygender). Inthisline,oneFGDwithmothersandoneFGDwithfatherswasconducted
per village. These were conducted in separate locations within the village to create an positive
environment for addressing sensitive topics relating to gender norms and attitudes. Finally, data

CHAPTER
Findings
This chapter presents key findings from this evaluation. These are based on endline survey data
collected after the end of the AEP and on MIS program data, collected during program implemen-
tation. Section I. starts with a description of key characteristics of respondents in the sample,
combining both treatment and control areas and drawing comparisons with official statistics and
related studies. This way, the section provides a snapshot of the specific population of interest
- individuals eligible for the program - for whom the results presented thereafter hold. Section
II. continues to lay out evidence on implementation fidelity, assessing program implementation,
awareness, exposure, and uptake; capturing program main inputs and their limitations. Building
upon this background information, main results are presented in Section III.A, addressing effec-
tiveness/impact evaluation questions. First, causal changes in child marriage, early pregnancies,
andeducationare explored. Second, tobetterunderstandthe driversofchangeor thelackthereof,
Section III.B, explores causal changes in program’s outputs and intermediate outcomes, includ-
ing changes in adolescent empowerment, communication, and social norms. Finally, Section V.

This section does not intend to observe differences between treatment and control groups, but to
obtain a picture of basic characteristics disaggregated by gender from respondents in the whole
sample at the time of data collection. Data for this sample was collected from February to March
2021 in Jharkhand and from October to September 2021 for Andhra Pradesh, Assam and West
Bengal.

The average adolescent in the sample was 16 years of age and lived in a household of 5, within a
relatively small village (<1000 inhabitants). A majority of these households (78%) held a Below

quarters (74%) of young adolescents (aged 10 to 14) reported attending secondary school. This
rate was slightly higher (+4pp) for girls than for boys. When looking at older adolescents, those
aged 15 to 21, a similar share reported attending secondary education or college (72%). Again,

attendance was significantly lower among married adolescents. Only 17% of married adolescent
girlsreportedattendingsecondaryorprimaryschoolwhileonly5%ofmarriedboysdidso. Inthis
line, boys were also more likely to dropout of school before grade 9 (13.5% of boys versus 10.5%
of girls). A majority of respondents, 85%, wanted to continue education in the sample. However,
negativeattitudestowardseducationstillexisted. Forinstance,12%ofrespondentsconsideredthat

andparentsregardlessoftheirgender.
When it comes to adolescent empowerment, adolescents were usually aware of some of their
rights. Adolescents and parents were asked about children rights. On average, adolescents were
familiar with 88% of the adolescent rights they were asked about. For instance, a majority of
adolescents (96%) knew their right to receive education. Considerably less (73%) was aware of
their right to decide when to get married. 18% was not aware of their right to receive protection
against sexual violence. Surprisingly, awareness of adolescent rights was higher among married
adolescents. In thisline, 98% ofmarried adolescents wasaware of theirright to receiveeducation
and92%wasawaretheyhadtherighttodecidewhentogetmarried. Likewise,alowershare(7%)
was not aware of their right to receive protection against sexual violence. These rates were not
significantly different between married adolescent girls or boys. It is important to mind that rates
on awareness of adolescent rights among married adolescents are derived from a small share of
adolescentswhoreportedbeingmarried,andshouldthusbeconsideredwithcare.
However, when it comes to confidence in their communities or in their day-to-day activities,
adolescent empowerment was weakened. Only 47% felt confident expressing their needs to
public officials and just 29% felt confident going to the local market alone. Gender differences
exist-adolescentgirlsfeltconsiderablylessconfidentdoingday-to-dayactivities(-5pp).
Adolescentgirlsshowedworseratesintermsofmentalwell-beingandself-efficacy. TheWorld
Health Organization - Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) was employed as a short self-reported

with 100% indicating a very strong feeling of being in control. Gender disparities were present in
some of the items of the scale. For instance, when compared to adolescent boys, adolescent girls

More thana fifthof adolescentsreported havingexperienced corporalpunishments athome

considered it was acceptable to punish their daughter if she did not obey. Just 33% reported that
physical violence was not acceptable under any situation. Rates of violence experience among
adolescents were considerable. More than a fifth of adolescents reported having experienced
corporal punishments at home or in school. On average, adolescents reported having experienced

Socialnormsintreatmentandcontrolareaswerenotgenderegalitarian. Toassessprevailing
social norms, adolescents and parents were asked about their views on gender roles. To test this, a
scalefrom? whichcapturestheroleofwomen/girlsvs. men/boysinthepublicandprivatesphere
was used. On average, respondents answered positively 15.1% of the questions on the gender role
models scale (0-14 items), i.e., presented egalitarian beliefs about gender norms. For instance,
only 21% of respondents agreed that daughters should have the same chance of working outside

II. Program Implementation, Exposure and Uptake
This section explores program implementation and exposure in program-assigned areas. To tri-
angulate the scope of implementation, program documentation is contrasted with accounts from
surveyrespondentsintreatmentareas. ThisisdonecontrastingMISandendlinesurveydata.Then,a
comparisonofprogramimplementationinprogram-assignedandnon-programareasusingendline
surveydataispresented.
ImplementationFidelity-KeyFindings
Keyfindingsthatemergefromthissectioninrelationtoevaluationquestionsare:
EQ.1.1. Wastheprogramimplementedasplannedintheassignedareas?
• Based on endline survey data, implementation reach in treatment areas was modest. At least one

• Respondents were more frequently aware of AEP training or workshops when compared to other
AEPacitivites(15%).
• Due to the sampling criteria all respondents to qualitative interviews were aware of the program

• TheaveragerespondenttookpartinanAEPactivityforthelasttime2.3yearsago,inJune2019.
• Due to the sampling criteria for qualitative interviews, respondents had all engaged with the
program in some manner. However respondents mentioned a number of barriers to accessing
or becoming engaged with the AEP, broadly along the categories of traditional beliefs, gender
differences,availabilityoftimeandlackofrelevance.
II.A Program-assigned Areas
Table 3.2 uses MIS program monitoring information provided by UNICEF’s IPs. This includes key
aspectssuchaswhat,where,andwhenprogramIPs’activitieswereimplemented. Allareaswhere
no information from any IPs is available are assumed to have not received any activities (are set to
zero).
An important note is that information for Andhra Pradesh and Assam is considered at the village
level, i.e., if at least one adolescent or parent group exists in the village, this village is counted as
having received treatment. In Jharkhand and West Bengal, however, information was provided at
the GP-level which implies a more generous counting. If at least one adolescent group existed in
theGP,allvillagesarecountedashavingreceivedtreatment.6
Based on MIS data, the reach of adolescent groups and CPC was modest in Andhra Pradesh.
According to monitoring data, girls’, boys’ and parent groups were implemented in a minority
of villages (<15%). That is, while girls’ groups were supposed to be implemented in all 52
villagesassignedtoatreatmentarm,theywereonlyimplementedinsixvillagesbasedonprogram
monitoring data. Likewise, CPCs and referrals were only used in 12% of treatment villages. The
limited reach of AEP implementation in Andhra Pradesh is aligned with project documents from
implementingpartnersinAndhraPradesh.
In Assam, program implementation had a good reach. Together with this, MIS data hints that
6Based on MIS information, the sampling level was defined independently by each state. Therefore, direct
comparisonsfromMISimplementationdatacannotbedrawnacrossstates. Thesamplinglevelforeachstateisfollows:
Assam: villagelevel;AndhraPradesh: villagelevel;Jharkhand: GPlevel;WestBengal: GPlevel.
Chapter3: Findings 55
programimplementationdidnotalwaysfollowtheoriginalevaluationassignment. InAssam,girls’
and boys’ adolescents groups were implemented in a majority of villages (<75%), while parent
groups were implemented in 44% of villages. Following the evaluation design, both parent and
boys’ groups were supposed to be implemented in 20 out of 80 treatment villages (25%).7 This
means that based on MIS data, both parent and boys’ groups were implemented in a higher share
of villages than originally intended. This information was confirmed by project documents from
implementationpartnersinAssam. CPCswereimplementedinmorethanthreequartersofvillages
in the treatment group (79%). Of these, a majority had an active action plan (70%) and had met
at least once (76%). Referral services were used in less than one third of treatment villages. In
this line, at least one girl was referred to health services in 30% of treatment villages. Referrals to
educationschemeswereusedin23%ofvillagesandreferralstomarriageschemesin24%
InJharkhand,programimplementationreachedvillagesinamajorityofGPs. Adolescentand
parent groups and CPCs were implemented in a large majority of villages in Jharkhand (<90%).
However, the exact number of villages reached within each GP is not known from MIS data, so this
figure is probably overstated. A majority of CPCs also had conducted at least one meeting (94%)
and had an active action plan (80%). Adolescent girls were also referred to health, education and
marriageservicesinamajorityofvillages.
BasedonMISdata,programimplementationalsohadagoodreachinWestBengal. Adolescent
and parent groups were implemented in villages of a majority of GPs in West Bengal (<95%),
Similarly, CPC were functioning in a majority of villages, although few had an active action plan
(19%) and 30% never conducted a meeting. Referrals for adolescent girls to health and education
services were given in a majority of villages (<90%),. Referrals to marriage services were less
frequent but still common. As in the case of Jharkhand, the exact village-level reach of program
implementationcannotbeknownfromMISdata,sothesefiguresareprobablyoverstated.

However,relativetoMISdata,self-reportedsurveydatahintsthattheimplementationforAEP
hadamoremoderatereach. Table3.3presentsimplementationandcomplianceindicatorsbased
onendlinesurveydata. Self-reportedimplementationevidenceisavailableforthetreatmentgroup
by main respondent (adolescents, parents, and community leaders). This information is helpful to
triangulatethereachandscopeofactivitiesimplementedaspartoftheAEP.
To identify individuals and villages that were actually reached by the program, respondents were
asked whether any of the following events with or about children and adolescents had taken place
intheirvillageinthelastfouryears: trainingorworkshop,groupsessions,trainingsrestrictedtoa
selected group of participants, group games, public gathering or sports events. Then, respondents
wereaskedabouttheformalnameoftheinstitutionimplementingtheevent,trainingorworkshop.
Respondents who were aware of at least one event implemented by UNICEF, an IP 8, or an event
focusing on a topic related to the AEP were identified as compliers9. Based on this information,
villages where at least one respondent was aware of an AEP event were identified. Following this,
respondents were asked whether they had been invited to these events and whether they had taken
partinthem.
Program awareness: Based on self-reported data, AEP activities reached 64% of treatment
villages. Within a given village, only 16% of respondents on average were aware of an AEP
activity implemented in their area. This hints that the breadth of program implementation, the
number of villages that were reached, was more significant than the depth of program implemen-
tation,thenumberofindividualsreachedwithineachvillage.
Whilerevealing,itisalsoimportanttonotethatonlyrespondentswhocouldidentifythenameofthe

was identified as “reached by the program”. Given that activities could have been implemented

19, recall bias could play an important role in low levels of reported program awareness. Thus, it
wasattemptedtoaddressthisproblembyencouragingtheenumeratorstouseadditionaltechniques
so that respondents are encouraged to remember the events.10 In this line, many respondents
answered they had forgotten about the name of the implementing organization when asked about

in their area. Training or workshops were the most frequent events reported by respondents.11
Considering QPMS and self-reported survey data combined, at least 94% of treatment villages had
arespondentawareofanAEPevent.
Program characteristics: A majority of respondents aware of any AEP-related event (85%)
were invited to take part in them. Panel B shows event characteristics reported by respondents
thatwereawareofatleastoneAEPevent,regardlessofwhethertheytookpartinthem. Statisticsare
only presented for respondents who were aware of any AEP-related event in their village (N=667).
Invitations were more commonly received from other adolescents, family members, teachers or
school officials (Figure 3.1a). Participants in AEP events were reported to be diverse. More than
halfofrespondents(66%)reportotheradolescentfriendsorrelativesattendedtheevent. Likewise,
more than a third of respondents reported participation from NGO representatives, school officials
orotheradolescents.
Based on information from respondents in treatment areas, AEP events usually addressed
relevant topics for the AEP, such as early marriage, and were mostly attended by adolescents
aged 15 to 19. As intended, participants report that a majority of AEP events addressed topics of
early marriage (83%), education (73%), or early pregnancy (72%) amongst others (Figure 3.1b).

andcontrolareas. ThisinformationisusefultotriangulatetheextentofAEPreachwithintreatment
areasandtoassesspotentialspilloversincontrolareas.
Table 3.4 displays effects from a set of Ordinarly Least Squares (OLS) estimation results using
endline survey information on several indicators of program awareness and uptake. Part I of the
table considers program effects on overall program awareness, while Part II focuses on program
uptake.
AwarenessofAEPactivitieswashigheramongrespondentsintreatmentareas,withdifferent
levels of program awareness across states. Overall, respondents in treatment areas were 11pp
more likely to be aware of AEP activities than respondents in control areas. Andhra Pradesh and
West Bengal report the highest levels of awareness within treatment areas. In treatment blocks of
AndhraPradesh,respondentswere15.6ppmorelikelytobeawareofAEPactivitiesthanrespondents
in control areas. That is, in treatment areas of Andhra Pradesh, 26% of respondents were aware
of any AEP activities in their village. This lies in contrast to MIS data which suggest the reach of
AEP activities in Andhra Pradesh was more limited. In treatment areas of West Bengal, 23% of
respondents(18ppoverthecontrolgroupshare)wasawareofAEPactivitiesintheirvillage.
AsmallshareofrespondentsincontrolareaswasawareofAEPactivities. However,spillovers
were more frequent in Andhra Pradesh. Within the control group, 4% of respondents were
awareofAEPactivities,hintingthatspillovers(exposureofrespondentstoAEPactivitiesincontrol
areas)waslow. IncontrolblocksofAndhraPradesh,theshareofrespondentswhichwasawareof
AEP activities in their village was considerably higher (11%). This hints that AEP implementation
tookplaceinsomecontrolvillagesofAndhraPradesh,whichprogressreportsfromimplementing
partnersconfirm.
AwarenessofIPCs/mid-mediaactivitieswaslowamongrespondentsintreatmentandcontrol
areas. To capture awareness of IPCs/mid-media activities, respondents were asked whether they
were aware of any public gathering or sports events in their village in the past four years. Overall
awareness of IPCs/mid-media activities among both the treatment and control group was very low
(4.6%). Respondents in treatment areas were slightly more aware (+2.9pp) of IPCs/mid-media
activitiesthanrespondentsincontrolareas.

the past four years, including for instance life skills trainings. Overall, adolescent girls were
more likely to participate in activities than boys. The control mean for variables in Part II of
the table hints that a share of participants in control areas took part in activities similar to those
implemented by the AEP, but not necessarily implemented as part of it. That is, respondents in
control areas may have benefited from trainings which were not delivered as part of the AEP. This
isparticularlytrueinthecaseofAndhraPradeshwhere18%ofrespondentsincontrolareasreport

III. Impact of the Program (Program Effectiveness)
Thissectionpresentsresultsfromfinalandintermediateoutcomestoaddressevaluationquestions
on program effectiveness. Section III.A presents results for final outcomes (child marriage, child
pregnancy, education), while Section III.B follows with a closer look into potential drivers of
change (adolescent empowerment, communication, social norms, and service provision). To
increase the learning, all results are further disaggregated by comparing the program’s impacts by
State, treatment package, and heterogeneous characteristics (poverty and adolescents’ age group).
The section ends by addressing potential limitations of the main and LATE analysis in a set of
robustnessanalyses(SectionIV.).

reductionintheincidenceofchildmarriageamongadolescentgirlsandboys. Respondentsinqualitative
interviewsreportedageneraldecreaseinchildmarriageratesoverthepastdecade. However,thiscannot
be directly attributed to the program as this decreased seems to have happened in both treatment and

Overall Impact Considering results from all states combined, there is no evidence that the AEP led to a
reduction in the incidence of child pregnancy among adolescent girls. Evidence from both quantitative
andqualitativeinterviewspointthatearlypregnancyisrareamongadolescentgirlsinbothtreatmentand

thehousehold. Asaresult,estimationsforstate-levelresultsarestatisticallyfragile.
EQ.3.3. Didtheprogramleadtoanincreaseinschoolenrollment?
Overall Impact Considering aggregate results from all states, the AEP had a very limited effect in
increasing school attendance rates for adolescent in the sample. Overall results only show a small,
statistically significant increase in school attendance among adolescent girls aged 10 to 19 (+1.7pp).
However,moresignificantresultsarefoundwithinsomestates:

The presentation of the findings takes place within three tables per outcome. The results for the
Basic Package are discussed in the first table, where the sample combining results from all states,
the overall pooled sample, and the four state disaggregated samples are presented in five panels,
similar to the preceding sections (e.g., Tables 3.5). The second table for each outcome explores
the effects from the overall Plus Package in the first panel and the differential effect of the various
treatment arms in the second (Table 3.6). The final table explores the heterogeneous effects when
disaggregating by the reported poverty status of the treated households and by adolescents’ age
group.
Chapter3: Findings 67
The results for Tables 3.5 and 3.6, for the child marriage indicator, are explained in detail, such
that the overall interpretation of the various coefficients and statistics in all the tables is thereafter
intuitive for the reader. For the other outcomes, the interpretation per table will remain shorter, in

InterpretationoftheResults
Inthisevaluation,wefocusontheso-calledIntention-to-Treat(ITT)effectswhendiscussingtheresults.
This approach de facto measures the effects of an adolescent’s community being randomly assigned to
the program, or not. In this sense, ITT ignores the influence of factors that happened after the random
assignment to the program, such as non-delivery or partial delivery of the program, non-compliance,
withdrawal, or a general lack of program uptake, as well as deviation from the original assignment
(suchasprogramimplementationincontrolcommunities). Therewithproducingmoreconservative,yet
also more credible (unbiased) estimates for the impacts, given that a lack of program implementation
or deviations from the program are non-random and thus a relationship may exist between the selected
programdelivery/uptakeandtheoutcomesofinterest(e.g.,capturingahigherlevelofempowermentnot
onlybecauseoftheprogram,butalsobecauseitwaspotentiallyselectivelydeliveredtomoreempowered
individuals to start with). Due to non-compliance, the ITT effects will remain an underestimate of the
true effect (?). In other words, the effects on actual direct program participants/ beneficiaries would
certainly be larger in size. Therefore, the evaluators recommend reading and interpreting the results of
this evaluation as being more conservative, yet easier generalizable for policy purposes. What needs to
be kept in mind is the community’s eligibility criteria (original characteristics) for the original program
assignment (i.e., the type of communities that were in the original pool to be either assigned to the
treatmentorcontrolgroup).
III.A.1 ChildMarriage
ReducingtheincidenceofchildmarriagewasakeyobjectiveoftheAEP. Toconstructthisoutcome
indicator, the household head was asked about the age of all household members, and a few
questionslater,whetherhouseholdmembersweremarried,widowed,ordivorcedandforhowlong
they had been in their marital status. Using the information from these questions, age of marriage
was constructed for all adolescents in the ages of 10 to 21 at the time of program implementation.

Consideringresultsfromallstatescombined,theAEPisnotassociatedwithanyreductionin

girls separately. Coefficients in result tables can be interpreted as follows: The mean reported

concludedwithahigherlevelofconfidencethatthedifferenceinmeansbetweenthetwogroupsis

the two groups- when it actually exists. A coefficient with three (two) stars implies that the risk of
falsely concluding no difference in means (where there is one) is as low as 1% (5%). The more
stars that are indicated, the lower is the probability of finding false results, or conversely, being
more confident in our results. Therefore, the evaluation concludes with 90% confidence, that 4

At the state level, more program effects present a diverse picture. In Andhra Pradesh, the AEP
is related with lower child marriage rates for adolescent boys and girls in the treatment
group. The program is associated with a statistically significant reduction in child marriage rates
for adolescents aged 10 to 19 (Part I). In Andhra Pradesh, 4.7% of adolescent boys and girls in
the control group reported being married. This is to say, that out of every 1000 adolescents in the
control group, on average 47 reported being married. The treatment group mean is 2.9pp lower
thanthecontrolgroup(i.e.,1.8%oftheadolescentsinthetreatmentgroupreportedbeingmarried
between the ages of 10 to 19).This result is highly significant, at the 1% significance level. This
reductionalsoholdswhendisaggregatingresultsbygender. TheAEPisassociatedwithareduction
in child marriage rates of 1.6pp among adolescent boys and 4.2pp among adolescent girls. The
reduction in child marriage rates is thus three times higher for adolescent girls in treatment areas
whencomparedwithadolescentboysintreatmentareas.
In Jharkhand, the AEP is associated with a reduction in the share of treated adolescent boys
being married early. This reduction is 2.0pp, i.e., only around 0.3% of the treated boys reported
being married between 10 to 19. Considering results for adolescent boys and girls together, the
Chapter3: Findings 70
program is also associated with a reduction in marriage rates for adolescent boys and girls
of 2.5pp. When disaggregating results by gender, this result appears to be driven primarily by
adolescentboys. Intreatmentareas,20feweradolescentboysoutof1000,reportedbeingmarried,
when compared to adolescent boys in the control group. The reduction in marriage rates is not
statisticallysignificantwhenconsideringresultsforadolescentgirlsalone.
In Assam, unexpectedly, the AEP is associated with an increase in marriage rates for ado-
lescents in treatment areas, by 1.5pp (statistically significant). This increase is mainly driven
by higher rates of child marriage for adolescent girls, where an additional 28 out of 1000 female
adolescents (compared to 15 female adolescents in the control group) reported being married in
the10to19agegroup.
ForWestBengal,theAEPdidnotleadtoaneffectonchildmarriageratesforadolescentboys
or girls. This implies that the adolescents did not report better child marriage outcomes, but also
notworse,thanthecontrolgroup.
When considering program effects on adolescents in different age groups (Parts II, III and
IV), the AEP is only associated with a reduction of child marriage rates for adolescent boys
and girls in Andhra Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh, the program is associated with a consistent,
statistically significant, reduction in child marriage rates among adolescent boys and girls aged 10
to 17 and 15 to 17. This reduction is statistically significant for adolescent boys aged 10 to 17
(-2.4pp) and for adolescent boys aged 15 to 17 (-2.9pp). For adolescent girls, this reduction is only
statistically significant for those aged 10 to 17 (-4.0pp). Additionally, within Parts II and III, a
statistically significant increase of 1.0pp is observed in the child marriage rate for adolescent girls
in Assam. In Part IV, the increase in marriage rates for adolescent girls aged 18 to 21 in Assam is
higher, and statistically significant (+7.2pp). In West Bengal, an increase of 0.3 and 0.5pp in child
marriage rates was reported for adolescent boys aged 10 to 17 and 15 to 17. The former is weakly
significantatthe10%level.
The program appears to have a weak effect on child marriage outcomes for adolescent boys
and girls aged 18 to 21. In Part IV, which focuses on the age bracket where marriage is legal for
girlsbutillegalforboys(18-21),theonlydecreaseinmarriagerateswasreportedamongadolescent
boys and girls in Jharkhand (-3.2pp). This result is however only weakly significant and appears
to be driven primarily by adolescent boys, for whom marriage is still illegal at that age. Together
with this, the AEP is associated with an increase in the marriage rates among males and females in
treatmentareasofAssam(by+2.9and+7.2pp,respectively),andfortheoverallfemalesample(by
+2.5pp).

When considering program effects on adolescent boys and girls together, the Plus Package
showed no additional effects in reducing child marriage. Panel A shows no difference in child
marriage from Plus Package activities for the pooled sample. When disaggregating by gender,
however, there is a small reduction of 0.6pp over the Basic Package effect (i.e., 0.1pp) in child
marriage for boys. In the case of females between 18 to 21 years of age the evaluation observes a
statisticallysignificant,higher,reportedmarriagerateof2.8ppwithintheBasicPackage,compared
tochildmarriageratesinthecontrolgroup.
Disaggregating effects by the treatment groups, a reduction in child marriage rates is observed
across the board in villages that additionally implemented parents groups. Overall, a statisti-
callysignificantreductionof1.3pp(ontopoftheBasicPackage)isreported. Disaggregatingresults
by gender, this reduction equals 1.7pp and 0.9pp lower marriage rates among adolescent girls and
boys, respectively. Comparing Parts II and III, the effects of the PG are smaller, at 0.9pp and 0.8pp
respectively, where the effect is not statistically significant in the older age group (15-17) for the
female sample. In the 10 to17 age group, however, the effects aredriven by the female adolescent
sample,whichareuptoseventimeslargerthanthemaleadolescentsample(15femalescompared
to2males)(columns(5)and(6)).
Within Parts I and III, it can also be observed that villages having ABG+PG or Both groups
experiencedareducedchildmarriagerate,whichisdrivenbyadolescentsaged15to17. Inthisage
group, the female sample for Both groups is the only statistically significant coefficient, compared
toallothertreatmentmodalities. Theadolescentboysgroupsmodalityhadoneweaklysignificant

All in all, the AEP showed no significant effects in reducing child marriage rates when con-
sideringprogrameffectsonyoungerandolderadolescentsseparately. Thisisalsotruewhen
considering program effects on poor and very poor adolescents separately. Table 3.7 and 3.8
shows heterogeneous results by the poverty status and age group of adolescents. Disaggregating
the sample by the poverty status does not appear to show any statistically significant difference
between the control and treatment groups for the Basic Package between poor and very poor ado-
lescents. This is also true when considering results for younger and older adolescents, together or
disaggregatedbygender.
EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
Respondentsinqualitativeinterviewsreportedageneraldecreaseinchildmarriageratesover
thepastdecade. However,inlinewithquantitativeevidence,theymentionedthismaynothave
been necessarily associated with the AEP. All participants speculated that child marriage rates
weredecreasing,notspecificallyinthepreviousyearbutinthepastdecadesmoregenerally. Despite
these declines in child marriages, participants felt that a longer program duration - particularly in
Assam’s tea gardens - could have yielded additional decreases in child marriage rates. A few
participantsstatedthatthegovernment’s(Kanyashree)schemealsohelpedmotivateandencourage

respondents were aware of the legal parameters pertaining to marriage in India (where the legal
age to marry is 18 years for women, 21 years for men) and most felt these ages were appropriate.

only use them as a last resort. Given that most participants reported not knowing of any child
marriage cases, they described what they think they would do, should they learn of such a case.
Most surmised they would talk to the family involved either directly as a group or, more often,
through the local NGO. In this sense, most study participants felt such situations could first be
addressed internally and viewed law enforcement only as a last resort. A few others feared being
blamed or even physically harmed by family and/or the wider community should they attempt to
intervene in a child marriage and thus preferred to keep quiet or, if necessary, to address it as a
group. Two interviewees from West Bengal surmised that efforts to prevent child marriage are
nearly impossible in regions with low levels of education and awareness regarding the negative
consequencesassociatedwiththispractice.

The results on child pregnancy are based on endline survey information captured through the
household roster. The household head was asked about the age of all household members, and, a
few questions later, whether household members have any children to whom she has given birth,
conditional on them being a female and being married, widowed, or divorced. The incidence of
early pregnancy is captured through a dummy (yes/no) indicator for married girls who had their
firstchildwhilebeinganadolescent.

For Panel B, the evaluation disaggregated that effect to find that it was the lower early pregnancy

groups, that drive the results. The PG group on top of Adolescent Girls Group (AGG) led to

Table 3.12 models program effects on current school attendance, disaggregating results by state
gender and age-group. Results are presented for the same adolescent age groups considered in
Tables3.5and3.9.

ofeducation,thesampleincludesadolescentsthatactuallyfellwithintheagecategoryreportedin
the tables at the time of the data collection. Therefore, adolescents in the age groups included in
Parts I to IV, were more likely to have been exposed to the program at the time of implementation
(2015-2019).
Considering aggregate results from all states, the AEP had a very limited effect in increasing
schoolattendanceratesforadolescentboysandgirlsinthesample. However,moresignificant
results are found within some states. The evaluation only finds a small, statistically significant,
increaseinattendancerates(+1.7pp)foradolescentgirls,aged10to19,inprogramareas. Overall,
attendance rates were generally high, in both treatment and control areas (>85%). This was
particularly true for the school attendance rate of adolescent boys and girls aged 10 to 17 (93%).
Givenhighschoolingratesincontrolareas,theAEPonlyhadamarginalcapacitytoincreasethese.
Likewise, it is important to note that COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns might have affected
some of the impacts on educational outcomes driven by the AEP. These factors might explain part
ofthelimitedeffectsoftheAEPoneducationoutcomes.
InAndhraPradesh,theAEPisassociatedwithhigherschoolenrollmentratesforschool-aged
adolescent boys. For adolescent boys aged 10 to 17, the evaluation finds a statistically significant
increase of 3.5pp. When considering older school-aged adolescent boys, those aged 15 to 17, the
effect is stronger and statically significant (+10.8pp). This means that the school attendance rates
for adolescent boys (15-17) in treatment areas of Andhra Pradesh was 85%, an increase of 10.8pp
over the attendance rate in control areas (74%). For adolescent boys aged 18 to 21 the evaluation
finds a strong, statistically significant, negative effect in school attendance rates (-18.6pp).15. No
statistically significant effects on school attendance rates are found for adolescent girls in any age
groupofAndhraPradesh.
In Assam the AEP had a positive impact on school attendance rates among adolescent boys
and girls. When considering together adolescent boys and girls aged 10 to 19, the program had
statistically significant increase of 3.8pp. For adolescent boys this effect is strongly significant
and slightly higher (+4.5pp). This increase in school attendance rates is also observed when

considering adolescent boys in all other age groups. When considering adolescent girls aged 10
to 19, the increase in school attendance is smaller (+3.2pp) and only weakly significant. Likewise,
thisincreaseisnotobservedforadolescentgirlsinotheragegroups.
InJharkhand,theAEPisassociatedwithanincreaseinschoolattendanceratesforadolescent
girls aged 10 to 19. The AEP increased school attendance rates for adolescents aged 10 to 19 by
2.6pp. This increase seems to be mainly driven by the increase (+6.2pp) in school attendance rates
amongadolescentgirlsaged10to19intreatmentareas. Whenlookingatadolescentboysandgirls
together, the evaluation also finds a sizeable, statistically significant, increase in school attendance
foradolescentsaged18to21(+8.5pp).
In West Bengal, the AEP did not lead to any significant increases in attendance rates for
adolescent boys and/or girls. For adolescent girls aged 18 to 21, the evaluation finds a decrease
inattendancerates(-7.5pp),butthisisonlyweaklysignificant.
Table 3.13 disaggregates AEP effects on current schooling into Plus Package and Basic Package
effects.
The AEP Plus Package did not have a systematic additional effect over the Basic Package in
increasingschoolingrates. Theevaluationonlyfindsasmall,weaklysignificant,increaseof1.2pp

be driven by ABGs. Adolescent boys groups are associated with an increase of 2.0pp in schooling

Intermsofheterogeneouseffects,Table3.15showstheAEPisassociatedwithasmallincrease

report heterogeneous program effects on current school attendance. Table 3.15 shows the AEP
is associated with an increase of 2.6pp in the share of older adolescent girls who report they are

It is important to note that as a consequence of the pandemic and resulting lockdowns, several
sources report setbacks and increasing disparities in access to education. To account for this, this
section also discusses AEP effects on adolescents reporting to have been ever enrolled in primary
orsecondaryeducation(TableA.34inAppendixA.III.C).
The evaluation only finds positive effects in the share of adolescents reporting to have been
everenrolledinprimaryorsecondaryeducationinAndhraPradesh. Withinthestatesamples,
the positive effect is observed for this outcome only in Andhra Pradesh. In the state, the Basic

Negative effects are observed for adolescent boys aged 10 to 19 when looking at results from
all states combined. For adolescent boys aged 10 to 19, a small statistically significant reduction
of 0.6pp is observed. This implies that adolescent boys aged 10 to 19 were less likely to report
havingeverattendedprimaryorsecondaryschools. Withayoungeragegroup,ofadolescentboys
aged 10 to 17, the effect persists, while it is insignificant for the age group of 15 to 17. This
goes in line with the declining educational outcomes observed among younger adolescents since
the COVID-19 pandemic started. Older adolescents were more likely to have attended primary
schooling or secondary schooling, before the pandemic related restrictions intercepted the usual
educationalmediumfortheyoungersample. Foradolescentgirls,nostatisticallysignificanteffects

Negative effects are observed for adolescent girls in Assam, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
These effects, averaging a reduction of 8pp, are strongly significant for adolescent girls aged 10 to
19 in the three states. In West Bengal, the reduction is also statistically significant for adolescent
girlsaged18to21.

The evaluation finds positive effects in the share of adolescent girls aged 10 to 14 who have
been ever enrolled in secondary education. There is a statistically significant increase of 3.1pp
foradolescentgirlsaged10to14whohaveeverattendedsecondaryeducation.16 Thiseffectseems

The program had positive overall effects when considering formal years of education. An
increase in 0.3 years of formal education is found among adolescent boys and girls in treatment
areas, when considering results from all states combined. This increase is statistically significant
for both girls and boys. Regarding drop-out rates, a strong, statistically significant, decrease is
observedamongadolescentboysinJharkhand(-7.9pp).
Table A.36 considers AEP effects on educational attitudes. All in all, the program had a modest
effect in shaping educational attitudes. A positive effect is found in the share of adolescents
whowanttocontinuesecondaryeducation. Ahighershareofadolescentboysandgirls(+2.9pp)

boys (+5.8pp), and even more so for adolescent boys in Andhra Pradesh (+10.4pp). For adolescent
girls, there is only a significant increase in Assam (+5.2pp), coupled with a similar, statistically
significant decrease in West Bengal (-4.8pp). The program had no consistent impact in other
indicators capturing attitudes towards education. In this sense, results for males in Jharkhand
appear as particularly inconsistent. The evaluation finds a statistically significant reduction in the
shareofmenwhoagreewiththestatement“Educatingboysismoreimportantthaneducatinggirls”
(-4.9pp). However, among men in treatment areas of Jharkhand, there is also a strong, statistically
significant reduction in the share of men who are willing to send their daughters to secondary
education--17.9ppwhencomparedtomeninthecontrolgroup.
EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
In line with quantitative evidence, the majority of study participants reported high access to
education, high school attendance rates and very low or non-existent drop-out rates. Only
few participants felt that access to education was limited, especially for girls, noting that “parents
consider [girls] a burden” and thus do not allow them to attend schools, particularly when these
are far away from home (CPC head, F, West Bengal). Parents and adults more generally compared
current improvements in school attendance to their youth, remarking that, “once upon a time, rich
people only attended schools and others worked in their houses, but now [...] everyone has the
same rights in studies and all” (Parent (group member), F, Andhra Pradesh). Many also attributed
thesuccessofhighattendanceratestotheAEPactivities. Inparticular,theyhighlightedasinfluential
factors in high enrollment rates and increased school attendance parents’ greater awareness about
theimportanceofeducationandgenderequalityaswellasgirlsbeingencouragedtoattendschool.
Some study participants also identified marriage and increased bride value as factors contributing
to favorable enrollment rates: “unlike in the early days, girls can’t be married if they are illiterate,
sotheireducationisimportantnowadays”(Parent,M,WestBengal).
All participants agreed on the importance of education for adolescents’ development. Al-
though a few adults suggested that 10th or 12th standard was a sufficient level of education, most
adolescentsandadultsalikeagreedthatacollegedegreewasnecessary. Notably,intervieweessug-
gested they had held these views prior to participation in the program, which they saw as possibly
reinforcingbutnotchangingtheirviews. Forotheradolescents,however,thischangeinpercep-
tion was clearly linked to program activities: “We got more concerned about the importance of
education and how a lack of education can affect our life. All this, we realized after attending the
Chapter3: Findings 84
adolescentgroup”(Adolescent(peerleader),M,18,WestBengal).
ReflectingUNICEF’sidentificationofaffordableandgoodqualitysecondaryeducationasoneofthe
main drivers of change against child marriage (?), our study suggests that improved infrastructure
plays an important role in promoting school attendance. Although most villages have a primary
school,manydonothaveahighschooland,intheabsenceofproperroadsorstreetlighting,
parents do not allow their children (especially daughters) to travel further to attend high
school. Several participants stated that government schemes, which for example provide financial
support or free lunches, lessen the burden on parents and play a significant role in encouraging
parents to send their children to school. Some of these schemes are aimed specifically at girls, as
they were traditionally more disadvantaged in terms of accessing education. Some interviewees,
however,observedareversalinthistrend,notingthatboysaredroppingoutofschoolmoreoftenin
ordertoearnmoneywithwhichtosupporttheirfamilies. Whilegirls’drop-outrateshadpreviously
been higher than that of boys (as girls were getting married early), “most of the boys are [now]
migrating to other states in search of job and easy cash” and thus no longer attend school (Head
teacher,F,WestBengal).
Members of parents or adolescents’ groups, CPC and SMC members all agreed on their re-
sponsibilitytopromoteequalaccesstoeducationandtopreventdrop-outsthroughawareness
programsandbyinformingthecommunityofavailableschemes. Theyexplainedthattheusual
course of action for the rare occurrences of drop-outs involved contacting the parents, discussing
with them the possible reasons for the drop out, creating awareness regarding the importance of
remaininginschoolandtryingtoconvincetheparentstosendtheirchildrenbacktoschool. These
activities were either carried out by committee members or by the NGO to which adolescents typi-
cally reported such cases. Involving district authorities or calling the helpline was, in most cases,
reported as the last recourse and rarely used. In some cases, participants felt it was impossible to
convince parents to send their children to school and also unfair and unrealistic to ask them to do
so, as the family could not sustain it. One parent from Assam noted, “after getting a closer look
at the family’s financial situation, we could not force [the child] to [go] back to school” (Parent, F,
Assam).

III.B IntermediateOutcomes: Empowerment,Communication,SocialNorms,
and Service Provision
ThissectionlooksattheeffectontheintermediateoutcomestargetedbytheAEP. Theseintermediate
outcomes, were envisioned as impact pathways to shape the final outcomes addressed in the
previoussection. Theyincludeadolescentempowerment,communication,socialnormsandservice
provision. Were there to be no effects within these channels, through which the adolescents were
to become “agents of change”, the muted results observed in the previous section might become
clear. Note, Appendix A.III.C includes tables for Plus Package and heterogeneous results for all
intermediaryoutcomes.
Impact/Effectiveness(IntermediateOutcomes)-KeyFindings
Keyfindingsthatemergefromthissectioninrelationtoevaluationquestionsare:
EQ. 2.1. Did adolescents, parents, and community members acquire an increased sense of adolescents
empowermentandgenderequalitythroughtheprogram?
Overall results At the aggregate level, the AEP shows positive effects in terms of supporting awareness
of child rights among adolescents, parents and community service providers. The share of respondents
in program areas that was aware of child rights was 25%, relative to 17.7% in control areas - a 7.3pp
improvement. However, improvements in other areas of adolescent empowerment were very limited or
non-existent. Inthissense,improvementsintermsofconfidencewereonlyobservedamongadolescents
in Andhra Pradesh. No improvements were observed in terms of well-being, self-efficacy or active
supportforadolescentsinanystate.
• In Andhra Pradesh, adolescent girls in program areas showed higher levels of confidence than
adolescent girls in control areas. For instance, adolescent girls were 12.0pp more likely to feel
confidentindoingactivitiesbythemselves.
• InAssamtheprogramisnotassociatedwithanypositiveeffectsintermsofadolescentempower-

• In Jharkhand the program is associated with positive results for adolescent girls but negative

comparedtocontrolgroup).

outcome,despitethefocustheprogramhadonsupportingcommunicationoutcomesinthisstate.
• InWestBengal,theAEPincreasedintragenerationaldialogueamongadolescentboys(+4.3pp).
EQ. 2.3.. Did social norms and practices change in treated communities towards abolishing structural
impedimentstoadolescents,especiallygirls?
Overall results At the aggregate level, evidence from quantitative data hints that the program did not
significantly shape social norms surrounding child marriage or equal opportunities for girls and boys.
When looking at program effects on men, a small decrease in disagreement with child marriage is
observed (-2.0pp). In qualitative interviews, respondents who took part in the program noted positive
changes in regards to their attitudes about equality. This includes learning about treating girls and boys
equallyinrelationtotheireducationalpursuitsandbecomingmoreawareoftheimportanceofproviding
girls the opportunity to attend school for the same length of time as boys. However, respondents felt
equality between girls and boys was something “ people just say” and that, “ in real life, it’s not true”.
At the state level, some of the indicators capturing social norms show significant changes, but these are
mostlyweakinsize:

likely to report an improvement in access to community services (4.7pp). Likewise, access to Child
Protection Committees was improved in treatment areas. However results differ by state and a large
majorityofcommunityleadersreportedCPCswerenotpresentintheirvillage.
• In Andhra Pradesh, knowledge and access to existing government services improved among
adolescent girls (+6.4pp). Adolescent girls in control areas of the state where aware of 6.68

• In Jharkhand, program effects on knowledge and access to community services and CPCs were
low.
• In West Bengal, access to community services within treatment areas improved by more than in
controlareas,asreportedbycommunityleaders(6.5pp).
III.B.1 AdolescentEmpowerment
The AEP was designed to strengthen adolescent empowerment with a multi-pronged approach.
The program targeted adolescents to expand awareness of adolescents’ rights and to foster their
confidence, self-efficacy, and psycho-social well-being. Likewise, the program targeted, parents,
community members and service providers to increase their awareness of adolescent rights and to
createaconductiveenvironmenttotheirprotection.
Table 3.16 display AEP effects on selected adolescent empowerment indicators by state using OLS
regressions. Part I in Table 3.16 considers Basic Package program effects on four indicators -
awareness of child rights topics, confidence of the adolescent in day to day activities, as well as a
summary indicator on overall confidence, and a Well-being scale constructed from World Health
Organization(WHO)-5items.
Attheaggregatelevel,theAEPshowedpositiveeffectsintermsofsupportingawarenessofchild
rightsamongadolescents,parentsandcommunityserviceproviders. Theshareofrespondents
in program areas that were aware of child rights was 25.2%, relative to 17.8% in control areas -
a 7.4pp improvement when considering both male and female respondents. At the state level, this
effect is observed in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand (14.2pp and 4.8pp, respectively).
InAndhraPradesh,awarenessofchildrightswashigheramongbothmaleandfemalerespondents,

no significant effects are observed in terms of enhanced awareness on child rights among female
ormalerespondents.
Positiveeffectsintermsofenhancedadolescents’confidenceareonlyobservedforadolescent
girls in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand. Part II in Table 3.16 explores the impact of the Basic
Package effects on adolescents’ confidence 17. The share of adolescent girls who reported feeling
confident in doing activitiesby themselves was 11.6pphigher in program areasof Andhra Pradesh
and 11.0pp higher in program areas of Jharkhand. This means that while 46% of adolescent girls
in control areas of Andhra Pradesh reported feeling confident in doing activities by themselves,
57.6% did so in treatment areas. Considering the summary indicator for confidence, the AEP is
also associated with positive results for adolescent boys in treatment areas of Andhra Pradesh, as
captured by the increase in the share of activities that adolescent girls felt confident to engage in
(+8.6pp). In Jharkhand, the AEP is also associated with negative effects for adolescent boys. For
thesummaryindicator,inJharkhand,negativeeffectsareobservedforadolescentboysinprogram

Chapter3: Findings 93
The AEP had a significant effect in expanding awareness of adolescent rights among very
poor adolescents and older adolescent boys (15-23). Table A.27 shows that the AEP had a
greater effect in terms of increasing awareness of adolescent rights among very poor respondents
(+9.7pp) when compared to very poor respondents in control areas). Likewise, the program had a
large significant effect in increasing awareness of adolescent rights among older adolescent boys,
(+14.3pp) and younger adolescent boys (+17pp). Results show however, no significant changes
in terms of increased awareness of adolescent rights for younger or older adolescent girls, when
comparedwithotheryoungerorolderadolescentgirlsincontrolareas.
TablesA.37andA.38inAppendixA.III.Cincludeadditionalresultsonadolescentempowerment,
withafocusonnon-violentenvironments,self-efficacyandactivesupportforadolescents.
No statistically significant positive effects are found in terms of enhanced self-efficacy or
violence reduction for adolescent girls or boys. The AEP is not associated with any positive
results in terms of the share of respondents who agree it is ok to punish your daughter if she
discussed marriage timing with parents. Likewise, the program did not affect the number of
situations in which adolescents reported experiencing violence. No statistically significant results
arecapturedinthesummaryindexforself-efficacyeither.
Considering results from all states, program effects in enhancing active support for adoles-
cents was limited. Table A.38 reports no statistically significant increases in terms of the number
of harms from violence to adolescents that parents can recognize or in terms of the number of
actions parents took to support adolescents. The program is associated with a small increase in
joint action from adolescents to uphold adolescent rights. In control areas, 10% of adolescent
girls reported that adolescents in their community had come together to request local government
officials or political leaders for anything benefitting adolescents. In control areas, the share of
adolescentgirlswhodidsowas12.4%,anincreaseof2.4pp.
Additional indicators show the AEP had a modest impact in terms of enhancing adolescent
empowerment and agency in their surroundings.. Figures 3.4 and 3.4 also visualize the impact
of the AEP Basic Program! (BasicProgram!) effect on various indicators of awareness and em-
powerment for the complete sample. For each indicator, the point estimate is depicted by the blue
diamondineachline,whiletheconfidenceinterval(95%)aretheblueboundstotheleftandright
of this point. Statistical significance (5% or lower) is denoted by the blue bounds not overlapping
the “No Effect” vertical dotted line. Confidence intervals that touch slightly the dotted no-effect
line represent statistical significance at the 10% level. The size of the coefficient for the overall
treated sample has been reported for each indicator above the blue point, while the control mean
and number of observations, N, is reported under the indicator name. From the non-overlapping
confidenceinterval,theindicators(besidesreachonCRwhichwasdiscussedpreviously)thatshow
a significant difference compared to the control group are - confident about speaking in public
(3.8pphigher, ornearly 25%of treatedadolescents) andsubmitting requeststo governmentbodies
to benefit adolescents in the last 4 years (2.0pp higher, or around 11% in the treated group). Weak
significance (at 10% level) is also observed for the indicator - choosing which clothes to wear.
Chapter3: Findings 94
The only indicator (from those presented) that appears to perform worse in the treated sample is
the knowledge on what rights adolescents have to protect themselves against child labor. This
coefficient is close to being weakly significant (nearly crossing the No Effect line), but suggests
that around 82.2% of treated adolescents, compared to 85% in control areas, were aware of rights
tocounterchildlabor.
ConstructionofSummaryorIndexVariables
To capture broad concepts and more efficiently summarize information, the report presents summarized
information of several responses on a similar topic, so-called “indices”. In what follows, the general
procedureofgeneratingtheseindicesisoutlinedshortly. Summaryvariables(orindices)areconstructed
by first generating score variables which summarize the responses to several individual questions, and,
inasecondstep,byrescalingthisscoretorangebetween0and1. Rescalingisachievedbydividingthe
achievedscorebythenumberoftotalsubcomponentsincludedinthesummaryvariable.
Tomakethisprocedureclearer,pleaseconsiderthefollowingexample. Imaginerespondentswereasked
to answer a set of ten questions with yes or no. In order to aggregate the responses to the ten questions
intoanindex,thefollowingstepsarefollowed:
1. Individualindicatorvariables(responses)foreachquestionaregenerated,codedas1iftherespon-
dentindicatedanimprovement,and0otherwise. Therebyallresponsesfirstneedthentopointto
thesamedirection(forinstancethata1alwaysindicatesanimprovement);
2. Ascorevariableisgeneratedwhichindicatesthetotalnumberofquestionstherespondentanswered
withyes(max. ten);
3. The score variable is rescaled to range between 0 and 1, attained by dividing the score by the
numberoftotalnumberofquestionsincludedinthesummaryvariable(i.e.,byten);
The resulting summary variable (or index) indices, out of the ten questions, the share of questions that
wereansweredwithyesonascaleof0to1. If, forexample, arespondentansweredfourquestionswith
yes,thentheircorrespondingsummaryvariablewouldlieat0.4,inotherwordstherespondentanswered
40%ofthequestionswithyes.
This procedure is similar to how ? construct their indices. For example, for their gender empowerment
index,theyfirstconstructascoreindicatingthenumberofquestions(outofeight)towhichrespondents
answered that both genders should be equally responsible. Therefore, higher values represent more
egalitarian gender norms. They then rescale the score to range between 0 and 100. Their gender
empowerment index, thus, indicates the share of questions (out of eight) to which the answer was both
genders should be responsible. Note that other approaches to index construction are possible, such as
addingweightsasdoneby?.
EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
In line with quantitative evidence, adolescents frequently reported increased awareness of
their rights and more knowledge around education, child marriage and adolescent pregnan-
cies. Adolescentsreportedincreasedknowledgeandbehaviorchangeinrelationtothecorepillars
Chapter3: Findings 95
of the awareness campaigns and group sessions, that is, education, child marriage and adolescent
pregnancies. Many reported having been made aware of these issues and realizing the importance
ofstudyingaswellasdelayingmarriageandchild-bearinginordertoincreasetheirfamily’squality
of life. Adolescent study participants also recounted learning to resist family or community mem-
bers’ attempts to push them into early marriage or to infringe on their right to education. Some
describedusingtheirnewlyacquiredknowledge(andconfidence)toconvincetheirparentstoallow
them to delay marriage or to study longer. One participant described being the first in his family
to continue studying beyond secondary school: “After joining the group, I see one major change
in my family. In the cast which I belong to, nobody is very educated but I am getting educated
and planning for higher education” (Adolescent (peer leader), M, 19, Jharkhand). Others reported
advocating for adolescents’ education by convincing families to send their children to school or to
delay marriage. Adolescents and parents alike mentioned such changes, noting parents are now
faced with children who are aware of their rights and equipped to fight for them. Indeed, one
parent group member from West Bengal suggested that adolescents “have become more confident
and aware. They themselves do protest against their marriage at early age. They aspire to higher
education and to get established in life. They want to fulfill their dreams” (Parent group member,
F,WestBengal).
In line with quantitative evidence, girls frequently reported less confidence to perform their
day-to-day activities outside the household. Boys mostly reported enjoying complete freedom
of mobility without restrictions, though several indicated their lack of interest in participating in
politicalmeetingswherealcoholandbribesareoftendistributed. Girls,incontrast,reportedbeing
faced with various restrictions pertaining to their mobility outside the household. Although a
few girls indicated (and some parents confirmed) they could participate in all social events, some
reportednotbeingallowedtoattendcertaineventsorlocationssuchascockfights,barsorthevillage
fair. Othersindicatedthattheywerenotallowedtogooutontheirownand/orafterdark: “Wedon’t
participate in any social discussions or events. In mosque, we are not allowed and in marriage or
funerals,eldersparticipate. Wearenotallowedtobeinvolvedinmuch”(Adolescent(peerleader),
F, 18, Assam). Finally, girls reported even more limited movement during menstruation, during
which (with very few exceptions) parents reportedly prohibit girls from going to the temple or in
somecaseseventoschool.
Young women reported feeling more capable to report various forms of abuse since they
began participating in the AEP. They suggested that their increased self-confidence and agency
encouragedthemtospeakmoreopenlytotheirparentsifsomeoneteasedorabusedthem,ortofight
backdirectly. Severalparticipantsdescribedhaving“gained[throughtheAEP]thatmuchcourageto
protest an abuser” (Adolescent (group member), F, 16, West Bengal). This new-found confidence
also encouraged adolescents to report rights violations (e.g., an attempted child marriage) they
observed among others. Some adults also recognized girls’ and women’s agency to protest when
victimized and opined that sexual and gender-based violence was “not common nowadays. It’s
an educated society where girls do protest if they are tortured” (Parent (group member), M, West
Bengal).
Chapter3: Findings 96
Most participants reported that parents were in charge of decision-making for the house-
hold.Thefathertypicallytakesresponsibilityforlargerdecisionsexternaltothehouseholdandthe
motherfordailywithin-householddecisions. Participantsmentionedthat,insomecases,unclesor
grandparents (or in the absence of the father, the elder brother) take decisions for the family. Most
(butnotall)adolescentsreportedhavingnoinfluenceondecision-makingwithintheirhouseholds,
even in relation to decisions that directly concern them. Only a few adolescents study participants
reported feeling completely included in the family decision-making process: “Before making any
decision, discussions are done among the members of the family. Each of our opinions is counted
beforethefinaldecisionismade”(Adolescent(groupmember),M,18,Assam).
III.B.2 Communication
TheAEPsupportedadolescents’inter-andintragenerationalcommunicationskillstoempowerthem
by shaping attitudes towards marriage, gender roles and education. To do this, the AEP facilitated
dialogue among adolescents as well as between parents and their adolescent offsprings. Likewise,
adolescent and/or parent discussion groups were organized in program areas assigned to Plus
Packagecomponents.
Table3.17displaysBasicPackageAEPeffectsoncommunicationindicatorsbystate,andforgender
sub-samples. InAppendixA.III.C,TableA.28displaysPlusPackageAEPeffectsoncommunication
indicatorswhileTableA.29focusesonheterogeneouseffects.
Part I of the table considers two indicators of intergenerational dialogue. The first, “share of
intergenerational dialogue” is a scale (0-1) that captures the share of intergenerational dialogue
situationsthatrespondentstookpartin. Adolescentsandparentswereaskedwhetherthey(ortheir
adolescent offsprings) did any of the following activities in the last three months: Contacted their
sibling’s teachers regarding their education, convinced or tried to convince their parents to send
theirbrothersortheirsisterstoschool(separatequestions),negotiatedwiththeirparentsonbehalf
of their sisters so that they can get skills training, talked to their parents regarding their fears and
emotions,andtalkedtotheirparentsabouttheirfuturemarriage. Likewise,ifrespondentsattended
any type of event, group session or training19, respondents were asked whether they had discussed
thetopicsofthisactivitywiththeirparents/children20.

dialoguesituations thatadolescentboys andgirlsengaged in. Thispositiveeffect isstrongerwhen
focusingonadolescentgirlsalone(2.8pp). State-wise,positive,statisticallysignificants,effectsare
observed for adolescent girls in West Bengal (4.3pp) and for adolescent boys in Assam (3.0pp). In
Jharkhand, where the AEP had a particular focus on supporting intergenerational dialogue, results
arenotconsistentandweaklysignificant. Foradolescentgirls,thereisapositive,weaklysignificant
positive effect (2.7pp). For adolescent boys this effect is negative and weakly significant (2.4pp).
Regarding Plus Package effects, Table A.28 reports no additional effects from providing a higher
intensityoftreatment,involvingadolescentboysandparents,throughPlusPackageactivities.
The AEP Basic Package did not effectively increase the share of situations in which parents
considertheirchild’sopinion. Columns(4)to(6)ofTable3.17reportprogrameffectsontheindex
for situations in which parents consider their child’s opinion. Adolescents and parents were asked
inwhichsituationstheirparents(orthey)taketheir(ortheirchild’s)opinionintoconsideration,on
ascalefrom1(fullyconsideredoraccepted)to3(nottakenintoconsiderationoraccepted). These
included, for example, the decision to go to the local market alone, the decision whether to go to
the doctor or medical facility, the decision on whether to speak out in public, etc.21 The summary
index captures the number of situations, out of seven possible situations, in which parents (fully
or somewhat) consider their child’s opinion on a scale from 0 to 1. Only in the overall sample a
weakly significant effect size of 0.6pp is observed. No effect is found within the state or gender
sub-samples.
The AEP did not increase interpersonal communication competences significantly in any
state. The AEP is only associated with a small, weakly significant increase in interpersonal
communicationcompetencesamongadolescentgirlsinAndhraPradesh. PartIIinTable3.17
focusesonBasicPackageAEPeffectsinsupportingintergenerationalcommunicationcompetence.
An important scale thereby is an established psychological scale on communication by ?: The
Interpersonal Communication Competence (ICC) scale. Adolescents and parents were asked to
indicate whether (ten) statements such as “I allow friends to see who I really am” and “I am
comfortable in social situations” fit them (or their child) on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
Using this scale, different domains can be generated: Identity and self-esteem (indicator for social
relaxation),empathyandrespect(usingtheindicatorsforempathy,assertiveness,andaltercentrism),
communication and expression (with indicators for self-disclosure for interaction management,
expressiveness,immediacy,supportiveness)andfinallycopingwithstressandmanagingemotions
(using the indicator for environmental control). Taking their answers for the ten domains together,
theInterpersonalCommunicationCompetencescoreindicatesadolescents’overallcommunication
competence on a scale from 10 to 50, with 50 representingfull competence across 10 dimensions.

comparedtocontrolgroup). NosignificanteffectsareobservedwhenlookingatBasicPackage
effectsattheaggregatelevel. ThisisalsotrueforPlusPackageeffects(TableA.28).
The AEP only increased intragenerational dialogue among adolescent males in Assam. Part
III of Table 3.17 considers intragenerational dialogue among adolescents (peers). To capture this,
adolescents and parents were asked whether, in the last three months, they (or their child) talked
to friends regarding their fears and emotions, or to their brothers and sisters regarding their future
marriage. In addition, adolescents and parents were asked whether they (or their child), after the
participation in program activities, usually discussed the topics covered in the classes with peers,
such as adolescent family members, fiends, or acquaintances.22 The summary variable indicates,
out of the four situations, the share of situations in which adolescents engage in dialogue among
peers. No significant effects are observed at the aggregate level, when looking at program effects
in all states pooled together. A small increase in the share of topics that adolescents discuss with
eachotherisonlyobservedformaleadolescentsinAssam(3.1pp).

(1.1pp). This increases when considering results separately for older adolescent boys (1.2pp) and

EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
Following their participation in the AEP, adolescents reported feeling less shy, more knowl-
edgeableandthusmoreconfidenttoexpressthemselvesandcommunicatewiththeirparents
orevenwithothercommunitymembersinpublicspaces: “Iusedtobeafraidofspeakingto
people. I used to think before, speaking in front of 2-3 people, what if they scold me by saying I
am too young to speak? But now, if I have something to say, I ask for their permission and speak
up” (Adolescent (group member), F, 18, Assam). Parents and adolescents alike reported commu-
nicating about previously taboo issues and enjoying overall improved communication within their
families. One peer leader from Assam explained: “Before we were a part of the NGO, we hardly
discussed about such issues at home. But now we talk about topics like menstruation without
any awkwardness. I have come to know that it’s nothing to avoid, it’s just a biological process”
(Adolescent(peer leader),M,18,Assam). Another peerleaderfromWest Bengalelaboratedhow,
afterbeingpartoftheprogram,shebegandiscussingissueswithherparentsthankstohernewfound
“courage to believe that whatever [she] does is wise and correct” and does not need to be hidden
fromherparents(Adolescent(peerleader),F,18,WestBengal). Adolescentsreportedrecognition
oftheimportanceofcommunicationandsharinginformationinordertosolveproblems,including
issuesrelatingtoeducationorchildmarriage.
Parentsandadolescentsalikeagreedthatparticipatinginparentgroupshadpositivelyinflu-
enced parents in three primary ways. Parents identified strengthened communication between
themselves and their (adolescent) children as particularly important. They reported feeling more
knowledgeable and confident to speak freely and to communicate with their children, discussing
issuesinacalmratherthanagitatedorangrymannerandthusbeingmorelikelytoachievedesired
results (i.e., getting their children to listen to them): “Whenever we talk to them, we should say it
inapositivemannerforthemtoacceptourwords”(Parent(groupmember),F,AndhraPradesh).

Chapter3: Findings 106
EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
Quantitative evidence hints that the AEP did not led to any drastic changes in social norms
between treatment and control areas. Qualitative evidence, however, hints that participants
in program activities learnt positive attitudes in terms of gender equality after taking part
in activities, although these may no have been enough to trigger a wider change. Parents that
took part in AEP activities generally reported learning to treat boys and girls equally: “A mother
goes through equal hardships while giving birth to a boy or a girl. I don’t see any reason why they
should be given different treatment” (Parent (group member), F, Assam). Participants described
the previously common discrimination in favor of boys (who they reported traditionally stayed
hometotakecareofparents)overgirls(whotheyreportedtypicallymarriedandmovedtoanother
family and were thus seen as someone else’s asset, into whose future they described was wasteful
toinvest).
Somedescribedthechangeandtreatmentofgirlsandboysasadirectconsequenceofhaving
participated in the group sessions. They noted in particular learning about treating girls and
boys equally in relation to their educational pursuits and recounted becoming more aware of the
importance of providing girls the opportunity to attend school for the same length of time as boys.

parents(particularlymothers)alsofeltequalitybetweengirlsandboyswassomething“people
justsay”andthat,“inreallife,it’snottrue”(Parent(groupmember),F,WestBengal).
Finally, for some parents, participating in the program lifted taboos, particularly with regards to
menstruation. Parents learned that girls should not be ostracized but should rather be supported
while menstruating, through teaching them how to use pads properly and maintain good hygiene.
Some adolescents also observed this change in their parents: “Earlier, my parents didn’t allow me
to go out during my menstruation but now they have realized that it’s okay to go out if I maintain
the hygiene” (Adolescent (peer leader), F, 18, Assam). These changes in perception regarding
menstruation were not common to all, however, and some parents reported that girls were still
prohibitedfromattendingtempleduringmenstruation.
III.B.4 ServiceProvision
The final impact pathways that is explored for the AEP are those related to reported improvements
in service provisions, such that adolescents and parents have better access to health services, in
ordertoaddresshealthrelatedchallenges.

Considering results from all states, access to community services within treatment areas
improved slightly more than in control areas. Community leaders in treatment areas were
slightlymorelikelytoreportanimprovementinaccesstocommunityservices(4.7pp). Thisincludes
services like “access to information regarding the community members’ rights and entitlements”
or “life-skills trainings”. However, this result is only weakly significant. This effect appears to be
drivenbyWestBengalwheretheeffectisstrongerandmoresignificant(6.4pp).
Overall, access to CPCs was improved in treatment areas. However results differ by state
and a large majority of community leaders reported CPCs were not present in their village.
Overall, a higher share of community leaders in treatment areas reported there was a CPC in their
communities (8.4pp). In control areas, 13% of community leaders reported the existence of a CPC
in their communities, while 21% did so in treatment areas. CPCs were more frequently reported
in treatment areas of Assam and West Bengal. In Assam, 26% of community leaders reported the
existence of a CPC (15.1pp over control areas), while 6.8% of community leaders in West Bengal
reportedtheexistenceofaCPC(4.2ppovercontrolareas). Inotherstates,therewerenosignificance

Pradesh, the increase in awareness among adolescent girls was steeper (6.4pp). Adolescent girls
in control areas of the state were aware of 6.68 government services provided by the government,
out of 19, and adolescent girls in treatment areas were aware of 7.9 services. In Andhra Pradesh,

Chapter3: Findings 110
EvidencefromIn-DepthInterviews
Qualitative evidence reveals that in general, in depth knowledge regarding the availability of
services and committees available to support adolescents was not widespread. Most partic-
ipants (adolescents and parents) knew of and could describe only the roles, responsibilities and
locations of ASHA and Anganwadi workers, especially in relation to prenatal care. Study partici-
pantsmentionedthatsuchworkersoftentookpartinAEPgroupsessionsandfunctionedasresource
persons to help increase awareness on health and hygiene issues. In contrast, adolescents and par-
entswerelessawareofCPCandSMC. Manyadolescentsinparticularreportedhavingnoknowledge
ofeitherofthesecommitteesintheirvillages. SomehadheardofCPCsandSMCsbutwereunaware
of their aims and activities, and others (more parents than adolescents) had encountered CPCs and
SMCs and were able to describe their roles, although not as thoroughly as those of the Anganwadi
andASHAworkers.
The availability and location of sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents was
unknown or unclear to most adolescents. They most commonly mentioned such services were
available from NGO staff or Anganwadi workers but also mentioned hospitals, family (parents,
siblings),teachersandtheinternetaspossiblepointsofreference. Some,however,feltnobodywas
available to discuss these subjects and reported having no idea to whom to turn in order to access
sexual and reproductive health information or services. A frontline worker confirmed this view,
notingthat“thereisnosuchknowledgeablepersontowhomtheycanapproach”forsupportrelated
tosexualandreproductivehealth(CPCMember,F,Assam).
Given the limited awareness of services offered by CPC and SMC, their limited use by ado-
lescents is not surprising. Although ASHA/Anganwadi services were better known, adolescents’
perceptionsthatthesearemainlyservicesforpregnantwomenalsolimitedtheiruse. Onlyahandful
of study participants reported making use of the services provided by these frontline workers, one
youngparticipantrecountinganASHAworkerprovidingirontabletsinschools,anotherdescribing
her complaint to an NGO staff member after her mother threatened to take her out of school and
others, still, relating experiences of reporting to ASHA/Anganwadi workers some attempted child

Adolescents’comfortcontactingNGOstaffwithconcernsregardingsexualandreproductivehealth
information or reporting any form of child abuse likely reflects the close rapport built between
adolescentsandNGOstaffduringgroupsessionsaswellasNGOs’presenceandlevelofengagement
withadolescents,whichmakesthemmoreapproachablethanothers.
In stark contrast, most study participants mentioned law enforcement as the last resort as a
point of contact. They recounted calling police only if and when an issue was not successfully
handled within the community (with those involved, with the help of NGO staff or existing com-
mittees): “Thecasesthatcannotbesolvedwithinthevillagearesenttothestation”(Parent(group
member), F, Assam). Many study participants reported having never contacted law enforcement.
Among those who spoke of existing laws being enforced by the police, they usually felt the laws
protectingchildrenweresufficientandadequatelyenforcedbythoseincharge.
Chapter3: Findings 111
Support for increasing sexual and reproductive health services was not widespread among
parentsandadolescents. Adolescentsofferedvaryingsuggestionsregardingwheretoavailsexual
and reproductive health services, likely based on personal views and experiences rather than
knowledge of availability of such services. Aside from a few exceptions, adolescents reported not
yethavingaccessedorneedingtoaccesssuchservices. Someindicatedtheyfelttherewasnoneed
to have sexual and reproductive health knowledge and that they preferred to remain uninformed:
“Some amount of sexual and reproductive health information is necessary to know the boys and
girls but a very wide range of sexual information is not needed” (Adolescent (group member), M,
17, Andhra Pradesh). A number of adults shared this view, elaborating that any knowledge of
sexualandreproductivehealthshouldbegainedonlyaftermarriage: “Someextenthastobegiven
but don’t go deep on it. Only basics. [...] There is no need to inform about sex and reproduction
totheadolescentbeforetheageof21”(Headteacher,M,AndhraPradesh).
IV. Robustness Specifications
ResultsonthreeadditionalrobustnesschecksareprovidedinAppendixA.III.E:
IV.A Local Average Treatment Effects
The non-compliance within program areas, i.e., the low or (close to) no reported implementation
asperassignment,asshowninSectionII.,impliesthattheremightbeabiasinthecomputationof
the ITT estimate. This bias might arise because of the non-random nature of this non-compliance.
For instance, it might be that villages that might have had a large effect of the program, might not
have received implementation. This non-random selection of compliers (those who received the
program as per assignment) is what LATE tries to address. Since very little contamination in our
control sample is observe, only one-sided non-compliance has to be dealt with. In the report, the
LATEiscalculatedforfinaloutcomesofinterestforthisevaluation: Childmarriage,earlypregnancy
andschoolenrollment.
Assignment is estimated using the original treatment assignment indicator for the sample. Imple-
mentationontheotherhandismeasuredviaself-reportedawarenessofprogramsthataresimilarto
theAEPwithintheendlinesample. TheLATEiseffectivelyainstrumentalvariableregression. This
method assumes that regardless of treatment assignment, the eventual treatment (based on) status
leads to a change in the outcome. There is an important condition, the so called exclusion restric-
tion, that should be satisfied, to maintain the validity of this method. For the exclusion restriction
to be fulfilled, the treatment assignment should only affect the outcomes via the treatment status,
and no other additional channel or mechanism. Moreover, it should be sufficiently correlated to
thetreatmentassignmentvariable. TheF-statistic,whichdeterminesthestrengthoftheinstrument
Chapter3: Findings 112
(i.e.,treatmentstatusisonlychannelthatexplainseffectoftreatmentassignmentonoutcome)does
not cross the rule of thumb threshold of 10 for all three outcomes, implying that the instrument
does not satisfy the exclusion restriction in any case. Alternatively, they may cross this threshold,
butnosufficientcorrelationbetweentreatmentassignmentandstatusisestablished.25
Consequently, the main conditions to hold the validity of the LATE estimation are not fulfilled and
the results are not free from bias. Therefore, they are not reported in the main text, although the
tablescanbefoundintheAppendix(TablesA.41,A.42,andA.43inAppendix. A.III.D).

integrating evidence (in large part from studies carried out by UNICEF India and partners as
well as pilot studies) with the Theory of Change and making adjustments and regionally-specific
adaptations to their design, as necessary. This consisted of examining evidence regarding what
works and what doesn’t work in various contexts and then rearticulating “broad level strategies”

“senior level official from government in charge of the revenue and law and order administration
and all developmental activities in the district”), meetings were held across line departments (i.e.,
department of health & welfare, department of women & children, department of education,
department of rural, water and sanitation etc.) to determine the precise programming activities to

EffortstoharnessgovernmentsupportthroughintegratingtheAEPintonationalagendasremained
central to the program’s intervention logic, which sought to build on existing schemes (such
as the national National Service Scheme (NSS) through which senior high school students meet
regularly as well as other “ready-made platforms” of, for instance, women meeting to discuss
microfinanceandempowermentissues(UNICEFStaff2,AndhraPradesh). Throughcollaboration
with Panchayati Raj Institutions, which are constituted by elective membership from the village
level, the program was adapted to address even village-specific needs and conditions (UNICEF
Staff 2, Andhra Pradesh). This approach, coupled with UNICEF staff’s “international experience”
and technical expertise, enabled a well-informed and contextually relevant conceptualization and
implementationoftheAEP(UNICEF1,WestBengal). UNICEFpaidparticularattentiontoensuring
the AEP was well integrated into existing efforts to implement adolescent programming across a

Issues of gender barriers, such as some boys’ and fathers’ discomfort discussing menstruation,
limitedtheinvolvementofsomeprospectiveparticipantsintheAEP. Adolescentsrequestedteachers
of their own gender in order to address this challenge. In Assam, mixed teams of teachers (one
male and two female teachers for every co-educational school) helped to successfully address this
barrier, as it accounted for the greater number of girl children and at the same time allowed boys
to talk with male teachers about their own issues. In general, a focus on girls may have limited

Externalconsistency-AlignmentwithGovernmentPriorities
Key informants overwhelmingly reported a strong integration and explicit alignment of AEP pro-
gramming with existing government goals, schemes and initiatives. In addition to ensuring the
AEP’salignmentwithinternationalframeworkssuchastheUNCRC,theyemphasisedthattheAEP
programhadbeen“wellintegratedwiththegovernment”(DistrictChildProtectionOfficer(DCPO),
Andhra Pradesh), engaging in dialogue and discussion with state-level officials responsible for
programming “right from the beginning” (UNICEF Staff1, Delhi), with the exception of Assam
state, where UNICEF initially worked with tea garden management authorities rather than the
government of Assam itself. In Jharkhand, for example, this involved the explicit alignment with
theChiefMinister’sdeclarationtoprioritizetheendofchildmarriageor,inWestBengal,aligning
with drafting guidelines in collaboration with Purulia District level officials and in consultation
Chapter3: Findings 115
with the State Department of Child Development and Social Welfare. According to KIs, the AEP
coincided constructively with changes in state level programming that has, over time, shifted from
amodelofprovidinghandouts(“whetheritissomekindofacashorjustanirontablet”,UNICEF
Staff2,WestBengal)toconceptualizingcomprehensivelyadolescents’needs,includingtheir“need
forempowerment”(ibid.).
Thisnew“empowermentkindoflens”nowpromulgatedbygovernmentwas,inpart,demonstrated
through UNICEF’s “holistic development” approach to adolescence that involves a convergence
of cash transfer programs, the SAG scheme, and Kanyashree (UNICEF Staff 2, West Bengal).
UNICEF’ssuccessinaligningwithgovernmentprioritieswasconfirmedbystateanddistrictlevel
officials, who commented that “UNICEF is doing a wonderful job” in supporting government’s
goal to create an “environment where these children actually can be free from any kind of victim-
ization”, that is, “a society free of child marriages, a society free of any kind of myth, any kind of
superstitions, which, in turn, force a girl to be a victim” (District Officer 3, West Bengal). Often
highlighted by district officers and UNICEF staff alike was the AEP’s strong alignment with the
Kanyashree scheme, which many suggested was “perfectly integrated” and “implemented by the
Block Development Officers ...and Panchayat personnel”, enabling the AEP to use the existing
structureoftheKanyashreegroups(DistrictOfficer1,WestBengal).
AEPIntegrationinGovernment
All key informants felt the AEP was well supported by and integrated throughout various levels
of government. Nevertheless, although a range of individuals and government representatives
(spanning frontline workers, elected Panchayat personnel, block officials and district officials)
supported the implementation of the AEP, a District Coordinator in Jharkhand suggested that even
more could be done to integrate such representatives into program implementation in order to
strengthentheprogram’sfunctionandensureitssuccess.
GovernmentrepresentativesechoedtheKIIs’praise,suggestingthattheexistinggovernmentstruc-
tures readily facilitate integration of programs such as the AEP. Indeed, a Deputy Commissioner
(1) explained at length the organizational flow of the Government of India that enables such in-
tegration of complex programming, highlighting in particular the involvement of the Ministry of
Women and Child Development (which tends broadly to issues affecting children and adolescents
and functions as a “nodal ministry”) as well as the state governments, each with their own social
welfare department that, in turn, become the nodal department for their respective states. At the
districtlevel,DistrictCommissionersfunctionlikea“CEO!(CEO!)ofthedistrict...underwhom
all the departments (education, health, police, ...labor department) ...can converse” (Deputy
Commissioner 1). A District Officer expanded on this description, suggesting that “government is
in a position to handle the whole thing alone”, as long as districts receive (financial) support to do
so, which - the District Officer lamented - was not consistently the case across all districts. This
DistrictOfficersuggestedthat,...wecanrunitwell”(DistrictOfficer2,WestBengal).
KeyinformantsnotedthatthestrongintegrationoftheAEPintogovernmentinitiativesencouraged
Chapter3: Findings 116
government representatives to feel a considerable level of ownership of the programming and
trust between sectors. They were optimistic that AEP programming could not only continue but
also be scaled up following its official end. An important component in this success was the
AEP’s “development of a district implementation plan for ending child marriage” (UNICEF Staff
3, Jharkhand) and actively involving in its development multiple stakeholders (including, among
others, District Child Protection Officers, Joint Directors of Health, Labour Department, Police
Department, Education Department, District Collectors and Department Heads) (UNICEF Staff 3
Assam). AccordingtoaUNICEFstaffmember,thisultimatelyplayeda“verycriticalroleinraising
voices, in securing the rights of children” (UNICEF Staff 3, Jharkhand). The AEP’s intentional
andexplicitinvolvementofmultiplegovernmentandnon-governmentstakeholdersthroughoutthe
design and implementation process also reportedly helped to ensure the AEP interventions were
well integrated into district implementation plans and thereby contributed the program’s overall
success(UNICEFStaff3,Jharkhand).
Finally,UNICEFstaffsuggestedthatthestrongdistrictconvergenceplatformofgovernmentlinede-
partments,whichyieldedsimilarmodels(yetdistinctconcreteimplementationapproaches)across
all districts within an implementing state and the institutionalization of the programming that was
involvedthroughout,helpedcontributetothedesiredlongevityoftheAEPbeyonditsofficialfund-
ing period (UNICEF Staff 2, West Bengal). Illustrating the importance of this institutionalization
is the continued spreading of child marriage and child protection messages to girls in Jharkhand
through parent groups as part of the SAG, despite UNICEF’s cessation of support in December
2019(DistrictCoordinator,Jharkhand). Aswesawearlier,KIsmostfrequentlyidentifiedthestate
government’sKanyashreeschemeasexemplaryofthestronginstitutionalizationandintegrationof

Keyinformants’suggestionstocontinuetobuildonintegrativeeffortsinfutureadolescent-centered
programming draw from their unanimous agreement that the AEP was well integrated into gov-
ernment structures and initiatives. Specifically, KIs recommended beginning by “identifying the
existing social protection schemes and [...] if there is a gap, [...] then you do advocacy with
the government to come up with new schemes” (UNICEF Staff 2, Assam). To further improve the
integrationofprogrammingwithgovernmentinitiativesandplanning,theyrecommendedworking
on“strengthen[ing]thestructureswherethereis[government]provisionofchildren’sparticipation
andthereisnomandatefromthestateside”andhelpingtosupportandstrengthentheSocialWelfare
Department (UNICEF Staff 1, Assam). Furthermore, KIs identified the importance of advocating
for government to take policy decisions on important issues affecting children and adolescents,
includingamongothersadolescentempowerment,childmarriage,childlaborandchildtrafficking.
Finally, in order to fill the government’s gap in strong community mobilization efforts, a UNICEF
staffrepresentativefromAssamsuggestedmoreactivelyengagingwithcivilsocietyorganizations,
which typically have stronger human resources and community awareness and are seen as better
positioned to “ensur[e] true community participation in the program implementation” (UNICEF
Staff 1, Assam). Moving forward, key informants requested district leaders to prioritize efforts
to address child marriage and child protection (Women Development and Child Welfare (WDCW)

Staff,AndhraPradesh).
Although integration with government programmes was found to be strong, there were problems
reported such as lack of resources (Implementing partner 1, Assam); lack of manpower and large
numberofvacanciesingovernmentpositions(WDCWstaff,AndhraPradesh)andlargeturnoverof

sustainability of programs from the government due to lack of manpower and loss of institutional

AdaptationandResponsivenesstoLocalContext
Study respondents had very little to say regarding the responsiveness of the AEP to feedback or
regarding its internal and external consistency. Only one UNICEF staff member in West Bengal
suggestedthatpilotingtheprogramindiversesettingscouldbehelpful,suchthatrecommendations
for ways forward or future similar programming are not reliant upon findings stemming from a
region that may be considerably unlike other regions, e.g., a “tribal” or “minority dominated”
district(UNICEFStaff2,WestBengal).
TheconsiderablediversityacrossandwithinIndianstatesmeantthattherewasnosingleprototype
ofAEPobjectivesanddesignsuitableforallcontexts,butratherprogrammingrequiredconsiderable
adaption, state by state. “There are clear state level issues because of the diversity that we have
in India”, explained one UNICEF staff member in Delhi (UNICEF Staff1, Delhi). Within states,
programming required further adaptation, “rethinking and readjusting” both in terms of “demand
generation” as well as “in terms of the supply of services” according to whether it was being
implementedinanurbanorruralsetting(UNICEFStaff2,Delhi). Indeed,giventhelargesizeand
considerablediversityofpopulationsevenwithinstates,considerabledistinctionsinprogramming
had to be made at a fairly localized level, some of the districts being “split up” following the
commencement of programming and those implementing the programming at local levels often
devising “their own ideas of how that should be operationalized” in one part of the district while
notinanother(UNICEFStaff2,Delhi).

contextsofcivilstrifewhich,accordingtoaUNICEFstaffmember,affectedallfourstatesstudied

nuances” that required adaptation (UNICEF Staff2, Delhi). Further considerations involved the
adaptationofAEPprogrammingtowhatKIsreferredtoas“tribal”areas,whichmanyrespondents
identified as considerable barriers. One UNICEF staff member explained: “there are different
tribes and each of the tribes has their own culture, own taboos and superstitions, all those things”,
pointingoutthechallengeintryingtoinfluence“theircultureandtraditionswhichare500,600or

(UNICEF1,WestBengal).
In West Bengal, Purulia District in particular was frequently mentioned as a “tribal dominant

pletelydifferent”cultureandsetting,requiringa“differentstrategyanddifferent[program]design”
that takes into consideration “local contexts [and] the local culture” (UNICEF 1, West Bengal).
Adaptation to diverse “tribal” contexts may involve working with Panchayat level workers rather
than“bring[ing]peoplefromoutsidetoworkinthosecommunities”UNICEFStaff2,Jharkhand).

Althoughthesampleisinsufficienttomakeanydefinitiveconclusions,thewidevarietyofcontexts

the adaptations eventually undertaken were dependent on individual initiative and responsiveness
to feedback and good monitoring. As discussed below, this was not always optimal. The local
factors that required adaptation related to language, culture, religion, security situation, need
for inclusiveness and much more. This means that apart from increased responsiveness, greater
participation in program design and flexibility of intervention may help provide the necessary
adaptabilitytoaccountfortheimmensediversityoflocalcontexts.
Relevanceatcommunitylevel
In spite of the apparently close integration and ownership by the government many study par-
ticipants felt they were incapable of continuing program activities in the absence of NGO and/or
UNICEF support and guidance. According to them, this was due to lacking financial support,
lack of knowledge and training as well as limited motivation among facilitators and group mem-
bers. Despite these apprehensions, a few participants reported undertaking efforts to continue the
programming within their capacities and available human resources. A handful of participants
mentionedactivitieswereongoingbutrecountedthechallengesofcontinuingactivitiesoutsidethe
AEPframeworkandquestionedthevalueofparticipatingfollowingtheprogram’send. Allagreed,
however, that continuing the program would be very useful. They worried that the achievements
(regarding adolescents’ and parents’ learnings and changes in behavior) may be lost should the
programnot resume,yet simultaneouslyfeltit wasimportantfor theyoungergeneration andthose
entering adolescence to also benefit from the teachings they had received. This mixed picture
suggests that while the community appreciates the AEP and there are attempts to continue some
activities,thereisalackofconfidenceintheirabilitytodoso.
An implementing partner was considerably sanguine about the feasibility of handing the program
overtothecommunity: “... ifwecontinuethisprogramme,likeifwecutoursupport,handoverour
responsibilitiestothecommunityandleaders,monitorthemcloselyandstrengthenthemwhenever
possible, then I think it can be carried forward easily. A project cannot be continued forever so

thePanchayatmeetingsanddiscusstheissueslike,importanceofeducation,genderequalityetcin

Partner,Pos. 56)
However, the picture emerging from adolescents was quite mixed. One peer leader reported not
facinganychallengeincontinuation: “yes,weusedtoconductmeetingsevenafterdiscontinuation
oftheUNICEFprogram. Weneverfacedanychallengeswhileweconductedthemeetingsandwe
were supported by all.” (Adolescent (peer leader), M, 17, Andhra Pradesh). Another adolescent
leader reported a considerable decline in activities: “yes, it continued but not as much as during
the project period. [Continuation was] very challenging. No one came to participate in meetings.
They were saying, “The program has ended. Why should we come?” (Adolescent (peer leader),
M,19,Jharkhand). Thismayhavebeenduetoalackofresourcesaspointedoutbyaparent: “It’s
difficulttocontinuethegroupmeetingwithoutfund. Tomanagegroupmeetingsandtransportation
oneneedsfunds.” (Parent(groupmember),M,WestBengal).
There was a clear desire for the continuation of the program and an appreciation of its relevance:
“Although the program has ended, I would want it to happen again because I want the generations
after us to get this opportunity to learn as well.” (Adolescent (group member), F, 18, Assam).
Another adolescent leader in Assam was equally appreciative but stated “no, we haven’t started
anything on our own since the students don’t come as there are no teachers.” (Adolescent (peer
leader), F, 17, Assam). In Andhra Pradesh, the lack of continuation was blamed on a lack of
resources but there were continuing attempts to increase awareness in other ways: “We don’t have
enough resources to continue the AEP program, but still, we provide awareness to adolescents
usingourschoolteachersandAnganwadiworkers.” (HeadTeacher,M,AndhraPradesh).
Itappearsthatcontinuationofprogramscouldhavebeenensuredbyagradualtaperingofactivities
withaphasefocusedoncapacitybuildingandinstitutionalisation. Intheabsenceofthenecessary
capacityandtheresultinglackofconfidencearisingfromit,eventhoughthewillingnessanddesire
for continuation was there, community efforts were haphazard and easily frustrated. Community
mobilisation was considered a weak point by a key informant and a priority area for greater
involvementbyUNICEF:“oneareawheregovernmentisstrugglingisthecommunitymobilisation.
They do not have adequate human resources, so here I see the role of civil society organisations is
very critical in terms of community mobilization, community awareness, you know, ensuring true
community participation in the program implementation is one area where maybe UNICEF can
take a lead and bridge that gap between government and community” (UNICEF Staff 1, Assam,
Pos. 23).
MonitoringandFeedbackMechanisms
With few exceptions noting a “lack in monitoring” (Deputy Commissioner 2, Part 2), particularly
in relation to the number of student (temporary and permanent) dropouts (WDCW Staff, Andhra
Chapter3: Findings 120
Pradesh) or the insufficient independent midterm evaluation to methodically assess (rather than
rely on NGOs’ declarations) “whether the program is reaching [the] most vulnerable adolescents”
(DeputyCommissioner2),keyinformantsgenerallyagreedthatthethird-partymonitoringsystem
putinplacetokeeptrackoftheAEPonaquarterlybasisthroughoutitsimplementationwasa“very
strong” (UNICEF Staff 2, Delhi) and effective platform for promoting and informing dialogue
throughout the program implementation. They particularly lauded its application in facilitating
knowledge sharing across the states, its contribution to informing “further reprogramming” in
relation to adolescent empowerment (UNICEF Staff 2, Delhi) and the system’s encouragement for
stakeholders“toreflectandunderstandwhere[theAEP]islaggingandwhatcorrectedaction[needs]
tobetaken”(UNICEFStaff2,Jharkhand). Indeed,aUNICEFstaffmemberinJharkhanddescribed
a number of “mid-cut corrections” that resulted in relation to the involvement of boys in the AEP,
basedonthecommunicationresultingfromthemonitoringdata(UNICEFStaff1,Jharkhand).
Keyinformantsspokeofmultiplelevelsofgovernment,communityleadersandotherstakeholders
involvedinmodifyingandrectifyingprogrammaticapproachesbasedonfeedbackdrawnfromthe
monitoring data. In addition, some reported employing more frequent mechanisms of monitoring
AEP implementation, using, for instance, the WhatsApp messaging system in order to remain
informed on a “real time basis” about the number of adolescent participants (by gender) in tea
gardenadolescentandparentgroups,technicalconsultantssporadicallyvisitinginterventionsites,
fortnightly meetings involving adolescents providing feedback on the programming and monthly
meetings between block, Panchayat and district levels officials to review and discuss necessary
adaptations to the programming (UNICEF Staff 3, Jharkhand). These latter monthly meetings, in
particular, enabled those involved (program team, field officers, block officers) to regularly gather
and share feedback “so that everybody could know each other[’s] learning, issues and problems”
allowing them to collectively “address the problem” and fill the gap identified (UNICEF Staff 3,
Jharkhand).
One key informant described the occasional attendance of children at these coordination meet-
ings, which sometimes involved “dramatic” gatherings in which “thematic deliberations” at times
involved reports of very young children engaging in child marriage and the “children narrating
their experience and their decisions” (UNICEF Staff 3, Andhra Pradesh). Complementing these
regular meetings were field visits, typically by UNICEF staff (from Delhi and state offices) to en-
gage directly with implementing NGOs, district officials, frontline and Anganwadi workers as well
as adolescents, in an effort “to create space for feedback and getting on-the-ground perspectives”
to complement the official reporting channels between the NGOs and UNICEF in order to better
understandtheobstaclesfacedinAEPimplementation(UNICEFStaff1,AndhraPradesh).
A UNICEF staff member in West Bengal noted the value of direct feedback mechanisms made

tothedistrictmagistrateandsaythat,look,thesearetheissueswhichwearefacing”(UNICEFStaff
2, West Bengal). This UNICEF staff member reported that the use of such a feedback mechanism
Chapter3: Findings 121
was “kind of an eye opener” for UNICEF, as it enabled adolescents to openly voice their opinions
and raise issues related not only to their personal lives but to their communities, such as lacking
toilets at schools or playgrounds etc., in best case scenarios also enabling the district magistrate to
“takeimmediateaction”onsuchmatters(UNICEFStaff2,WestBengal).
Despitethesegenerallypositiveassessmentsofthemonitoringmechanismsinplacethroughoutthe

thatthemonitoringmayhavebeeninadequateorinconsistentduetomisreporting: “Moreover,for
the life skill training when the teachers were trained we were told to take the classes once or twice
weekly. But when we go the ground level we find that no such classes happen. It is only when
we go to the schools; the teachers tell their students that when the NGO people will ask about the
classes they have to say that the classes are being taken regularly. But when we interact directly

The endline evaluation for the AEP was particularly challenging on account of the COVID-19

somecases. Asaresult,theevaluationprovidesasnapshotofmediumtoevenlongtermimpactof

Additional issues that introduced complexities in the evaluation were the low implementation
fidelity, the absence of good baseline data and the variation in program MIS data. The block level
design suffered from two main concerns, i) the lack of power, implying that large samples might
not be able to tease out program effects, even if these exist, and ii) threats to the randomization
validity,duetofailureinrandomizationwithfewclusters. Tomitigatetheseissues,thevillagelevel
randomization design was added, improving power for several variables, and enabling the design
to test the effectiveness of different program modalities. However, at endline, it became clear that
implementation at village level was not followed by all states except West Bengal. Hence, the
analysis has to be carried out at the original block level, due to contamination and selection bias
related concerns. However, even at block level the implementation was not ideal, where Andhra
Pradesh implemented heavily in five blocks, and only lightly in the remaining 17 blocks. These
deviationsinbothdesign-levelscreatedbiases,whichimplythatthevalidityofsomeoftheresults

that imbalances in outcomes occurring post 2011 would not have been detected. Moreover, the
baseline level for many relevant intermediate outcomes for adolescents and parents, specifically
related to empowerment were missing, besides the reduce baseline conducted in 2016. A large
baseline would have allowed a more precise estimation of outcomes values at baseline, and the
change in these as a result of the program, at endline. Despite these issues, the evaluation team

Largely, the findings from the qualitative and quantitative components should not be examined at
the meta-level, but rather within the various sub-samples that are described. The implementation
of the AEP differed across the four states to fit in with existing government programs, structures
and additional implementation challenges. These provided different contexts and platform for the
program to function in, and to reach adolescents. Likewise, UNICEF worked alongside different

one person per village reported to be aware of AEP activities in 64% of villages. Triangulating
information from both MIS data and endline survey data, the AEP would have reached 94% of

Among individuals, program awareness of AEP events in treatment areas was low (16%). While
revealing, it is important to note that only respondents who could identify the name of the imple-
mentingorganizationthatcarriedanevent,training,groupactivityofworkshopintheirvillagewas
identified as “reached by the program”. Given that activities could have been implemented more
than three years before the survey, and given the delays in data collection caused by COVID-19,

positive effects when considering formal years of education. An increase in 0.3 years of formal
education is found among adolescent boys and girls in treatment areas, when considering results
from all states combined. This increase is statistically significant for both girls and boys. At the

Andhra Pradesh showed encouraging results with reduced child marriage rates within the
treated villages. Results for Andhra Pradesh showed a statistically significant reduction in child
marriage rates among all adolescents in the ages of 10 to 19 (-3.0pp). This reduction was stronger

The evaluation also considered intermediate outcomes that were to be influenced by the AEP.
Change (or lack thereof) in intermediate outcomes can help to understand the limited effect of the
AEP on final outcomes. The program was successful in improving awareness of adolescent rights
among respondents (adolescents, parents and community leaders) in treatment areas. Likewise,

results differed by state and a large majority of community leaders reported CPCs were not present

Communication outcomes were marginally improved. The program increased slightly the share
of intergenerational dialogue situations that adolescent boys and girls engaged in. This positive
effect was stronger when focusing on adolescent girls alone (2.pp) and on older adolescent girls in
particular(4.2pp).

changes between treatment and control areas in social norms relating to child marriage or equal

Considering the Relevance of the program, key informants frequently reported a strong integra-
tion and explicit alignment of AEP programming with existing government goals, schemes and
initiatives. In addition to ensuring the AEP’s alignment with international frameworks such as the
UNCRC,theyemphasizedthattheAEPhadbeenwellintegratedwithexistinggovernmentactivities.
However,inspiteoftheapparentlycloseintegrationandownershipbythegovernmentmanystudy
participants felt they were incapable of continuing program activities in the absence of NGO
and/or UNICEF support and guidance. According to them, this was due to lacking financial
support, lack of knowledge and training as well as limited motivation among facilitators and
group members. Despite these apprehensions, a few participants reported undertaking efforts to
continue the programming within their capacities and available human resources. A handful of
participantsmentionedactivitieswereongoingbutrecountedthechallengesofcontinuingactivities

Although this finding is derived from qualitative interviews, the wide variety of contexts and
conditionsthattheinterventionneededtoadapttomayhavelowereditsimpact. Inmanycases,
the adaptations eventually undertaken were dependent on individual initiative and responsiveness
to feedback and good monitoring. As discussed below, this was not always optimal. The local
factors that required adaptation related to language, culture, religion, security situation, need
for inclusiveness and much more. This means that apart from increased responsiveness, greater
participation in program design and flexibility of intervention may help provide the necessary
adaptabilitytoaccountfortheimmensediversityoflocalcontexts.
Finally, despite generally positive assessments of the monitoring mechanisms in place throughout
the AEP, one District Officer requested stronger coordination and more regular meetings between
AEP and other service providers in order to ensure transparency in data sharing, for instance in
relation to adolescent healthcare seeking behavior, in the absence of which service providers are
unabletoprovidetherequiredservicesdespitetheneedforit. Qualitativeinterviewalsosuggested
that clear and structured coordination mechanisms were not implemented and/or followed by all
frontline workers. Most adolescents and parent study participants that mentioned coordination
described this as an ad hoc process. These coordination challenges arose mostly due to lacking
information and databases, which implied that coordination between implementation levels was
Chapter4: ConclusionandOutlook 127
compromised.
II. Lessons Learned
This section outlines lessons learned that emerged through the evaluation process. These include
approaches and strategies that could enhance the implementation, and evaluation, of complex
cross-sectoralprogramslikeAEP. First,lessonslearnedonprogramimplementationarepresented,
followedbylessonslearnedonprogrammonitoringandevaluation.
ProgramImplementation
• Facilitating communication among frontline workers and other IPs can enhance pro-
gram implementation. A key informant suggested that clear and structured coordination
mechanisms were not implemented and/ or followed by all frontline workers. In this line,
mostadolescentsandparentstudyparticipantsthatmentionedcoordinationdescribedthisas
an ad hoc process. These coordination challenges arose mostly due to lacking information
and databases, which implied that coordination between implementation levels was com-
promised. As a lesson learned, improving coordination and information sharing between
village and district level committees could enhance implementation at the ground level. As
part of the AEP, this was done by IP and frontline workers by introducing fortnightly co-
ordination meetings, and by the creation of a reporting mechanism that ensured frequent
sharing of information and referrals. Quick feedback mechanisms, such as “WhatsApp”
were used by some key informants, and could also be incorporated within communication
strategiesofsimilarprogramsinthefuture,toallowrealtimeimprovementsinprogramming.
• Regular training and capacity building of government officials’ at different levels is
needed to ensure adequate coordination with IPs. Quantitative and qualitative evidence
hintsthatprogramimplementationdifferedconsiderablyacrosscommunities. Likewise,per-
ceptions regarding the receipt of support (in terms of trainings or resources from UNICEF
and/ortheirpartneringIP)differedacrossfrontlineworkers(headteachers,Anganwadiwork-
ers, CPC members) and across states, with some key informants feeling that they received
sufficient support, while others indicating that they received no support at all. Stronger
coordination and support from stakeholders at all levels would facilitate the effective imple-
mentationofprogramadaptationstomeetlocalcontexts.
• Gender barriers can create challenges to the participation of adolescent boys and par-
ents. Gender barriers such as some boys’ and fathers’ discomfort discussing menstruation,
limited the involvement of some prospective participants in the AEP. Adolescents requested
Chapter4: ConclusionandOutlook 128
teachers of their own gender in order to address this challenge. In Assam, mixed teams
of teachers (one male and two female teachers for every co-educational school) helped to
successfully address this barrier, as it accounted for the greater number of girl children and
atthesametimeallowedboystotalkwithmaleteachersabouttheirownissues.
• Programming activities at suitable timing facilitates participation of adolescents and
parents. The convenience of the adolescent groups’ timing, (typically on weekends or after
school)andlocation(alwaysinacentralandeasilyaccessiblevenuesuchasaschool,temple
or community center) was appreciated by participants and should be seen as critical to suc-
cessful participation. Similarly, for parents, the timing of the group meetings in the evening
wasbeneficialforparticipation,especiallyoffathers.
• The peer educator role was beneficial in more aspects than initially anticipated. Al-
though the original focus of the peer education was to be on adolescents, in Jharkhand they
additionally took on the function of facilitating intergenerational dialogues regarding child
marriagewithparents.
• Context-dependent state-level variation There is no “one glove fits all” approach possible
for the diverse contexts program operates in. Each state team operated in line with exist-
ing government bodies and programs, to leverage and improve upon existing structures that
promoteadolescentsandtheirrights. However,resultsfromAssamsuggestthatmanykeyin-
dicatorsdidnotimprovewithinprogramareas. Payparticularattentiontouniqueregions
or populations (such as tea garden communities) where challenges are greater and the
riskofdrop-outs,childlabororearlymarriageandsubsequentlyearlypregnanciesare
higher.
ProgramMonitoring&Evaluation
• Focusing the evaluation on a smaller set of activities can help to pinpoint specific ap-
proaches that work to reduce child marriage. Variations in program implementation, by
locationandbyIPs,createdchallengestocaptureexpectedoutputsfromalldifferentprogram
activities comprised within the AEP. A more standardized approach, where key program
aspects are similar, such as mode of selection of adolescents within groups (school based or
sportgrouporemploymentprogram),roleandengagementwithCPCs,useofradioprogram,
etc. would have facilitated the evaluation process. In this sense, focusing the evaluation on
a pilot program, with a smaller set of program activities, would have improved the external
validity of the evaluation results, and would have allowed for concrete recommendations on
whichmodalitiesperformbesttoinformfurtherupscalingoftheprogram.

design. Adrawbackoftheendlineevaluationtomediatechangesinimplementationwasthe

tors, information that was not available to the evaluation team at endline. These differences
become even more critical with several threats to the design validity, as in the case of this
evaluation. Futureevaluationsshouldaccountforthisintheirplanningandbudgeting.
• Providing real-time access to monitoring information to the evaluation team can help
to track the state of program implementation more effectively. Despite several attempts
to acquire MIS data over the evaluation period, the evaluation team did not have real-time
access to monitoring information, implying regular monitoring of the implementation, i.e.,
treatment compliance, was not possible. The biggest drawback to this was that quality and
intensity of implementation could not be checked regularly, and the course and incidence
of contamination between the various program groups was not available to the evaluation
team until the endline. Providing real-time monitoring data access for the evaluation team,

in knowledge between evaluation and implementation team. Likewise, a straightforward
knowledge management strategy, including communication plans for all key actors in the
evaluation,couldhavefacilitatedcommunicationbetweenstates,andwithinprogramactivi-

III. Recommendations
The recommendations outlined below stem from the evaluation process, implementation data,
quantitativeandqualitativefindingsandlessonslearned,andshouldbeconsideredinprogrammatic
decision-making in the future. Therefore, these are all targeted at UNICEF country and region
office staff. The recommended actions are not listed on the basis of their relative importance.
Consequently, the sequence of suggested actions below does not suggest one recommendation has
higherprioritythantheother,butareallactionablewithinthenextfewyears.
1. Enhancing communication strategies is needed to boost awareness of available pro-
grams on child marriage and education. Communication approaches that were followed
were not sufficient to generate awareness of program activities among respondents. In this
sense,futureprogramsonchildmarriage,educationandadolescentempowermentcanbenefit
fromincreasingawarenessoftheservicesavailable,particularlyinrelationtochildprotection
and school management committees. The evaluation team, thus, recommends creating
Chapter4: ConclusionandOutlook 130
a communication strategy for child marriage and education programs that includes a
variety of methods for outreach, e.g., engaging with digital media outreach as well as
collaboration with the private sector. The development and deployment of an expansive
communications strategy would ensure higher visibility, increased participation and higher
longevityofresults.
2. Targeting boys and parents can help to reduce acceptance of child marriage within
communities. Theevaluationresultshintattheinclusionofparentsandadolescentboysinto
program activities as beneficial. The inclusion of parents’ and boys’ group seems to lead to
improvements in core outcomes, potentially by creating a supportive environment for girl’s
empowerment, and should be included in future programming. Parent groups, especially,
should be considered for inclusion into programs related to adolescent empowerment and
wellbeing. Qualitativeevidenceshowsthatmaleparentsare,however,hardertoreachdueto
activitiesfallingwithintheirworkinghours. Likewise,genderbarriershadtobeovercometo
engage parents and adolescent boys in program activities that addressed culturally sensitive
topics. The evaluation team, thus, recommends creating a strategy for the effective en-
gagement of parents and adolescent boys in child marriage prevention programs. This
should include strategies and recommendations to overcome gender and availability
barriersfortheparticipationofboysandparentsinchildpreventionprograms.
3. Standardizing monitoring information across states in child marriage programs can
helptotrackandenhanceprogramimplementation. Duringtheimplementation,regular
structures of monitoring were set up to monitor the program, to share information and to
identify challenges in implementation, and thereby help address these shortcomings. The
use of this monitoring information was critical in improving program implementation and
enhancing programmatic approaches. Additionally, the monitoring information was helpful
forthequantitativeanalysis,thoughitwouldneedtobeunifiedacrossstates(unitsofreport-
ing and type of information collected). This is important to ensure that the extent and scale
of program implementation can be compared across states, and to conduct analysis of im-
plementationreachattheaggregatelevel,combiningmonitoringinformationfromallstates.
To avoid variation in reporting, the evaluation team recommends the development of a
toolkitforprogramstargetingchildmarriageof(qualitativeand)quantitativeresearch
tools, techniques and standardized indicators for monitoring changes in knowledge,
practices and gender equitable attitudes. This can facilitate a singular approach of mea-
suringprogramimplementationdespitevaryingmodalities,overasimilarunitofreporting.

tiveevidencesuggeststhatstudyparticipantsfelttheywereincapableofcontinuingprogram

Chapter4: ConclusionandOutlook 131
and group members. All agreed, however, that continuing the program would be very use-
ful. They worried that the achievements (regarding adolescents’ and parents’ learning and
changes in behavior) may be lost if the program does not resume. Simultaneously, they felt
it was important for the younger generation and those entering adolescence to also benefit
from the teachings they had received. The continuation of the program is encouraged by
the communities, but can only take place under a revised program. The evaluation team,
thus, recommends embedding sustainability of programs as a key aspect of future
programming,forinstance,embeddingprogrammaticapproachesintoexistinggovern-
ment schemes based on representative and rigorous evidence. Potential improvements
includecreationofparentsgroups,standardizeduseofCPCs,andadoptionofprogrammatic
