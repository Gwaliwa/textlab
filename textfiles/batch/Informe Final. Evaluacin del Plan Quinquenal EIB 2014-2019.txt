Executive summary
Context and background
The seven native peoples of Panama, Bribri, Naso Tjedi, Ngäbe, Buglé, Kuna, Emberá and
Waunaan, represent 12.3% of the Panamanian population and their children and adolescents 19%
of the total number of children under 18 years of Panama (INEC 2010). They are organized in 5 regions and 7
indigenous territories. Three of these regions: Ngäbe-Buglé, Kuna Yala and Emberá-Wouunaan have
Province category, which is why they have their own regional educational addresses. Two, with
Kuna population, matugandí and Wargandí have a category of corregimientos. You are together with the
communities formed by the Naso and Bribri peoples, are part of regional addresses with
Latin population
The multidimensional poverty index of children and adolescents (IPM-NNA) of households
indigenous exceeds the national index that is at 0.1494. In the Kuna Yala region it is 0.593, in Emberá-
Waunaan is 0.365 and in Ngäbe-Buglé it is 0.568 (MEF, INEC, Mides, 2018).
The indicator of lack of education and early training of the IPM-NNA, also exceeds the index
National located in 16.1. In the regions of Kuna Yala, Emberá-Wouunaan and Ngäbe-Buglé is from
48.7, 40.9 and 48.7 respectively. The educational offer in the schools of the indigenous peoples is
deficit at all levels with the exception of primary school. Access to the preschool level in Darien
And in the Emberá-Wouunaan region it does not reach 45% of the population under 5, the premedia
exceeds 50% only in the Kuna Yala region and in all indigenous territories the average is almost
non -existent (Meduca 2019). The schools of these peoples are deficit in infrastructure,
teachers trained in EIB, contextualized and material curricular programs, as well as a
adequate supervision.
The indigenous peoples of Panama question the quality of education provided in their schools
and rescue the need to include their language and knowledge in the curriculum and study programs. TO
beginnings of the 1980s, in Latin America the homogenizing bias of
Educational systems, which were limited to translating school academic content into languages
vernacules (Trapnell 1984), or to add "indigenous" school content to national curricula, and
It was raised rather to rethink indigenous education from a cultural decolonization perspective
and ideological (Varese and Rodríguez 1983). International agreements and conventions joined this
Bilingual Intercultural Education Concept (EIB), assuming that this education accepts the
existence of different visions of reality and opposes rational concepts that seek the ‘truth
universal and universal.
In Panama, the Constitution of the Republic, the Education Law, the laws of creation of the
Regions, Law 88, among others, recognize the right to bilingual intercultural education. The
National Directorate of Bilingual Intercultural Education (DNEIB) of the Ministry of Education
(Meduca) has the mandate of managing the implementation of EIB throughout the national territory.
To comply with this role, with UNICEF support, he designed the EIB five-year plan, 2014-2019.
Object of evaluation
The object of the evaluation is the “EIB five -year plan for the original peoples of Panama,
2014 - 2019 ”, whose general objective was“ to offer the native peoples an education that
Consider its cultural characteristics and develop your communicative competence in education
initial and basic of multilingual intercultural education, for the strengthening of its identity,
appropriation of the national culture, consolidate its mother tongue (L1) and the
Acquisition orally and written from Spanish and English as a second language (L2) ”.
The Plan defined four work components: i) Strengthening of Human Resources in Management and
Teaching EIB, II) Curriculum and Materials, iii) Restructuring of School Management and Administration and
Yo
iv) evaluation, monitoring and supervision of classroom; with which, at the end of the period, he had to count
With a national and regional administration strengthened in EIB management and supervision, 3,000 teachers
trained, 400 educational centers of the seven native peoples developing the EIB until the
Ninth grade, benefiting 60,000 children and indigenous children (NNA).
For the execution of the plan, the DNEIB presented a budget requirement of 46 million
Balboas, integrating only 21 million into the budget that Meduca presented to the MEF, obtaining
At the end of the Legislative Assembly only 5 million balboas.
The holders of the plan of the plan are the indigenous children and the main guarantor is the Meduca. The
Indigenous authorities are secondary guarantors of the right to quality EIB.
Purpose and objective of the evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation is to achieve institutional learning and that the promotion of policies to
future is guided by the knowledge generated in the quinquenio evaluated.
The objective is to analyze the effectiveness of what is carried out in the plan for the achievement of the results, its
relevance to national needs and NNA rights, efficiency in the management of
human and financial resources and the sustainability of the actions and results obtained and the
NNA participation from a human rights perspective and gender equity.
EVALUATION SCOPE
Thematic: The evaluation analyzes the interventions carried out with the implementation of the EIB, in the
Frame of the four components of the plan, identifying bottlenecks and results achieved.
Temporary: It covers the five years of the period of the 2014-2019 plan.
Territorial: its scope is national because it evaluates information from the Sietes Peoples schools
Native.
Evaluation framework
The evaluation of the five -year plan is carried out based on the criteria defined by the OECD: efficacy,
relevance, efficiency and sustainability in a human rights framework. In each criterion there are
questions that guide the evaluation of the plan, identifying by each question the formation of judgment,
the indicators, the sources of information and the collection methods.
Methodology
This evaluation uses mixed methods, combining qualitative and quantitative tools, and
Elements of evaluation based on plan theory (rebuilt change theory). The
evaluation was carried out during the Covid-19 pandemic under conditions of restrictions on
Mobility, social distancing and closure of schools. For this situation the visits were suspended
to schools and three fundamental sources were used: i) two surveys applied virtually to
173 Directors of schools and 101 teachers who apply EIB; II) 60 virtual interviews to
National, regional and supervisors of Meduca, training institutions, training institutions,
International Cooperation Organizations, Leaders and Leaders of Regions and Organizations
indigenous; iii) analysis of curricular programs, materials, reports, plans, laws, data
Statistics 2019 of Meduca, among others. For better information triangulation,
Quantitative data were contrasted with qualitative information. The sample to apply the
surveys was formed by all schools that according to information from the DNEIB were
Applying the EIB.
Conclusions
The main conclusions are presented as a result of the findings found:
Effectiveness:
1. The implementation of the plan was not effective enough to get the EIB to develop
in the schools of the seven indigenous peoples and that the right of children can be fulfilled,
indigenous girls and adolescents to a quality education, with respect to their language and their culture. The
II
Lack of development of the planned strategies and activities prevented programs
Curricular and EIB materials, personnel trained in management and teaching in EIB, systems of
monitoring and supervision of EIB schools and student evaluation; as well as guaranteeing the
Institutional strengthening of the DNEIB and regional regional addresses. With exception
of the budget requirement product, its execution did not achieve any of the other products
planned or the expected results.
At the end of the period it continues without EIB schools, only classrooms with teachers who try to develop
EIB despite not having curricular programs and EIB materials.
2. The implementation of the plan was not assumed by the majority of the organizational structure of the
Meduca, leaving in the DNEIB all the responsibility of its execution, without providing him with the
regulations, human and financial resources that would allow him to lead a systematic process and
articulated with the different national and regional addresses, indigenous authorities and the
International cooperation.
Relevance:
3. The little clarity that the different responsible actors had on what EIB and its implications are
In school work, they influenced the activities and programs carried out not to respond
sufficiently to the rights of indigenous children to a relevant and quality education. I don't know
He gave an adequate response to changes in sociolinguistic scenarios, to the needs of
teacher training and training from a personal and pedagogical technical dimension, or
to the articulation of the knowledge of the native peoples with school academic knowledge.
4. The scarce involvement in the formulation and implementation of the Quinquenal Plan of the leaders,
leaders and traditional authorities of the seven native peoples prevented collecting their demands and
needs and have your support in the dissemination and surveillance of plan development, as well as in
The achievement of their goals and objectives.
Efficiency:
5. Although the financial resources obtained for the implementation of the plan were 10%
($ 5,000,000.00) of the budget requirement, was the first time that a plan prepared by the
Dneib managed to have a budget. However, DNEIB did not have the management capacity to
prioritize activities and results that allow efficient use of the resources obtained and use it
as counterpart with other financial sources.
6. Although international cooperation supported Meduca with various programs and products
mentioned in the five -year plan, no evidence was found that the plan was a tool
articulator that potentiates this contribution.
Sustainability:
7. The minimum conditions have not been guaranteed to ensure the sustainability of the actions
made in favor of the EIB during the five -year period. No organizational development has been achieved
articulated between the different national and regional instances of Meduca, the strengthening of
the technical teams and a context of political commitment of Meduca and the authorities
Indigenous traditional in favor of the implementation of EIB.
Gender and equity rights:
8. The plan has not generated spaces for reflection on differential needs between genres,
nor for the participation of children and adolescents. Although the five -year plan went to
make their right to quality EIB effective, they and they cannot only be receptors and must
Together with their fathers and mothers, to act in the recognition and demand of their rights.
III
Lessons learned
1. The process of implementing a plan -oriented plan of the original peoples,
It requires the concerted action of the different directions of Meduca. While the EIB follows
Being a marginal theme in Meduca there is a risk of maintaining the paradigm of a school
monocultural officer, with its back to the diverse reality of the country, and limit the EIB to the development of
specific activities, disconnexes with each other, without a real impact on indigenous students.
2. An effective implementation of the five -year plan requires participation, coordination and
strategic and permanent articulation of different types of actors, and not only of the technicians of the
DNEIB, so that the formulation of the plan is involved, the traditional authorities,
leaders and leaders of indigenous organizations, children and adolescents and their parents and
mothers, as well as NGOs and international cooperation entities that develop projects and
educational programs in indigenous areas.
3. The development of an EIB five -year plan for the native peoples of Panama requires, as
minimum, that the different actors responsible for their implementation handle a clear proposal
and agreed on what is understood by EIB and what characteristics an EIB school has; than the
actors have the profile and capabilities necessary for their execution, and the budget is
requested.
4. To be relevant EIB proposals must respond to changes in the scenarios
sociolinguistic and in the demographic and social dynamics that are causing displacement
of languages native to Spanish and a growing migration to urban areas.
5. The delay in the approval of standards has been a brake for the implementation of the EIB during
The development of the five -year plan, affecting the right of children to an education in their
Language and culture, endorsed by national and international laws and policies. However, the fault
The norm cannot continue to be an excuse to stop the development of EIB proposals.
Recommendations
In view of the findings and conclusions indicated, the consulting team presents the following
recommendations, aimed at improving the effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of
EIB in Panama.
Institutionalization of EIB
1. The senior management of Meduca must ensure that EIB becomes a state policy
prioritized, which is implemented with a national plan progressively and systematically, with goals,
clear objectives, strategies and indicators and with a budget that allows its implementation
gradual in all schools that serve indigenous students.
2. EIB requires a regulatory framework that allows its operationalization and officialization. It is suggested
that Meduca accelerates the culmination of the entire regulatory package that has been in process: i)
the regulation of Law 88, ii) the proposals of elaborated resolved, and iii) the profiles of the different
charges for EIB.
Contextualized and material curricula
3. It is suggested that the DNEIB and the Curriculum Directorate, together with the regional addresses of
education and traditional authorities of the regions, review the strategy adopted to add
subjects to the national curriculum, and analyze other alternatives, taking advantage of the advances achieved. This
requires elaborating new protocols for the design of curricular programs from an approach
EIB that addresses indigenous and academic-school knowledge in an articulated manner, as well as a
Design plan for new materials that respond to these programs.
IV
Human Resources Training for EIB
4. It is suggested that the Directorate of Training and Teaching Improvement, in coordination with the
DNEIB, design a human resources training plan, with the support of training institutions
State and private for the initial and continuous training of teachers in EIB. This plan should
also cover specialized training in school management and administration for directors
of educational centers and administration and management of the EIB for various officials of the system
National and regional educational.
Differentiated attention in EIB and language treatment
5. Considering the displacement process that are suffering from languages native to the
growing influence of the Spanish, it is suggested that Meduca through the DNEIB, review the model
EIB pedagogical that assumes that the native language is always the mother tongue (L1) of the children
and girls from indigenous peoples and Spanish the second language (L2). This requires the development of several
EIB care models and differentiated pedagogical tools.
Indigenous participation
6. The role of traditional authorities, leaders and leaders of indigenous organizations is crucial
for the development of any educational plan or program within its territories. That is why I know
recommends indigenous congresses to include the theme of EIB as a priority theme in their
agendas and work spaces and meduca create a space for dialogue, consultation and taking of
decisions with these leaders and leaders generating a new social pact in favor of an education
quality bilingual intercultural.
Availability and management of human and financial resources
7. It is necessary for Meduca to work with the MEF to create a budget item of
Specific investment for EIB policy that is part of the national budget, in such a way
that there are sufficient resources for the implementation of EIB in indigenous regions
and collective lands.
8. Given the need to maximize funds and human resources available for development
of the EIB, the Meduca is suggested to convene international cooperation in order to arrange
efforts oriented to the effective implementation of the EIB, based on a specific plan and in a way
articulated in the territories of the 7 native peoples.
Organizational strengthening and technical teams
9. Meduca is suggested to elaborate a continuity strategy of the processes and actions that have
They are unfinished and that are necessary for attention with EIB to indigenous students.
This implies articulating the actions of the plan with the new development project of the peoples
indigenous, close to being initiated with a World Bank loan and led by the Ministry of
Government.
10. The implementation of the five -year plan and the development of EIB requires a solid team
and with strengthened capabilities both at the DNEIB level and regional addresses
educational (DRE). Therefore it is necessary that the organizational structure of the Meduca be reviewed and
improve coordination and articulation channels between national and regional addresses of
education, as well as generating greater autonomy for a more effective performance and
timely in their territories.
Gender Equity and Equity Rights
11. It is recommended to articulate the work of the EIB with other sectors of the State that ensure the
Childhood rights and with cooperation entities such as UNICEF and UNFPA and do more
Explicit in the national curriculum and in the contextualized curricular programs EIB, the themes of
Child rights, the gender equity approach, from an intercultural perspective.

1. Context and background
1.1. The native peoples in Panama
In Panama there are 7 native villages: Ngäbe, Kuna, Emberá, Buglé, Wooan, Naso Tjedi, and Bribri,
With your own culture and language. According to estimates from the last census of 20101, for the
2018, its population represents 12.3% of the total Panamanian population and the indigenous population
From 0 to 17 years, it represents 19% of the total people under 18 in the country. The people
Ngäbe is the largest population and the minor is bribri. The masculinity index is greater in
All peoples with the exception of the Kuna people, which may be due to a greater loss of
indigenous identity in women, or belonging to an original people in the Buglé and Waunaan case
which are minorities against Ngäbe and Emberá with whom they share territories.

Territorially these peoples are organized in 5 regions and 7 territories. The recognition of
region is significant because they give them a dual government system, with regime authorities
Republican and traditional authorities, in addition to a unique and integrated territory and property
Earth collective (UNFPA-INEC s/f). Three of these regions have province category, by
which, they have regional regional regional addresses; Two have corregimiento category2
and its schools are managed by regional non -regional regional addresses. Two of the
regions integrate two villages each and three of the regions correspond to the same town.

After many years of struggle, Law 72 of December 23, 2008 recognized the right to
Collective property of territories with indigenous population that had been out of the regions.
This law establishes the special procedure for free collective property award

However, despite these legal initiatives aimed at guaranteeing the right of peoples
native to their territories is known about the existence of various processes that put their
Territorial sovereignty. Among them are the invasions of the territories (entitled or in claim) and the
megaprojects of economic development and infrastructure that are executed or intended to be executed in
they. To the dispossession problems is added the impact that these processes could cause in
Environmentally very weak regions, which are already suffering the consequences of climate change.

In 2018 INEC, MEF and measure with the accompaniment of UNDP and UNICEF they calculated the poverty index

Specific lacks and deprivations of the population of 0-17 years of Panama, in order to improve the design and implementation of policies
aimed at ensuring compliance with the rights of NNA. The IPM-NNA matrix determined 5 dimensions and 10 indicators.

When disaggregating the IPM-NNA for each of its indicators it is observed that, in each of them, the
value in the regions is much greater than in the national average, clearly expressing the
situation of inequality in which these children and adolescents live, limiting their possibilities of
development. Today it is known that the context in which boys and girls live, especially in the first
years, influences its physical, psychosocial and cognitive development. The quality of housing, health,
Nutrition, care and recreation are key for these children to arrive at school

Statistics from the Ministry of Education for 2019 indicate that in the country there are 623 educational centers
considered indigenous5.
• Because of the population and extension of the Ngäbe Buglé region, 61% is located in this region
With 321 schools, of which 27 are from the Buglé people.
• In Bocas del Toro with 13% (84 schools) 3 schools of the Naso people, 3 schools are located
Currently closed from Bibri people and the rest, schools with Ngäbe population.
5 Educational centers are categorized by Meduca as urban, rural and indigenous. Here only those that appear
as indigenous centers and are located within the regions. However, taking into account that half of the indigenous population lives
Outside the regions it can be collected that in some schools indicated as rural there is an indigenous school population. For example,
Schools that are located in the ancestral wounaan territory that are in the province of Panama this figure as rural schools. This
categorization enters into contradiction with article 4 of Law 88 that raises the teaching of the native language in the regions, areas
Annexes and collective lands.

• In Darién, Emberá-Wouunaan and Region Kuna Yala have 8% of schools each,
which corresponds to 47, 52 and 49 schools respectively. In Darién there are the 3 schools of the
Kuna de Wargandí region, 7 of the Wounaan town, 3 Kuna de Taguguyala and Emberá Schools.
In the Emberá-Woounaan 5 Son of the Wounaan people.
• In Panama this is 2% with 12 schools, 10 of the Kuna of Madugandí and two of the
Emberá territory of Alto Bayano.

It reaches 50% of schools. In Panama according to educational law, the State has the obligation to
ensure nine levels that go from preschool to the end of premedia (ninth grade), to all
Children and adolescents. It is observed that this right is not fulfilled in indigenous schools. The

As for the student population, the same statistics indicate for 2019, 16% of the total
Students (115,408) are in indigenous educational centers. Of this total, 88% (101,098) are
In indigenous regions and the rest, 12% outside the regions, mainly in Bocas del Toro,
Darien and Panama. The relationship of children and adolescents by sex at each level
It shows that at all levels men are a majority. The difference, which is two points in
4
Preschool, it is increasing until it is located at 8 points at the average level in favor of men. It
that suggests that girls are the first to leave school (graph 3).
For 2019, the number of teachers in indigenous schools was 7,375 (600 in preschool, 3,588 in
Primary, 1,129 in Premedia and 2,058 on average), of this total, 6,594 are located within the regions
indigenous (509 in pre -school, 3,058 in primary, 1,022 in Premedia and 2,005 on average). The quantity
of teachers on average, despite the lower offer at this level, it is explained by the specialization in the
Teaching subjects. Although these statistics do not give teachers by gender
Depending on the degree they teach, there are generally more teachers in the minor degrees and more
male teachers in the upper degrees.
The quality of education received by NNA is not good. Schools in communities
Indigenous people do not have educational texts and materials with cultural relevance, they do not have enough
bilingual teachers, and many of them lack training or have training
limited on EIB. To this is added the absence of training and accompaniment programs
pedagogical, and the low operational capacity for supervision and monitoring from the addresses
regional and the central level of Meduca. “In Panamá, the place where you live determines the quality
of the education you receive. This is reflected in international tests such as Terce and tests
premises such as growing, where there are large gaps between urban, rural or regional areas. By
example, while in the urban area, 4 out of 10 students do not achieve the basic level in reading,
In rural areas 5 out of 10 it does not succeed and in regions 8 of 10 ”(UNICEF, 2019).
1.4. The right to quality education of children and adolescents of
Native peoples
In the early 1980s, indigenous leaders from several Latin American countries along with
professionals linked to the indigenous movement, joined the questioning that was done, from
various continents, to the homogenizing and assimilatory bias of educational systems (v. May 1999,
Mac Carty and others 2005, Varese and Rodríguez 1983). Thus, the need to go more
beyond bilingual education programs, aimed at translating school academic content to
The vernacular languages (Trapnell 1984), or to add "indigenous" school content to curricula
national and, rethink indigenous education from a cultural decolonization perspective and
Ideological (Varese and Rodríguez 1983). In this context, the education term began to be used
bilingual intercultural (EIB).
Today, there is a wide range of speeches about interculturality, some more functional
to the current system of domination and others rather oriented to the questioning of conditions
in which it is intended to develop the “cultural dialogue”. The former usually focus on
cultural diversity and consider that conflicts can be overcome with more information about
of the "other" and best communication practices; while the latter raise the need for
that “the dialogue of cultures is to enter dialogue about economic, political,
military, etc. that condition the frank exchange between the cultures of humanity [...] not to
falling into the ideology of a decontextualized dialogue that would favor only the created interests of the
dominant civilization, not taking into account the asymmetry of power that reigns in the world ”(Fornet
Betancourt 2000: 12). From this second position the need to identify and
Review the beliefs that reproduce the asymmetry of power and strengthen processes development
of personal reworking of self -image of contempt and denial generated through the
Colonial domination (Mignolo 2000). In the same way, the need to address aspects is raised
5
ontological and epistemological6 assuming that intercultural education accepts the existence of
different visions of reality and opposes rational concepts that seek “unique truth and
universal".
Examples of this new EIB vision, we find them in experiences developed in Peru in
the ‘Bilingual Teacher Training Program of the Peruvian Amazon’, coejecuted by the
Loreto Pedagogical Higher Institute and the Aidesep Indigenous Confederation, which forms teachers
bilinguals that promote the revaluation of the cultural heritage of their peoples and an education
relevant and quality for children and adolescents; and in Guatemala in the ‘program of
Improvement of the quality of education ’, developed by the Ministry of Education, oriented
to implement EIB at the preschool and primary level according to the demands of the peoples
indigenous.
To this process of review of the paradigm have contributed world conventions and forums that
They have incorporated the issue of cultural diversity, in a human rights framework. In 1979 it occurs
the Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against CEDAW women;
In 1989 the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes that all children and adolescents,
Without discrimination, they are subjects of rights; In 1990 the World Forum made in Jomtien
Thailand declares "Education for all", then ratified in Dakar in 2000 and in the World Forum
of Incheon - Korea in 2015. The commitment of "Education for all" is an essential part of the
2030 Agenda for sustainable development with the objective 4 that seeks to “guarantee an education
inclusive, equitable and quality, and promote learning opportunities throughout life to
all. ”This same objective in goal 4.5 mentions indigenous peoples:“ From here to 2030,
Eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access at all levels
of teaching and professional training for vulnerable people, including people with
disability, indigenous peoples and children in situations of vulnerability. ”along with these
declarations, the rights of the original peoples are recognized existing documents of
International Law as the UN declaration on indigenous rights, agreements 107
and 169 of the ILO, the last not yet recognized by Panama.
1.5. The right to bilingual intercultural education in Panama (EIB)
In Panama, the long struggle of indigenous peoples for their right to intercultural education
Quality bilingual resulted in regulatory changes:
• The 1972 Panama Constitution, in its articles 88 and 90, recognizes languages
aborigines as an object of study, conservation and dissemination, and promote programs of
bilingual literacy. Article 108 talks about education and promotion programs
For indigenous groups.
• Law 34 of Education, reviewed in 1995, in its article 11 indicates that education for
indigenous communities are based on their right, to preserve, develop and
respect your identity and cultural heritage.
• The different laws of creation of the regions also recognize the right of peoples
originating to bilingual intercultural education at all levels7.
6 ontological aspects refer to the existence of different ways of understanding reality. For example, for original peoples
There is a visible reality accessible through the senses and a non -visible that can be known through various substances such as
tobacco, ayahuasca and toé. Epistemological aspects are understood as the existence of different ways of building and transmitting the
Knowledge that differ from schooling ways to learn, in which observation and practice have great incidence.
7 In Law 2 of 1938, which created the Kuna Yala region, in its article 29, there is talk of a bilingual intercultural education system in
All levels. In Law 22 of 1983, which creates the Emberá-Wouunaan region, in its article 21, it mentions a special program of
bilingual education In Law 10 of 1997, which creates the Ngäbe-Buglé region, in its article 54 talks about intercultural bilingual education
in the region, following what Law 34 of Education says.
6
In this century, the possibility of a bilingual intercultural education with the
following standards:
• Executive Decree 274 of August 31, 2007 that creates the National Intercultural Directorate
Bilingual (DNEIB) and assign functions, including implementing education
bilingual intercultural.
• Executive Decree 323 of October 2007 that creates the school regions Ngäbe Buglé and
Emberá- Waunaan.
• Executive Decree 687 of 2008 that implements and develops bilingual education
Intercultural in the indigenous peoples and communities of Panama, with special emphasis on the
Teaching reading and writing the mother tongue and spirituality of peoples
Indigenous of Panama.
• Law 88 of 2010, which recognizes the languages and alphabets of the indigenous peoples of Panamá
and dictates rules for bilingual intercultural education.
Together with these regulations, indigenous peoples, and the DNEIB, in particular, have prepared different
plans that sought to lift diagnoses, collect information as a source for the new
subjects of spirituality and indigenous identity, to train teachers in the management of the teaching of
Original and EIB language and the elaboration of materials. Among the plans are:
1. 1996. Plan of the Indigenous Peoples of Panama, prepared by the National Coordinator of
The indigenous peoples of Panama (Coledapip), with the support of the Foundation for the
Economic and Social Development of Central America and the Support Program of the Peoples
Indigenous of Central America of the European Union.
2. 1998. Annual Operational Plan 98-99 within the framework of the previous plan.
3. 2005. National Plan for Bilingual Intercultural Education, within the framework of the Strategic Plan
2005-2009 of the National Government and with the support of the authorities of Meduca and
International organizations such as World Bank, IDB and UNICEF.
4. 2011. EIB Implementation Plan in indigenous regions and territories 2011-2014.
Technical document addressed to the meduca authorities prepared by the DNEIB with the
IDB support.
5. 2014. Quinquenal Plan for Bilingual Intercultural Education for native peoples.
2014-2019 period, with the support of UNICEF.
EIB is a right that children and adolescents of the original peoples have to which the
Panamanian status has not responded. Despite the regulations and plans made, the DNEIB does not
He achieved, until 2016, to have a government investment budget to implement the EIB
And the operating budget that the Meduca grants it, does not allow to complete the resources
humans necessary to fulfill the role of managing the implementation of the EIB. All this
affects the educational achievements of indigenous children and adolescents who, according to the
Standard tests carried out occupy the lowest positions. "The biggest gap in performance
In reading it is among those who speak indigenous languages versus those who speak other languages
At home ”(Pisa, 2018). Because EIB is a right, its implementation means an important fight
that, together with the defense of the territory, the indigenous organizations of Panama fight.
1.6. EIB on UNICEF Agenda and International Cooperation in Panama
International cooperation has been the main source of financial and technical support in Actions
aimed at implementing EIB in Panama. AECID has been supporting the Kuna Congress with the project
of intercultural bilingual education since 2004. The World Bank supported the DNEIB in the
Teacher training and text production in three languages: Kuna, Ngäbere and Emberá. The IDB
supported the definition of operational plans and, as of 2017, together with the OEI, and the financing
7
Japanese promotes the Jadenkä program (fun mathematics for preschool level) in schools
Ngäbes of the Ngäbe-Buglé region.
UNICEF, on the other hand, has supported the Ngäbe and Emberá peoples in the elaboration of programs of
grade and materials, including a text for children on childhood rights and in the last
years in the production of new didactic support materials.
However, despite the normative advances, the design of plans and programs and the definition of
Guidelines, as well as the support of international cooperation, in 2014 problems persisted
in the implementation of bilingual intercultural education in Panama, caused, among others
factors, due to the presence of teachers without training in EIB; the lack of contextualized curricula and
Study and text programs in indigenous languages and with cultural relevance; as well as one
institutional and financial weakness of the National Directorate of Intercultural Bilingual Education
(DNEIB). In this context, UNICEF supported the DNEIB in the elaboration of the five -year plan of
Bilingual Intercultural Bilingual Education for the original peoples 2014 - 2019.
Now, UNICEF, within the framework of its cooperation program with the Government of the Republic of
Panama 2016-2020, which seeks: i) contribute to children and adolescents, particularly from
rural, indigenous and urban marginal areas, have timely access to an initial education of
quality and complete their premedia education cycle; ii) that Meduca has capacities and
instruments for the execution of a policy and an EIB national plan that guarantees the quality of
services and cultural relevance for all indigenous peoples; It was proposed to accompany the
Meduca and DNEIB in the evaluation of the five -year plan so that the Panamanian State and the
indigenous authorities have information to continue with the implementation of the EIB in
Panama.
2. Object of the evaluation and theory of change
2.1. Evaluation object
The object of the evaluation is the “Quinquenal Plan for Bilingual Intercultural Education for the
Native peoples of Panama, 2014 - 2019 ”, prepared in 2014 by Meduca and the
DNEIB, with the technical and financial support of UNICEF.
The plan, with executive intention, had the general objective of, “to offer the original peoples a
education that considers its cultural characteristics and develops its communicative competence in
Initial and basic education of multilingual intercultural education, for the strengthening of its
identity, appropriation of national culture, consolidate in an oral and written way its mother tongue
(L1) and the acquisition orally and written from Spanish and English as a second language (L2) ”.
Defined as specific objectives:
1. Develop a pedagogical model for native peoples that consider their characteristics
cultural and develop its communicative competence both in Spanish and in indigenous language.
2. Offer to the original population an intercultural and multilingual education, with quality and
cultural relevance.
As expected results at the end of the period, he defined:
1. 400 active educational centers, in execution and applying the teaching of the mother tongue, in
The Kuna Yala, Wargandí, Madugandí, Ngäbe Buglé, Emberá-Wouunaan regions, lands
Naso and Bibri ancestral, collective lands and urban areas with original population.
8
2. 60,000 Kuna, Ngäbe, Emberá, Buglé, Woounaan, Naso and Bribri, benefited from the
Teaching of L1 and L2 and the EIB program, to ninth grade. In the case of Naso peoples
And bribri the projection goes to sixth grade.
3. 3,000 teachers trained for the application of the mother tongue (L1) and the EIB program.
4. DNEIB, regional and regional addresses and links strengthened in its structure
administrative and management.
Within the framework of these expected objectives and results, the plan defined four components8:
1. Strengthening of human resources, through teacher training,
coordinators, links, directors and supervisors, technicians and administrators in the
EIB application methodologies and the management of the five -year plan.
2. Curriculum and contextualized materials, through the review and update of the curricula
and degree programs already produced and the design and elaboration of new programs, texts and
Educational materials in EIB with linguistic and cultural relevance.
3. Restructuring of EIB School Management and Administration, through a strategy
DNEIB Restructuring Administrative, of the Regional Directorates, reallocation of
Functions of regional links, budget allocation and a legal strategy of
Regulation, review and implementation of laws, decrees and resolved.
4. Evaluation, monitoring and supervision of classroom, through strengthening in quantity and
Capacity of the EIB monitoring and supervision system and the creation of a system of
Evaluation of EIB school students.
The five -year plan was prepared without a budget, but as a tool to be able to achieve it. With
This intention was presented at a public event with the participation of the main authorities
of Meduca, indigenous authorities, representatives of international cooperation and NGOs,
achieving the endorsement of the minister of that time, who delegated to the DNEIB the responsibility of elaborating
the necessary budget to implement it. For its elaboration, the DNEIB convened
representatives of the different indigenous peoples among teachers, teachers and leaders for
Identify the budgetary needs of its implementation in each of the peoples. Based
To this work the DNEIB proposed a budget of 46 million dollars for the age of 5, with the
Assignment shown in Table 39.

However, this budget proposal was not accepted and the budget obtained at the level
of the Ministry of Education, endorsed by the Minister of Education then, was twenty -one
8 The five -year plan considered a fifth component: adult literacy with their own goals and objectives. According to the TDR
This component is not part of this evaluation since it does not correspond to the implementation of the EIB in the native peoples of
Panama.
9 In this budget, 15 million was considered for literacy, which was annulled in the institutional budget of Meduca
which only considered 21 million.
9
million dollars (US $ .21,000,000.00) for five years, divided into four million two hundred
one thousand dollars (US $ .4,200,000.00) per year.
The five -year plan presented other characteristics, which have been considered in the evaluation:
1. It was not disseminated between different government and non -governmental institutions, who
have implemented EIB projects and strategies in the different regions during the period of the
Plan, without these being systematized or analyzed within the framework of the Quinquenal Plan. The
evaluation collects and analyzes the impact of these actions on the implementation of the plan
Quinquenal in indigenous peoples.
2. Within the indicated components, the plan design does not discriminate
activities, nor presents a clear route to obtain its results. The plan does not have
A more detailed framework of results at the level of activities, products, financial resources.
3. It does not present phases or indicators that allow an evaluation monitoring of the process that
its implementation followed.
4. It lacks a systematization of what was done or achieved, where it was done and who has
beneficiary There are no plan monitoring reports so the main sources of
information are the programs and materials produced together with the actors that led them to
cape.
5. In the plan there is no reference to elements related to accountability
nor of moments of evaluation of its implementation. There are no reports of its execution or
had a process evaluation, so the evaluation contemplates those own aspects
of a process evaluation, and aspects of a final evaluation.
Beneficiaries and actors of the Quinquenal Plan
The final beneficiaries of the plan (rights holders) are children and adolescents
indigenous from the seven native peoples who would receive a bilingual intercultural education of
Quality with respect to your language and culture improving your learning achievements.
As part of a state with responsibility to make effective the right to quality education
With cultural relevance, the main guarantor of law is the Ministry of Education through the
following instances:
• National Directorate of Initial Education, with the responsibility of coordinating, supervising, giving
Monitoring and support for initial education from 0 to 3 and preschool from 4 and 5 years.
• National Directorate of Basic Education, with the responsibility of coordinating, supervising,
monitor and support primary and premedia education.
• National Directorate of Curriculum and Educational Technology, with the responsibility of the
Preparation, presentation and commissioning of curriculum proposals that respond to the
scientific, technological and rights advances and therefore also to new notions
EIB.
• National Directorate of Teaching Training and Improvement, responsible for improving the
quality of education through the training and professional update of the personnel of
Education in service, including the EIB teaching plant.
• National Directorate of Educational Evaluation, responsible for the evaluation of
learning and performance of the different executing instances, including schools
of indigenous peoples, to provide information to the system for decision making.
• National Directorate of Bilingual Intercultural Education, by Decree Law 372 of
creation, the responsibility of carrying out the management and implementation of the EIB,
must lead this process.
10
• At the local level, the regional regional regional addresses and provinces with
indigenous population, are responsible for operationalizing educational policies emanating from
central system.
The traditional and non -traditional indigenous authorities are also secondary guarantors of the
right, as responsible for managing and controlling that children and adolescents receive
A quality bilingual intercultural education.
With another level of responsibility, the evaluation of the plan also contemplated, in the role of allies
as secondary guarantors of the law of children and adolescents to an EIB, to the entities
of international cooperation, which in the years of the plan (2014 to 2019) developed some
Type of program or project related to its implementation. In particular, the role fulfilled by
UNICEF throughout this process, given its financial technical contribution in the plan design, and now
In your evaluation.
2.2. Reconstruction of change theory
The five -year plan did not develop a framework of actions and results, nor did it define indicators that
they will facilitate processes of evaluation of its implementation. Therefore, on February 12, 2020 it was made
A participatory workshop, with DNEIB personnel, representatives of regional and personal supervision
Manager and teacher of schools of the seven native peoples, in order to obtain
Information for the reconstruction of the theory of change (TDC) that the five -year plan had not
contemplated (Annex 2. Workshop participants).
TDC was an important element to be able to perform the analysis with a causal logic, allowing
The systematization of findings, conclusions and recommendations. For its reconstruction, in the
Workshop worked: i) the concept of EIB; ii) the problem of the implementation of the EIB and the
learning situation of children and adolescents and; iii) the reconstruction of the desired. This
stage was key to understanding how the five -year plan was working and how the
products, results and changes. With this information, the causal analysis of the situation of the
exercise of the right to bilingual intercultural education of children and adolescents of the
Indigenous peoples of Panama and the theory of change was rebuilt, relating strategies,
components, supplies and products with results to achieve the proposed objectives, giving
Order and systematicity to the analysis presented in the findings section.
Causal analysis
Problem: boys, girls and adolescents from native peoples do not access an education of
quality or culturally relevant that is expressed in low yields, loss of its language and
His indigenous identity.
Immediate causes: lack of contextualized material, curriculum and programs with
Cultural relevance approved by Meduca, lack of teachers trained in EIB and management of
The original language, lack of teacher training programs, supervisors, directors and
EIB managers.
Underlying causes: institutional weakness of the DNEIB, lack of budget, absence
of a national EIB policy.
Structural cause: discrimination, the contributions of the native peoples are not valued to the
Country, indigenous peoples have no representation in organisms that make decisions.

3. Purpose of the evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation is to achieve institutional learning and that the promotion of policies to
future is guided by the knowledge generated in the quinquenio evaluated. It seeks to learn from
last five years in order for Meduca and, particularly, DNEIB, have better
Elements to plan short, medium and long term actions that allow the objectives to be achieved
of politics in favor of the intercultural education of children and adolescents of peoples
Indigenous of Panama.
The evaluation also has the purpose of accounting for what is carried out in the EIB five -year plan
2014-2019, including activities developed by other organizations and cooperation
international, of the levels of progress achieved, of the challenges that must have faced and the
limitations that you have found in its execution, in order to identify the actions that need to be
taken in the next five years (2020-2025) to maintain the sustainability of what has been done and
Advance the implementation of EIB in Panama.
This evaluation has as direct users to the Ministry of Education, the addresses
Regional education, indigenous authorities and UNICEF. It is formative because it intends
feed with learning the following EIB and summative planning cycle because it intends
determine if the set of the actions implemented allowed to achieve the expected results,
indicated in the TDC.
Evaluation bJethers
4. EVALUATION OBJECTIVE
The central objective of this evaluation is to take a balance of the results achieved by the plan
Quinquenal de EIB 2014-2019 in the seven (7) indigenous peoples, during the five years of their
execution, in order to have systematized information that serves as the basis for the development of new
plans, projects or programs that seek to implement EIB in the indigenous schools of Panama.
Specifically, it is sought:
• Determine the effectiveness of the strategies and activities implemented within the framework of the plan
Quinquenal de EIB 2014-2019 and how suitable are to respond to the results and objectives
of it.
• Establish the efficiency of the government budget and international organizations for
achieve the results and objectives of the plan, considering both the amounts assigned and
The quality of spending.
• Establish the relevance of the EIB 2014-2019 Quinquenal Plan according to the needs
nationals, the needs and expectations of the subjects of law and according to a
Conception of EIB that contributes to its quality of life.
• Evaluate the sustainability of the actions implemented and make suggestions for a new
Plan.
• Verify the participation of children and adolescents in the formulation and
Implementation of the plan, from a human rights perspective and gender equity.

5. Evaluation scope
THEMATIC SCOPE: The evaluation analyzes all activities, carried out within the framework of the four
Components: Strengthening of human resources, curriculum and contextualized materials,
restructuring of the management and administration of the EIB and evaluation, monitoring and supervision of
classroom, related to the achievement of the results and objectives of the five -year plan, even if they have
been carried out as part of the plan or independently to it. From this perspective analyze
The bottlenecks presented in their implementation and identifies the results achieved in the
Schools indicated as EIB, which serve children and adolescents of the peoples
Native. This evaluation, as already noted, does not analyze the literacy component.
Temporary scope: The evaluation covers the five years of the period of the Quinquenal Plan (2014-
2019), which coincided with the government period of President Juan Carlos Varela. In July 2019
A new government administration entered with President Laurentino Cortizo, which meant
A change of national authorities in Meduca and DNEIB. Therefore the interview evaluation
to officials of both periods, in order to have information of what was done, and their possible
continuity, and provide the new administration elements for decision making.
Territorial scope: it is nationally taking into account, in the first instance, the schools of
The seven indigenous peoples, to, from them, work with schools that, according to information
provided by the DNEIB and supervisors, implemented the EIB.
6. Evaluation framework
The evaluation of the five -year plan is carried out based on the criteria defined by the OECD in the
Next order: efficiency, relevance, efficiency and sustainability. In efficacy, the level of
scope of the objectives through the achievement of the results chain; in relevance it is evaluated in what
Measure the interventions were aligned with the priorities and rights of children and
adolescents to a quality bilingual intercultural education that contributes to their learning achievements
and assessment and practice of their culture and language; In efficiency, resources and way are examined
These have been used in the achievement of the results, that is, how much they contributed to the effectiveness of the plan;
In sustainability, the potential of the results of continuing once the
Plan. Transversely, the human rights approach is evaluated, including the rights of the
childhood and gender equity.
In each criterion there are questions that guide the evaluation of the plan, identifying for each question the
Trial formation, indicators, information sources and collection methods. The
COVID-19 pandemic, which forced methodological changes, which are explained in the following
section also implied adjustments in the indicators, sources and methods of collection of
Information to answer the questions designed.
In the process of writing the report, the need to reorder the questions in the criteria was seen
of efficacy, in order to bring the topic of initial and continuous training of teachers to the analysis of the
four components addressed in question 1. The initial order of the criteria has also been
changed developing the efficiency criteria in third place and not in the end as it was, due to the
Need to address the subject of sustainability after having analyzed all other criteria. He
Evaluation frame is part of Annex 3.

7. Methodology
7.1. Description
7.1.1. Adaptation of the Methodology by COVID-19
This evaluation was carried out during the Covid-19 pandemic under conditions of restrictions on
Mobility, social distancing and closure of schools. Originally, the evaluation included
face -to -face field work in indigenous regions, in order to observe the application in situ
From EIB in schools, conduct teachers and make focal groups with children, girls,
adolescents, mothers, fathers and indigenous authorities, to know the management of languages and knowledge
of the NNA and the acceptance of the fathers and mothers of the type of education that their sons and daughters receive
and the importance they give to EIB. However, the measures decreed by the authorities
Panamanians to face the Covid-19 pandemic annulled this possibility.
The appropriate methodology to the new conditions, remained mixed by combining tools
quantitative and qualitative, but he adjusted, focusing on a deep documentary review of
educational curricula and documents, in telephone interviews with more than 60 men and women, among
Meduca authorities, representatives of universities, NGOs and cooperation
International; and, online surveys to more than 180 of the directors and teachers of EIB schools.
The sample had to be adapted, expanding to all the schools that applied the EIB,
According to information given by the DNEIB.
The changes made in the sample and in the methodological tools are explained in detail in

7.1.2. Quantitative tools
to. Meduca statistics
It has worked with statistics from the 2019 school year, which differentiate three types of schools: urban,
rural and indigenous, without any record of EIB schools. Indigenous schools are those that are located
in territories with population mostly from either of the seven native peoples, providing
The following information:
• Number of indigenous schools in the national territory for regions and provinces.
• Number of teachers of indigenous schools in regions and provinces.
• Registration in indigenous schools according to sex in regions and provinces.
• Level of training offered by schools: preschool, primary, pre medium and medium.
• Learning indicators according to sex in regions and provinces: approved, disapproved and
deserters
b. Digitized surveys
Two types of digitized surveys were applied by using information technologies and
Communication (ICT) in educational centers where EIB10 had been implemented:
1. For directors and directors of EIB educational centers, with the aim of knowing aspects
of the management and composition of the school, the state and level of application of the EIB in its
school and identify the contact data of the teacher who develops her classes with
EIB METHODOLOGY. (Annex 4).
10 to the 2019 school period, the application of EIB had not been generalized in all indigenous peoples such as the objective of
Quinquenal Plan and its advance was differential even within the same school. This information was obtained through different
Sources such as: Workshop for Reconstruction of Change Theory (TDC), conversations with authorities and supervisors of the DNEIB,
local statistical data and document analysis.
17
2. For teachers identified by the director or director surveyed of educational centers
EIB, to know its level of training, management of the EIB and its implementation level
to the degree in his charge. (Annex 5).
These surveys were applied11 using information and communication technologies (ICT),
after they were validated both at the reference group formed by UNICEF, UNESCO and
DNEIB, as by 7 directors, directors and 7 teachers representatives of each town of the exhibition:
3 Ngäbe, 2 Kuna, 1 Emberá and 1 Waunaan respectively (Annex 6).
Each survey had a specific security code that allowed to know if they had responded
survey so that they did not respond twice12.
Universe of application of the survey
The universe13 is made up of all the educational centers of indigenous peoples where, according to the
Dneib applies EIB. There are 188 educational centers, distributed in 4 regional addresses, 4
Regions and 4 native peoples. Buglé, Naso and Bibri peoples do not have educational centers
EIB. Neither the Kuna people of the Wargandí region. In each educational center, the unit of
sampling is made up of the center or teachers who, according to the director,
EIB apply to its degree.
The surveys were applied between July 15 and September 20, 2020 and were sent to all and
the directors of the 188 educational centers of the sample, obtaining the response of 173
directors corresponding to 92% of the planned. The list of educational centers

Some significant characteristics of schools where the directors indicate that it is applied
EIB are:
• All offer primary school, but not all offer preschool and premedia: 65 and 239 of 119
respectively.
• The average offer is almost non -existent: only 1 of 21 Kuna schools and 22 of 93 Ngäbes schools.
No Emberá and Waunaan school offers the average.
• The multigrade modality is in some schools, but it is in all villages
Native, 34 of 119.
11 The contact directors of school directors were provided by regional education directors and that of the
teachers by the director of the school.
12 The 4 Link Teachers (Pedro Marmolejo (Emberá), Cleto Montero, Francisco Carpintero and Fulgencio Taylor (Ngäbes) that went to us
Accompany as interpreters on visits to schools, supported the process of contacting directors and teachers and were
Anuentes to answer the survey. Jenny Gómez, Kuna indigenous professional, former director of the DNEIB, who is part of the team of
Consultants was an important strut in this process, for the respect that teachers, regional directors and schools have of it.
13
For the design of the sample, specific interviews were conducted with DNEIB personnel in the figure of its director, Professor Enrique
Gardel (Kuna); the technicians Máximo Pereira (Kuna), Yoni Cárdenas (Wouunaan) and the Griselda Atencio (Ngäbe) technique and supervisors and
Links: Lucindo Pérez (Kuna Yala), Fulgencio Taylor, Cleto Montero and Francisco Carpintero (Ngäbe Buglé region) and Pedro
Marmolejo (Emberá-Wouunaan region), who provided information about the universe formed by EIB educational centers.
14 Despite the collaboration of regional directors, school directors, links and direct dedication of colleague Jenny Gómez, I don't know
He could get 100% of the sample of directors and teachers mainly due to: 1) that were in moments in moments
of the beginning of non -face -to -face classes, trying to ensure that the materials reach the largest number of schools; 2) A serious problems
of connectivity; and 3) to the health situation by the pandemic. For example, the 3 teachers who could not interview in Kuna Yala was
Because one was with Covid-19, another was mourning for the death of a relative for COVID-19 and the other due to connectivity problems.
Similar situations, but fundamentally connectivity were the problems in the Ngäbe and Emberá people.

• 57% of teachers are women (58 of 101) unlike directors where they are 39%
(46 of 119).
• The director of the EIB Woounaan School is Latino, while among the Kunas and Emberá all
They are from the same town. In Ngäbe schools 66% (52 of 93) are the same town and the
43% (40 of 93) are Latin. The only director of the Ngäbe educational center of another town is

7.1. 3. Qualitative tools
On a qualitative level, two types of tools are used: i) scanned documentation analysis or in
Digital and II) Non -face -to -face interviews.
to. Documentation analysis
To complement and triangular the information of the surveys and interviews and thus have a
more detailed knowledge both in quantity and quality of curricular programs,
study programs by grade and educational materials; To documentation analysis
regulations and reports added the study of the national curriculum, the curricular programs EIB
contextualized by peoples, the study programs by grade of the indigenous peoples, and the
Educational materials for teachers and for students (in Spanish and in original language).
Similarly, with the aim of having more information developed in the EIB in the
last years and triangular the information that would be collected in the interviews and surveys, it was carried out
the review of some work plans and reports of the technical teams of the DNEIB of the years
2017 and 2018, as well as some supervisors.
The complete list of the documents reviewed to know the progress, the conceptual management of
The EIB and the context in which it occurs, is in Annex 8.
b. Non -face -to -face interviews
Between July and August 2020, interviews were conducted to different actors, on the level of understanding
and acceptance of the EIB, particular aspects related to the position they occupy and their knowledge of the
Quinquenal Plan, which are indicated below:
19
a) National directors and directors, both of the previous and current government, in order to
know the advances in the period of the plan, as the application perspective with the new
government management.
b) Regional directors, supervisors and regional links to know the degree of
Application of EIB in schools.
c) Organizations with educational programs and/or actions within the region: OEI, Fe and
Alegría, House Workshop to know its incidence and relationship with EIB.
d) Representatives of initial training and training organizations: UDELAS,
University of Panama, Isae, and Training Organizations (Ocas): Cultural Action
NGäbe, Emberá Wunaan Agua for Plants and the Research and Development Institute
of Kuna Yala (Iidky), to know its EIB training perspective and degree of
involvement in it.
e) Representatives of international cooperation agencies that have been supporting the EIB:
World Bank, IDB and UNICEF to know the management of EIB, its relationship with the DNEIB
and the five -year plan.
f) Traditional regional authorities, to know its vision of the EIB, its evaluation of the
Quinquenal Plan and the main problems of respect for their rights as a people
original.
g) Leaders of indigenous women organizations to know the level of involvement
of women in the application of the five -year plan.

next chapter of findings all have been codified16 respecting what was informed on the sheet of
Information and consent (Annex 9). Annex 10, reports all people interviewed
by category and Annex 11, presents the guides used for interviews.
7.1.4. Data analysis
In the data analysis process the following methods were used:
Quantitative analysis method. Meduca statistics are analyzed, depending on the indicators
raised in the evaluation matrix, as well as the results of the surveys carried out
emphasis on aspects linked to the composition of the teaching plant of schools, the management of the
language native to the teacher and students, the use of curricular programs
contextualized and materials and the treatment of the original and Spanish language. In this process
special attention was granted to the similarities and differences found in the different villages
Native.
Qualitative analysis method. The information collected from the review of the
documents and interviews based on the thematic lines, criteria and questions raised
In the evaluation. Particular care was paid in the coding of interviews, in order to,
maintaining anonymity, knowing the level of concordance or discrepancy that could exist in the
answers to the different questions, both at the individual level and at the level of the position or function that
Exercise each of the interviewees.
Analysis levels. The information collected was analyzed looking for the triangulation of the information
in the following order: i) Analysis of the information collected from different documents; II) Analysis of
the statistics and the results of the surveys; iii) analysis of the information collected through
of interviews, verifying the existence of common points and contradictions between the different
actors and with the information collected in the surveys and documents; iv) identification of
findings. At this level of analysis, the data collected with the theoretical approaches were contrasted
on EIB and other reference frameworks of academic literature; v) Identification of lessons
learned from experience, to raise the necessary recommendations.
7.1.5. Limitations and mitigation measures
The main limitation was the presence of the pandemic that forced a methodological change already
explained. With the new methodology, the connectivity challenge arose due to the low accessibility of
Some schools. In these cases, it was chosen to call the cell phone and do the survey by telephone. TO
times, the photo of the survey was sent so that the person is reading it while answering it
Telephone
Due to this same limitation of COVID-19, in some parts of the analysis there is only
qualitative information of interviews; But in these cases the triangulation has been carried out based on
to the answers of different people, who were asked the same question.
Other limitations were:
• Meduca statistics do not register EIB schools, or children's percentages
indigenous with access to these schools. This lack of information was mitigated in a certain way to
through the information obtained from the supervisors and surveys to the directors
and teachers who asked about the management of the original and Spanish language and the amount of
students who attend. This absence of registration is an expression of the lack of institutionality of
the EIB that is collected in the findings and recommendations.
16 The coding was carried out as follows: i) The first code differentiates the individual interview of the collective: (i, c); i) the
Second Code differentiates the institution to which it represents and in the case of Meduca the role it plays: (Dn = National addresses
of Meduca; Dr = Regional addresses; Su = supervisors; Co = international cooperation; Uo = universities and occasions; Li = leaders
indigenous); iii) It is numbered in order in which people were interviewed. Example: I-SU-10.

• The EIB Quinquenal Plan does not have an intermediate or process evaluation or a plan of
Monitoring with indicators that allow a reference line of progress. Therefore, it has
sought information from the advanced before the plan and the advanced year by year in order to power
Identify the real level of implementation. This was done fundamentally with
Qualitative information, above all, for the analysis of the criteria of effectiveness and sustainability.
• Another limitation was that the evaluation occurred in a new government administration with
New national and regional authorities. To mitigate this limitation, interviews were conducted
both to the current authorities and the previous ones.
7.2. Evaluation standards and ethical considerations
The evaluation is aligned with the United Nations evaluation standards and standards. Are
standards and standards are operationalized as follows:
• The consulting team is external and independent, with capacity, experience and prestige in
similar works. The evaluation was carried out objectively, impartially, open and participatory,
based on empirically verified evidence, valid and reliable.
• The consulting team has long experience in the defense of human rights and childhood
and native peoples in particular. The search for information and analysis was carried out with respect
to the dignity and diversity of the people interviewed and surveyed considering throughout the
Evaluation process Respect for human rights, equity and gender equality.
• The consulting team acted respecting the confidentiality of the information and data involved
responding to the right that people have to provide information confidentially.
The objectives of the evaluation, its scope, the use of its results and the
confidentiality level of your response.
• There are not focal groups with boys and girls there was no ethical control committee.
• Finally, the consulting team made and presented the certificates of having conducted the courses
required to carry out the consulting.

The objectives of the five -year plan were not met to the extent that most of the
Activities aimed at achieving the results of the plan. This prevented all centers from
educational that serve children and adolescents from the seven indigenous peoples have access to the
EIB, as is your right. Several aspects influenced the non -achievement of the results, and by
consequently, in the objectives of the five -year plan: i) the lack of a training and training program
Strengthening of human resources responsible for the development of EIB; II) The delay in the formulation
and approval of the contextualized curricular programs and the study programs by grade and the
Difficulties in the elaboration and approval of the materials in indigenous languages for the different peoples;
iii) the lack of restructuring of school management and administration of the EIB; and iv) the lack of a plan of
Evaluation, monitoring and supervision of the classroom with the EIB approach and strategies.
The analysis of the progress of the plan towards the achievement of the planned objectives is carried out through the
Identification of the expected results chain with the development of the following components:
22
1. Strengthening of human resources.
2. Curricula and contextualized materials
3. Restructuring of EIB School Management and Administration.
4. Evaluation, monitoring and classroom supervision.
Component 1: Strengthening of human resources through teacher training,
coordinators, links, directors and supervisors, technicians and administrators in the
EIB application methodologies and the management of the five -year plan.
The development of this component required that the DNEIB, in coordination with the direction of
Meduca teacher training and improvement, identify training institutions
capable of offering programs for studying and teacher training in EIB and programs of
training aimed at teachers, coordinators, links, supervisors and technicians of the
DNEIB and regional addresses. This should have the purpose of coordinating the design and implementation
of new careers, programs or specializations in EIB, that help strengthening resources
humans for their development.
It should be noted that the only activities aimed at training coordinators, links, directors
and supervisors, technicians and administrators in relation to the content of the five -year plan, and
Promote their knowledge of EIB application methodologies were the national day and
International Congresses on EIB that were held between 2016 and 201717, even when
These were not considered in the five -year plan and in the reconstructed TDC.
The information collected indicates that, although DNEIB had an approach to the University of
Panama to see the possibility of developing an EIB training plan, then did not give it
follow-up. There was no approach with Juan Demóstenes Arosemena University of
Santiago de Veraguas that forms the Panamanian teachers, or with the University of the
Américas (UDELAS), the only university in Panama with a degree in EIB since 1996.
Outside the framework of the five -year plan, between 2014 and 2019 they graduated in the EIB Degree in

the National Directorate of Teaching Training and Improvement of Meduca, with the objective of
develop, reinforce and renew the pedagogical, scientific and technological knowledge of the
Teachers, at the national level.
The need to have teachers and managers formed in EIB demanded active participation
of the DNEIB in the design of the training activities, in order to ensure the presence of
teachers of the 7 villages, as well as the design of an evaluation and monitoring plan of the processes
of training and its impact on teaching work, as stated in TDC. However, its
Participation in this process was limited to following the protocol established by the Training Directorate
and teaching improvement, which summons those caused by Meduca. According to said
Protocol These present their proposals and the addresses that request training, evaluate them
considering that they necessarily include 80% of practical activities for their prompt
implementation in the classroom.
During the last five -year period, only three occasions were recorded in Meduca as organisms that
They can offer EIB workshops: the Kuna Yala (Iidky) Research Institute), in the
Kuna region; Ngäbe Bugle Cultural Foundation for Ngäbe teachers; and Water Foundation for
Plants for Emberá. The Naso, Bribri, Buglé and Waunaan teachers do not have this type
of continuous training and, with the exception of the Kuna people, there is no continuity in the annual offer of
These organisms.
The design of an evaluation and monitoring plan for training processes and their impact on the
Teaching work planned in the TDC, did not occur. Precisely one of the limitations of the strategy
continuous training is that it is limited to summer courses and does not ensure processes of
accompaniment in the classroom, to know how teachers have incorporated what they learned
in their practice in the classroom and feedback the formative processes.
The planned products, to have the Teacher Training Plan, the Training Plan in
EIB management and education of the DNEIB personnel, national and regional addresses, as well as
expand the training offer in EIB with specializations at different school levels
They achieved and therefore the results of having sufficient personnel trained for the
MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF EIB.
Component 2. curriculum and contextualized materials through the review and update of the
curricula and degree programs already produced and the design and elaboration of new programs, texts
and educational materials in EIB with linguistic and cultural relevance.
The five -year plan had planned the review and update of the curricular programs already
produced and the design and elaboration of new programs and programs of study by grade. With
This end a coordination strategy between the DNEIB and the Curriculum Directorate was raised. From
This strategic framework had to develop workshops for the elaboration of the curricular program by
Competencies, materials for teachers' students and guides, according to EIB. As
product was expected to have contextualized curriculas for each original town, programs
of study by preschool to premedia, materials and guides endorsed by Meduca.
In the five years of its implementation, a coordination strategy between
the DNEIB and the curriculum direction that will ensure the development of workshops for the elaboration of the
EIB curriculum program by competencies, nor the elaboration, validation and officialization of the
Contextualized curricular programs and study programs by grade. While this

It was decided to put aside the curricular design process and prioritize the production of materials. He

change of educational authorities also affects this change and prevented the continuity of the
processes already initiated before the plan.
As can be seen in Table 8, the town with greater advances in the formulation of the programs
of study by grade is the kuna, which carried out a process of adapting everything he had elaborated
before the plan, within the framework of the program that the Kuna Council develops with AECID, so that the
Curriculum address can approve it and go to the validation phase.

The Ngäbe people began the validation of preschool programs to third grade of four subjects:
Maternal language (L1), Spanish (L2), identity and ethnomathematics. 18. In this town it is being carried out
Regarding ethnomathematics, the Jadenkä project for preschool, which raised an adaptation
of the curricular program. In 2019 this program has been implemented in 226 educational centers of
The Ngäbe-Buglé region, Bocas del Toro and Chiriquí. While they have the support of Meduca, the
program has not yet been formalized by the respective resolved.
The third town that has managed to prepare a proposal that exceeds the first grade is the buglé, thanks
to the participation of a group of 14 voluntary teachers from this town that wrote in a way
Autonomous the first -degree study programs for 3 subjects: L1, identity and

Each of them there are different levels of directors, supervisors, teachers and wise or grandparents and grandmothers of the

Materials linked to study programs by grade are fundamental to development
of EIB in schools. However, it lacked that the DNEIB, in coordination with the Directorate of
Curriculum foressting more clearly the set of materials that were required for each town

Component 3: Restructuring of EIB School Management and Administration, through a
DNEIB Restructuring Administrative Strategy, Regional Directorates, Reassignment
of regional link functions, budget allocation and a legal strategy of
Regulation, review and implementation of laws, decrees and resolved.
The restructuring of the EIB School Management and Administration that contemplated the plan
Quinquenal implied, to achieve the results indicated in the TDC, four activities
26
fundamental: i) the reorganization of the DNEIB; ii) the conversion of regular schools that
They serve indigenous students in EIB schools, inside and outside the regions; iii) the review and
Formulation of a set of norms for the operationalization and institutionalization of the EIB; and IV)
The elaboration of position profiles of the different levels of EIB management. It was contemplated,
In addition, that this restructuring had to be made with the participation of the national directions of the
Meduca, of the Regional Directorates of Education and of the traditional authorities of the
Indigenous peoples.
i) The reorganization of the DNEIB was by regulating what is established in the Executive Decree
274, standard that creates the instance by EIB in Meduca and that establishes a structure
organic that to date is not implemented19. This involved providing the budget for
Creation of coordination, for positions of functional managers and technical teams
respective.
ii) The process of conversion of schools began in 2015 with a set of workshops and
Meetings between the DNEIB team and representatives of the DRE. The schools of
Each region and indigenous territories that would be converted into EIB schools every year, in a way
progressive That same year, a proposal to be resolved for approval and officialization was prepared
gradual of these conversions. However, the rule did not pass the review of the advisory office
Legal of Meduca. This prevented schools from formally becoming EIB schools.
iii) the review of the regulatory framework covered the regulation of Law 88 (issued in 2010) and
the formulation of a set of resolved necessary to regulate aspects of institutional management
and pedagogical of the EIB; that, not being completed, they prevented the operation of the EIB and its
respective institutionalization in the educational system of Panama.
The Regulation of Law 88: In 2015, progress was made with a regulation proposal that was
Consulted in the Kuna, Ngäbe and the Naso people. This was led by the DNEIB team with
The legal accompaniment of legal advice of Meduca. After the first consultations to these
peoples did not resume the activity and the regulation of the law was not culminated.
In February of this year 2020 the DNEIB has restarted the process of regulation of the law and
It has planned its culmination and approval in December 2020. However, given the pandemic it is
You may need more time.
Solved for the institutionalization of EIB: In 2015, DNEIB came to formulate the resolves
which were required with the participation of representatives of the Regional Directorates of Education of
The indigenous regions, mainly supervisors, and with the advisory of lawyers
Indigenous contracted by the DNEIB as consultants. Given the normative nature of these
products, the ideal would have been to count on the entire process with the accompaniment of specialists from
the Meduca Legal Advice Office, as a competent instance in the matter, in such a way
that could guarantee their technical quality and greater speed in their approval. Of
There that, despite the fact that the DNEIB managed to formulate these standards, and delivered them to the advisory office
Legal of Meduca for review, to date its approval has not been achieved.
These resolved cover various organizational, pedagogical and resource management aspects
Humans:
19 DNEIB, since its creation, is formed from a director and a group of technicians among those who try to have a
professional, generally of teacher training, which represents each indigenous people, and two or three people who see the
administrative part
27
Resolved linked to the organizational structure:
▪ Resolved for the implementation of Executive Decree 274 of Creation of DNEIB, in which
It is indicated that the operation of the coordination units must be approved
established, as well as the respective positions and profiles.
▪ Resolved for the conversion of regular schools located in the regions, collective lands,
attached areas and outside them to bilingual intercultural educational centers in order, which
all schools that serve children and adolescents of indigenous peoples are
formally recognized as EIB schools.
▪ resolved for the creation of the regional education addresses in the regions of
Nedrini, ñokribo and Ködri of the Ngäbe Buglé region, given the amplitude of the region.
▪ Solved that incorporates into the DNEIB in the annual budget20 of the Meduca.
Resolved linked to pedagogical management:
▪ Resolved to formalize the development of the subjects of the EIB Study Plan. This
Norma approves the new subjects, considered in curricular programs by degrees,
which must be incorporated into the school evaluation bulletin of the students
Indigenous of Panama.
Resolved linked to human resources management:
• Resolved for the selection of teachers for the areas and regions of the peoples
Native. This standard establishes the requirements and procedures for hiring and
Appointment of teachers for EIB schools inside and outside the regions
indigenous.
• Resolved that approves the provisions for the evaluation of linguistic competences
of the teachers, coordinators and administrators in EIB. This rule regulates
criteria and procedures to evaluate the mastery of the native language of various actors
that occupy positions in the management of the EIB, as a requirement for their hiring and
appointment.
▪ resolved that norms the creation of the position of supervisor in EIB and the process of
appointment to ensure that it is carried out with EIB approach.
These resolved proposals have not been reviewed because the DNEIB did not deliver them to the
Evaluating equipment, so it is not possible to issue judgments about their content and quality.
It is also necessary to highlight that five years have passed since these resolved were elaborated and not
Effective monitoring has been done to achieve approval. According to interviews conducted
To the DNEIB team, changes in the management of Meduca and DNEIB have affected these
processes.
iv) Development of organizational organization, profiles and performance standards within the framework of the
restructuring. EIB management requires an organizational structure that allows its
operation from the central level of Meduca to the Regional Directorates of Education.
The plan contemplated as a main activity the elaboration of the profiles of the different
positions related to educational services of EIB, such as: technicians of the DNEIB,
regional directors and supervisors of the indigenous regions, directors and teachers of the
EIB educational centers. According to the information collected, this activity did not reach
Develop to the extent that required a joint work with the National Directorate of Education
General basic and the Human Resources Office, which did not occur.
20 The issue that the budget had in the achievement of the results will be analyzed in efficiency
28
Not having developed this activity there is no position profiles, which makes it difficult to know
If professionals who are occupying the different positions related to EIB have the profile
appropriate for it. Currently, and according to a standard approved in 2012, who postulate
The positions related to the EIB, in addition to the professional title that is common for all, are
demands the requirement of "domain of culture and language." While this is a fundamental aspect, no
It is the only profile of the profile required to have efficient professional performance in the
different levels of EIB management.
This same requirement is used for the appointment of directors and teachers in schools of the
indigenous regions. DNEIB has the responsibility of competition evaluation
linguistics21 and according to the results, the priority criterion is applied, which consists of prioritizing
to those who have the domain of culture and language. According to the teacher survey, only 71 of the 101
respondents have gone through this test. In addition, priority is only valid for schools that
They are within the regions, a reason for questioning some indigenous leaders who live in
non -regional territories.
“The simple reason is because we are not a region. That is a great weakness because they have told us
That, you are district they tell us. It is one of the reasons because we have teachers from other areas. He
issue here is that we have been told that there are no naso teachers in our schools because Meduca
He has not coded them as an indigenous school. And naso teachers who want to be in the Naso territory if
there are ”(i-li-52).
All products that were undertaken (Regulation of Law 88), without approved (resolved) and
without elaborating (profiles) would have allowed a significant advance in the expected results
with the plan and a greater institutionality of the EIB would have been achieved.
Component 4: Evaluation, monitoring and supervision of classroom, through strengthening in
quantity and capacity of the regional monitoring and supervision system and the creation of a system
Evaluation of students in EIB schools.
This plan component is analyzed from the activities carried out for i) the creation of a
Student evaluation system in EIB and II schools) of strengthening the system of
Monitoring and supervision of EIB schools.
i) Student evaluation:
The evaluation of EIB school students required the design of a plan that ensures the
Definition of guidelines and evaluation criteria for students. The same way,
demanded the elaboration of a regulation that establishes the mechanisms to incorporate into the
National Evaluation System (School Bulletin) The new subjects considered in the
Contextualized curricular programs. This is the case, for example, of the subject of "Language
Indigenous maternal ”, although the teachers developed it, they could not consign the evaluation
formal of this subject for not being in the newsletter. The regulation is in the package of the
Eight resolved that have been stagnated in legal advice of Meduca.
One of the arguments indicated by the directors of the DRE and supervisors to not
Develop EIB, is not having more precise orientations for the evaluation of
students considering the subjects of curricular programs.
21 The evaluation of culture and language consists in asking questions related to the culture of the indigenous people to which they are going to
work and the degree of oral and written domain of the language.
29
ii) Monitoring and supervision of EIB schools
The monitoring and supervision of schools had as its main activity the elaboration of a
Supervision regulations, which should include all orientations, criteria,
Procedures for supervision to an EIB school.
This activity should be carried out jointly between the DNEIB, the National Directorate of
General Basic Education (which has among its functions the supervision of schools at the level
national) and regional education addresses. However, there is no regulation or protocol
approved that allows adequate supervision of EIB schools.
In interviews conducted to directors and supervisors of the DRE and in the surveys to
teachers, it is evident that the lack of EIB supervision protocols did not allow monitoring
specialized schools and an accompaniment process that will help strengthen the management of
EIB strategies for managers and teachers. Supervisors use the general protocol that
It provides the basic address and everyone sees how it adapts.
In addition, this supervision is not given to all teachers. Surveys indicate that 40.5% (41)
From teachers never receive supervision. As the supervisors point out, this happens
In schools that are further, the closest ones if they receive the supervision visit at least one
time a year and some two or three times a year.

It is important to highlight that supervisors, although they depend administratively on
Regional addresses, the guidelines of the National Directorate of
General basic education, which is the instance of the Meduca that sees supervision in all
schools in the country and provides a unique supervision protocol for all. Regional addresses
They should assume a more proactive role and adapt these protocols, but the directors themselves
regional indicate that they are operational and that there is no document that says that schools are
EIB and that do not make EIB supervision because it has not been formalized.
“It is not done because it does not come from Meduca, it has not been formalized. We are operational, it must go down
From above, officialized, there is the law, but it does not go down, it has not given it that validity and that officiality. I
I would like to implement this, but that Meduca endorses, and we started working with the materials ”(i-
DR-43).
Nor do they exercise any level of demand in the number of schools to visit and the time that must be
devote. This decision is at the discretion of each supervisor, as it is conditioned by the subject
Budget. The supervisors do not have per diem, passages and/or gasoline for visiting
educational centers.
30
The DNEIB has links in some regional addresses such as in the Ngäbe Buglé region,
that try without resources to act as supervisors of schools considered EIB. These links
They are teachers in charge with their same salary that is half of what a supervisor earns.
Question 2: To what extent initial training and continuous training offered to teachers
In regional areas, was appropriate and sufficient to achieve the achievements of the plan?
Initial teacher training training offers in EIB and continuous training implemented
During the plan of the plan they were not appropriate to achieve the results of having teaching staff
prepared for the implementation of EIB in indigenous schools. The initial training offer is
He developed independently to the plan and the offer of continuous training faced the lack of a
Defined and oriented training horizon that incorporates the technical dimension
pedagogical and identity personnel and ensure accompaniment processes to classroom teachers. It does not exist
A plan for the formation of trainers.
The initial and continuous training of teachers is one of the fundamental lines of action planned
in the five -year plan for the development of EIB in indigenous schools. That's why we were looking to count
with bilingual and managerial teaching staff trained in the EIB in the short term and have teachers and
Directors of EIB Schools with positive skills and attitudes that develop programs
EIB curricular, in the medium term.
The UDELAS degree, the only one that develops the EIB race in Panama, was designed five
Years before the start of the Plan (2009), from the proposal of a group of teachers of the people
Kuna who had visited universities in Bolivia.
The degree in the specialty attends Kunas, Ngäbes and interested Latinos. According to the data
Provided from 2014 to 2019, 68 kunas and 128 between Ngäbes and Latinos graduated. According to data from
Meduca in the Ngäbe Buglé region there are 321 schools with 1,729 teachers and in Kuna Yala 49
Schools with 713 teachers, which helps to give an account of the teacher training gap in EIB.

Although the UDELAS curriculum was updated in 2015, due to the demand for the management
of teaching improvement of giving a greater amount of hours to the pedagogical aspect, there was no
No level of coordination with the DNEIB and this address with the UDELAS to ensure its
Articulation with the five -year plan. In addition, the fact that curricular programs
contextualized and the study programs by grade would not have been official, prevented them from using them
as referents in the development of classes.
22 It has not been possible to obtain discriminated data by sex for paintings 11 and 12.
31
The absence of a training plan affected the quality of the training process of the
You, given the fact that not all trainers had the elements
conceptual and methodological required for the development of the curriculum.
In addition to the lack of specialization of the trainers, some interviewees highlight their
ambivalence in relation to the EIB and its lack of management of the context in which their
graduates
“There are weaknesses in the UDELAS training. EBI's career in UDELAS began super there, but
He began to lower his quality because even the same educators who give in UDELAS, some not
They are so suitable for preparing future educators. If some educators have that
Ambivalence of thought then they put the doubt and when you get to the field you say, maybe it is so,
Then you have to see the strength of Udelas; Sometimes one thinks that, because one has so many roles
of certificate the curriculum so long, but at the time those papers are there, do not implement, no
You share the knowledge to what you have to get. That knowledge is left on the walls "
(I-OU-11).
"I have also seen that Udelas's same teachers do not have indigenous context management" (I-
Its 10).
The DNEIB and the Teaching Training and Improvement Directorate must have done
Coordinations with UDELAS to ensure that future teachers have elements that
allow them to implement the EIB in their regions. This implies being able to identify the context
sociocultural and linguistic in which they will work and develop contextualization processes
curricular and tongue treatment according to them, deepen the knowledge and practices of their
cultural heritage, develop competences in its management of the original language and Spanish, and
Design and use educational materials in two languages. Several of the interviewed people point out
Limitations in the teacher training of graduates.
“From the university you have to expand your mind, it is not to come to work in a single way. There are several
worlds and where they send you you have to learn. There are educators who can be five or six years there
And they do not speak or pio of the language or are interested in coexistence with the community members, there are educators who
They are locked there, they don't even visit their father and mother. That should be seen from the beginning (of your
training), that awareness must leave from its formation not when it comes there ”(I-OU-11).
Continuous training processes are part of the plan and are served through organisms
Trainers (OCAS), who respond to the National Directorate of Training and Improvement
Meduca teacher, with the aim of developing, reinforcing and renewing the
Pedagogical, scientific and technological knowledge of teachers, at the national level.

Source: Own elaboration from the data provided by the occasions
According to law, during school holidays (January and February of each year) every teacher must be to
Meduca disposition for three weeks to participate in training, some mandatory
defined by the National Directorate of General Basic Education and other optional that each teacher
32
You can select according to your interest. Among the range of optional workshops is that of EIB. In such
Sense, assistance to EIB workshops is not mandatory, depends on the teacher's will.
During the last five -year period only three occasions have registered in Meduca as organisms
that can offer EIB workshops, two of them with non -continuous offers, as can be seen in
Table 12.
Having not existed a specific formative horizon based on an analysis of needs of
articulated training to the expected results in the plan, the training offers of the three occasions
They vary. Even when they all address some of the study programs by grade, in some cases,
They have seen their actions limited by the little progress that has been had in relation to their design and
validation.
In addition to attending the study programs by grade, the OCA of the Ngäbe Cultural Foundation
Bugle addresses issues related to the problem of the region such as issues
Environmental, legal issues and economic issues. None of the occasions work on the subject
Identity The Ngäbe Bugle Cultural Foundation tried to do it from a psychological approach
But it was not accepted by Meduca, which prioritizes didactic issues.
The lack of development of the training plan of trainers determined that two occasions assumed the
Development of training workshops trusting the experience of facilitators
selected. The training that the occasions offer to the facilitators before the workshops is
mostly oriented to logistics and coordination issues.
Although the facilitators of the workshops are mostly based on the materials that have been
produced in the original language, do not develop precise indications on how to address and use
Both languages beyond the use of materials. For example, in the Emberá case they have only been
indicated that they have a special hour for children Emberá, since in institutions
Educational of this town also study boys and girls.
Question 3: What was the role of the Bilingual Intercultural Education Directorate of the Ministry of
Education in achieving the objectives of the plan?
The DNEIB had a fundamental role in the formulation of the five -year plan, which managed to be elaborated
with the mostly indigenous technical team that existed at that time in the direction. The DNEIB
It also had an important role in the initial positioning of the plan before the traditional authorities and
Leaders of indigenous peoples and before the authorities of the highest level of Meduca. However, no
then there was the same level of leadership and technical capacity to advance systematic implementation
and organized of the plan; and did not have a monitoring and evaluation plan that allowed improvements in the
process.
One of the main activities to achieve the results defined in the plan was the
Institutional strengthening of the National Directorate of Intercultural Bilingual Education (DNEIB)
being the instance responsible for leading the implementation of EIB in Panama. However, like
It has already been pointed out in the first question, the DNEIB did not restructure as established by the
Executive Decree 274 of its creation. From its creation in 2007 to the present the DNEIB
It has only had minimal teams of technicians, which have oscillated between 8 and 18 people, to which
They are assigned specific functions and tasks, but that do not respond to an organizational structure with
Functions and lines of work clear.
33
In interviews conducted to different actors, it has been possible to verify that there was an insufficient
and weak relationship of the DNEIB with the other national addresses, the regional addresses, the
Traditional authorities, cooperation entities and NGOs. DNEIB interference was more
Administrative and field logistical support, but failed to promote and advance the execution of
the various activities of the plan that implied a high degree of coordination with the actors and
mentioned institutions. With the Regional Directorates of Education and the authorities
Traditional of the indigenous regions The coordination were short -term, in the face of situations
and concrete problems, without involving them as a team in the conduct of the plan.
On the other hand, the five -year plan did not have an annual operating plan and plan or strategy of
monitoring and evaluation of its implementation, which prevented DNEIB from making the adjustments that
They were required during its execution. This responsibility must have been assumed in coordination with the area
of planning and monitoring of projects that Meduca has, which was not involved either. The plan
It did not have progress reports that had allowed us to collect results and impacts of the plan.
While the plan was presented to the different addresses, it was not possible to guarantee a full
understanding of its scope and articulation levels that demanded its execution at the level of the
Meduca. According to some of the people interviewed, this lack of coordination is due to lack
DNEIB dialogue with other directions; But from another perspective, the lack of
Interest in Meduca to develop this policy and that working conditions have not been given
necessary so that DNEIB can assume a more preponderant role.
As deduced from the above, the DNEIB failed to systematically boost the
implementation of the plan and lacked the leadership that was required to summon the instances that
They had to get involved within the meduca at the level of the headquarters and the regional ones, and to the different
external actors and allies such as the leaders of the indigenous regions, the NGOs and the agencies of
Cooperation that were already developing educational actions in indigenous territories.
Question 4: How was the coordination between international cooperation and the Ministry of
Education to achieve the objectives of the plan?
During the period of the five -year plan, the type of coordination between the DNEIB and cooperation did not change
International, it continued to be informative, logistical support or compliance with a formality. He
Quinquenal plan did not become an articulating axis between international cooperation and DNEIB to
achieve greater impact on education in indigenous regions where she had already been working or had
planned to work, due to the lack of call and leadership of the DNEIB.
One of the strategies established for the execution of the five -year plan was that the DNEIB establishes
Alliances with international cooperation and NGOs. This alliance should strengthen the DNEIB
supporting its management for the implementation of the five -year plan. However, this alliance is not
concrete.
In the years of application of the 2014-2019 five-year plan, international cooperation developed,
independently of the plan, programs related to four of the seven native peoples
(Kuna, Ngäbe, Emberá and Waunaan) and three of the five regions in Panama (Kuna Yala,
Emberá-Wouunaan and Ngäbe Buglé), as can be seen in Table 1323.

Only the EIB reflection day was an action related to the five -year plan and carried
Go ahead for the DNEIB with the support of international cooperation. In the other cases, the
Cooperation related to the Regional Directorates of Education and the other Directorates of the
Meduca. DNEIB was a support in language or logistics management, without those in those
Moments will talk about the five -year plan.
“The most prominent technicians were from the initial direction. When they already had the contents
There was interference of the DNEIB that was more administrative, field logistics support. In the language

“We coordinate with the Regional Directorate. We present the project, we define the actions that we are going to
carry out and in some cases we coordinate for the development of the actions. ”(I-CO-28)
To the perception of weakness of the DNEIB, the ignorance that cooperation indicates was added
With respect to the five -year plan, as well as that it was not part of the office agenda either
of International Cooperation of Meduca, responsible for validating the relationship of Meduca with
These entities. Although different international cooperation institutions participated in the
2015 In the presentation of the plan to the authorities of Meduca, this did not generate synergies and alliances
that made the plan a road map between cooperation and DNEIB - Meduca, oriented
to the achievement of the results and objectives of the Plan, although they addressed related activities.
The World Bank did not have direct actions linked to the development of the plan during this period.
His action was aimed at the design of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan with the Ministry
of government and in which DNEIB participated as an ally in the education component. This
Project contemplates an EIB component referred mainly to infrastructure and furniture
and some other pedagogical aspects. 20% of component's resources are aimed at strengthening
groups of fathers and mothers and the administration of the school itself in the maintenance of the
infrastructure so that this investment is not lost and, to the training of teachers in
The understanding of the EIB curriculum.
The results of international cooperation interventions are important and there is no doubt
which meant an advance in achieving some of the plan's products, in regards
to the production of preschool educational support materials for the Ngäbe, Emberá, Emberá peoples
Waunaan (workshop and UNICEF). Likewise, the implementation of the Jadenkä program also in
Preschool in the Ngäbe (IDB-Japan-Oei) region, the pedagogical diagnosis in 3 Ngäbes schools
(UNICEF - Fe y Alegría) and support for the design of curricular programs, texts and materials of the
Kuna people (Aecid-Congresso Kuna). However, with the exception of the latter, all
above run the risk of being only specific experiences, with risks of non -continuity, to
Depend totally on international cooperation financing, and all run the risk of
35
Not being sustainable as they are not engaged in the institutionality of Meduca, as well as lacking
An incidence strategy with the indigenous authorities to ensure that they are assumed by them.
The limitations found in the development of the strategies and activities considered for the
Implementation of the Plan, they have had an impact on the non -achievement of products and results
planned. Below are the implications that this has had in the application of the EIB
in the schools of the seven native peoples.
EIB application in indigenous schools
To date, and having reached the end of the period of implementation of the Plan (2019),
Find that the Naso, Bribri, Buglé, Kuna from the Wargandí region are still without schools
EIB as reported by the techniques of the DNEIB. Surveys report that
Reality is even greater and that the Kuna people of Madugandí also have eib schools.
(Graph 6)
The difference between what the links and DNEIB and the directors pose, is explained because a
School is considered EIB according to the existence of a teacher who uses the original language
and Spanish and introduces cultural elements in the teaching -learning process; What means:
a) That the school ceases to be EIB if the teacher changes to another school that is not always indigenous or,
b) It moves from degree for which it no longer has materials.

For the purposes of the specific objective of the plan, it is also important to know how it is being carried out

For the occasions they are the only input of the managing plan to this process, having not developed

Planning and use of contextualized curricular programs 24
The information collected shows that the teachers Kuna and Ngäbe mostly
They use the National Curriculum Program and the Emberá and Waunaan always do it. This limits
their chances of incorporating cultural elements in their learning and developing sessions
capacities in the oral and written management of the original language.
The eventual use of contextualized curricular programs by some Kuna teachers
and Ngäbe can be explained by the fact that the training of the occasions were guided by the
study programs by grade, and for the special attention that the AECID Kuna program gave to
This process. While there were Emberá teachers who also received training from an oce

punctual, the lack of officialization of contextualized curricular programs and programs
Study by grade, together with the lack of the evaluation bulletin, made few teachers
willing to work with contextualized programs.

However, even if this is the case, the fact that most teachers surveyed indicate
that base their planning on the social and/or productive activities carried out in the community
It helps to give cultural relevance when the curriculum approaches the daily experiences of the
students. Your option to plan based on the problems facing the community and the medium
Environment helps contextualize the national curriculum.
Planning and use of the two languages in learning processes
Language use planning in the classroom must necessarily consider the characteristics
sociolinguistic of the community and the level of management that language students have
native and Spanish. However, as can be seen in graph 7, only 23 teachers
they consider the sociolinguistic panorama of the community and 38 the level of management that the and
students have from the original language and Spanish. In turn, 36 teachers refer to the degree of
studies that are studying students, which has to do with the proposal for increase
sequential of the second language adopted by the DNEIB, and this is quite logical due to the
need to vary the time of use of languages throughout basic education.
24 Contextualized curricular programs contemplate the modification of the national curriculum curriculum plan to include the
indigenous language subject as language 1 and Spanish as language 2 as well as other subjects related to the knowledge of each
Original people.

The fact that 35 teachers indicate that they also plan according to the characteristics of the
subject to treat, it is understandable given how difficult it is to develop learning in the language
Originally in some subjects rather than others, for the type of content. However, this would be
demonstrating the existence of limitations in the development of a pedagogical discourse in the language
originally that may account for academic knowledge, a fundamental aspect in the development of the
EIB. The language in which the materials they have at school have only been considered
For 15 of 101 teachers surveyed, which would show that it has little weight in its option for an U U
Another language.
Regarding the use of languages, most of the 101 teachers surveyed indicate that they plan
the use of the two languages and that they use them in the different subjects and moments of the sessions of
learning. But it has not been possible to verify, for the impossibility of going to schools, and the lack of
technical supervision reports that account for how teachers use both languages in
learning processes, and if this treatment responds to a strategy for the use of languages with
Clearly defined criteria or rather to the management that the teacher himself has of the indigenous language
At an oral and written level. For the information collected in the interviews with regional directors and
supervisors as well as that carried out with some officials of international cooperation,
You can infer that teachers are not doing a planned and systematic treatment of
two languages that allow them to develop communicative skills in their students, both in the
indigenous language as in Spanish.
Capacity development of the students in reading and writing in the two languages
The quality of the EIB -learning teaching process is expressed in the learning achievements of
The students and this is an aspect to which the continuous training processes have given it
special attention, emphasizing reading and writing processes in the mother tongue. Without
however, when he asks the teacher about the management of reading-writing according to the degree to which
They are, it can be seen that 44, say that most of their students read and write well in
Spanish, and only 10 say they read and write well in the indigenous language. This is because the and
teachers, for their own options, are using Spanish more in the activities and tasks that
They perform in writing and the use of the indigenous language is remaining at a more oral level. The fault

RELEVANCE
Question 1: To what extent did the objectives of the EIB five -year plan were and continue to be
Valid for the national and regional context?
Although the objectives of the plan were related to their design with the EIB proposal expressed in
Official documents are insufficient for the current national and regional context for two reasons
fundamental: do not consider the changes and complex sociolinguistic scenarios that are
producing in Panama and give little weight to the intercultural aspect of the educational proposal.
The five -year plan includes a general and two specific objective. The general objective proposes to offer
an education that considers the cultural characteristics of the original peoples and the
consolidation of their competences in their mother tongue, as well as the acquisition of Spanish and English
as a second language, for the strengthening of its identity and appropriation of national culture. He
first specific objective the intention of the general objective, referring to the development of a
pedagogical model that considers the cultural characteristics of the students and develops their
communicative competence, both in Spanish and in indigenous language, thus limiting the claims
of the general objective. The second objective does not raise any level of concretion, more, well it is limited
To reiterate the need to offer the original population an intercultural and multilingual education
with quality and cultural relevance.
The official documents on which EIB is supported in Panama conceives of languages and cultures
as a heritage of native peoples that must be preserved to strengthen their identity
and ensure that, in turn, they appropriate national culture and assume the country's development plans,
from the development of a relevant and quality educational proposal. This can be seen in
Article 11 of Law 34 of 1995 and in article 1 of Law 88 of 201025 as well as in the Program
25 “Education for indigenous communities is based on their right to preserve, develop and respect their identity and
Cultural Heritage ”(Art11 Law 34 1995).“ The State recognizes cultural diversity as a historical value and heritage of the
humanity…. (Art. 1 Law 88 2010)
39
Bilingual education for the country's indigenous communities designed within the framework of the reform
Educational, in which it is said that the objective of bilingual education is to serve as an effective means to
Enugar to the different cultures that exist in the country in the life of national development.
The objectives of the plan are also consistent with the vision of bilingualism that the State arises
Panamanian, who considers it as an advantage to strengthen identity and appropriate culture
national. The State also opts for bilingual maintenance education, which implies the
Development of competencies in the original language and Spanish throughout the educational process and
takes distance from transition bilingual education approaches that languages rather use
native as means to access Spanish.
However, the bilingual education proposal on which the plan is supported does not consider the
complex sociolinguistic scenarios that are taking place in Panama, due to
Displacement of the indigenous language in favor of Spanish and the growing presence of population
Migrant indigenous in cities (UNICEF-PROEIB ANDES 2009). THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE PLAN
assumes that the original language is the mother tongue of the students, unlike the
Technical guidelines for bilingual intercultural education in Mesoamerica, which assume that the
Mother tongue may or may not be the indigenous language. The bilingual intercultural education model/
Intercultural bilingual education also points out the possibility that the mother tongue of the
Students be Spanish, however, it does not develop a differentiated option for treatment
of languages in different sociolinguistic contexts. The only proposal presented by the model seems
Being oriented to scenarios in which the original language is the mother tongue.
Another aspect to relieve is that the objectives of the plan give little weight to the intercultural aspect of the
educational proposal. Although they are based on an EIB approach that recognizes diversity and
identity statement, which is an important advance against a speech that has considered the
cultural and linguistic diversity as a delay or obstacle to national development, it is considered
limited the fact that the first specific objective refers to the “development of a pedagogical model
that consider the cultural characteristics of the students ”(our underlined). This
Approach is vague in the context of a regional debate that raises the need to address
curricular construction processes in native peoples from a more comprehensive approach that
Incorporate ontological and epistemological aspects. Limit to the recognition of the characteristics
cultural brings with it the risk of simplifying educational processes and reducing the dimension
Intercultural education to the most visible aspects of material culture.
Question 1.1: To what extent did activities, projects and programs respond to
needs of the beneficiaries?
Activities, projects and programs did not respond sufficiently to the right of children and
indigenous adolescents to a quality bilingual intercultural education due to the little clarity that
They have the different actors responsible for their implementation about what EIB is and what it implies in
The practice, from the understanding of children and adolescents of the original peoples as subjects
of rights and the State as guarantor of that right.
The lack of precision in relation to how EIB is understood and what it implies in practice, permeates everything
The plan implementation process is explicitly manifested in the activities carried out
Within this framework, as is the case with contextualized curricula and study programs by grade.
The lack of a clear vision of the socio -political and technical implications of the EIB also
It is evidenced in the initial and continuous teacher training processes.
40
i) Perceptions about EIB and the characteristics of the EIB school
There are different approaches to the EIB among the interviewed actors: some more oriented
to aspects of claim and others that also link it with quality learning and
The assessment of diversity. However, several officials of Meduca conceive it as
Something that only concerns indigenous peoples, as explained below.
Most indigenous actors associate EIB with the assessment of culture and see it as
A mechanism of cultural and linguistic claim, from a rather intracultural vision.
“I understand it as an important axis to carry out the work of the rescue of our language, culture
and tradition of the region in our country in Panama since it is the engine to continue promoting the
values of our ethnicity ”(Supervisor - TDC Workshop cards).
“It is the cultural, linguistic, traditional, mathematics of each person in a
original group or a region, and is valued and rescued for conservation ”(teacher - cards
TDC workshop).
In the techniques of the DNEIB, and in some links the idea of the EIB associated with the
cultural relevance and therefore with quality learning. The idea of valuation is also seen
of diversity and exchange of cultures.
“This approach seeks to strengthen their identity and of course to the whole society respect for the
Diversity ”(DNEIB technician - TDC Workshop cards).
"Exchange of culture in knowledge of today's world" (DNEIB Link - TDC Workshop cards).
This vision of the technicians of the DNEIB and the idea of an EIB that involves the entire system
educational, as the EIB26 model raises, is not shared by all in Meduca, and rather
In other national addresses, an EIB conception is evident as something only for the
indigenous.
“The first thing we have to do is the characteristics of the context if EIB is, we have a population
Native or also teachers, but you also have to see if they are settlers. If we talk about villages
Indigenous the population is more than that area, but we also have provinces in which there are other children, if
Most are Latin, the general pattern of Meduca is maintained ”(I-DN-40). (Ours)
This vision of interculturality and eib restricted only to indigenous people is perceived of
Critical way from other civil society actors such as NGOs and international cooperation:
“The issue of intercultural is not in the debate, we have always considered it in our
I work, but it is not in the official debate. On the other hand, the same concept of interculturality. It is due
Thinking about all the cultures of Panama, the issue of the interrelation of cultures is not seen. It looks alone
how the indigenous people are going to integrate or do, but not an assessment of others to their
culture ”(I-CO-26).
“It is not seen as an intercultural education but as a subject of indigenous people, it is a matter of them,
And they will see how they can and should do ”(I-CO-25).
26 The EIB model states: “Bilingual intercultural education is not an‘ for indigenous ’education, much less intends to isolate
To indigenous peoples ... the transformation of our education system should not be referred solely to indigenous peoples, but
To all culturally diverse groups that live in the country. Just as cultural diversity is a characteristic of society
Panamanian, thus the national education system, in its entirety, must be oriented to achieve a truly multicultural society ...
41
Due to the little appropriation of the concept of interculturality for all, and the need for its
Inclusion in education, the child and adolescent are blurred as a subject of rights, and in
particular of the right to relevant and quality education, and of the State as guarantor of that
right.
The lack of clarity about the concept of EIB has an impact on the operation of educational services
in schools that serve indigenous students, and is evidenced in the way it is defined what
It is an EIB school and what components or characteristics should have to say that it is
offering this service. Indeed, many of the regional supervisors and directors
interviewed consider that the school is eib when the teacher speaks the language and wishes
implement it or with the use of traditional clothing and celebration of cultural events, as already
He scored in question 1 of efficacy.
“I don't know. I don't define it. I suppose it is Law 88 that says that all teaching must be EBI.
Although this does not happen. There are no 10% EBI. Because the observations that I have made not all schools
EBI apply. And that they have specialists in their schools, trained in EBI, graduated in
UDELAS ”(I-SU-06).
“That school there are teachers who speak and write in the language. It must show interest and be
empowered the subject ”(I-SU-32).
II) Contextualized curricular programs
The analysis of the relevance of the contextualized curricular programs is addressed from the
needs of its beneficiaries, taking into account the regional debate of recent years around
to the EIB that raises:
to. the need to incorporate bodies of alternative knowledge to Western knowledge, from a
approach that values the cultural heritage of the original peoples, not only in terms of their
worldview and values, but as a creator of knowledge that have allowed them to respond to
delicate ecosystems in which they have lived.
b. The urgency of promoting knowledge dialogue as a way of responding to potentialities,
local problems and global challenges from the recognition that there is more than one way
valid to access the knowledge and understanding of reality to interact with it.
c. the need to respond to the new and complex sociolinguistic situations that originate the
Displacement of native languages in favor of Spanish.
The contextualized curricula of the Ngäbe, Buglé and Kuna peoples are not framed in this debate
regional because they have been prepared from an additive approach that implies adding subjects to the
existing national curriculum, which develops from homogenizing parameters. The option of
Add subjects respond to the National Bilingual Intercultural Education Plan of 2005, which
He raised the need to modify the curriculum to include subjects such as indigenous mathematics,
indigenous history, mother tongue, indigenous religion, indigenous botany, art and Spanish as second
Language (Meduca, 2005).
Meduca's option to keep indigenous knowledge separate from knowledge
school academics, through the inclusion of new subjects, not only inhibits the possibility of
that these two types of knowledge can enter into dialogue and respond to potentialities, problems
and local - global challenges from different ways of understanding and interacting with reality.
It can also be unmanageable for teachers in practice, maintaining subjects
"Officers" of the national curriculum and "add" the other subjects according to the curriculum of each
town. While some teachers can try to articulate the two types of knowledge this results
42
complex in operation and remains at your will or the decision of its director and endorsement of the/a
Supervisor.
The development of knowledge dialogue processes requires an approach to the set of knowledge
that the native peoples have developed to function in their local environments. This implies
address both sociocultural aspects related to family, values and community and
botanical, zoological, ethological and technological knowledge and visions that peoples
natives have about the different spaces where they develop and the different beings that
They live in them. However, contextualized programs initially focused on aspects
sociocultural and therefore they only considered the subjects of spirituality in the Kuna and
Identity in the Ngäbe and Buglé, leaving aside what referred to the field of knowledge about the environment.
Until 2017 none of the 4 study programs prepared by the three villages, included the
botanical, zoological, ethological and technological knowledge that they have developed to be able to
unfold in your environment. This has only been incorporated into the subjects of Natural Sciences and
of agriculture and technologies that have developed the Kuna. While it is important to recognize the
importance of including knowledge related to the environment, as is done in these last two
subjects, these have the inconvenience of continuing to add more subjects to the curriculum
contextualized and make teacher work more difficult.
In the current situation, the teacher would have to develop both the subject of spirituality or
Identity and social sciences of the national curriculum, when it would be more operational to have a
single subject that addresses social sciences from indigenous knowledge and critically add
and selective school knowledge. The same could happen with science subjects
Natural, agriculture and technology and mathematics. Having unified subjects, in turn,
would facilitate the dialogue of knowledge27 by allowing students to deepen the
knowledge of their native peoples and have spaces to compare them with other knowledge. By
Example, they could know the vision that their people have about the ecosystem and contrast it with which
handles Western science, identifying similarities and differences and contributions of each one to
Improve the quality of the environment and the quality of life. This could not be done if the
subjects of the study programs by degree independently of those of the curriculum
national.
iii) relevance in human resources training
As for the relevance of the formative offer of the UDELAS, as well as that of the occasions is put
attention in how much their proposals contribute to the implementation of the EIB and how they address the
Personal identity dimension of teacher training. While only the occasions developed in the
Plan frame, it is necessary to collect the learning of the only initial training experience
EIB that exists in the country, for the design of future curricula in the specialty.
to. The degree in EIB of UDELAS
The professional and technical pedagogical personal dimension are two key aspects in training
teacher and must be completed in the development of the profiles and subjects of the curricula.
Although the profile of the graduate of the degree of Udelas includes the professional dimension and
ethics, only one of the subjects, which is called ethics and values, is related to this trait,
even if it becomes unique importance in the case of indigenous students, who must have
possibilities to reflect on the multiple factors that influence their identity and identify the
27 The dialog of knowledge in education is understood as a process of dynamic, enriching and permanent interrelation between systems
of knowledge /knowledge, of different cultural traditions that are pedagogically addressed from local and global challenges.
43
impact that the historical mechanism of the coloniality of society has had in its life and in the
His family, among other aspects.
“We drag shameful feelings of being indigenous, as long as that does not work, from dignity
Of his own identity, the trend is to try to be like others ”(I-CO-26).
“There are well -counted educators who already have the theme of EIB in their heart and soul. But the
Most think that talking about EBI is a delay. We have the mind so colonized that we
We greet in Spanish as soon as we see each other, the first thing that comes out is the other world. But it must be
on the contrary ”(I-OU-11).
“But there are (teachers) who are colonized by another education and only follow what they are told and not
They see what is the best for their people ”(I li 54).
EIB treatment also requires identifying the sociolinguistic context in which
develop educational work and have the capacities to implement a treatment plan for
languages that respond to the needs of children and adolescents. However, the Bachelor
of you forms students to attend a single linguistic scenario, the one in which
The original language is the mother tongue or first language and Spanish the second language or language 2.
The expected general competences of the graduate point to the knowledge of an indigenous language,
Kuna in the original proposal and Ngäbere, in the proposal adapted for this town. However, no

When they reach the classroom, they don't want to apply. They do not give value (to the EIB) and have bilingual formation. There is
to see the appointment in Meduca and that the university is well prepared in forming them ”(i-
Su-10).
“It is worrying you are not formed what we want for the teaching of the mother tongue.
Who has to dominate the language well. Students do not speak Spanish well and either the
indigenous ”(C-DN-01).
You currently lack differentiated proposals for scenarios in which the language
native to be treated as second language, or as a language of inheritance and design methodologies
Chords with this situation. This has not yet been done in Panama, as people explained
Interviewees.
“If we should make a change because we have tied more mother tongue as an original language.
But that original language methodology as a second language is nobody working. Also, now
There was a previous Spanish work as a second language, that method has not yet been reviewed since
The 80s. There is no method to teach Spanish with first language and the original language
as a second language ”(I-UO 36).
“There are communities, although there are few, that there is more Spanish by historical factors, there we have
that implement Kuna language as second language ”(C-CO 37).
The Bachelor of the Bachelor's study does not offer students spaces to deepen
knowledge of its original people, even if it includes a set of courses that allow strengthening
Grammatical knowledge and the use of the original language. In the same way the didactic courses
of the different areas lack spaces that allow the future teacher to design situations of
learning for different sociocultural and sociolinguistic contexts within the framework of a dialogue of
Knowledge between its cultural tradition and other cultural traditions, including science.
44
“Universities are not training EIB professors, and have no work of culture thoroughly.
It is lacking those wise ”(I-Co-26).
b. Training courses offered by training agencies
These courses allow the teacher to be updated in the management of the study programs by grade,
However, the lack of a agreed proposal is observed in relation to the treatment of the
Intercultural Education The fact of working based on study programs by grade, which only
They approach the intracultural dimension, entails the risk of losing the intercultural, as is
appreciates in the following response in relation to how the intercultural approach is worked on in the
Training
“Many teachers have no idea what a story is, which represents an Emberá, for example.
They know why we are teaching to speak Emberá, they do not know their culture. We talk about culture,
Language, food, jobs. Way of living. But many teachers are not interested ”(I-O-
19).
Other interviewees indicate the need to start from the same to know the other, but they lack
A concrete proposal on how to do it.
“The idea is to see that there is another culture, respect for culture, depends on each trainer. We have not
made a measure for everyone. Understand culture and that there is another culture apart from the national that
We all have and that of that coexistence and that the teacher can respect the cultural reality in the
That is, in which it is being incorporated. We trust the facilitators because they are from the area. Us
We train the facilitators, but we expect more than they know, but not that, we do not work
As something technical. We are building the approach or shaping it. There is nothing written for these
realities ”(I-UO-18).
“That (the intercultural approach) is seen by the facilitators that first reinforce what is one for
Be able to understand the other world. First you have to understand yours to understand on the other side. Yeah
You understand the other first yours is banished ”(I-UO-11).
In addition, the lack of a clear proposal on how to address the treatment of languages is observed:
“In practice, the teacher who goes to the seminary does not know how one to 10 in Ngäbe is said, in the
Seminar Learn that, how long, square, round objects are counted, what you are going to do is
know the language in what has to do with mathematics we form them in which they know
basic aspects. The theme of the schedule in which each language is going to work is not worked, that must
Define DNEIB and MEDUCA ”(I-UO-18).
“We rely on the materials in Kuna. Now work is now working at the meduca level with
The programs. Some texts are in Spanish, but for the lowest and initial degrees everything is in
Kuna in third would already be combined because there is transfer from kuna to Spanish, the lowest grades
Everything is in Kuna ”(I-UO-11).
While it is recognized that some teachers have ambivalences against their cultural heritage, the
Identity issue is not addressed in training, as a specific topic. This limitation is
relates to a more pedagogical vision of the training process that leaves aside the dimension
Teaching staff and the influence you have in your work.
“For example, that of identity is important because it feels that identity and cultural part are
very weak against the national. (…) The issue of cultural identity is, but tangentially
Not well orderly. This more psychological theme was proposed to Meduca and did not prosper ”(I-
UO-18).
45
Question 2: What was the participation of indigenous communities during planning and
execution of the plan?
The participation of leaders and traditional authorities of the General Congresses and of
Indigenous communities in the formulation of the five -year plan. The participation of indigenous leaders
It occurred in two moments, in the presentation event, in which the traditional authorities themselves
They made formal delivery to the Minister of Education, achieving their political positioning; and in the analysis
of the budget requirement for the implementation of the plan. They did not participate in the execution and
monitoring of plan activities because channels and structure were not anticipated to do it
effective
The participation of regional leaders and indigenous organizations was considered one of
The strategies in the TDC, and these instances should assume the representation of their communities of
base. However, the existence of an organizational structure that ensured its
Participation from the formulation and during the plan execution process.
The formal presentation of the five -year plan at an event in Panama City achieved an impact
important politician, since it was the traditional authorities of the seven indigenous peoples who
They delivered the plan to the Minister of Education, getting them to commit to guaranteeing
its implementation and in obtaining the funds for it. Unfortunately this initial positioning
of the plan and participation of the indigenous leaders in their execution was not then enhanced. He
Plan was also presented in the Kuna Yala region, at the request of the regional authorities.
The representatives of the congresses of the regions and communities also participated in the
Preparation of the budget for the execution of the plan, once this had already been formulated.
After that, no other deeper socialization space was foreseen, nor
involved in the dissemination and development of plan activities, in the monitoring and surrender of
Plan accounts, hence the ignorance of most leaders and leaders interviewed.
“I would lie to him if I told him that I have participated or that any of us has participated. If they tell us
We are going to organize a plan and they call us, we will always be present, if we know when they are
elaborating, when they are cooking, we were already left ”(C-Li-38).
“I know, but I have not participated in the elaboration, but it is known because it has been presented at the level
of the Congress ”(I-Li-54).
The interviewed regional leaders also point out that there are no coordination with them
From the Regional Directorates of Education, except to solve some specific problems that
They are presented in schools, but not to participate in activities related to the plan.
“The regional direction of the Kuna Yala region we have in theory the coordination with all the
Regional authorities, but in practice it does not happen. Since 2014 the regional addresses are
mostly in the city, and not in the region. The relationship is little, so our authorities of the
Communities do not take that relationship into account. There is only relationship when problems occur,
not with respect to EIB for example ”(I-LI-54).
The lack of participation from the formulation of the five -year plan can explain the little
involvement of regional leaders and indigenous organizations in their execution and
The little level of surveillance they have exercised to evaluate the achievement of their objectives. However,
During the 2014-2019 five-year period, indigenous organizations did independently to the
Plan a set of activities related to the valuation and dissemination of their cultural knowledge and
linguistic. The Ngäbe Buglé (Asmung) women's association can be cited
46
projects with identity approach; Women Emberá in Alto Bayano who encourage women
and young people in the practice of art and production from their worldview and the Women's Association
Gunas (Olowaili) that raises the importance of maintaining and recovering ancestral wisdom Kuna
in the elaboration of the molas.
In the specific issue of EIB the National Coordination of Indigenous Women of Panama
(Conamuip) has worked through translations in indigenous projects of projects
Institutional such as health, education, gender and environment. He has also worked on the card
carried out to revitalize the language and culture in 7 indigenous languages with intercultural approach. Without
However, during the collective interview with their representatives, they pointed out that no
They were summoned for the design of the plan and the majority did not know.
During the years 2018 and 2019, 14 teachers Buglé voluntarily and autonomously drafted the
Study programs from first to third grade for L1 subjects, identity and mathematics.
In the Naso case a group of university students wrote 5 volumes from the Naso Encyclopedia
about history, verbal art, botany and crafts, through an investigation with the grandparents that
He had support from Colombian linguistics.
The various activities carried out by the organizations of the original peoples, teachers and
indigenous students demonstrate the valuation of their cultural and linguistic heritage and their capacity
to mobilize around this goal. Similarly the authorities of the congresses and others
Leaders and leaders consider that the issue of EIB is important for the development of their peoples,
But except in the Kuna case, they do not have projects and budgets that allow them to develop a
more specific and sustained work of support and surveillance of EIB in its communities. A major
participation of these traditional leaders, as well as the participation of the fathers and mothers of the
EIB SCHOOLS AND ITS REPRESENTATION OF THE CONGRAMS OF EACH PEOPLE, COULD HAVE GIVENED HIM FORCE
to the five -year plan, through the awareness and dissemination of its main activities. Besides,
would have reinforced the requirement of accountability processes of the plan. However, the
participation of fathers and mothers and communal authorities was not planned in the
Plan.
EFFICIENCY
Question 1: Were the resources invested for the implementation and execution of the
Plan? Question 1.1: To what extent was there an adequate execution of the budget for the
Implementation of the plan?
The five -year plan was designed as a tool that allowed to obtain a budget consistent with
The activities and programs to be developed in order to implement EIB in all native peoples.
However, the resources obtained were insufficient and their execution was not adequate, nor timely,
compromising the implementation of the plan.
Until 2014, the DNEIB to fulfill its “responsibility to manage the implementation of the
Bilingual Intercultural Education in the native peoples ”, only had financing
from international cooperation. With the political opening of the Minister of Meduca, the
DNEIB carried out a collective elaboration process of the quinquenal plan already prepared
for the techniques of the DNEIB with support of UNICEF. In order to perform an analysis of the
Budget requirement, organized tables by town that worked the budget that was required
To execute the activities designed in the plan.
47
This year resulted in a budget of 46 million balboas28 for the 2016 period
to 2020, at $ 9,200.00 per year.
In Panama the final budget of an address is the result of a negotiation process that
has several steps:
1. The management proposal of the management, in this case the DNEIB, with the acceptance of the
Minister is integrated into the proposal of the total budget that the Ministry leads to the MEF.
2. This total proposal goes to the Ministry of Economy and Finance to be integrated into the
National Executive Budget. In this step, unless you have a high political guarantee
priority, cuts are always produced.
3. The national budget proposal goes to the National Assembly to be the law of
Republic. In this last step you can also suffer cuts.
In the case of the budget presented by the DNEIB, although it had the endorsement of the minister, in the first
step was reduced to 21 million dollars, decreasing starting 54%. In the second step, he suffered a
New cut of the order of 29%, reaching the assembly only 15 million. In the third step he returned
to suffer another 67%cut, finally obtaining only 5 million for the age of 5 (2016-2020), a
million for each year.
Given the magnitude of the plan, the budget obtained from one million dollars per year was clearly
Insufficient for the execution of all activities designed to obtain products.
The lack of experience in budget negotiations, since it was the first time that the DNEIB
proposed and managed a budget for a plan, caused the DNEIB not to take the issue to a
national discussion and look for other incidence strategies, such as the participation of the authorities
of indigenous peoples or the support of international cooperation.
On the other hand, the DNEIB did not make a new exercise of prioritization of the activities and results to
In order to direct the investment of the budget that for the first time obtained.
For 2016, the budget that the DNEIB had to execute the plan was one million dollars
($ 1,000,000.00). However, according to reports provided by the same DNEIB they only used
$ 270,000.00.
The low execution capacity of 2016 caused DNEIB to lose budget allocation in
in 2017, the year in which only $ 100,000.00 was assigned and in El, 2018, only $ 50,00029. 2018
Dneib changed director and Meduca made an audit to the use that was taking place of the funds,
whose results could not be accessed. In 2019 the DNEIB had “zero” of budget
investment
“The plan was fine. What was wrong was the implementation of the DNEIB weakness.
"Budget this year (2019) we started at zero. Only for operation" (C-DN-27).
28 This budget contemplated 15 million balboas to meet the target of EIB literacy, in all regions,
Collective, ancestral and regions of the native peoples of Panama. This component being aimed at adults does not form
part of this evaluation.
29 data obtained in the DNEIB report.
48
“In the Varela Administration (2014-2019), although we had the defined plan and resources, it was not executed.
It did not advance. Yes you can advance when there is a will to do things. We had the plan, but I don't know
He could advance ”(I-DN-14).
In 2019 around $ 77,000 were distributed among the three regional education addresses
regional, for mobilization, training and elaboration of sheet support sheets in
L1, L2 and mathematics.
“At one time a conflict was formed and outside what they took us out there was a background and transferred to
The regional that was at that time, of the 27 thousand dollars to each other 30 thousand regions. With
That money was to continue working on training for the orientation of texts, sheets,
books they had to do ”(I-DN-24).
The use that occurred to the resources assigned in the different years is not clear, because it could only be
Obtain information on your use in some of the interviews conducted. These indicate that they were
mainly used to mobilize the management and personnel of the DNEIB to the
regions, but there is no information about it and not known reports on
Results of these mobilizations. However, we can collect that they had no impact
important in the advance of the achievements of the plan explained above.
Among the factors that affected the meager capacity for execution was that the DNEIB was not
prepared to identify investment priorities in the plan, nor did it use this budget as
Financial counterpart to obtain new resources from non -governmental sources.
“The management does not have a budget plan to execute a program and its technical team does not
It has a strategic vision. That they have people or not to speak the language is not enough, I also know
It needs the ability to make a plan ”(I-CO-60).
"We have money and we didn't know how to manage resources. We never had an investment resource" (I-
DN-03).
“The national direction and its team did not have that opportunity to use the state resources that
They had assigned us after so much fight. Like the direction, the main head did not have much
effort that we could handle as a state commitment because we understand that every resource
that a town recognizes it must be managed with the capacity, with the height and definitely
We did not have that solidity ”(I-DN-14).
The reasons are related to the negotiation and management capacity of a budget of the
DNEIB, the importance of EIB in Meduca and in the social and political imaginary of the country and
level of concern on the agenda of the indigenous authorities most aimed at problems of the
territory, which together expresses the low level of priority that EIB has for the State
Panamanian.
The result was that the actions defined in the plan were not carried out, compromising the
Effectiveness in obtaining results.
30 Although the current director of the DNEIB formally requested the Meduca Budget Department to facilitate
Information on the management of the DNEIB budget during the plan of the plan (budget requested, delivered and spent by
year), it was not possible to have such information. This prevents a more detailed analysis of the items in which the
assigned budget.
49
Question 2: How efficient was the investment of international cooperation to achieve
expected results?
The investment of international cooperation was not significant enough to promote the achievement of
The expected results in the plan and their specific actions have not always managed to strengthen development
of the EIB at the level of the schools because there was no operational plan of the five -year plan that prioritizes
the needs to be covered to which this investment could have aligned in a strategic and operational way.
International cooperation contributed31 in the achievement of some of the actions that had been
Proposed to perform the DNEIB with the five -year plan.
• IDB, with Japanese cooperation funds invested around $ 900,000 for
Implement the Jadenkä program by the OEI in Ngäbes schools of the Ngäbe region
Bugle.
• AECID continued to support the Kuna Congress in the implementation of the EBI program in the
Kuna Yala region.
• UNICEF contributed with $ 20,000 for the day of reflection on EIB organized by the
DNEIB within the framework of the Quinquenal Plan, with the assistance of 50 participants. Around
of $ 70,000 for the participatory diagnosis made in three schools in the Ngäbe region
I bugly with faith and joy. With around $ 60,000 for the production of texts and elaboration
of playful teaching material with the Casa Workshop Foundation32.
As indicated in the efficacy section, with the exception of the reflection day, the actions
carried out by international cooperation were not framed in an operational plan
coordinated between cooperation and DNEIB.
With respect to the Jadenkä program (IDB-Japan-OEI), the evaluations carried out to this program by
external agents, give an account of the big difference in learning the children who participate
of the program in front of other boys and girls who do not participate in it, which demonstrates the importance and
Efficiency of this program developed at the pre -school level. An aspect that can limit the
Efficiency of this program is the high mobility of teachers both in the degrees they teach
as in schools, losing the training carried out. This, together with the dependence of the
Financing external to Meduca, endanger its continuity.
“The country's indigenous communities run the risk of continuing with isolated, incapable experiences
to consolidate the process of an education that has aroused great expectations in them ”(Aiban
Wagua, 2015. pp33).
“The program continues until the funds are over. Now as the National Directorate of
Initial we are in national capacity and we are going to appropriate to continue working with our
own funds. It is in the management plan, they are processes that the management will try to
keep." (C-DN-46).
The EBI program (AECID-Regional Congress Kuna), has achieved continuity in the more than 15 years
what you have. Although it is the people who have advanced the most in the elaboration of curricular programs
31 The indicated investment amounts were obtained through the interviews with the respective responsible. The consulting team
He could not get documentation about it. In the case of AECID, the representative was retiring from Panama and the person who
I interim replaced it did not have this information.
32 These amounts were provided in an interview with UNICEF
50
and EIB texts, just 2018 and 2019 El Meduca has validated its curricular programs, leaving
its formalization still pending. However, we must point out that, unlike the others
Cooperations, this EBI program finds its strength to be assumed by the General Congress
Kuna that develops with own resources such as teacher training, awareness of
Families, work meetings to continue advancing with EBI in the schools of the region.
Question 3: To what extent were human resources suitable to achieve the objectives?
DNEIB did not have enough human resources to carry out the implementation of the plan
Quinquennial. The size of the plan required more personnel in quantity and professional qualification. Dadaist
The magnitude of the task, the DNEIB must have been strengthened with the appointment of qualified personnel of
in accordance with the provisions of the law of its creation.
DNEIB, to fulfill the role of implementing the five -year plan in indigenous peoples, must
have at least indigenous technicians of each indigenous people, formed in EIB and handle
the language and culture of the people with which they work.
“As for the profile first as is from the Indigenous Education Office, it must have training
Academic because you will guide, participate, give seminars, you must have experience and be a teacher,
Know your culture, speak your language well spoken, to know the history of your people, to know the
evolution of the public educational field and the original people, they must have not so knowledge
broad, but at least that profile. You have to attend to the chiefs who do not speak Spanish to
Make them understand, the same in the field you have to speak in the language itself and know how to explain well. We have
had colleagues that we have tried to support them, but upon reaching the field you cannot communicate
Well in their language then they speak in Spanish ”(I-DN-24).
However, during the plan of the plan only had three technicians, one for the Emberá people,
another for the Wunaan and another for the Ngäbe. In 2018 the technician Emberá was transferred as a teacher
of degree to an educational center in the Emberá-Wouunaan region, leaving this town without
representation. While the national director and the planning director are Kunas, there is no
Specialized technician who advises this town. The same happens with the Buglé, Naso and Bibri peoples.
The work of the technical one is limited to the lack of human resources in the regional addresses
and training processes that strengthen their management, coordination and advice capacities
in the application of EIB in the respective peoples.
“The training of technicians in the DNEIB is lacking. They are not trained to take the EIB to the
Indigenous peoples, another instance is the regional direction, are not trained to develop the
EIB, they say that it will be called EIB regional address, but it is not only a name change but also
are trained to make the EIB because if we have no mind changed in relation to the EIB, how
You can work with the boys who have two three languages, that is the missing part to give it
force to the institution. (C-CO-37).
“How are we going to attend our program if we don't have staff, trained teachers, material
didactic?" (I-DN-02).
The magnitude of the task to implement the five -year plan required that DNEIB was strengthened
with the appointment of qualified personnel in the management of the EIB, in accordance with the provisions of the
Law of its creation.
51
SUSTAINABILITY
Question 1: Have you managed to generate institutional capacity in indigenous regions for the
Sustainability of the plan's actions? Question 1.1: To what extent a governance model
centralized allowed (or not) the scope of the plan's objectives? And ask 1.2: What adaptations
They require governance, monitoring and evaluation systems to ensure the sustainability of the
Plan?
The necessary institutional capacity for the sustainability of the five -year plan in
The regions have not developed the capacities of the technical teams of the DRE or the
teachers and directors of schools, which, although they have had some training processes, these have not
been sufficient to guarantee the continuity of the activities of the Plan and the development of the EIB.
Achieve institutional in indigenous regions for the sustainability of the plan's actions
implies having achieved at least three aspects: the organizational apparatus of the
Dre as local instances in charge of EIB, the skills and competencies of the equipment
DRE technicians who take care of EIB and a favorable institutional and political context,
which covers both adequate and permanent coordination with the DNEIB and the other directions of the
Meduca, as the relationship and involvement of the traditional authorities of the regions
indigenous in the development of EIB.
None of these three aspects have been consolidated in these years of implementation of the plan
Quinquennial. Although the plan contemplated as an activity the restructuring of the management system and
EIB administration, this restructuring did not occur and the regional education directions of
The regions still have limitations both at the organizational level, due to the lack of a structure
more in line with the territory and the type of schools in which they have to manage the services
educational, as at the level of their technical teams, both for the insufficient amount of personnel and
for their profile.
“The current structure of the Regional Directorate of Education is not adequate by the extension of the
region. Personal lack. In the Nedrini region, Besiko has 5 school zones, in Nole Diuma there are
Two zones, Mironó has 3 zones, that is, total 10 areas to see. Cleto is Nedrini and Cleto Supervisor
It has to do with the 10 zones; logical that cannot reach everyone. That is why supervisors are used
Regional of the basic but do not speak Ngäbe. And they only repeat that EIB is important, but even
There they arrive because they cannot say or good morning in Ngäbe. Francisco attends Muna with seven areas
and ñurum with 3 zones. He can visit some of Muna, but not ñurum that is further. The
Basic supervisors are one X zone. There are 39 zones. There are 39 supervisors. Worse in ñokribo ”(I-DR-
16).
“… They [the teams of the regional education addresses] are not trained to
Develop the EIB, they say that it will be called EIB regional direction, but it is not only a change of
name but are trained to make the EIB, because if we have no mind changed with
Relationship to EIB, how you can work with boys who have two three languages, that is the
part that is missing to give strength to the institution ”(C-CO-37).
Regional education addresses, both regional and non -regional, are instances that
They depend administratively on the academic vice ministry of Meduca, but which, at the level
Operational, coordinate with all the national addresses that are part of the General Directorate
of education His role in the implementation of the five -year plan was fundamental to development
of the activities, being the instances that assume the management of schools in the territories and
52
They know the specific needs and demands of the population. However, they were not involved in
systematic mode from the beginning throughout the process, as well as the traditional authorities of the
regions and indigenous communities.
This model of centralized governance of Meduca, where everything must be approved in the
instances of the central level, does not allow the DRE to have some autonomy and develop initiatives
that allow to respond better and more quickly to educational needs in their territories. HE
It also requires improving communication and coordination channels between national addresses
and regional addresses, so that the decisions and actions taken have the
relevance and quality that require the reality and concrete problem of the schools of the regions
indigenous.
In the different interviews it is evident that the organizational structure of the Meduca inhibits the
development of actions directly concerted between the regional addresses and the DNEIB with
The purpose of meeting the needs of schools with a quality EIB. This is perceived by various
actors, among them, those of international cooperation, who have had serious difficulties in
Coordinate with regional addresses:
"We made a proposal to Meduca to training all year ... the address of
Strengthening and improvement did not accept because it is very hierarchical. Is the DNEIB, but
Meduca has another teaching improvement address, we had to have the authorization of the
of teaching improvement, only then we had to present to the DNEIB so that this
Present to the regional management a lot
Time ”(I-CO-28).
The institutional capacity of the regional education addresses is limited to following the
Indications of the different directions of Meduca. As the same directors and
some indigenous leaders, everything is done based on the guidelines that come from the central meduca and
What is not official, even better for schools and for villages students
indigenous, it is not done.
“… With each national direction we see specific aspects, if I need to approve something of the curriculum
I go to that address, if I need to make an infrastructure project, with that address, if it is something of
Evaluation, or initial ... and so with each one ”(I-DR-43).
“We have resources, but the weakness is that teachers are obliged to take the guidelines of the
Ministry of Education, because they are paying them. That is the weakness of our people [of the
Dre], which has to comply with what the Ministry gives them the order: this is the curriculum, this is the material,
This is the program. We do not have the support of Meduca ”(I-Li-54).
Such a centralized structure prevents the development of levels of autonomy and leadership of
Regional Directorates of Education in decision making about aspects that could be assumed
directly for them. The governance and management model requires being reviewed in light not only
of the results of the five -year plan, but of an evaluation of the critical situation of education
who are receiving indigenous students in the regions and outside them, and the functions
and responsibilities of regional addresses in the lack of implementation of a quality EIB.
DRE are not fully assuming the functions that compete in the framework of the
current centralized structure, as they are not managing a relevant education to the characteristics
sociocultural and linguistic of students under the pretext that schools have not been
still converted into EIB schools.
53
In relation to the strengthening of a political context in favor of EIB that allows sustainability
of the plan, as already mentioned before, despite the fact that the traditional authorities were in the
presentation of the five -year plan were not then summoned for their involvement in the
implementation. A strategy with them was not generated to, for example, dissemination and awareness
to teachers, fathers and mothers and communities of their respective regions, something that
It would have contributed as a social basis for sustainability.
Question 1.3: To what extent does the processes, effects and results achieved be sustained
In time?
It is difficult to talk about the sustainability of the effects and results because the objectives of the five -year plan are not
They have achieved fully. There are processes that can be supported over time, but rather in a logic
of continuity, in order to conclude them and achieve the expected results.
There are some processes provided in the five -year plan that are underway and that could follow
being driven by DNEIB until its culmination, as are those related to the framework
normative (regulation of law 88 and resolved) and that are important for institutionalization and
EIB development. But the direct support of other addresses and office of Meduca is required,
as the Office of Legal Advice, but above all of the political will of the authorities of the
Meduca to bring these processes to their culmination and approval.
They are also in different degree of progress, as detailed in question 1 of efficacy, processes
of formulation of the study programs by grade for the seven indigenous peoples, which must be
reviewed and completed with the participation of the Meduca curriculum address. Equal
way, the elaboration of educational materials in indigenous languages aligned to
curricular programs and for all indigenous peoples.
There is information that following the pandemic, the DNEIB has resumed the elaboration of materials
In native languages to distribute to the regions, since the lack of connectivity prevents them from and
Indigenous students can follow virtual and TV classes. DNEIB has planned
reissue, impression and distribution of some materials that already existed, such as those of the Kuna people
and of the Jadenkä preschool program, but it should also be seen as an opportunity for
The elaboration of materials for the other indigenous peoples resume more diligently.
Question 2: What are the necessary activities/conditions in the next five years to
ensure the sustainability of the long -term plan?
The five -year plan did not contemplate the formulation of a strategy for its sustainability, once
This will culminate its period, and the DNEIB does not plan for another plan to implement the plan with a
New budget for this. Nor was a plan management team composed of
representatives of the different national, regional and traditional authorities to
monitor and sustainability to the plan.
To give sustainability to the plan, a new plan of plan should have been planned considering the
processes and activities that have not been developed; a budget line for this new cycle of
Plan in the Meduca budget; and have fixed places for the plan management team
EIB at the strategic and operational level. None of these three aspects have been considered.
54
The Meduca, and in particular the DNEIB, does not have a contingency plan and/or continuity of the plan
Quinquenal that allows to continue advancing with the planned activities and that have not been
developed, in such a way that they lead to the achievement of the results, which remain
necessary to reach.
However, it is important to note that in the month of February 2020 the academic vice minister of the
Meduca installed a table to review the implementation of EIB in Panama, with the DNEIB,
some national addresses and regional regional addresses. This process was suspended
due to pandemic. It is unknown when that work will be resumed, but this could be the
opportunity to rethink in this new route the activities that were pending in the plan
Quinquenal 2014 - 2019, and this evaluation is taken into account, seeking to overcome weaknesses
Originals of the Plan, such as the lack of indicators, monitoring and monitoring strategy and plans
annual operations. The results of this evaluation should serve to identify the gaps and
Pose new EIB improvement routes.
Another important aspect to consider is that the Ministry of Government designed a development plan
of indigenous peoples. In this, the traditional authorities of the seven villages participated
Indigenous, and will be executed with a world bank loan that is in the process of application.
Among its components is the education, which is planned to be executed in alliance with the
Meduca through its different directions, including DNEIB. This component, although it is
mainly aimed at improving school infrastructure, has a directed subcomponent
to actions that are related to the five -year plan: “curricular development and implementation of the
EIB expanded Bilingual Intercultural Education curriculum, with the training of teachers and
Materials for the 7 indigenous peoples ”.
“There is a memorandum of understanding with Meduca where it is defined that the address in charge is
The DNEIB ... for EIB there are approximately 35 million. 28 million for infrastructure and furniture
and the rest for technical assistance, especially in educational management, especially strengthening groups of
parents, mothers, the administration of the school itself, so that the investment in infrastructure and
Furniture is not lost and that there is maintenance, and that the EIB curriculum is well understood by the
parents ”(C-CO-58).
In this regard, the Deputy Minister of Indigenous Affairs indicates:
“We have a development plan for indigenous peoples and there is an educational component where
We are seeing bilingual education. We already have [the funds], we have already disbursed a small
part. We must have the opening of the funds and with that the EIB will be promoted ”(I-LI-59).
Although it has not been prepared within the framework of the five -year plan, this project and the budget that is
Consider in it could be the stage to start the continuity of the most important activities.
55
GENERAL CHURCH AND EQUITY RIGHTS33
Question 1: Did the participation and voice of children and adolescents include during the
Implementation and refinement of program and projects?
The participation and voice of boys and girls in the implementation of the five -year plan, was not considered
explicitly in plan design. However, if your participation is found in the actions
executed by international cooperation. The five -year plan has the value of being an attempt to give
Response to the lack of attention and guarantee of the right of indigenous children, to an education of
quality with respect to their culture and language.
The participation and voice of children and adolescents was not explicitly considered in
The plan. The design was an institutional action with DNEIB technicians and external consultants, and
then with participation of teachers, directors and supervisors to work the budget.
When asked about the participation of children in the process of implementation of the
Plan, the people interviewed indicate that it occurs in the festivities as dances and
rounds While this can be a way of participating, its level of participation is not clear.
“In the Kuna General Congress they have a group of youth, in our part we have done
Works with children and also painting contest. Floral games help
Much because the child and girl's participation is valued as a project ”(C-CO.37).
“In all schools in the regions there is a week of culture, where children,
girls, educators all must program what they will do, what they will present, how
They will dress, different activities rescuing food, ceremonies, but it is an arduous job ”
(I-U0-11).
However, there is the participation of children in actions carried out by the
International cooperation. For example, in the EBI Kuna project, financed with AECID funds
and the Kuna Congress, a drawing contest was held for the covers of validated texts, with
The participation of boys and girls. This program also has among its guidelines that validation
of all texts and materials must be made with the active participation of children to
through micro classes and delivery of the material to see if they understand it or not.
House Workshop, who worked in the elaboration of stories, songs and legends, had as part
important in their methodology, the participation of boys and girls, who not only drew, but
They participated in the recreation of the stories.
While it is true that the plan did not contemplate the participation of boys and girls, you cannot forget
that the five -year plan responds to the recognition of the right of indigenous children of
have quality intercultural education.
33 The original methodological design of the previous evaluation The visit to educational centers with focal groups with children,
girls and adolescents in order to inquire about their participation in the design and execution of the plan. There was also
considered to make ethnographic observation on this subject. In the context of pandemic, these methodologies are not
They could do.

Question 2: Did the differentiated needs of girls and boys considered? In what
measure has been counted in the joint participation and equal conditions by girls
And children when planning and implementing the programs and projects implemented?
In the five -year plan, the differential needs of girls and boys are not addressed, and it has not been counted
with a joint participation when planning and implementing programs and projects.
The issue of gender equity in native peoples, is still a complex issue that has
that be also seen from an intercultural approach, which takes into account the indigenous worldview
that moves in terms of complementarity and solidarity. When asked in interviews
On this subject, the answers are:
“In our town there is no separation, it is a group work, it can be said that in traditions
And customs may be separation, but everything is teamwork. There was a job in sex education
that the General Congress handled. What is knowledge of traditions and customs, the part of how
Boys learn there are songs for boys and girls. If I was born a child, it is singing that it is a child and if it is born
Girl is sung what does girl ”(C-Co.37).
“It seems to me that even in the national gender agenda the concepts have not been developed since the
indigenous perspective and its diversity. Then gender concepts can have several categories.
That is something that an intercultural lens must also have, understanding individual rights. This
It has not been incorporated. They speak more of complementarity than of equity ”(I-CO-34).
“Gender and law is complex and special. There is little space for activities. I would say they have
to come in teaching from the teacher. Because in the end when they are small that cannot
Communicate because they don't speak the language there is a rights problem. Make visible that topic in
own teachers. In the classroom we all throw ourselves to the floor. We all play. There is no difference if they are girls
or children and there is permeating equity. ”(I-CO-31).
This is precisely what has not been contemplated in the plan, the need for a reflection process
that allows to identify if in that world of complementarity there are practices that are limiting to
men and women to have the same opportunities and make decisions according to their
particular needs for gender issues. Nowhere in the plan it is expected, for example,
Develop in study programs, in didactic support texts and materials, topics
related to gender violence, equity and human rights. In training processes
of teachers have not found content aimed at understanding the concept of
gender and their implication in the life of men and women, and then work with their
Students, boys and girls.
Some of the interviews account for the contribution that international cooperation has had in this
topic, advising so that the issue of equity is part of its programs.
“UNICEF has put us like the light on the gender issue, but we see it from the faith approach
and joy. Most teachers are women. We have had special attention to the subject of
Treatment of boys and girls during training processes. We influence adequacy
Halls from gender vision, and also under school conditions for personal hygiene of
Children and also in the care of children, also in the development of content, more
with the idea that the teams are also led by girls who have a voice to expose. If there is
Five girls and a boy among the Ngäbe the child has the voice because it is in the Ngäbe culture, we try to
change that. We also saw that the games are more oriented to the inclusion of girls, we have
57
spaces for child reading where boys and girls are combined, but we saw that the stories are
oriented more to the interests of children, we have to have readings that also interest the
Girls In training we make (teachers) that those who socialize children are
Women, they are the ones who transmit the language, have great value in cultural transmission. ”(I-CO-
28).
You cannot forget that education is one of the main means of socialization of relations
of power among genres to the detriment of girls/women, that the five -year plan has not taken it
IN ACCOUNT.
9. Conclusions
Effectiveness:
1. The implementation of the plan was not effective enough to get the EIB to develop
in the schools of the seven indigenous peoples and that the right of children can be fulfilled,
indigenous girls and adolescents to a quality education, with respect to their language and their culture.
The lack of development of the planned strategies and activities prevented programs
Curricular and EIB materials, personnel trained in management and teaching in EIB, systems of
monitoring and supervision of EIB schools and student evaluation; as well as guarantee
the institutional strengthening of the DNEIB and the regional regional directions. With
Exception of the budget requirement, the execution of the plan did not achieve any of the
planned products or the expected results.
2. The implementation of the plan was not assumed by Meduca, leaving in the DNEIB all the
responsibility for its execution, without providing this address of the necessary conditions in
regulations, human and financial resources that would allow him to lead a systematic process,
Organized and articulated with the different national and regional addresses, authorities
indigenous traditional and international cooperation.
Relevance:
3. The little clarity that the different responsible actors have about what education is
bilingual intercultural and its concrete implications in school work, influenced that
Activities, projects and programs did not respond sufficiently to children's rights,
girls and adolescents from the native peoples to a relevant and quality education. This
demanded an adequate response to changes in sociolinguistic scenarios, to
teacher training needs from a personal and technical dimension
pedagogical, as well as the articulation of the knowledge of the original peoples with the
School academic knowledge.
4. The scarce involvement in the formulation and implementation of the five -year plan of the
Leaders, leaders and traditional authorities of the seven native peoples have prevented collecting
your demands and needs and have your support in the dissemination and surveillance of development
of the plan, as well as in the achievement of its goals and objectives.
Efficiency:
5. Although the financial resources obtained for the implementation of the plan were 10% of the
Budget requirement, it was the first time that a plan prepared by the DNEIB achieved
Have a budget. However, DNEIB did not have the management capacity to prioritize
activities and results that allow proper, timely and efficient use of resources
58
Financials obtained, direct the actions of their human resources and use it as a counterpart with
Other financial sources.
6 Although international cooperation supported Meduca with various programs and
products mentioned in the five -year plan, no evidence was found that the plan was a
articulating tool that potentiates this contribution.
Sustainability:
7. The minimum conditions have not been guaranteed to ensure the sustainability of the actions
made in favor of the EIB during the five -year period, to the extent that a
organizational development articulated between the national and regional instances differences of the
Meduca, the strengthening of the technical teams of the national and regional instances,
and a context of political commitment of Meduca and the indigenous authorities in favor of the
Implementation of EIB.
Duties of childhood and gender equity:
8. The plan has not generated spaces for children and adolescents of the peoples
Original from Panama are heard and participate with relevant strategies in all that
that concerns them. Although the five -year plan went to make its right to an EIB effective
quality, they and they cannot only be receptors and need, together with their fathers and mothers,
be actively present in the recognition and demand of your rights.
9. Reflection and action on gender differences between boys and girls was not
present in the plan, being that the educational system is one of the main means of
Socialization of the lack of gender equity.
10. Lessons learned
1. The process of implementing a plan -oriented plan of the original peoples,
It requires the concerted action of the different directions of Meduca. While the EIB
It is still a marginal issue in Meduca and there is no interculturality policy for
All, which covers the entire educational system, runs the risk of maintaining the paradigm of
an official monocultural school, with its back to the diverse reality of the country, and limit the EIB to the
development of specific activities, disconnexes with each other, without a real impact on
indigenous and non -indigenous students.
2. An effective implementation of the five -year plan requires participation, coordination and
strategic and permanent articulation of different types of actors, and not only of the techniques
of the DNEIB so that it is involved from the plan of formulation of the plan to the authorities
traditional and other leaders and leaders of indigenous organizations, children and
adolescent and their fathers and mothers, as well as NGOs and international cooperation entities
that develop educational projects and programs in indigenous areas,
3. The development of an EIB five -year plan for the native peoples of Panama requires,
at least, that the different actors responsible for their implementation handle a
clear and agreed proposal on what is understood by EIB and what characteristics a
EIB school; and that they have the profile and capabilities necessary for their execution, as well as
The required budget.
4. To be relevant EIB proposals must respond to changes in the scenarios
sociolinguistic and in the demographic and social dynamics that are causing the
displacement of languages native to Spanish and growing migration to areas
Urban
5. The delay in the approval of standards has been a brake for the implementation of the EIB,
affecting the right of students to an education in their language and culture endorsed
59
by national and international laws and policies. However, the lack of the norm cannot
continue to be an excuse to stop the development of EIB proposals.
11. Recommendations
In view of the findings and conclusions indicated, the recommendations that the consulting team
presents, they are aimed at improving the efficacy, efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of the EIB
In Panama. The temporality of its execution due to its level of priority develops in the
Next section of traffic lights.
Institutionalization of EIB
1. The senior management of Meduca must ensure that EIB becomes a state policy
prioritized, which is implemented with a national plan progressively and systematic, with
goals, objectives, clear strategies and indicators and with a budget that allows its
Gradual implementation in all schools that serve indigenous students inside and outside
of the regions and of all educational levels.
2. EIB requires a regulatory framework that allows its operationalization and officialization. HE
suggests that Meduca accelerate the culmination of the entire regulatory package that has remained
In process and norm crucial aspects for the institutionalization of EIB: i) the regulations of
Law 88, ii) the proposals of elaborated resolved, and iii) the profiles of the different positions for
The EIB.
Contextualized and material curricula
3. Given the importance of having EIB curricular programs and study programs by
degree that facilitate the dialogue of knowledge and allow an intercultural treatment of the processes
of learning, it is necessary that the DNEIB and the Curriculum Directorate, together with the addresses
Regional Education and the traditional authorities of the regions, review the strategy
adopted to add subjects to the national curriculum, and analyze other alternatives, taking advantage of the
advances achieved. This requires the elaboration of new protocols for the design of the
curricular programs from an EIB approach that addresses indigenous and academic knowledge
schools in an articulated manner and a design plan for new materials that respond to said
programs.
Human Resources Training for EIB
4. It is suggested that the Directorate of Training and Teaching Improvement, in coordination with the
DNEIB, design a human resources training plan, with the support of institutions
State and private trainers for the initial and continuous training of teachers in EIB. This
Plan should also cover specialized training in school management and administration
for directors of educational centers and administration and management of the EIB for various
officials of the national and regional education system.
Differentiated attention in EIB and the treatment of languages
5. Considering the displacement process that are suffering from languages native to the
growing influence of the Spanish, it is suggested that Meduca through the DNEIB, review the
EIB Pedagogical Model that assumes that the original language is always the mother tongue (L1)
of the children of indigenous peoples and the Spanish the second language (L2). This requires the
Development of several models of EIB care and differentiated pedagogical tools.
The treatment and use of the two languages in school must respond to the existence of different
sociolinguistic scenarios, taking into account which is the L1 and the L2 of the students and the
level of domain they have of each one.

Indigenous participation
6. The role of traditional authorities, leaders and leaders of indigenous organizations is
crucial for the development of any educational plan or program within its territories. By

national, in such a way that there is sufficient resources for the implementation of the
EIB in indigenous regions and collective lands.
8. Given the need to maximize funds and human resources available for development
of the EIB; It is suggested that Meduca calls international cooperation in order to
Concentrate efforts oriented to the effective implementation of EIB based on a specific plan
and articulated in the territories of the 7 native peoples.
Organizational strengthening and national and regional technical teams
9. Meduca is suggested to elaborate a strategy of continuity of processes and actions
that they have been unfinished and that are necessary for attention with EIB to the
Indigenous students This implies articulating the plan's actions with the new project
of development of indigenous peoples, close to being initiated with bank loan
World and led by the Ministry of Government.
10. The implementation of the five -year plan and the development of EIB requires a solid team
and with strengthened capabilities both at the level of the DNEIB and the DRE. Therefore it is necessary
that the organizational structure of the Meduca is reviewed and coordination channels are improved
and articulation between the national and regional education directions as well as generating in the

EVALUATION OF THE INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION PLAN
BILINGUAL
Background and justification:
The Panamanian State has recognized five indigenous regions: Kuna Yala with a population
approximately 46,267 people (territory of 2,306 m2); Emberá́ Wunaan with a population
approximately 12,773 people (territory of 4,383 m2); Ngäbe buglé with an approximate population
of 219,302 people (territory of 6,968 m2); Kuna matugandí ́ with an approximate population of
3,305 people (territory of 2,318 m2); and Kuna Wargandí ́ with an approximate population of 1,133
people (territory of 775 m2). The languages spoken in these regions are the Ngäbere, the Teribe, the
Guna, Buglere and Bibri, which belong to the Chibchense linguistic family, and the Emberá and
The Woun Meu that belongs to the Linguistic Family Chocó.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Education for 2017, there are 17 schools in the Emberá́ region
Woounaan, 42 schools in the Kuna Yala region and 169 schools in the Ngäbe Buglé region. As soon as
To educational population, the statistics of the year 2018 suggest that there are 15,365 students in the region
Kuna Yala (86 teachers for preprimary, 335 for primary, 137 for Premedia and 62 for Media);
4,293 students in the Emberá́ Wouunaan region (28 teachers for pre-primary, 112 for primary school,
30 for Premedia and 18 for Media); and 80,746 students in the Ngäbe Buglé region (494 teachers
for preprimaria, 2541 for primary, 1168 for premedia and 610 for media).
According to the growing test carried out by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Panamá in the
Year 2016, 87.6% of third grade children in indigenous regions do not reach the basic level

National and international experts suggest that education in indigenous communities should

of EIB. First, indigenous communities are in rural areas and difficult to access. Others
problems are the insufficiency of bilingual teachers, the effective time of classes, the lack of
educational materials and texts with cultural relevance, the non -existent training programs and
pedagogical accompaniment and the low operational capacity for monitoring from the addresses

Object of the evaluation:
The purpose of this evaluation is the EIB 2014-2019 five-year plan prepared by the
Ministry of Education of the Republic of Panamá with the support of UNICEF. The plan is
In Annex 1 of these terms of reference.
The EIB five -year plan is not a unique intervention or program, but a strategy framework
To ensure that indigenous communities at the national level receive quality education. The SE Plan
focuses on writing and speech of the mother tongue. Includes educational strategies, training
Teacher, pedagogical accompaniment, curricular adaptations, production of texts and materials,
Legal frameworks, consultation, dissemination, monitoring and evaluation processes. These aspects are
Responsibility of the Bilingual Intercultural Education Directorate of the Ministry of Education in
Coordination with national directors of the same institution.
From 2014 to 2019, different government and non -governmental institutions have implemented
projects and strategies to achieve the scope of the objectives. However, these projects have not
been systematized and its impact is unknown. The plan does not present phases, budgets or
indicators, although results were expected in a period of 5 years.
The main beneficiaries are the educational communities of indigenous regions, specifically,
from the Ngäbe Buglé region, Emberá́-Wouunaan, Guna Yala, Guna Madugandí ́ and Guna Wargandí.́
With educational community we refer to traditional authorities, regional directors,
educational supervisors, directors of educational centers, classrooms, teachers, family and students.
The main actor is the Ministry of Education. UNICEF Panamá has also been a key actor
contributing to the generation of educational texts and materials developed with cultural relevance
(I.E., Story and Canto Books, and rag characters) and the diagnosis and elaboration of Action Plan
In 3 educational centers of the Ngäbe Buglé region for the implementation of an EIB program.
The Bilingual Intercultural Education Plan has no goals, indicators or a theory
of change for which the evaluators are expected to identify and present them in the
Product 1 (evaluation protocol). To this end, you must establish preliminary interviews with
key actors in the implementation of the EIB five -year plan, such as the Ministry of
Education through its higher office, the National Directorate of Intercultural Education
Bilingual, the National Directorate of Initial Education, the National Directorate of Curriculum, the
National Directorate of Teaching Improvement, considering exercise officials or that

of Ibero -American States and the Inter -American Development Bank, among others.
Purpose of the evaluation (why)
The EIB 2014-2019 five-year plan ends this year. However, there is no systematization
of what has been done, where it has been done and who has mostly benefited. More important
It is not clear if the EIB five -year plan was relevant (I.E., served its purpose) and what actions
They need to be taken in the next 5 years (2020-2025) to maintain the sustainability of the
Actions established so far.
The present is a formative and summative evaluation. It is formative because it intends to establish the
Efficacy, relevance, sustainability and efficiency of the plan. In other words, it aims to monitor the
Progress of the actions and projects implemented. At the same time, for being carried out at the end of the
Plan period (2014-2019), is also a summative evaluation because it intends to determine whether the

sum of the actions implemented allowed to achieve the expected results. It is intended then
respond to 1) progress (formative part) and 2) Final scope (summative part).
This evaluation is mainly carried out in order to achieve institutional learning and promotion
of future policies (2020-2025) that are guided by the knowledge generated in the five-year period
be evaluated. In other words, what is sought is to learn from the last five years to plan
future actions.
The evaluation is carried out at the precise moment: just at the end of the plan and at the time that a
New government administration must plan actions to ensure that EIB is
effectively implemented in indigenous communities nationwide. It would have been ideal
perform a medium-term evaluation (purely formative), but given its absence, the present
Evaluation intends to fulfill both purposes (formative and summative). It is intended that the results
of the evaluation allow to generate a new action plan with the necessary adjustments (I.E., new phase
implementation). For this, specific information on implemented programs is necessary
and its effectiveness to decide if your scaling proceeds.
In the evaluation methodology, the participation of rights holders is proposed (Right

EVALUATION OBJECTIVES:
The central objective of this evaluation is to take a balance of the results of the plan
Quinquenal de EIB 2014-2019. Specifically, it is sought:
• Determine the effectiveness of programs (I.E., Actions or projects) implemented within
of the EIB 2014-2019 five-year plan.
• Establish the relevance of the EIB QUINQUENAL PLAN 2014-2019 or, in other words,
Determine if you have responded to national needs.
• Evaluate the sustainability of the actions implemented and make suggestions for a new
plan.
• Establish the efficiency of the government budget and international organizations for
achieve the objectives of the plan.
Evaluation scope:
This evaluation has a national scope, so it is expected to systematize the
carried out in the EIB five -year plan in all indigenous communities, for level
primary and secondary and for all possible counterparts (Ministry of Education and
addresses involved, international organizations, community organizations and
NGOs). The plan will be evaluated in its entirety from beginning to end (2014 to 2019). The evaluation
It aims to collect as much information about efficiency, relevance,
sustainability and efficiency. For this, the participation of a different group of
actors, including children and adolescents, the educational community (directors
regional, supervisors, directors of centers, teachers and parents),
Implementing organizations and guiding institutions.

Evaluation frame:
This evaluation must be designed to respond to criteria of effectiveness, relevance,
Sustainability and efficiency defined by DAC-OCDE1. Efficacy refers to measuring the degree to which
The plan reached its objectives. Relevance refers to the degree to which the plan was appropriate to
priorities and policies of the beneficiary group. Sustainability refers to whether the benefits of
Activity have the potential to continue once the plan is over. Efficiency refers to measure
in that resources/supplies (funds, time, equipment) have been invested in a cost-effective manner. Of
transverse way, human rights approaches must be evaluated (including the rights of the
childhood), of gender equality and equity.
To evaluate the aforementioned criteria, it is suggested that the evaluation design responds to the
following questions:
Effectiveness:
1. To what extent were the objectives of the EIB Quinquenal Plan meet?
2. What aspects influenced the achievement or non -achievement of the objectives?
3. How was coordination between international cooperation and the Ministry of Education for
achieve the objectives of the plan?
4. What was the role of the Bilingual Intercultural Education Directorate of the Ministry of Education
in achieving the objectives of the plan?
5. To what extent initial training and continuous training offered to teachers in areas
regional was appropriate and sufficient to achieve the achievements of the plan?
6. Is there a monitoring and evaluation system of the plan that allows the monitoring of the goals
for decision making? What have been its eventual weaknesses and challenges?
Relevance:
1. To what extent did the objectives of the EIB five -year plan were valid for the
national and regional context?
2. To what extent did the activities, projects and programs consisting with
The objectives and goals of the plan?
3. To what extent did activities, projects and programs respond to
needs of the beneficiaries?
4. What was the participation of indigenous communities during planning
of the plan?
Sustainability:
1. Have you managed to generate institutional capacity in indigenous regions for the sustainability of
Plan actions
2. To what extent a centralized governance model allowed (or not) the scope of the objectives
of the plan?
3. To what extent can the impacts achieved be sustained over time?
4. What adaptations do governance, monitoring and evaluation systems require to ensure
The sustainability of the plan?
5. What are the necessary activities in the next 5 years to ensure the sustainability of the
Long -term plan?
Efficiency:
1. Were the resources invested for the implementation of the plan?
2. How efficient was the investment of international cooperation to achieve the results
expected?
69
3. To what extent were human resources suitable to achieve the objectives?
Children's rights:
1. Was the participation and voice of children and adolescents included during the
implementation and refinement of programs and projects?
Gender and equity equality:
1. Were the differentiated needs of girls and boys considered?
2. To what extent has the joint participation and equal terms
part of girls and boys when planning and implementing programs and projects
implemented?
The evaluators must complete an evaluation matrix (see Annex 2) where explain how
Each evaluation question will measure, through which indicators, with what methods and sources.
METHODOLOGY:
The proposed methodology is mixed, including the use of quantitative and qualitative techniques. HE
Wait a systematization of actions (programs, projects and activities) under the five -year plan
of EIB 2014-2019 to determine efficacy, relevance, sustainability and efficiency.
Data collection is expected using three techniques: 1) Secondary data analysis and
documents, 2) interviews with implemers and 3) focal groups and surveys with guarantors of
Rights and the educational community. It is expected that at first the

the triangulation of the results through constant feedback processes with the
participants. Interviews and focal groups must be verbatim and analyzed in NVIVO.
Surveys must be processed in SPSS or Stata.
The evaluators must identify the key actors to interview to achieve national coverage in
The evaluation of the plan. A model to analyze the implementation must also be chosen. By
Example, the implementation quality model or Qif2 is proposed. This model uses four stages
of analysis: 1) initial considerations about the implementation context, 2) creation of a
Implementation structure, 3) maintenance of the structure while the
Implementation and 4) Improvements for future applications. In the first stage, issues such as
needs and resources, the relevance of the plan, the ability of organizations,
possibilities for adapting programs, support of communities and recruitment of the
Staff are evaluated. In the second stage, the implementation equipment and the implementation plan
of each programmatic action is evaluated. In the third stage, supervision, monitoring and
Feedback mechanisms are evaluated. Finally, in the fourth stage the evaluators must

Certain limitations are foreseen during the evaluation. First, the EIB non -non -quinquenal plan
It was widely disseminated, so the different international organizations, NGOs and
community organizations have taken actions not necessarily framed within the
proposed goals. It is important, then, the identification and systematization of activities
made in these last 5 years.

Tool American Journal of Community Psychology, 50 (3-4), 481-496.
To mitigate this limitation, the continuous accompaniment of the Ministry of Education will be necessary
through the academic vice ministry and the direction of EIB to guide the identification of said
Actions.
Second, the evaluation occurs at a time of government transition. The authorities
responsible for implementing actions in the last 5 years may not be found in the same
government positions. To mitigate this limitation, close coordination will be necessary with
academic institutions (such as you) who can identify actors that are no longer present
in government management but that can offer relevant feedback.
Third, the evaluation is of a plan implemented nationwide. Evaluation is intended

months for the realization of this evaluation contemplating the delays that may arise in the
Ethical review process.
Evaluation standards and ethical considerations:
The evaluation will have to be aligned with the standards and standards of evaluation of the nations
Joined3 and will have an external and independent character and will be carried out in an objective way,
impartial, open and participatory, based on empirically verified evidence that is valid and
reliable.
The ethical principles that will guide the evaluation are those of independence, impartiality, credibility,
Responsibility, honesty and integrity4. It is also essential that the evaluators maintain
respect for the dignity and diversity of the people who are interviewed and who consider in everything
The evaluation process respecting human rights, equity and gender equality5. It must

assessment.
The evaluation must also comply with the UNICEF procedure in terms of ethical standards

2. Translation of the traditional web forms survey: These forms were created through
of Limesurvey software. At first, the consent signature of
The respondents with the Limesurvey Plugin - Signature plugin. However, in the process of
validation was evident that this made it difficult to carry out the survey for problems of
connectivity Therefore, information about the use and
