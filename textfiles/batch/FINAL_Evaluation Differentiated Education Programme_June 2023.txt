1. INTRODUCTION
This evaluation report presents findings from the UNICEF Suriname Formative Evaluation of the From Classroom
to Differentiated Education Programme: Improving Enrolment, Learning and Transition from Frontal to
Differential Learning (2018–2022) that was conducted by the author of this report, Dr. Robin Haarr (PhD), Professor
and UNICEF Senior Consultant. This evaluation was commissioned and managed by the UNICEF Suriname Country
Office (CO), in close coordination with the UNICEF Latin American and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO). This
evaluation was conducted between December 2022 and June 2023.
The purpose of this formative evaluation is to assess to what extent the programme entitled, ‘Improving enrolment
and learning: Transition from frontal teaching to differentiated learning (hereinafter referred to as the
Differentiated Education Programme) was successful in improving the performance of the Education Foundation of
the Moravian Church (SOEBGS) schools in Suriname. The Programme was developed to strengthen teacher training
programmes to build teachers’ knowledge, capacities and skills to apply more innovative teaching methods in the
classroom, which would improve student learning, outcomes and academic performance. Trained teachers should
be able to effectively integrate these innovative teaching methods into the classroom in a more holistic manner,
and use different teaching styles and approaches to teach students with different learning styles and abilities.5 This
evaluation is also focused on learning more about enabling factors, bottlenecks and challenges, as inputs for learning
and future actions for improving and scaling up the Programme.
The Programme was funded by UNICEF with civil society organization (CSO) partner contributions (i.e., SOEBGS).
The Programme cost a total of USD 89,728, of which UNICEF contributed a total of USD 81,356 and the CSO
contribution was USD 8,373.6 Because the Programme was funded by UNICEF as a thematic initiative versus by
external donor monies, programme-related documents were limited in number, as there were no specific external
donor reporting requirements. Nevertheless, programme-related documents that were available were reviewed
and used to design the evaluation methodology and data collection tools, and draft this Inception and Final
Evaluation Reports.
The Programme was initially planned to be implemented from 1 August 2018 to 31 December 2020, but it was
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic which began in March 2020.7 To date, the Programme continues to be
implemented by the 56 SOEBGS primary schools.
The intended uses of this evaluation is to inform ongoing implementation of the Programme in SOEBGS primary
schools. Thus, this evaluation offers evidence-based recommendations for further improvement of the Programme
and the potential for scaling it up to other grades and schools, and to inform national teacher training programmes.
This evaluation offers strategic guidance to UNICEF on how to sharpen its focus areas of support to SOEBGS and
MINOWC for mainstreaming differentiated teaching and learning approaches in education, and the overall approach
to quality education.
The target audience, including primary expected users of this evaluation is UNICEF SCO, SOEBGS and MINOWC.
This evaluation will also be of interest to partner UN agencies and international financial institutions/donors that
contribute to UNICEF results and wider UN system commitments, intended outcomes and efforts on the realization
of children’s rights and wider human rights commitments, including equitable access to quality education and
improvement to learning skills and outcomes.

7 On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. Subsequently, on 13
March 2020, Suriname announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 and closed its borders. On 16 March 2020, all schools
were closed to prevent a further spread of COVID-19. The closure of schools had a notable negative impact on the ability of
schools and teachers to ensure all children have access to distance education and remote learning. Although the COVID-19
pandemic continued throughout 2020 and into 2022, schools in Suriname were able to open in October 2020 with protective
measures, yet temporary closures did occur as needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the spread of COVID-19
continued to interrupt the delivery of education and student learning.

Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards.11
1.1. Structure of the Report
The report includes multiple sections. The evaluation begins with an overview of the country context and the
educational system. This is followed by an overview of the UNICEF-supported From Classroom to Differentiated
Education Programme. The next section offers a description of the evaluation methodology. This section describes
the purpose and objectives of the evaluation, evaluation criteria and questions, data collection methods and tools,
ethical considerations and protocols, data management and analysis, and reporting and validation of findings and
recommendations laid out in this report.
The next section presents the evaluation findings related to each of the four Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee’s (DAC) criteria12 – relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability – and cross-cutting issues of equity, gender equality and human rights.
This section offers an analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected in the field during this evaluation,
and uses this data to answer each of the evaluation questions related to the evaluation criteria.
This evaluation report ends with a section focused on conclusions, lessons learned and recommendations from this
evaluation. This section presents conclusions that are derived from the findings and present a picture of the
strengths and limitations of the Programme as it relates to the Programme's goal, objective and aims, and the

2. OVERVIEW OF THE COUNTRY CONTEXT AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
The Republic of Suriname lies on the north-eastern Atlantic coast of South America, bordered by French Guiana to
the east, Brazil to the south and Guyana to the west. Suriname is one of the smallest countries in South America
with an area of 163,820 km. Suriname is considered a Small Island Developing State (SIDS). Despite being located
on the mainland, as a low-lying coastal country, Suriname faces development challenges similar to small island
nations, such as limited resources, environmental fragility, high costs of transportation and energy, and vulnerability
to climate change and natural disasters.13
Suriname is also recognized as the most forested country in the world. In 2020, 97 percent14 of land was reported
to be forest area, of which 93 percent of the territory is covered by the Amazon rainforest. This creates distinctive
differences between the sparsely populated interior and the more populated coastal areas of the country.15
Suriname is a small, upper middle-income country with an estimated population of 612,985 in 2021; an estimated
35 percent of the population were children aged 0-19 years.16 Suriname is one of the most ethnically diverse
national and multilingual societies in Latin America and the Caribbean with population groups originating from
African, Amerindian, Indian, Javanese, Chinese, European and multiracial backgrounds. The largest ethnic groups
are East Indians17 (37 percent), Creole18 (31 percent) and Javanese19 (15 percent).20 Suriname is also home to four
distinct indigenous groups which comprise up to five percent of the population, and six tribal communities, known
was Maroons, which comprise up to 10 percent of the population.21

Most of the population is concentrated along the northern coastal zone areas; whereas the interior is sparsely
inhabited.22 An estimated 65 percent of the population live in urban areas with more than half the population living
in and around Paramaribo, the capital city. Thirty-five percent of the population lives in rural areas, including the
interior.
2.1. Economic Growth and Human Development
Suriname is a member of the CARICOM-Caribbean Community (CARICOM), a regional intergovernmental
organization that promotes and supports a unified Caribbean Community that is inclusive, resilient and
competitive.23 According to the World Bank, Suriname is an upper-middle income country24 with a Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of USD of 2.98 billion in 2021, down from a GDP of 4.02 billion in 2019 (prior to the COVID-19
pandemic).25 In 2020, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Suriname experienced a 16.0 percent annual decrease
in GDP from 2019, which saw a 1.2 percent annual increase in GDP.26 In 2021, Suriname’s economy recovered
somewhat from the global pandemic, but still faced a 2.7 percent annual decrease in GDP.27 In 2022, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected a 1.3 percent annal increase in GDP.28
The Human Development Report 2021/202229 presents Human Development Index (HDI) values30 for 191 countries
and territories with the most recent data for 2021. The HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in key
dimensions of human development, including: the ability to lead a long and healthy life, measured by life expectancy
at birth; the ability to acquire knowledge, measured by mean years of schooling for adults 25 years of age and older,
and expected years of school; and the ability to achieve a decent standard of living, measured by gross national
income per capita. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are aggregated into a composite index using a
geometric mean and a ranking provided.31
Table 2.1 shows 2021 HDI values32 for Suriname.33 Scores for the three HDI dimension indices are aggregated into
a composite index using a geometric mean and a ranking provided.34 In 2021, Suriname was classified as ‘high’ on
the HDI, positioning at 99 out of 191 countries and territories. For comparison purposes, similar data are presented
for Latin America and the Caribbean and High HDI countries.

healthy life, measured by life expectancy at birth; the ability to acquire knowledge, measured by mean year of schooling and
expected years of school; and the ability to achieve a decent standard of living, measured by gross national income per capita.

To measure human development more comprehensively, the Human Development Report 2021/2022 presents the
Gender Development Index (GDI), which compares female and male achievements on HDI values, and the Gender
Inequality Index (GII), which highlights women’s empowerment as it relates to reproductive health, education,
political representation and the labour market.35 The GDI is calculated for 167 countries. Globally, disadvantages
facing females are a major source of gender inequality and one of the greatest barriers to human development
progress.
In 2021, the female HDI value for Suriname was 0.728, in contrast to 0.727 for males, resulting in a GDI value of
1.001, placing the country into Group 1 of countries with high equality in GDI achievements. In addition, Suriname
has a GII value of 0.427, ranking it 105 out of 191 countries on the GII.36
In 2016-2017, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in cooperation with the Central Bank of Suriname and
Suriname’s Energy Company, implemented the Suriname Survey of Living Conditions37 and established poverty lines
(in SRD per adult person) for Paramaribo, the coastal area and rural interior. Based upon these different poverty
lines, it was estimated that 1.7 percent of the population lives in extreme poverty or indigence, 26.2 percent live in
overall poverty (may be interpreted as living in survival mode) and 47.9 percent of people living in the rural interior
are poor. 38 Chart 2.1 shows that poverty and indigence rates vary significantly across districts. Poverty rates are
highest in Sipaliwini, (51.7 percent), Para (44.0 percent), Marowjine (40.2 percent) and Saramacca (38.3 percent);
whereas indigence rates are highest in Brokopondo (25.9 percent), Sipaliwini (15.8 percent) and Marowjine (11.8
percent).39

Transforming World. UNDP: New York, NY, USA.
36 As it relates to the GII dimension indices, only 29.4 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women in Suriname (SDG 5.5).
In addition, 69.9 percent of adult women aged 25 years and older had reached at least a secondary level of education,
compared to 70.7 percent of adult males (SDG 4.4). Also, the female labour force participation (aged 15 years and older) was
43.4 percent, compared to 65.1 percent for males aged 15 years and older. Also, in 2017, for every 100,000 live births, 120
women die from pregnancy-related causes (SDG 3.1), and the adolescent birth rate is 56.1 births per 1,000 women of aged 15-
19 (SDG 3.7); Ibid, 2022.

More recently, the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 202240, based upon 2018 survey data, it was estimated
that 6.7 percent of population was in multidimensional poverty and 4.0 percent were vulnerable to
multidimensional poverty. Contributions of deprivation to overall multidimensional poverty included education
(43.8 percent), standard of living (35.8 percent) and health (20.4 percent).
Poverty is clearly a problem in Suriname, even though the country has reached a level of development that should
allow a significant proportion of the poor to escape poverty. A considerable amount of poverty derives from
inequalities. Poverty is also at the heart of vulnerability, social discrimination and exclusion, including limited access
to education, health care and other basic and essential services. Households with inadequate incomes are more
vulnerable to changing economic and social circumstances and to reduced income-earning potential.
Child poverty is a problem which national experts have given much attention to because it threatens the future of
national economic and social development objectives. In 2013, 41 percent of children in Suriname were
multidimensionally poor.41 Poverty and living in Amazon’s interior are aggravating factors for other social problems,
including early marriage and pregnancy among girls. In recent years, UNICEF supported an analysis of
multidimensional child poverty in Suriname.42 Although findings from this analysis were not available at the time of
this evaluation, the analysis of multidimensional child poverty has since been completed and is due to be published
in the near future.
It is well documented that children often bear the burden of poverty and poor children are frequently left behind
when it comes to fulfilling their rights. Child poverty limits children’s access to vital resources, including nutrition,
clean water, sanitation, health care, early childhood education and social services; preventing children from

achieving their full potential. In addition, families living below the poverty line are not provided with adequate safety
nets and services to ensure that their children have the same opportunities as wealthier children. The CRC entitles
children to an adequate standard of living, reiterating that growing up poor violates their rights, and highlights
multiple dimensions of well-being related to survival, development, protection and participation.
Given the importance of children to the future of Suriname, it is essential that policymakers address poverty,
particularly if they do not want children living in conditions of poverty to be compromised by poor health, limited
education and reduced employment opportunities, and to ensure that these patterns are not replicated for future
generations of children.43
2.2. National Commitments to Development and Human Rights
Suriname has ratified core international human rights conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the
International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESC), as well as the Millennium Declaration and
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As a signatory, the Government of Suriname has prioritized
improving access to and the quality of health, education, child protection and social services for children and families
in need, including social inclusion of persons with disabilities.
Since ratifying the CRC in 1993, Suriname has made significant progress in ensuring compliance of its legal and policy
frameworks to ensure children’s access to education and to improve the quality of education. In 2018, UNICEF
launched the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and Education Analysis for Global Learning and Equity (MICS-EAGLE)
Initiative with the objective of supporting governments to improve learning outcomes and equity issues in education
by addressing two critical education data problems – gaps in key education indicators and lack of effective data
utilization by the Government and education stakeholders. Thus, the MICS-EAGLE was designed to support an
education sector situation analysis and sector plan development by building national capacity, and leveraging
education data collected by MICS. The MICS-EAGLE builds on the global foundation provided by MICS to yield
insights at the national, regional and global levels about ways to ensure that each child can reach his/her full
potential by reducing barriers to opportunity.
Data generated from the MICS-EAGLE Initiative has increased knowledge generation as to the nature, extent and
dynamics of education and learning outcomes in Suriname, as well as equity issues and child protection in education.
Knowledge and information generated from the MICS-EAGLES in Suriname contributed to the development of the
Programme, and challenges faced and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic informed modifications to
the Programme, as school had to shift to distance education and learning.
UNICEF MICS-EAGLE assisted UNICEF SCO to engage in policy dialogue and programme planning with the
Government of Suriname (GoS) to ensure that all children, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, enjoy
their rights of a quality education and the opportunity develop to their full potential in an equitable, inclusive and
protective society. This agenda is in line with Suriname’s national priorities and UNICEF Guyana and Suriname
Country Programme Documents for 2017-2021 and 2022-2016, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets
and indicators in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.44
2.3. Educational System
In Suriname, the Government and the Roman Catholic and Moravian Churches provide education for kindergarten
through secondary school. It is notable that nearly 50 percent of the schools are faith-based, yet subsidized by
MINOWC and managed by the several religious organizations. In the interior of Suriname, the SOEBGS owns and
manages the majority of primary schools.
The educational system consists of pre-school, primary school, junior and senior secondary schools, and vocational
and tertiary education. Pre-school is a two-year programme for children ages four and five, and is usually housed in
a primary school. Currently pre-school is not compulsory. Compulsory primary school consists of Grades 1 to 6 for
children ages 6-12. Completion of primary school is determined by examinations conducted nationwide at the end
43 Ibid.
44 Retrieved on 15 January 2023 from: The Sustainable Development Agenda - United Nations Sustainable Development
7
of Grade 6. The national examinations are used for placement at secondary school, and monitoring and
identification of students who may be ‘at risk’ of not achieving educational outcomes. Children enter lower
secondary school at 12 years of age and upper secondary education starts at 16 years of age; neither lower nor
upper secondary education are compulsory. Lower secondary school grades are referred to as Grade 1 to Grade 4,
and upper secondary school also includes Grade 1 to Grade 4.45
Suriname’s basic educational curriculum is partly out of date; however, MINOWC aims to reform the education
system and related legislation which dates back to the 1960s when Suriname was a Dutch colony. Reforms aims to
increase compulsory schooling for children aged 4-16, and increase compulsory education up to Grade 10.46
In the educational system, there is an ad hoc system of strengthening teaching skills and training teachers. In
general, however, the teaching methods can be categorized as being ineffective given the high repetition rates.47
In fact, in the Caribbean region, Suriname has the highest number of repeaters (e.g., 20 percent of students in grade
1 of the primary school are repeaters); thus, teacher training courses have yet to lead to a significant improvement
in school performance. Moreover, teachers are insufficiently trained to provide a differentiated approach to learning,
which responds to class dynamics and the situation, talents and learning differences of students. By sticking to a
rigidly prescribed lesson plan, teachers are not sufficiently responsive to differences among students; thus, not all
students have an equal opportunity to excel in school and everyday life.48
In the sections that follow, data related to access to education, and learning and skills development are presented
and described to provide a context in which the Programme being evaluated was implemented. It was not clear
from Programme documents that these data were utilized to inform the development of the Programme, however,
they are relevant to the context in which the Programme was implemented.
2.3.1. Access to Education
Access to quality education is one of the most effective interventions to empower children and adolescents with
the skills to function in and contribute to society. Access to education has broad effects on children and adolescents’
development and well-being, including physical and mental health, social development and civic engagement.
Access to quality education is a vital prerequisite for combating poverty, and protection from hazardous and
49
exploitative practices.
With the adoption of the SDGs, the GoS has committed to achieving universal completion of primary and secondary
education by 2030, and a greater focus on inclusiveness in education, including gender parity. It is notable that the
primary education completion rate in Suriname is comparable with the average primary education completion rate
for Caribbean Small States, yet lower than the average for Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Bear in
mind, however, that Suriname does not have an automatic system of promotion from one grade to another.
2.3.2. School Enrolment
Chart 2.2 shows the primary school gross enrolment rate (GER) for children of primary school age from 2016-2020.
The GER has declined from 116 percent in 2016 to 101 percent in 2020, with little variation by gender. A GER can
exceed 100 percent in situations where many children enter school late or repeat a grade. In addition, Chart 2.3
shows the adjusted primary school net enrolment rate (NER)50 for 2016-2018. In 2018, 86 percent of children of
primary school age were enrolled in primary schools. The NER varied little by gender, although there was a three-
percentage point difference in favour of girls in 2018. Since the NER excludes overage and underage students, it
more accurately captures the education’s system coverage and internal efficiency than the GER; however, it is useful
to see differences between the GER and NER.

In 2018, MICS data found that children in urban (97 percent) and rural coastal areas (96 percent) were slightly more
likely to attend primary school, compared to children in the rural interior (94 percent). In addition, children in the
richest (98 percent) and middle (99 percent) wealth quintiles were more likely to attend primary school than
children in the poorest households (93 percent).

Upon completion of primary school, some students join the work force, while others continue their education at a
secondary institution. Secondary education is divided into four years of lower secondary education and two to four
years of upper secondary education. In 2021, 71 percent of children of secondary school-age were enrolled in
secondary schools, down from 82 percent in 2018. In 2021, the GER varied by gender, with a 14-percentage point
difference in favour of girls (78 percent) over boys (64 percent).
In 2018, MICS data found that 62 percent of children
aged 12-15 years attended lower secondary schools. Table 2.2. Lower secondary NER (adjusted), 2018

2.3.3. Completion Rates
Ensuring that all girls and boys complete primary and secondary education is a target of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. Charts 2.4 and 2.5 shows the completion rates51 for primary and lower secondary levels
of education for 2016-2020. Chart 2.4 reveals that the primary education completion rate declined from 88 percent
in 2016 to 80 percent in 2021. Over time, the primary education completion rate has been consistently higher for
females than males (i.e., 14-percentage points higher in 2021). The decline in completion rates in 2021 is most likely
51 UNESCO defines the completion rate as the percentage of a cohort of children or young people ages three to five years
above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who completed that grade

due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s education, including school closures and learning
modality changes, and challenges faced by teachers and students with teaching and learning during the pandemic.

In 2018, the MICS measured completion rates by level of education.52 MICS data revealed, on average, that 85
percent of children completed a primary education. Completion rates declined steeply at higher levels of education,
with only 49 percent of all children completing lower secondary education and 23 percent completing upper
secondary education. This implies that compared to primary education, lower and upper secondary education has
higher rates of dropout, grade repetition or delayed conclusion which results in lower completion rates.53
MICS data found serious area disparities in education completion rates. Completion rates for primary education
were much higher in urban (89 percent) and rural costal (86 percent) areas, and lowest in the rural interior (62
percent). Similarly, completion rates for lower secondary education were highest in urban areas (53 percent) and
lowest in the rural interior (15 percent). In terms of upper secondary education, completion rates were highest in
urban (23 percent) and rural coastal areas (19 percent), but non-existent in the rural interior. Across all levels of
education, the rural interior has the lowest education completion rates; this, in part, is because there no upper
secondary schools in rural interiors areas.54 Areas in and around Paramaribo have the highest education completion
rates at all levels of education; even higher than the national average.55
52 Similar to UNESCO, the MICS defines the completion rate as the percentage of a cohort of children or young people ages
three to five years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who completed that grade.

In 2081, across all three levels of education – primary, lower and upper secondary – females have higher completion
rates than males and the national average. There is a notable decline in completion rates for both males (39-
percentage point decline) and females (32-percentage point declined) from primary to lower secondary education.56
Socio-economic disparities influence education completion rates. Across all levels of education, completion rates
are highest among children in the richest households and lowest among children in the poorest households; to the
extent that children in the richest households were three times more likely to complete a lower secondary education
than children in the poorest households.57
Children who do not complete school at primary and secondary levels are most likely to be Maroon; Maroons
comprise 10 percent of the population. The 2018 MICS found that 56 percent of children who do not complete
primary school were Maroon. Maroon were 14 times more likely not to complete primary school compared to
Javanese (4 percent), nine times more likely to not complete primary school compared to Indigenous/Amerindians
(6 percent), and four times more likely to not complete primary school compared to Hindustani (15 percent) and
Creole (14 percent). Similarly, Maroons were most likely not to complete lower secondary education (33 percent)
and upper secondary education (28 percent).58 These patterns can be explained in large part by the fact that
Maroons tend to live in the rural interior, where they face poverty and infrastructure challenges, such as lack of
electricity, internet and schools. Children from the rural interior who aim to attend lower secondary school typically
need to move to another village/city and travel long distances by boat to reach lower secondary schools; there are
no upper secondary schools in the rural interior.59
2.3.4. Grade Repetition
Grade repetition rates represent the proportion of pupils who remain in the same grade in the following school
year. Repeating a grade reflects the internal efficiency of educational systems. Repetition is one of the key indicators
for analysing and projecting pupil flows from grade-to-grade within educational systems. In Suriname, repetition
rates vary widely from each grade of primary (P1-P6), lower secondary (LS1-LS4) and upper secondary (US1-US4)
education. Chart 2.6 shows that at the primary level, the repetition rate is highest at Grade 6 (23 percent), and at
the lower secondary level, the repetition rate is highest at Grade 4 (31 percent). Grade repetition continues at the
60
upper secondary level, with repetition rates highest in Grade 1 (24 percent) and 2 (19 percent).

In 2018, MICS data revealed that males (56 percent) were more likely to repeat grades than females (44 percent).

2.3.5. School Dropout
School dropout rates reflects the proportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year
who are no longer enrolled in the following school year. Premature exiting measures the phenomenon of pupils
from a cohort leaving school without completion, and its effect on the internal efficiency of educational systems.
School dropout is a key indicator for analysing and projecting pupil flows from grade-to-grade within the educational
cycle.63
Dropout rates vary at the primary (P1-P6), lower secondary (LS1-LS4) and upper secondary (US1-US4) levels. In
contrast with repetition rates, dropout rates are all at or below 3 percent at the primary level, but show a clearer
pattern increasing consistently at each grade in lower and upper secondary education (Chart 2.7). At the lower
secondary level, dropout rates ranged from 8 to 13 percent depending upon grade, and was highest at Grade 4
(LS4). At the upper secondary level, dropout rates increased even more, reaching 49 percent of students at Grade 4
64
(US4). Students who dropout at Grade 4 (US4) do not move on to tertiary education. Most dropouts abandon
school after attending a grade in lower secondary education (51 percent).65

In 2018, MICS data revealed that males (48 percent) and females (52 percent) were nearly equally likely to dropout.
Dropouts were more likely to be in urban areas (75 percent), compared to rural coastal (16 percent) and rural
interior areas (9 percent); this is most likely because dropout rates are higher at the lower and upper secondary
levels and most secondary schools are in urban areas. Dropouts were also more likely to be in the poorest household
66
(22 percent), although a significant proportion of dropouts were also in the richest households (17 percent).
Dropouts were highest among Maroons (33 percent) and Hindustani (22 percent).67
2.3.6. Equitable Access to Education
In Suriname, special needs education is provided for students whose needs cannot be met in mainstream schools.
This does not include exceptional or gifted students who may also have special educational needs. There are 36
schools for children with disabilities, including 24 at the primary school level (20 in urban areas, three in rural coastal
areas and one in the rural interior) and 12 at the secondary school level (nine in urban areas and three in rural
coastal areas).68

Children with disabilities who get high enough marks can transfer to mainstream secondary school, for further
education or vocational training. The challenge, however, is that teachers at secondary schools do not typically have
the skills needed to integrate children with disabilities into their classrooms and to accommodate their special
needs. As a result, many parents end up removing their children from the mainstream schools and bring them back
to the special schools for children with disabilities. Unfortunately, mainstream schools do not do a good job of
preparing teachers or students to welcome children with disabilities into their classrooms and to understand their
needs; as a result, children with disabilities are at increased risk of experiencing bullying and discrimination in
mainstream schools.69
Another challenge facing special schools for children with disabilities is that the teacher training colleges do not
prepare teachers to specialize in special education for children with disabilities. Nearly two decades ago the teacher
training colleges did offer a specialization in special education; however, that programme has since been eliminated.
Thus, finding teachers with an interest and expertise in teaching children with disabilities is a challenge for special
schools for children with disabilities. Thus, many teachers hired to teach in special schools for children with
disabilities end up receiving on the job training, on how to effectively communicate and teach children with
disabilities, and how to cope with and support them in their social and emotional learning. Some teachers must also
learn sign language on the job.70
In Suriname, only 14 percent of children ages 5–17 have at least one functional difficulty (i.e., a difficulty in any of
the following functional domains: sensory, movement, cognitive or emotional/behavioural). Children with
functional difficulties are over-represented among children not learning and out-of-school at both primary and
71
lower secondary school levels. At the upper secondary school level, only six percent of out-of-school children had
a functional difficulty. These patterns can likely be explained by the fact that children with functional difficulties stay
72
in school longer (more years), but not necessarily attending the right level of education in relation to their age.
The prevalence of functional difficulties is similar for boys (15 percent) and girls (12 percent), and among children
ages 5-14 (14 percent) and 15-17 years (11 percent). There is an apparent relationship between area and socio-
economic status and functional difficulties. Most notable, children ages 5-17 living in the rural interior (20 percent)
were more likely to have functional difficulties, compared to children living in rural coastal (15 percent) and urban
areas (12 percent). In addition, children in the poorest household (18 percent) are more likely to have functional
difficulties than children in the richest households (8 percent). The most common functional difficulties in Suriname
are emotional/ behavioural, including anxiety (4 percent), controlling behaviours (4 percent) and accepting change
73
(3 percent).
Children with functional difficulties attend school at very similar rates as children without functional difficulties.
There are, however, some gaps in attendance one-year prior to the start primary education (83 percent) and in
primary education (94 percent), compared to children without functional difficulties (96 percent). Similarly, there
74
are some gaps in attendance at the lower secondary level (53 percent and 62 percent, respectively).
There are no notable differences in repetition rates between children with and without functional difficulties. At
the primary level, 17 percent of children with functional difficulties repeated their last grade of primary school,
compared to 10 percent of children without functional difficulties. At the lower secondary level, 26 percent of
children with functional difficulties repeated a grade, compared to 20 percent of children without functional
75
disabilities.
In terms of learning, school environments seem less prepared to accommodate children with functional difficulties,
who still do not fare as well as their peers. Only 34 percent of children with functional difficulties have foundational
reading skills, compare to 49 percent of children without functional difficulties. The gap in foundational numeracy

is even larger. Children without functional difficulties (26 percent) were more likely to have numeracy skills than
76
children with functional difficulties (18 percent).
2.3.7. Trained Teachers
A trained teacher is one who has received at least the minimum organized pedagogical teacher training pre-service
and in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in Suriname. Training of teachers can have a great impact
on student learning outcome; yet this only happens when the teachers apply new knowledge and skills in their
classroom.77
Chart 2.8 shows that the proportion of trained teachers has remained high at the pre-primary and primary school
levels from 2016-2021; however, at the lower secondary level, only 82 percent of teachers were trained in 2021. At
the upper secondary level, the proportion of trained teachers was even lower at 50 percent in 2015; data are not
available for 2016-2021.78 There are far fewer trained teachers at the secondary level because there is a lack of
college faculty who can teach specialized subjects to college students and there is a lack of teachers trained on
specialized subjects; these two issues are coupled and there has been no education policy develop to resolve this
issue or gap.79

2.3.8. Skills and Learning Outcomes
In 2018, on average, only 47 percent of children ages 7-14 had the expected reading skills and 25 percent had the
expected numeracy skills for their grade. Chart 2.9 shows that the share of children with foundational reading and
numeracy skills has increased by grade; however, a significant proportion of children in each grade did not have the
foundational skills expected for their grade.80 For instance, in Grade 1, only 21 percent of children had foundational
reading skills and four percent had numeracy skills expected for that grade. By Grade 3, only 35 percent of children
had reading skills and 20 percent had numeracy skills expected for that grade. By Grade 6, only 63 percent of children
had foundational reading skills and 42 percent had numeracy skills expected for that grade. These patterns are likely
tied to the fact that grade repetition is highest at Grade 6. Skills of out-of-school children were even lower, with
only 11 percent having foundational reading skills and six percent having numeracy skills.

2.3.9. Impact of COVID-19 on Education
Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted learning for millions of children and young people as it
resulted in temporary school closures.83 In Suriname, education was interrupted and more than 139,912 children
were out-of-school between March and September 2020, of which approximately 48 percent were primary school
students.84 Although local schools instituted distance-learning initiatives, inequalities regarding access to
computers/laptops and other electronic devices, and the internet exacerbated inequalities in education. As
MINOWC took adaptive measures to start classes via television, the situation in villages was quite different and
schools in the rural interior could not always follow suit.85 Significant losses with respect to learning and human
capital development are likely to deepen already existing inequalities over the long-term.

The closure of schools put gains made in access to education and learning outcomes at-risk, especially for the
poorest and most marginalized children and young people. In March 2020, UNICEF, together with the, released
operational guidance on protecting children and schools from COVID-19. As a result, a total of 44,989 children in
Suriname, including 56 percent girls and 44 percent boys, gained access to school through distance learning with
direct UNICEF support. The pandemic highlighted the fact that there is an urgent need to invest in education
systems, so that they are better prepared to prevent and address disrupted learning including through online and
distance learning for every child and young person.86
The pandemic also highlighted that Suriname needs to invest more in the professional development of teacher.
Most teachers were not prepared and lacked the skills needed to shift from in-person to online teaching. One survey
found that 50 percent of teachers could not use a computer/laptop or electronic device. The pandemic highlighted
the fact that MINOWC needs to invest in lifelong learning and training for teachers.
A key educational reform that occurred in 2020, during the pandemic, was the enactment of the Automatic
Promotion Policy by the MINOWC. Automatic promotion is a practice of allowing students to progress from one
class/grade to the next higher class/grade at the end of the school year regardless of academic performance or
educational attainment. Automatic promotion has polarized educational development stakeholders along the line
of those in support and those against.87 The origin of the policy has been traced back to the 1930s, during which
time it was adopted and implemented in the perceived interest of students social and psychological well-being.
Arguments in support of automatic promotion fall into three broad categories – enhancing education quality,
improving internal efficiency of education and personal development of students/learners.88 Opponents of
automatic promotion maintain that the practice negatively affects the overall quality of education since it eliminates
competition and de-motivates students and teachers, which lowers teaching and learning outcomes.89 Arguments
for and against automatic promotion have centred on its credibility as a viable alternative to grade retention in the
search for efficiency and better learning outcomes.90 Empirical and non-empirical studies have been conducted in
both developed and developing countries to estimate the impact of automatic promotion policies and grade
retention policies on students’ learning achievements. These studies have shown mixed and inconclusive results.91

3. OVERVIEW OF THE UNICEF-SUPPORTED FROM CLASSROOM TO
DIFFERENTIATED EDUCATION PROGRAMME
In Suriname, multiple bottlenecks have been identified that account for the inequality and poor quality of primary
and secondary education, including: an outdated curriculum; a limited number of programmes for inclusive
education; unqualified teachers, especially at the secondary level; and language barrier for indigenous and Maroon
children, who must adapt to learning in the national language.92 In Suriname, there are notable disparities between
the coastal areas and the interior in terms of secondary-school attendance rates.
Teachers in Suriname have been trained to use traditional teacher-centred pedagogical approaches that use rigidly
prescribed lessons plans, where students put all of their focus on the teacher and students are supposed to passively
listen. During assignment or activities, students work alone and collaboration is discouraged. Teacher-centred
pedagogical approaches limit teachers’ abilities to identify students with different learning styles and capabilities
and meet their learning needs using different teaching methods and approaches that are responsive to students’
differences. As a result, a notable proportion of students tend to fall behind in academic performance and have a
to repeat grades, and transition and completion rates at the secondary level are low and dropout rates are high.
One of the causes of this are that teachers have not been sufficiently trained to use different teaching approaches
to support differential learning styles of students, or to assess class dynamics, including students’ skills and learning
differences, and to adapt their teaching styles accordingly.93
In recent years, MINOWC and SOEBGS had made some progress at developing the capacities of teachers via
trainings; however, a structured approach or policy for ensuring quality teacher training and capacity building had
yet been developed. Instead, solutions were ad hoc, such as offering refresher trainings to teachers. These ad hoc
solutions had proven ineffective, especially in interior areas and other areas where students do not benefit from a
‘one size fits all solution’ because they come from different ethnic backgrounds and have different needs and
language skills. This has put a lot of pressure on educational processes.94
Although classroom assessments are included in teacher instruction manuals and training, most teachers are ill-
prepared to conduct such classroom assessment in a structured manner. As a result, teachers are ill-prepared to
identify students with different learning capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between fast and slow learners) and
learning styles (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic and reading/writing learners). Teachers are also ill-prepared to
provide slower learners with remedial learning, to help them catch-up, or to identify students with developmental
and/or learning delays or difficulties. At the same time, teachers are ill-prepared to offer enrichment learning
activities for students who learn at a faster pace, to keep them engaged. Rather, teachers tend to treat all students
the same and make minimal adaptations to their teaching approaches.95
In light of the abovementioned challenges, in 2018, the Programme was developed by SOEBGS, in partnership with
NGO SAGA Foundation. The Programme was developed to strengthen teacher training to build teachers’
knowledge, capacities and skills to apply more innovative teaching methods in the classroom, which would
improve student learning, outcomes and academic performance. Trained teachers should be able to effectively
integrate these innovative teaching methods into the classroom in a more holistic manner, and use different
teaching styles and approaches to teach students with different learning styles and abilities.96
The Programme was envisaged as a joint effort between SOEBGS and NGO SAGA Foundation, with financial support
from UNICEF Suriname. The Programme was funded as a thematic initiative by UNICEF with contributions from
SOEBGS). The Programme cost a total of USD 89,728, of which UNICEF contributed a total of USD 81,356 and the
CSO contribution was USD 8,373 (for a summary of the budget see Chapter 6, Section 6.3, Efficiency) .97 Because
the Programme was funded by UNICEF as a thematic initiative, versus funded with external donor monies,
programme-related documents were limited in number, as there were no specific external donor reporting

requirements. Nevertheless, programme-related documents that were available were reviewed and used in the
inception phase to design the evaluation methodology and data collection tools, and to draft this Inception Report.
The Programme was initially planned to be implemented from 1 August 2018 to 31 December 2020, but was
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, the Programme continues to be implemented by the 56 SOEBGS
primary schools. The evaluation covers the period of August 2018 to December 2022 because schools needed more
time for implementation and to see results.
3.1. Programme Goal and Scope
The goal of the Programme was to strengthen teacher training to build teachers’ knowledge, capacities and skills to
apply more innovative teaching methods in the classroom which would improve student learning, outcomes and
academic performance. Trained teachers should be able to effectively integrate these innovative teaching methods
into the classroom in a more holistic manner, and to use different teaching styles and approaches to teach students
with different learning styles and abilities.98
The Programme was implemented in 56 SOEBGS primary schools across Suriname, including in coastal zone areas
and the sparsely inhabited interior. The 56 SOEBGS primary schools employ an estimated 900 teachers and enroll
an estimated 13,000 primary school students.
3.2. Programme Objective and Aims
The objective of the Programme was to create an integrated capacity development programme for teachers, which
includes teacher training, specifically training coaches and support staff (e.g., counselors) who are available to
support teachers to more innovative differentiated teaching methods in the classroom. The role of coaches and
support staff were important because teachers are often confronted with challenges when transitioning away from
traditional teacher-centred pedagogical approaches to differentiated teaching approaches that are student-
centred.99
The Programme aims to achieve the following effects at the students level:100
• By another ways of asking questions (Socratic questioning) by the teacher, pupils creative thinking will be
activated.
• By differentiated teaching the teacher responds dynamically to the class situation, talents and learning
differences of pupils.
• By means of group overview the teachers get a good picture of the learning needs of the pupils and adapt
their approach (interpersonal, professional-pedagogical, didactic and organization), accordingly.
• Through better understanding of and working with flexible grouping there is more room for the teacher to
pay attention to the weak students and by doing so increase their opportunities.
• Through efforts of the Activating Didactic Instruction (ADI) Model and the active approach the pupils get an
active role in the lesson and their participation increases.
• By becoming more aware of the language goals and teachers skills for the benefit of language stimulation,
language production of the pupils is enlarged .
• By the use of visual materials during lessons pupils can exercise their specific skills in a playful way; this will
increase their understanding and solution-oriented thinking.
3.3. Programme Outcome and Outputs
The Programme was aligned with the UNICEF Guyana and Suriname Country Programme Document (CPD) 2017-
2021.101 In keeping, the Programme’s outcome was defined as strengthened organization capacity of key

stakeholder to design and deliver equitable, inclusive and relevant education services, transitioning strategies and
protective learning in emergencies, for all children and adolescents within rights-based educational frameworks and
principles by 2021. The CPD key progress indicators related to this output were:
• Percentage of students who are overage for grade in primary education by gender (Baseline: 18 percent for
girls and 22 percent for boys / Target: 10 percent decreased for girls and boys).
• Percentage of students experiencing bullying, corporal punishment, harassment, violence, sexual
discrimination or abuse (Baseline: Bullying: 26 percent of girls and boys / Target: 10 percent decrease for girls
and boys).
More specifically, the Programme included four outputs (see Annex B: Terms of Reference, Annex Table B1: Results
Framework):
• Output 1 – Training programme (materials) for teachers on differentiated learning in basic education are
designed
• Output 2 – Participants have been trained on an integrated training programme for coaching teachers in
differentiate learning, and project leaders have been coached in managing the Programme
• Output 3 – On-the-job coaching of basic education teachers on differentiated learning/instruction are
completed in 56 schools of basic education.
• Output 4 – Baseline and effect measurement completed. Project management, monitoring and evaluation for
the correct adjustment aimed at achieving results.
The Programme was in line with Suriname’s national priorities and the UNICEF Suriname Country Programme
Documents for 2017-2021 and 2022-2016, and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4, which aims to ensure
inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
3.4. Programme Implementation
According to the Programme Document, the Programme was initially planned to be implemented from 1 August
2018 to 31 December 2020 in 56 schools.102 Because the COVID-19 pandemic was interrupted by the COVID-19
pandemic, primary schools required more time for implementation. At the time of this evaluation, Programme
activities implemented under the aegis of the Programme Cooperation Agreement had ended, although they were
not fully implemented due to the pandemic, yet schools were still implementing the Programme to varying degrees.
Thus, this evaluation covers the period of August 2018 to December 2022.
The Programme’s first phase was a Figure 3.1. Bloom’s Taxonomy
preparation phase that occurred between
August to November 2018, during which time
detailed programme planning occurred and an
integrated training programme was developed
to support the Programme.
The Programme’s second phase was an
implementation phase, which included the
training phase and the on-the-job coaching
phase. The training phase occurred between
November 2018 and July 2019. In this phase,
the goal was to train 119 education staff,
including 112 trained coaches (teachers) in the
basic education SOEBGS103, 5 SOEBGS
education consultants and 2 project leaders.
These education staff were divided into five
groups, each of which received the same 13-
day training, which included five modules. The

thinking, which teachers have already been trained to understand. In general, Bloom’s Taxonomy104 is a
classification of different learning outcomes and skills that educators set for their students (Figure 2.1). The five
different 13-day trainings were delivered over 65 days. The training phase also included capacitating or coaching
two project leaders in SOEBGS management.
The on-the-job coaching phase was planned to occur from November 2018 and August 2020; however, this phase
was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown measures that led to periodic, temporary school
closures and shifts to distance learning. Education in Suriname was interrupted from March 2020 and into the
academic year (AY) 2021-2022. More specifically, from March to September 2020, 139,912 children had been out-
of-school, of which approximately 48 percent were primary school students.105 These children had their learning
interrupted due to the spread of COVID-19, although they did receive some benefits from other school-based
support mechanisms, such as protection and health. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on programme
implementation, the on-the-job coaching phase was extended to August 2022.
The on-the-job coaching phase entailed simultaneously implementing the Programme in 56 primary SOEBGSs
through peer-to-peer coaching. During the implementation phase (2018-2020), each teacher was expected to
receive three class consultations with 90 minutes each from the coach. Across the 56 primary SOEBGSs, the plan
was that coaches would guide every two teachers in their schools. After coaching of these teachers, knowledge
would be further extended to other teachers in the schools. When choosing the first group of teachers, the focus
was on teachers who were able to quickly absorb knowledge and information and transfer it to others.106
For a rapid dissemination of knowledge, coaches were expected to be a buddy for the teachers who had not yet
been coached. With new teachers, the coaching can take place by both the coach and the buddy. In this way, it is
expected that knowledge is spread faster, can be used faster and remains widely available within the school.
Coaches were expected to continue to monitor the deployment of the training program within their schools.
The goal was to peer coach 224 primary SOEBGS teachers and to conduct 672 class consultations. Class consultations
entailed coaches observing teachers while teaching and offering feedback on their teaching style and lessons, and
to come to agreements for making improvements. Teachers were expected to have an assignment folder with
assignments from the different training components that need to be carried out, and coaches are expected to
monitor and give feedback on assignment.
Table 3.1 shows that the Programme was Map 2.1. Map of Suriname and Programme areas
implemented in a total of 56 SOEBGS primary
schools, including 43 primary schools in coastal areas
(i.e., 10 schools in Paramaribo Centrum District, 10
schools in Para-Wanica, Coronie and Nickerie
Districts, 9 schools in Saramacca District, 8 schools in
South West Paramaribo, and 6 schools in Saramacca
and Marowijne Districts) and 13 interior area schools
(i.e., 7 schools in Upper Suriname and 6 schools in
Brokopondo District). Map 3.1 highlights those
districts where the Programme was implemented.
104 The taxonomy was proposed in 29156 by Benjamin Bloom, an educational psychologist at the University of Chicago, and
originally included six levels – remembering, understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating and creating – that could be used
to structure learning outcomes, lessons and assessment. Like other taxonomies, Bloom’s is hierarchical, meaning that learning
at the higher levels is dependent on having attained prerequisite knowledge and skills at the lower levels; thus, Bloom’s
Taxonomy is often displaced as a pyramid to demonstrate this hierarchy. Retrieved on 12 January 2023 from: Using Bloom’s
Taxonomy to Write Effective Learning Outcomes | Teaching Innovation and Pedagogical Support (uark.edu).

3.5. Programme Stakeholders and Beneficiaries
The Programme was a joint effort of SOEBGS and NGO SAGA Foundation, which was contracted to develop and
deliver Programme-related trainings to 110 SOEBGS primary school teachers who would serve as coaches in the 56
primary schools (2 coaches per school). In SOEBGS, the division responsible for teacher trainings is the Board of
Management of the Moravarian Foundation. Other stakeholders include the 56 SOEBGS primary schools where the
Programme was implemented. The stakeholder analysis identifies the duty-bearers as UNICEF Suriname, MINOWC
and SOEBGS. Rights-holders (beneficiaries) include intended and unintended beneficiaries of the Programme, which
includes SOEBGS primary school teachers, primary school students and parents/guardians of primary school
students (see Annex C: Stakeholder Analysis).
Teachers are considered rights-holders because they lack the knowledge, capacities and skills needed to apply more
innovative teaching methods in the classroom, and to use differentiated teaching styles and approaches to teach
students with different learning styles and abilities, which would improve student learning, outcomes and academic
performance; thus, teachers were direct beneficiaries of the Programme.
Other interest groups who are not directly participating in the intervention but have strategic technical inputs into
the intervention, include: MINOWC, particularly the division responsible for teacher trainings (i.e., CENASU) and the
Inspection Department; and other denominations that operate primary schools.
3.6. Programme Management and Monitoring
Programme planning also included a focus on effective programme management, monitoring and evaluation.
Programming management and monitoring began at the start of the Programme in August 2018, and continued to
the end of the Programme. The aim was to use monitoring data to make quarterly adjustments to the Programme,
and to scale-up the Programme to other education providers after the Programme ends.107
The Programme Document included a Results Monitoring Framework (RMF) with defined performance indicators,
coupled with baseline data, targets and means of verification (see Annex B: Terms of Reference, Annex Table B1).
Administrative data was used to track the effects of transforming teaching on students’ grades and academic
performance, from AY 2018-2019 and up until the 1st Quarter of AY 2019-2020. Prior to the start of the Programme,
for more than four years, SOEBGS had been tracking average grades of students by school and classroom on a
quarterly basis. During AY 2019-2020, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, MINOWC ended the grading
systems in primary schools as part of educational reform. Thus, student grades are not available beyond the 1st
Quarter of AY 2019-2020.
As part of monitoring, coaches and teachers were also assessed through portfolio assessment methods and their
participation in training sessions. In the first stage of the Programme’s implementation, 134 teachers received
professional development from one module of the Programme.
At this time, it was determined that it is important to have an independent evaluation of the Programme to
determine whether the Programme brought about the desired changes and improvements to teacher’s abilities and
skills to teach using differentiated teaching and learning approaches and styles in the classroom to meet the needs
of students.

4. EVALUATION PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
4.1. Evaluation Purpose
The purpose of this formative evaluation was to learn about enabling factors, bottlenecks and challenges as inputs
for learning and future action for improving and scaling up of the Programme. The evaluation gathered information
and evidence from SOEBGS and primary schools that implemented the Programme. This included the collection of
data and information to determine the relevance, coherence108, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the
Programme before, during and after the pandemic
This evaluation has resulted in evidence-based recommendations for improving the Programme and the potential
for scaling up differentiated teaching approaches to other grades and in other schools, and to inform national
teacher training programmes. This evaluation can also be used by UNICEF to sharpen its focus areas of support to
MINOWC for mainstreaming differentiated teaching approaches in education, and the overall approach to quality
education.
The intended uses of this evaluation is to inform ongoing implementation of the Programme in SOEBGS primary
schools. Thus, this evaluation offers evidence-based recommendations for further improvement of the Programme
and the potential for scaling it up to other grades and schools, and to inform national teacher training programmes.
This evaluation offers strategic guidance to UNICEF on how to sharpen its focus areas of support to SOEBGS and
MINOWC for mainstreaming differentiated teaching and learning approaches in education, and the overall approach
to quality education.
The target audience, including primary expected users of this evaluation is UNICEF SCO, SOEBGS and MINOWC. This
evaluation will also be of interest to partner UN agencies and international financial institutions/donors that
contribute to UNICEF results and wider UN system commitments, intended outcomes and efforts on the realization
of children’s rights and wider human rights commitments, including equitable access to quality education and
improvement to learning skills and outcomes.
4.2. Evaluation Objectives
The main objective of this formative evaluation was to assess to what extent, before and during the pandemic, that
the Programme was successful at improving the performance of SOEBGS schools, in terms of target components
(learners, teachers, programme management and alignment with MINOWC and policy frameworks). Consideration
was also given to gender, equity and child rights, and what has or has not been working and why.
More specific objectives included:
a. Assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of the differentiated student-oriented
programme in the 56 SOEBGS schools, as a key enabler in promoting child-centred teaching and student
performance considering interruptions in education due to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2021.
i. Assess the relevance of the differentiated learning approaches in terms of design relevance and
justifications for such an intervention
ii. Assess the efficiency of the programme’s implementation process and costs related to the teaching and
learning approach, and identify different cost components needed to take place to plan and inform
budgeting for scale-up of the Programme.
iii. Assess the effectiveness of the Programme’s implementation process and see to what extent the
differentiated approach has achieved its objectives, and identify areas that need further strengthening in
ways that the approach is understood and implemented.
iv. Assess the sustainability of the intervention (i.e., Is the Programme and approach sustainable? And, how
feasible is it to roll the approach out to other schools?)
b. Assess what has or has not been working in supported schools regarding components of the Programme,
identify similarities and differences of targeted components across schools (before and during the pandemic),
108 In the TOR, coherence was mentioned in the section related to purpose of the evaluation, but there was no mention of
coherence in the objectives of the evaluation or the evaluation framework and criteria, and there were no questions related to
coherence.
15
and analyse causal factors that explain successes and failures, and similarities and differences before and
during the current pandemic.
c. Assess how gender, equity and child rights approaches have been applied in the components of supported
programme before and during COVID-19.
This evaluation documented good practices and lessons learned, as well as gaps, bottlenecks and challenges
considering pre-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Based on the findings and conclusions related to the ability of
SOEBGS to implement the Programme, this evaluation proposes pragmatic recommendations for improving the
Programme and its implementation going forward.
To achieve these objectives, human and child rights-based and equity-based approaches guided the evaluation
approach. Attention was paid to exploring human and child rights as the goal of the Programme, while taking into
account beneficiaries’ interests. Attention was also paid to equity dimensions of the intervention. For UNICEF, equity
means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without
discrimination, bias or favouritism. Equity-based evaluations provide assessments of what works and does not work
to reduce inequity, and highlights intended and unintended results for the most vulnerable groups as well as
inequalities in outcomes for vulnerable children and families. To the extent possible, access to quality support and
outcomes for different subgroups of vulnerable children and families will be explored in this evaluation, and the
groups least reached will be identified.
4.3. Evaluation Criteria and Questions
Evaluation evidence was assessed using the OECD-DAC criteria109 of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability. The evaluation also incorporated equity, gender equality and human rights considerations as cross-
cutting issues. In keeping with the TOR, this evaluation was designed to answer a total of 36 evaluation questions
related to each of the criteria and cross-cutting issues.

mind?
iii. To what extent are teacher and learning concepts, tools and methodologies accepted by national and
local stakeholders?
iv. How does the differentiated teaching approach work within the school environment and classroom
spaces?
b. Relevance of training teachers and preparing them to adopt the approach in the classroom:
i. How relevant are the teacher trainings to prepare teachers to adopt the differentiated learning
approach in the classroom?
ii. What are the different approaches or modalities of teacher training that have been applied?
iii. How relevant are current contents, methods, materials and delivery mechanisms used for the
training?
iv. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the teacher trainings? And, how could they be
improved?
c. Relevance of the teaching and learning materials used:
i. What are the different types of materials used for implementing the approach?
ii. How relevant are these materials developed by teachers to achieve the objectives?
iii. What are the positives and negatives? How could it be improved?

c. To what extent did the different groups, including children with disabilities and other most marginalised
children, benefit in different ways from the approach?
4.4. Evaluation Scope
In terms of thematic scope, this evaluation covered all related programme interventions and references relevant to
primary education, including: the developed differentiated education curriculum and syllabus; materials (e.g.,
lesson plan tools) and delivery mechanisms; level and modality of adoption in schools and classrooms; planning and
monitoring approach; and awareness-raising and capacity building of stakeholders. This evaluation also considered
the regulatory framework, including relevant policies, plans, and strategic documents.
17
Given the lack of a comprehensive baseline for all schools and other robust comparable data, this evaluation was
formative in scope and took into consideration disruptions to education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For these
reasons, the attributable ‘impact’ of the approach will not be assessed or determined in this evaluation. The
evaluation, however, will assess how the Programme is making a difference in teaching practices and students’
learning behaviours and progress, as well as differences among beneficiaries (e.g., SOEBGS counsellors, school
heads, coaches and teachers).
In terms of geographic scope, the evaluation focused on the 56 SOEBGS primary schools that were supported
indirectly by UNICEF through funding SOEBGS to implement the Programme. The 56 SOEBGS schools are located in
several coastal area districts and in the interior of Suriname. Bear in mind, SOEBGS primary schools are
autonomous in terms of management and delivery of education, but follow national policies, regulations and
curriculum, and are accountable to MINOWC.
In terms of temporal scope, this evaluation covered the Programme’s implementation period which began in 2018
and was still being implemented to some extent at the time of this evaluation in -2023; thus this formative
evaluation covers parts of the previous UNICEF Guyana and Suriname Country Programme 2017-2021, and the
period of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications, as well as the UNICEF Guyana and Suriname Country
Programme 2022-2026.
Stakeholders who were consulted included SOEBGS management and counsellors, and community level
representatives (i.e., school heads and teachers); UNICEF SCO staff, as well as NGO SAGA Foundation
(implementation partner).

5. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
To ensure the evaluation approach was as thorough and reliable as possible, a mixed methods evaluation approach
was developed to ensure systematic collection of qualitative and quantitative data and information related to each
of the evaluation criteria and questions. The primary sources of data and information were qualitative in nature;
however, quantitative data was collected to supplement the qualitative data, where possible.
The evaluation methods and data collection tools developed for this evaluation were guided by the TOR and a desk
review, with input from UNICEF. The evaluation methods and data collection tools served to ensure that data and
information collected was valid, reliable and sufficient to meet the evaluation criteria and provide credible answers
the evaluation questions.110 The evaluation methods and data collection tools served to allow for a fair and unbiased
evaluation of the Programme and its implementation by SOEBGS in its primary schools. Each component of the
evaluation methodology are described in the sections that follow.
The evaluator applied participatory approaches and principles of integrating human rights in evaluations, including
recognizing key stakeholders and beneficiaries as 'rights-holders, and the responsibility of the State and other actors
to act as ‘duty-bearers’ to support realization of children’s rights and wider human rights commitments, including
promoting gender equality and equitable, inclusive and relevant educational services. It should be noted that this
evaluation did not involve a Reference Group, although SOEBGS management was engaged as the primary user of
the evaluation during the evaluation design and implementation stages, and the reporting and validation stages.
Given the focus of the evaluation, the evaluation was utilization-focused as it was designed to ensure that the
findings would serve to inform decision-making and improve programme performance going forward. Thus, the
primary intended users of the evaluation, SOEBGS and UNICEF SCO, was engaged in the evaluation process,
including selecting study sites and helping to arrange site visits, and the in the validation of findings and in prioritizing
the recommendations and next steps. Utilization-focused evaluation approaches are beneficial because they help
to ensure that help to ensure the evaluation will be useful to and utilized by its intended users.111
5.1. Desk Review
The evaluation began with a desk review of seven relevant programme-related documents, including the
programme document, an annex on programme design, the teacher training manual for the programme and
workbook on differentiated teaching112, templates to monitor student grades and some analysis of the two years of
available grade data, and a detailed budget for the programme. The desk review also included a review of materials
on the environment in which Programme operated before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the
Situation Analysis of Children and Women in Suriname (2021) and Country Programme Documents (CPDs). Because
the Programme was funded UNICEF as a thematic initiative and not with external donor monies, programme-related
documents were limited in number, as there were no specific external donor reporting requirements. Nevertheless,
programme-related documents that were available were reviewed and used in the inception phase to design the
evaluation methodology and data collection tools, and are used in this evaluation report, when appropriate, to draw
conclusion and develop recommendations.
5.2. Inception Phase Consultations
Evaluations are typically characterized by extensive evaluator engagement throughout the evaluation period,
coupled with independent field assessments, data collection and analysis, and generation of findings and
conclusions by the evaluator to ensure independence and open discussion. Thus, UNICEF SCO was in planning for
the evaluation, determination of the evaluation methods and data collection tools, selection of sites (schools) to
visit, and coordination and scheduling for site visits and of interviews, and finalization of the Inception and
Evaluation Reports. SOEBGS management was also be involved in the process of identifying the 10 primary schools
to visit and advising schools on organization for site visits by the evaluator.

Dutch and will need to be translated into English, in whole or in part.
19
During the inception phase, before beginning the evaluation and data collection in the field, several online
consultations occurred with staff from UNICEF’s Suriname Country Office (Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist and
Education Specialist). The focus of these consultations was on planning for the evaluation, developing the
evaluation methodology and data collection tools, and planning for the mission trip to conduct data collection in
the field.
5.3. Site Visits
This evaluation does not aim to represent the entire country, but will be conducted in Paramaribo, the capital city,
where UNICEF and SOEBGS management are located, as well as some of the SOEBGS schools, and in several coastal
area and interior districts of Suriname, where SOEBGS primary schools are located. The districts and primary
schools to be visited were identified in consultation with UNICEF SCO and SOEBGS management. The initial plan
was to visit 10 SOEBGS primary schools located in both coastal and interior areas, including 7 SOEBGS primary
schools in coastal areas, including Paramaribo, and 3 SOEBGS primary schools in interior areas. The focus was on
SOEBGS primary schools that were implementing the Programme, but maybe at different stages of implementation,
and that had been successful, to varying degrees, so that lessons learned and good practices could be documented,
along with barriers and challenges faced.
Site visits and data collection in the field were conducted during a four-week period of time from 13 February to 9
March 2023. During this time period, Suriname experienced civil unrest as demonstrations against the government
descended into against a backdrop of high inflation descended into protestors clashing with the police and storming
Suriname’s national parliament, as well as vandalizing and looting nearby government buildings and businesses.113
This civil unrest and concerns about future unrest disrupted the evaluators ability to visit schools and collect data in
the field. As a result, one school in the interior was dropped from the list of schools to be sampled. Thus, a total of
9 SOEBGS primary schools were sampled, including 7 SOEBGS primary schools in coastal areas, including
Paramaribo, and 2 SOEBGS primary schools in interior areas.

5.4. Sample
The sample included a cross-section of duty-bearers and rights-holders, and UNICEF SCO. More specifically, this
sample included: UNICEF SCO; EGBS management and counsellors; SOEBGS primary school heads; and SOEBGS
primary school teachers and coaches (trained teachers). The initial plan was to interview the Director of NGO SAGA
Foundation; however, due to unforeseen circumstances the Director passed away during the evaluation period.
A purposeful sampling approach was used to interview 89 individuals who had knowledge of and/or experience with
the Programme at stages of planning, development and implementation. Table 5.1 provides summary information
about the sample size by type of institution/school and gender. The methods of data collection – key informant
interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) – are also identified for each group of respondents. Section 4.5
on data collection methods offers more explanation as to how each of these targeted groups were selected and
sampled.

The initial evaluation design included FGDs with students from grade 3-6 who were taught in classes with teachers
trained by the Programme114; however, not all schools were able to obtain parental consent prior to the evaluator’s
visit to the schools due to the civil unrest that occurred at the start of the evaluation. FGDs were attempted with
students in two schools, however, given the young age of students and the amount of time (20 minutes) the
evaluator had to engage with students, it was not possible to have a meaningful discussion and collected the desired
information. In addition, the evaluator, as an English speaker, was working through a translator, which added an
additional layer of challenge for the students and the evaluator. Thus, the decision was made by the evaluator to
not proceed with FGDs with students.
The evaluation was conducted over a five-month period from 28 December 2022 to 3 April 2023, including data
collection in the field during a four-week period of 13 February to 9 March 2023. The evaluator spent one day at
each of the schools visited (school hours were 8:00 to 13:00).
5.5. Data Collection Methods and Tools
As previously mentioned, to ensure the evaluation approach was as thorough and reliable as possible, a mixed
methods evaluation approach was developed to ensure systematic collection of qualitative and quantitative data
114 As it related to children/students, in advance of the FGD, parents’ informed consent was obtained for each child/student who
will participate in FGDs. Parental consent forms were collected prior to beginning the FGD. In addition, prior to starting the FGD,
each child/student was asked to give their verbal informed assent to participate in the FGD using a standard script that was part
of the FGD guide. As part of the informed consent, both parents and students were informed about the purpose and scope of
the evaluation, their voluntary participation and right to decline participation (without penalty), and planned uses of the FGD
data and evaluation findings. On average, the FGDs with students took about 20 minutes to complete. FGDs took place in the
schools for purposes of comfort and ease of participation. The International Consultant worked with an interpreter in the field
to conduct FGDs in Dutch, but not all children were fluent in Dutch.
21
related to each of the evaluation criteria and questions. The primary sources of data and information were
qualitative in nature; however, quantitative data was collected to supplement the qualitative data, where possible.
The sections that follow describe the data collection methods and tools used to collected both qualitative and
quantitative data.
5.5.1. Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)
A purposive sampling approach was used to interview persons who had knowledge of and experience with the
planning, development and implementation of the Programme. In many cases, more than one person was identified
as a relevant contact in each of the different institutions/schools. Given this reality, the evaluation approach
involved conducting a combination of one-on-one and small group key informant interviews (KIIs). Small group KIIs
included two to three persons.
One-on-one KIIs were conducted in those situations where there was one person in an institution/school that
needed to be interviewed and/or in situations where a senior official/representative (e.g., SOEBGS management,
school head) needed to be interviewed. One-on-one KIIs were conducted in situations where an individual, such as
a coach, has an area of specialization or expertise that requires a one-on-one interview.
Small group KIIs of two to three persons were used when interviews needed to be conducted with a small number
of staff in the same institution/school (e.g., SOEBGS counsellors and school staff). Small group KIIs allowed for some
degree of synergy and discussion on questions which allowed for more depth and perspective by groups from the
same institution/school. Small group KIIs allowed the evaluator to maximize their contact with a wide range of
individuals from institutions/schools identified as partners and key stakeholders by UNICEF SCO.
A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide KIIs. The interview questionnaire included questions focused
specifically on the evaluation questions related to each of the evaluation criteria – relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency and sustainability, as well as equity, gender equality and human rights. Questions were designed to
capture a historical perspective, to the degree to which respondents had a historical perspective of the Programme.
On average, KIIs will took about one hour to complete.
Informed consent was obtained from all persons who participated in KIIs (see Annex F: Consent Form). As part of
the informed consent, respondents were informed that their participation was voluntary and that they were
ensured confidentiality. All interviews were conducted in the language of preference to the interviewees. The
International Consultant worked with an interpreter in the field, as needed, to conduct interviews in Dutch. UNICEF
SCO provided an independent interpreter to support conducting KIIs in Dutch. Most all KIIs were conducted in-
country by the Evaluator.
5.5.1.1. KIIs with UNICEF
A KII was conducted with UNICEF SCO staff who had working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to plan, develop and
implement the Programme in partnership with SOEBGS. A one-on-one interview was conducted with this UNICEF
staff member.
A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide the interview with UNICEF SCO staff (see Annex G:: UNICEF
and National Partner Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire included questions related to each of the
evaluation criteria and questions, and were designed to capture historical perspectives and experiences to the
degree to which the respondent had a historical perspective of and experiences with the Programme. The interview
with the UNICEF SCO staff took about one hour to complete and was conducted in English.
5.5.1.2. KIIs with Implementing Partners
Another important component of this evaluation was to interview implementing partners, including SOEBGS
management and NGO SAGA Foundation who had working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to establish and
implement the Programme in the 56 SOEBGS primary schools, including current and former SOEBGS management
and counsellors. As previously mentioned, the initial plan was to interview the Director of NGO SAGA Foundation;
however, due to unforeseen circumstances the Director passed away during the evaluation period.
22
A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide the interviews with national partners (see Annex G: UNICEF
and National Partner Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire included questions related to each of the
evaluation criteria and questions, and were designed to capture historical perspectives and experiences to the
degree to which respondents have a historical perspective of and experiences with the Programme. On average,
interviews with national partners, , will take about one hour to complete.
5.5.1.3. KIIs with SOEBGS School Staff
School staff from 9 SOEBGS primary schools who had working knowledge of UNICEF’s support to establish and
implement the Programme were interviewed. In each school, separate one-on-one and small group interviews were
conducted with the principal and/or deputy principal, and coaches (teachers) trained.
SOEBGS and UNICEF notify each of the 9 SOEBGS primary schools about the dates for the evaluation site visit and
provided guidance as to which school staff the Evaluator would like to interview, and how to organize them. Still,
however, respondents were instructed that their participation in the evaluation was voluntary.
A structured interview questionnaire was used to guide interviews with school staff (see Annex H: School Staff
Questionnaire). The interview questionnaire included questions related to each of the evaluation criteria and
questions, and were designed to capture historical perspectives and experiences to the degree to which
respondents had a historical perspective of and experiences with the Programme, with a particular focus on
implementation of the Programme in their respective schools. On average, interviews with each separate group of
school staff identified above took about one hour to complete.
5.5.2. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with Teachers
In each of the 9 SOEBGS primary schools that were sampled,
separate FGDs were conducted with teachers targeted via
peer coaching as per the Programme. A purposive sampling Box 5.1. Pilot school sample
approach was used to determine which teachers were
invited to participate in FGDs. Teachers were asked to In each pilot school visited during the
organize the FGDs of teachers by inviting them to participate evaluation the goal will be to conduct:
in the FGD with the Evaluator on a particular day and time. • KII with school head/deputy head
FGDs were limited to four teachers. • KII with coaches (trained teachers)
• 2 FGDs with primary school teachers
In each of the 9 primary schools sampled, two separate FGDs who received peer coaching
were conducted with 2-4 teachers per FGD for a total of 6-8
teachers per school. The focus was on primary school
teachers who received peer coaching and participated in the Programme, and taught using differential teaching
approaches to support student-centred learning.115 A total of 18 FGDs were conducted with teachers and included
a total of 58 teachers who were targeted via peer coaching and participated in the Programme (Table 5.1).
A structured FGD guide was used to guide the FGDs with teachers (see Annex J: FGD Guide for Teachers). The FGD
guide included questions related to many of the evaluation criteria and questions, and were designed to capture
perspectives and experiences related to the Programme, with a particular focus on implementation of the
Programme in their respective schools.
In each school, school heads were asked to identify teachers who had been targeted via peer coaching and
participated in the Programme (taught using differential teaching approaches), and who are available and willing to
participate in an FGD. This selection criteria was be provided to each of the schools to help them identify teachers.
FGDs with teachers took place in the school during school hours for purposes of teachers’ comfort and well-being.
Prior to beginning FGDs, informed consent was obtained from each of the teachers who participate in the FGD (see
Annex F: Consent Form). All teachers were informed about the purpose of the evaluation and that their
participation was voluntary, and that they were be guaranteed confidentiality. They were also informed that the
115 It was brought to the attention of the Evaluator that in most of the schools, there will be only 6-8 teachers teaching grades 3-
6. In a couple of larger schools there may be a few more teachers teaching grades 3-6; however, they will not have all been
coached or taught to use differential teaching styles and approaches.
23
FGD would not be audio-recorded, but verbatim notes were taken by the Evaluator on her laptop during the FGD.
On average, each FGD took about one hour to complete. The International Consultant worked with an interpreter
in the field to conduct FGDs in Dutch. UNICEF SCO provided an independent interpreter to support conducting FGDs
in Dutch.
5.5.3. Review of Administrative Data
Although there is a lack of administrative data to measure the Programme’s effectiveness in terms of students’
academic performance, effort was made to learn more about the types of administrative data that were collected
by SOEBGS as part of Programme implementation, such as the number of teachers trained to be coaches, the
number of teachers supported with peer coaching, number of students who benefited from differentiated
education and learning. To the degree possible, effort was made to collect summary administrative data, without
identifiers to support this evaluation; administrative data was not collected on individuals. Administrative data that
were relevant and available were compiled and included in the findings section of this report. Bear in mind,
however, education management information system (EMIS) data that were available were neither useful nor
meaningful to this evaluation.
5.5.4. Stakeholder Participation and Triangulation
The Evaluator used participatory approaches, which include involving stakeholders and beneficiaries, particularly
participants in the Programme and those affected by the Programme, in specific aspects of the evaluation
process.116 In keeping with participatory approaches, the Evaluator recognized that implementing partners, key
stakeholders and beneficiaries are important and should actively participate in the evaluation, as they can
contribute to the production of knowledge and understanding needed to conduct an evaluation. To ensure their
participation in the evaluation process, the Evaluator set out to collaborate with SOEBGS management and primary
school staff during the data collection process. The use of participatory approaches helped to strengthen the
evaluation and ensure that human and child rights (including the rights to participate and have their voices heard)
were built into the evaluation process.117 In addition, key stakeholders will participate in the validation meeting
where they will have the opportunity to provide comments and feedback on evaluation findings, conclusions and
recommendations
Triangulation was also an important part of the evaluation approach to ensure the credibility of information and
data collected, and to allow diverse perspectives and experiences to be captured. Triangulation was conducted to
ensure that perspectives and experiences of implementing partners, key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the
Programme were captured. This is important because it ensures that individuals and groups who see the
Programme from different vantage points have their voices heard during the evaluation.
The Evaluator undertook the analysis and interpretation of data collected in the field as an opportunity to allow
different vantage points and diverse perspectives and experiences captured through triangulation to come to the
forefront and to reveal the influence of the Programme, including its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability. Effort was also be made to triangulate primary data collected in the field with secondary data
contained in programme documents and monitoring reports, to the degree possible. Bear in mind, however, the
number of programme-related documents are limited in number and scope.
Triangulation is also important because it allows for a critical, unbiased and objective examination and analysis of
data and information from groups and individuals with differing opinions of and experiences with the Programme
to come to the forefront. When contradictory information was obtained from groups and individuals with differing
opinions and experiences with the Programme, effort was made to understand the reasons for such contradictory
information, including sector and institution/agency differences in perspectives and experiences, and how to
address them in the evaluation findings.118

5.5.5. Equity and Gender Integration
This evaluation aimed to integrate equity and gender, to the degree possible, in keeping with UNICEF’s approach to
integrating equity and gender into evaluations. Equity and gender were taken into consideration during the
evaluation planning and development phases and were further mainstreamed into the collection, analysis and
report writing stages.
• Evaluation design and planning phase – Equity and gender were integrated into the country context analysis
and evaluation objectives; equity, gender equality and human rights were included in the evaluation questions;
equity and gender-sensitive indicators, and equity and gender-responsive data collection and analysis methods
were included in the evaluation design; and the evaluator had a strong background in equity and gender
research and evaluation methods, and equity and gender analysis.119
• Evaluation implementation phase – Equity, gender equality and human rights were included throughout this
Inception Report; quantitative and qualitative (mixed) methods included sex-disaggregated data and data
disaggregated by schools and districts, including coastal and interior areas; data collection methods were
gender-sensitive and attentive to who was conducting the interviews, who was participating in the interviews
and how questions were drafted/asked; and a woman is leading the data collection and analysis.
• Evaluation reporting phase– Report includes a discussion and analysis of equity and gender in the findings and
recommendations, to the degree possible; unexpected results and outcomes on equity and gender, and other
equity- and gender-based differences or results are addressed, to the degree possible.
5.6. Ethical Considerations
The evaluation followed UNEG Norms and Standards and Ethical Guidelines for Evaluations.120 In keeping, the
evaluation was “conducted with the highest standards of integrity and respect for the beliefs, manners and customs
of the social and cultural environment, for human rights and gender equality, and for the ‘do not harm’ principle for
humanitarian assistance.”121
In keeping with UNICEF Procedures on Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis122,
principles of respect, beneficence, justice, integrating and accountability were integrated into the methodology,
data collection and ethical procedures, and informed day-to-day decision-making during data collection in the field
and as part of the data analysis and report writing process (Box 5.1).
The evaluation was conducted in an independent manner, with key elements of impartiality, objectivity,
professional integrity and absence of bias at all stages of the evaluation process. Credibility was established as
evaluation findings and recommendations were informed by and grounded in the use of the best available
qualitative and quantitative data and analysis to meet organizational needs for learning and accountability.123
Universally recognized values and principles of human rights, gender equality and do no harm were integrated into
all stages of this evaluation and respected by the evaluator.124 In keeping, special measures were put in place to
ensure that the evaluation process was ethical and that participants could openly provide information and express
their opinions in confidence, as respondents were guaranteed confidentiality. In keeping, sources of information
were protected; only the evaluator knows the source of information. In keeping with UNEG Ethical Guidelines,
attention was paid to issues related to harm and benefits, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality and
exercising commitment to avoid conflicts of interest in all aspects of the evaluation, thereby upholding the principles
119 It is important to note that the Evaluator, Dr. Robin Haarr (PhD), is a gender expert with more than 25 years of experience
academic experience designing and conducting gender-focused and gender-sensitive research and evaluations, including within
the development context, and conduct gender analyses and theory-building on gender, offering gender recommends to support
gender mainstreaming in the development context.

of independence, impartiality, credibility, honesty, integrity and accountability.125 Data were protected and coded
to ensure anonymity.
Box 5.1. Five principles that will inform evidence generation in this evaluation
1. Respect – This principle involves engaging with all stakeholders in a way that honours their
dignity, well-being, participation and personal agency, and acknowledges any limitations of
agency. This evaluation will be responsiveness to respondent’s sex/gender, age, background,
ethnicity and ability, among others characteristics.
2. Beneficence – This principle means striving to do good for people while minimizing harms
arising from evidence generation. This evaluation weighs the harms and benefits of data
collection. Data collected will be purpose-driven (directly informed by the activity or benefit),
proportional (only collecting what is required) and protective of children’s rights.
3. Justice – The principle of justice requires that consideration is given to those who benefit and
those who carries the burden of evidence-generation, and the broader equity of the project,
its implementation and outcomes. This evaluation will be “people-centric”, which means the
needs, interests and expectations of people, including school staff and students will be
prioritized by the evaluation team.
4. Integrity – This principle necessitates the active adherence to moral values and professional
standards, which are essential for all evidence that is commissioned or undertaken.
5. Accountability – Is the obligation to be answerable for all decisions made and actions taken,
and to be responsible for honoring commitments, without qualification or exception, as well as
to report potential or actual harms observed through the appropriate channels. The principle
includes accountability to relevant populations. This principle will be followed in keeping with
the process of ethical review and international ethical standards of research and evaluation,
including human subjects protections.

All participants were informed of the purpose of the evaluation, and that their participation was voluntary and that
they were guaranteed confidentiality. To ensure confidentiality, all interviewees were assigned a unique
identification (ID) number at the time of the interview by the Evaluator; names were never recorded. The ID number
was included in the field name on the data collection tools. In the evaluation report, only generic categories (e.g.,
school heads, coaches, teachers) are used to identify and differentiate respondents; neither district nor school
names are used. Also, schools were provided an ID number at the time of writing this report to ensure schools
anonymity; school ID numbers were randomly assigned and do not correspond in any way with the order of schools
visited.
All interview and FGD notes were saved in password protected files with only the identification numbers assigned
to them to further ensure confidentiality. Qualitative data are presented in the report in a manner that ensures
anonymity and confidentiality to ensure that respondents cannot be identified, particularly in the case of school
staff. This is especially important to reduce the risk that their participation does not impact their experiences
working in or studying in their schools. Still, however, the Evaluator cannot fully guarantee that participation in this
evaluation can have some sort of negative effects.
The Evaluator did not audio record interviews or FGDs; rather, verbatim interview notes were typed directly into
Word on a laptop by the Evaluator during the interviews and FGDs, and cleaned immediately thereafter for accuracy.
The Evaluator has the skills needed to record verbatim interview notes in this manner, which is more efficient and
just as effective as audio recording interviews.

Efforts to minimize risks included the following complementary components:
• The evaluation methodology provided sufficient detail to demonstrate how each data element contributes to
the analysis plan to eliminate unnecessary procedures and to minimize the risk of procedures
• Minimum data needed for the evaluation were collected
• A minimum number of identifiers needed for the evaluation were collected
• Only procedures that are necessary to achieve the evaluation purpose and objectives were performed
• Steps were taken to ensure confidentiality and minimize risk to human subjects
• Data were coded to conceal identifiers
• Stored data were secured so that confidentiality of subjects is preserved
5.7. Ethical Review Process
The Inception Report was submitted for external ethical review. UNICEF SCO submitted the Inception Report for
external ethical review to ensure effective processes and accountability for ethical oversight, and to ensure that
human subjects protections, including the protection of and respect for human and child rights were incorporated
into evaluation methodology and data collection processes in keeping with UNICEF Procedures for Ethical Standards
in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and Analysis.126
The ethical review was conducted by an external Ethics Review Board (ERB) in Washington, DC, United States of
American (USA). The ERB was responsible for reviewing the evaluation methodology and data collection to ensure
the following requirements were satisfied:
• Proposed evaluation approach is methodologically sound and designed to minimize risk to human subjects
(participants).
• Human subjects are not placed at undue risk, and any risks are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits.
• Special protections are provided to special populations, including children.
• Human subject’s participation in the evaluation is voluntary.
• Informed consent is sought from each human subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative prior to
their participation in the evaluation.
• Informed assent is sought from children prior to their participation in the evaluation.
• Relevant protection protocols are in place to ensure human subjects’ protections and safety
• Human subjects’ safety, privacy, confidentiality, and anonymity when possible, are maximized.
• Data collection and analysis does not result in violations of confidentiality and/or anonymity

5.8. Data Management and Analysis
Data were coded and analyzed using grounded theory.127 Grounded theory allows data collection and analysis to
occur simultaneously, strengthening both the quality of data and analysis. As data collection and analysis progressed
and preliminary findings begin to emerge the Evaluator was able to identify and explore emerging themes, such as
results achieved, lessons learned, challenges faced and adjustments made to the Programme.
KII and FGD data were extremely important to this evaluation, as these data represent the voices of both ‘duty-
bearers’ and ‘rights-holders’, and reveals their perspectives and experiences with the Programme. KII and FGD data
offer insights into how the Programme was implemented across SOEBGS primary schools, including similarities and
differences in Programme implementation, challenges and bottlenecks faced, and steps taken to overcomes those
challenges and bottlenecks. The plethora of primary data was collected during this evaluation allowed the Evaluator
to triangulate findings by types of respondents. Where possible, primary data was triangulated with information
garnered from the desk review.
All data from KIIs and FGDs will be saved in Word files (a total of 100 pages of qualitative data were collected).
Qualitative data from open-ended questions were managed and coded in Word based upon themes and sub-themes
for each question, and were analysed for patterns by the Evaluator. Quantitative data from close-ended questions
were coded and input into SPSS, and analysed by the Evaluator. Both the qualitative and quantitative data allow for
an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the Programme and its relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability; this includes progress made toward expected outcomes. The Evaluator managed all data and led all
qualitative and quantitative data analysis.
5.9. Reporting and Validation
The Evaluator led the report writing process. The evaluation report has been prepared according to the UNICEF-
Adapted UNEG Evaluation Report Standards128, as per the Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS).
The evaluation report incorporates desk review materials, although limited in number, and qualitative and
quantitative data collected in the field. As previously mentioned, EMIS data that were neither useful nor meaningful
to this evaluation. The evaluation report was drafted in accordance with the agreed upon outline for the evaluation
report.
The evaluation report was prepared in English for UNICEF and SOEBGS for comment, and UNICEF Latin American
and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO). UNICEF took the lead to translate the evaluation report into Dutch. Based
upon comments and feedback received, the evaluation report will be revised and finalized. The Evaluator will
respond to all comments in the report using comment boxes and tracking changes to ensure transparency of the
process.
Findings and recommendations were presented at a UNICEF SCO and SOEBGS organized full-day workshop event in
Paramaribo on 8 May 2023. The event engaged SOEBGS management, school heads, coaches and teachers. The
presentation allowed the evaluator UNICEF SCO to validate the findings and recommendations, in partnership with
SOEBGS.
5.10. Evaluator
This external evaluation was conducted by Dr. Robin Haarr (PhD), International Consultant/Evaluator from the USA.
The Evaluator has extensive experience conducting evaluations for UNICEF and other UN agencies, as well as
experience interviewing children. This Inception Report, including the evaluation methodology and data collection
tools, was developed by the Evaluator, in consultation with UNICEF SCO. UNICEF reviewed and approved the
evaluation approach and data collection tools prior to beginning the evaluation (see Annex E: Evaluation Work Plan).

6. EVALUATION FINDINGS
Given the lack of documentation related to this Programme, including monitoring and reporting documentation,
the findings presented are based large upon primary data and information collected during the evaluation in the
field, including interviews and focus group discussion with SOEBGS management and counsellors, school
heads/deputy heads, trained coaches (teachers) and primary school teachers.
The three-year Implementation plan for the Programme (2018-2020) was interrupted and impacted by the COVID-
19 pandemic. Training of SOEBGS counsellors, school heads and coaches occurred in 2018-2019, as initially planned.
In 2019, coaches began to train other teachers in their schools to implement the Programme; however, activities
planned for 2020 were interrupted in March 2020 by the pandemic. Because of the pandemic, SOEBGS management
and NGO SAGA Foundation were unable to perform school visits and provide refresher trainings that were initially
envisioned. During the pandemic, SOEBGS management and school staff shifted their focus to delivering education
to students remotely, largely via television and radio; as a result, teachers had limited contact with students and
were unable to assess their learning or use differentiated teaching approaches. When students returned to the
classroom, school heads and teachers were focused on reintegrating children into the classroom, delivering
curriculum and limiting contact between children to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools.
The closure of schools puts gains made in access to education and learning outcomes at-risk, especially for the
poorest and most marginalized children in Suriname. The pandemic highlighted that Suriname needs to invest more
in the professional development of teacher, as most teachers were not prepared and lacked the skills needed to
shift from in-person to remote and/or online teaching. During the pandemic, MINOWC found that 50 percent of
teachers could not use a computer/laptop or electronic device. Thus, the pandemic highlighted the fact that
MINOWC needs to invest in lifelong learning and training for teachers.129
In 2020, during the pandemic, the MINOWC enacted the Automatic Promotion Policy, a practice of allowing students
to progress from one class/grade to the next higher class/grade at the end of the school year regardless of academic
performance or educational attainment.
At the time of this evaluation, Programme activities had ended although not fully completed due to the pandemic,
but schools were still implementing the Programme to varying degrees. Although this evaluation was unable to
assess the Programme’s implementation as originally envisioned at the design stage, it was able to evaluate the
Programme’s implementation as it occurred in the context of a global pandemic. Thus, the evaluation assessed the
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of the Programme, based upon where the Programme was at
the time of this evaluation, although implementing partners and key stakeholders were asked to recall Programme
implementation prior to the pandemic, from January 2018 to March 2020.
6.1. Relevance
6.1.1. How relevant is the differentiated teaching approach for the Surinamese context and the
national primary education curricula? And, to what extent are teacher and learning concepts,
tools and methodologies accepted by national and local stakeholders?
Prior to the pandemic, the Programme was highly relevant to the Surinamese context and national primary
education; and it remains so today. In the years prior to the launch of the Programme, MINOWC had been discussing
the need to reform the national primary education model and introduce differentiated teaching approaches that
tailor instruction to students’ learning needs. MINOWC recognized that the traditional teacher-centred pedagogy
that has long been at the centre of the country’s primary education model was not effective for all students, as
many students were having to repeat primary school grades and were not transitioning from primary to secondary
education. Given the high rates of grade repetition and school dropout, MINOWC envisioned differentiated
teaching approaches as a way to meet the learning needs of all students, regardless of the differences in their
abilities.

Despite this recognition, MINOWC has yet to make significant progress at developing and implementing
differentiated education; thus, in 2018, SOEBGS management partnered with NGO SAGA Foundation to develop
and implement a Differentiated Education Programme that involved training teachers to use differentiated teaching
methods and to tailor teaching to meet the learning needs of students. This included capacitating teachers to
develop and use differentiated teaching approaches, materials and assessment measures to ensure that all students
within a classroom can learn effectively, regardless of the differences in their learning needs and abilities. SOEBGS
management decided to pilot the Programme in their 56 primary schools, with support from NGO SAGA Foundation
and funding from UNICEF Suriname. SOEBGS management envisioned that the Programme would serve to
strengthen teacher training and build teachers’ knowledge and skills to apply differentiated teaching approaches in
the classroom to improve student learning and academic performance.
In an effort to document the Programme’s relevance, respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not
relevant to 10=very relevant) how relevant the Programme is to the Surinamese context and primary education.
Chart 6.1 shows that the majority of respondents thought the Programme was relevant to the national context and
primary education. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the Programme as 6.3 on a 10-point scale.
SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=9.3) were most likely to report the Programme is ‘very relevant’ to
national context and primary education, whereas school heads (mean=7.3), coaches (mean=6.8) and teachers
(mean=5.7) were more likely to report the Programme as ‘somewhat relevant’.

Respondents reported the Programme was ‘very relevant’ to the national context and primary education (ranked
8 or higher on a 10-point scale) included all SOEBGS management and counsellors, 40 percent of school heads, 19
percent of teachers and 18 percent of coaches. They reason they ranked the Programme as ‘very relevant’ was
because they understood that the Programme was developed and implemented with the goal of strengthening
teacher training and building teachers’ knowledge and skills to apply differentiated teaching approaches in the
classroom to teach all students, and it included giving additional attention to students who struggled to learn. They
understood that the Programme was ultimately designed to improve student learning and academic performance,
particularly in the areas of literacy and numeracy.
They also recognized that the Programme provided
teachers with the tools and skills to teach students “9 – Because we move from traditional to

31
Respondents also recognized that the Programme was designed to reduce grade repetition and school dropout,
which is the aim of educational reforms being introduced by MINOWC. Some school heads pointed out that
differentiated education is ‘very relevant’ because MINOWC is now offering teacher trainings on differentiated
education, but they recognized that it was SOEBGS that introduced the Programme first.
At the same time, however, respondents who ranked the Programme as ‘very relevant’ also recognized that the
Programme had yet to be implemented at the level that it should be and that there are teachers who are not
engaged in differentiated education and are still asking the question, “What is the Differentiated Education
Programme?” In large part, this is because the Programme’s implementation was interrupted in March 2020 by the
COVID-19 pandemic. As previously mentioned, during the pandemic, schools and teachers shifted away from
teaching using differentiated teaching approaches to focus on providing distance-learning initiatives in a difficult
context where access to technology and the internet is extremely limited. During this time period, when schools
were temporarily closed, teachers had limited to no contact with their students. Many students fell behind in their
learning and education during this time. When schools reopened, school heads and teachers were focused on trying
to encourage students to return to the classroom and helping them to catch-up in their learning.
Since MINOWC enacted the Automatic Promotion Policy school heads and teachers have found that the Policy has
had a negative effect students’ motivation and learning, as well as teacher’s morale. Moreover, school heads and
teachers have found that they are no longer able to use differentiated teaching approaches and the three-star
system to motivate students to learn and avoid grade repetition, as they did prior to the pandemic and the
enactment of the Automatic Promotion Policy.
Respondents who felt that the Programme was
‘somewhat relevant’ to the national context and
primary education (ranked 5, 6 or 7 on a 10-point scale) “7 – In the beginning [of Programme

students using active teaching methods, while also giving
attention to star 2 and 3 students.
Despite recognizing the benefits of the Programme, many teachers have resisted the Programme because it requires
‘too much writing’. Teachers are required to write daily lessons plans for both language and math courses using a
standardized five-page lesson plan form (i.e., ten-pages on a daily basis for two courses). Given that very few
32
teachers have access to computers, these five-page lesson plans need to be handwritten on a daily basis. Teachers
complained that they do not have time to write these five-page lesson plans and they lack the materials needed to
teach using differentiated teaching approaches, which requires the use of visual educational and teaching materials
and materials to teach using activities or games.
It was only teachers (24 percent) felt that the Programme was ‘not relevant’ to the national context and primary
education (ranked 4 or lower on a 10-point scale). Teachers felt the Programme was ‘not relevant’ was because
they were not sufficiently trained to implement the Programme and use differentiated teaching approaches. Some
teachers reported that they have too many students and not enough space in their classrooms, and not enough
time to teach using differentiated teaching approaches. Some teachers do not like the three-star system of
categorizing students based upon their learning pace and academic achievements because it creates a hierarchy in
the classroom between star 1, 2 and 3 students, which contributes to star 1 students (i.e., slow learners) being
bullied by their classmates.
Teachers were not satisfied with the Programme because it is time consuming and requires a lot of writing to
develop daily lesson plans, which is on top of their other teaching responsibilities. Teachers explained that when
they return home from work they have domestic and care responsibilities in their families. Some women also have
to travel by bus for up to an hour or more each way to and from their home to the school. They also complained
that the burden is put on teachers to pay for the Programme by making photocopies of lessons plans (which can
cost teachers as much as 400 SRD a month) and buying materials needed to create visual teaching aids (e.g., pictures,
story tables, word walls).
6.1.2. What are the different approaches or modalities of teacher training that have been applied?
How relevant are the teacher trainings to prepare teachers to adopt the differentiated learning
approach in the classroom? How relevant are current contents, methods, materials and
delivery mechanisms used for the training?
The Programme was designed to include different approaches or modalities of teacher training. SOEBGS and NGO
SAGA Foundation partnered to deliver a series of six-day training-of-trainers to 119 teachers who were selected to
be coaches. School heads at the 56 primary schools were asked to identify two teachers who would be trained to
be coaches to support implementation of the Programme in their schools. The training for coaches followed the
Activating Direct Instruction model which allowed coaches to experience how lesson materials could be transferred.
Fifty-four (54) School heads were also trained on the Programme; however, they did not receive the same in-depth
training that the coaches received and they were trained separately from the coaches.130
During the training, coaches were provided with a Programme manual and workbook, but not all school heads were
provided with the same Programme manual and workbook. Coaches were expected to return to their schools and
deliver trainings on the Programme to their colleagues, and they were expected to coach their colleagues to
properly develop daily lesson plans, apply three-star system of categorizing students and use differentiated teaching
approaches in the classrooms. Not all coaches followed through with these responsibilities for a variety of reasons,
including: lack of commitment or buy-in to use differentiated education in the classroom; lack of understanding of
differentiated education based upon the trainings received; lack of capacities and/or time to train and coach their
colleagues; resistance from their colleagues; and lack of support from school heads.
In an effort to document how important the Programme’s training has been at preparing teachers to use
differentiated education in the classroom, respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not important
to 10=very important) how important the Programme’s training has been at preparing teacher to use differentiated
teaching approaches in the classroom. Chart 62 shows that the majority of respondents thought the Programme’s
training was important at achieving this objective. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the
Programme as 6.8 on a 10-point scale. SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=9.0), school heads (mean=8.3)
and coaches (mean=8.1) were more likely to report that the Programme’s training has been ‘very important’ at
preparing teachers to use differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom, whereas teachers (mean=5.9)
ranked the Programme as only ‘somewhat important’ at preparing teachers to use differentiated teaching
approaches in the classroom. School heads and coaches ranked the training as more important than did teachers,
because they were directly trained on the Programme by SOEBGS and NGO SAGA Foundation, whereas teachers

Respondents who ranked the Programme’s training as ‘very important’ (ranked 8 or higher on a 10-point scale)
included 90 percent of school heads, 88 percent of SOEBGS management and counsellors, 73 percent of coaches
and 19 percent of teachers. SOEBGS management and counsellors thought the Programme’s training was ‘very
important’ because it strengthened teachers abilities to develop daily lesson plans. Prior to the Programme,
teachers did not prepare lesson plans that were student-centred, as they were using a teacher-centred model. Thus,
SOEBGS management thought the Programmes’ training helped to ensure that teachers are prepared to teach
students and to use differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom.
Respondents also recognized that teacher trainings are
necessary to achieve change in the educational system. They

way that they were expected to, in keeping with the

Respondents who ranked the Programme’s training as ‘somewhat important’ (ranked 5, 6 or 7 on a 10-point scale)
included 63 percent of teachers, 27 percent of coaches, 13 percent of SOEBGS management and counsellors, and
10 percent of school heads. Some teachers reported that the coaches helped them to understand how to develop
lesson plans and to use differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom; whereas other teachers were not
confident in the coaches capacities because they could not answer questions that teachers had about how to
implement the Programme and to develop lesson plans. Some teachers said they read the Programme’s workbook

and/or manual on their own in an effort to figure out
how to implement the Programme in the classroom.

6.1.3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the teacher trainings? And, how could they be
improved?
As previously mentioned, the implementation plan for the Programme was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic
in March 2020. After being trained, school heads and coaches were expected to return to their schools and
implement the Programme, and coaches were expected to train other teachers in their schools. One of the
disadvantages of this cascade training approach was that coaches received little feedback and support or additional
training and guidance once they trained and returned to their schools.
Because of the pandemic, SOEBGS management and NGO Saga Foundation were unable to perform the school visits
and deliver refresher trainings that were originally envisioned in the Programme’s design. In 2021, when schools
were re-opened and teachers and students returned to the classroom, the Programme was never re-started because
teachers were focused on reintegrating children into the classroom, teaching primary education curricula, trying to
help students who had fallen behind academically to catch-up, and maintaining social distance between students
to curb the spread of COVID-19 in schools. Thus, Programme activities that were interrupted were never restarted.
Thus, it is impossible to fully assess the of Programme’s approach to training teachers.
Taking into consideration these realities, this evaluation focused on understanding the advantages and
disadvantages of the trainings that teachers did receive prior to the pandemic, and the usefulness of the cascade
training approach that was used. The advantages and disadvantage identified are discussed below, along with some
recommendations for making improvements, some of which will be developed and further articulated in the Section
8. Recommendations.

Teachers who were trained to be coaches were
provided with a Programme manual and workbook.

also be developed and made available to teachers and
school heads.
The Programme’s teacher training did succeed at capacitating teachers to develop daily lesson plans, to varying
degrees. SOEBGS management and many school heads mandated that teachers develop daily lessons plans for
math and language using the lesson plan forms in the Programme’s manual and workbook. Coaches were supposed
to teach their colleagues how to develop daily lessons plans. Some coaches were very supportive at helping teachers
to develop their daily lessons plans and even reviewed their lessons plans and provided feedback and suggestions;
37
whereas other coaches did not do this. Some teachers complained that they were expected to develop lesson plans
with limited training or support from the coaches or school heads, and a lack of understanding of the Programme.
Some teachers took the initiative to photocopy and read the Programme’s training manual and/or workbook to
capacitate themselves to develop daily lessons plans for their classes, particularly language and mathematics. To
improve the Programme and its implementation, SOEBGS should capacitate all teachers to develop lesson plans
using differentiated teaching approaches, and to align their lesson plans with required learning outcomes as per the
subject and grade. These do not need to be daily lesson plans, which is time consuming for teachers, but could be
weekly lesson plans.
6.1.3.2. Disadvantages of the Programme’s teacher training
SOEBGS counsellors were not fully capacitated or committed to support schools to implement the Programme.
Not all SOEBGS counsellors were champions of the Programme and they were not properly capacitated to support
schools to implement the Programme; thus, schools complained that they received limited feedback, guidance and
support from SOEBGS counsellors. To improve the Programme and its implementation, SOEBGS counsellors must
be agents of change and champion of the Programme, and they need to be fully capacitated and certified to train
school heads and teachers on all components of the Programme, and to assess its implementation in the classroom.
They should also be required to participate in annual refresher trainings related to the Programme and re-certified
every five years. Each SOEBGS counsellor should also have an annual plan for visiting schools and deliver refresher
trainings and technical assistance to each of the SOEBGS primary schools in their cluster to strengthen the roll out
and mainstreaming of the Programme in all SOEBGS primary schools.
There was no clear criteria or guidance provided to school
heads for selecting teachers to be trained as coaches to
support the implementation of the Programme, and
“SOEBGS didn’t give us [school heads] any

and/or a reduced teaching load to fulfill the defined roles

School heads should have received the same trainings that coaches received so that they fully understood all
components of the Programme, as well as additional trainings on how to manage the Programme’s
implementation and support teachers to use differentiated education in the classroom. Because school heads did
not receive the same in-depth training that the coaches received, nor did they receive both the Programme manual
38
and workbook, they typically did not fully understand all
components of the Programme (e.g., differentiated
teaching approaches, development of lesson plans, use of “It would be good to educate the school

to which students belong in star 1, 2 and 3 groups.
The cascade training approach of training teachers to be coaches and then expecting them to return to their
schools and deliver trainings and support to their colleagues to implement the Programme was wrought with
challenges. This approach was partially unsuccessful for a multitude of reasons, many of which have already been
explained. In particular, the trainings provided to coaches did not capacitate all coaches to fully understand the
Programme and to apply it in the classroom; thus, they were unable to train their colleagues on how to do so. Many
teachers felt that the coaches were not confident to train or provide their colleagues with guidance on how to
develop daily lesson plans and to use differentiate teaching methods in the classroom.
Teachers also recognized that coaches often did not have time to take on these additional roles and responsibilities,
such as reviewing their colleagues daily lesson plans and providing timely feedback, visiting their colleagues’
classrooms to observe how they teach and provide feedback on how to improve their teaching by using differentiate
teaching approaches, and more. They also recognized that those who trained the coaches did not visit the schools
to provide coaches with the technical assistance that they needed to properly do this work. Because of these
shortcomings with the cascade trainings, the Programme was reduced down to completing the daily lesson plan
forms, assigning students to star groups based upon their learning abilities, using visual materials in the classroom
(e.g., storyboards) and spending more time with the star 1 students (i.e., slow learner).
39
6.1.4. What are the different types of materials used for implementing the approach? How relevant
are these materials developed by teachers to achieve the objectives? What are the positives
and negatives? How could it be improved?
Across schools, Programme implementation varied significantly depending upon the school head’s commitment to
the Programme, coaches understanding of the Programme and their commitment and abilities to train their
colleagues on all components of the Programme, and the willingness of teachers to implement the Programme in
their classrooms. A lot also depended upon the support provided by SOEBGS management and counsellors to
schools to implement the Programme and the level of teacher resistance to the Programme.
As previously mentioned there was a Programme manual and workbook. Both of these documents were provided
to coaches during their training. The Programme manual provides information on the structure of the training
coaches received, key elements of differentiated education and information about bullying, whereas the workbook
provides teachers with lesson plans and activities that they can use in the classroom to transition to teaching using
differentiated teaching methods. Some school heads were also provided with one or both of these Programme
document, but not all school heads were provided with copies. Most teachers were not provided with a copy of the
Programme’s manual or workbook, although some made a photocopy of one or both of these documents, typically
at their own cost. Other teachers reported that they were not aware of these Programme documents and had not
seen them.

system to assess students learning, particularly differences
between students in the star 1, 2 and 3 groups.
Teachers (47 percent) who ranked the Programme’s manual and workbook as ‘somewhat important’ (ranked 5,
6 or 7 on a 10-point scale) did so because they do not like having to fill out the daily lesson plan forms and to
elaborate on how they plan to teach in the classroom every day. Some teachers had difficult time completing the
lesson plans and determining whether a student belongs in the star 1, 2 or 3 group. Use of the three-star system
became even more difficult after the pandemic because school closure resulted in significant learning losses for
many students, and the learning losses were even greater in math and language. The Automatic Promotion Policy
was further compounding learning losses for many students as they were progressing on to the next grade at the
end of the year without achieving the required learning outcomes.
40
When teachers have a large number of students in their classroom, they cannot successfully implement the
Programme because teachers have to spend so much time working with the star 1 student (i.e., ‘weaker students’)
that they don’t have time for the star 2 and 3 students. Teachers also found it difficult to reach the star 1 students
and to help them learn because the learning losses for students have been so significant due to the combined effects
of the pandemic and the Automatic Promotion Policy.
Teachers are not applying everything in the Programme’s manual and workbook because they need more capacity
building training and technical assistant to implement the Programme. Moreover, there are still numerous teachers
who have never seen the Programme’s manual and workbook, so they cannot use them.
Teachers (26 percent) who ranked the Programme’s manual
and workbook as ‘not important’ (ranked 4 or lower on a 10-
point scale) did so because they were not working with the “3 – I only used it two to three times

were too many to do differentiated education, whereas others
pointed out that their classrooms are too small to put children
into groups and teach them using differentiated education.
6.1.5. How does the differentiated teaching approach work within the school environment and
classroom spaces?
During the evaluation, both coaches and teachers spoke about

month). Now, only if teachers change the grade that they are
teaching are they required to develop new daily lesson plans. It
was not clear how daily lesson plans were being reviewed,
approved or used by either school heads and teachers.
Since being trained, coaches and teachers have taken a wide range of steps to introduce differentiated teaching
approaches in the classroom. Teachers spoke about using different teaching materials that fit with the learning
levels of students, particularly in the lower primary school grades. They also told stories about using visual materials,
storyboards, word walls and other interactive activities to engage and teach students. The challenges teachers
41
faced, however, was a lack of visual materials and other
materials (e.g., paper, paints, crayons/markers, glue,
scissors) that are needed for interactive activities, such “They resisted the fact that they had to write

6.2. Effectiveness
6.2.1. To what extent and how has the Programme helped to improve teacher performance in
effectively addressing the different needs of students? And to making teaching and learning
more inclusive?
The goal of the Programme was to build teachers’ knowledge and capacities to apply differentiated education and
teaching approaches in the classroom to improve student learning and academic performance. Respondents were
asked whether the Programme had achieved this goal or had fallen short of this goal. Some school heads felt that
the Programme’s goal had been achieved because it introduced differentiated education and teaching approaches
which have provided opportunities for children to be more engaged in the classroom, which was not a practice
42
under the traditional teacher-centred pedagogy that has been used in the educational system in Suriname. Whereas
other school heads contend that the Programme’s goal has not been achieved because not all teachers are using
differentiated education in the classroom or taking into consideration the different learning needs of students, and
they have yet to see the results of the Programme on students.
Both school heads and teachers pointed out that prior to the pandemic, most teachers were applying differentiated
teaching approaches in the classroom, particularly for math and language, and were using the three-star system to
group students based upon their learning needs. The pandemic, however, halted progress that was made when
schools temporary closed and distance-learning initiatives were introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19. This
greatly impacted the effectiveness of the Programme. As previously mentioned, once teachers and students were
able to return to the classroom, teachers were no longer focused on using differentiated teaching methods in the
classroom, rather they were focused on reintegrating children into the classroom, teaching the primary school
curricula and help students to catch-up from the learning that was lost during the pandemic. They were also focused
on maintaining social distance between students (e.g., siting in rows), which made it difficult to teach students in
groups using the three-star system. Since returning to the classroom, some school heads have repeatedly
encouraged teachers to use differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom and to be more actively involved
with students when teaching, but progress made prior to the pandemic has been lost.
The Automatic Promotion Policy has also had a
significant impact on the effectiveness of the
Programme. The Policy has had a significant impact

school head explained, “What I have noticed is that

Respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not at all to 10=very much) to what extent the Programme
contributed to increasing the capacities of SOEBGS primary schools to use differentiated teaching approaches that
are focused on improving child learning. Chart 6.4 shows that the majority of respondents thought the Programme
contributed to increasing the capacities of SOEBGS primary schools to use differentiated teaching approaches that
are focused on improving child learning. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the extent of the
Programme’s contribution as a 6.0 on a 10-point scale. SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=7.1), coaches
(mean=6.6) and school heads (mean=6.6) were more likely to report the Programme ‘somewhat’ contributed to
achieving this objective, compared to teachers (mean=5.7).

6.2.2. To what extent and how has the approach achieved its objectives? What were the major factors
influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the differentiated learning objectives?
What and how have differences come about for other beneficiaries?
There were several objectives of the Programme, including:131
• Teachers are able to encourage students’ creative thinking by asking questions in a different way (e.g.,
Socratic questioning).
• With differentiated teaching approaches, teachers’ are able to respond in a more dynamic manner to
students learning differences and talents, and classroom dynamics.
• Teachers are better able to identify and assess the learning needs of students and adapt their teaching
approaches accordingly.
• Teachers are better able to understand and work with diverse groups of students in the classroom, and to
support students who underperform or have learning delays or difficulties, and do so by increasing students’
learning opportunities.
• Through efforts of the Activating Didactic Instruction (ADI) Model students are provided the opportunity to
participate and take a more active role in their lessons and to participate in the learning process.
• Teachers are more aware of the language goals and are better equipped or capacitated to support language

45
stimulation and production among students.
• Teachers are capacitated to use visual teaching materials during lesson plans to engage and teach students in
a more playful and interactive way, to increase their understanding and solution-oriented thinking.
To evaluate whether the Programme achieved its objectives, respondents were asked a series of scale-item
questions:
• How effective has the Programme been at preparing teachers to identify and assess the learning needs of
students?
• How effective has the Programme been at preparing teachers to adapt their teaching approaches to teach
different types of students in the classroom, with different learning abilities?
• How effective has the Programme been at preparing teachers to use visual teaching materials during lesson
plans to teach students in more playful and interactive ways?
• To what extent did the Programme contribute to increasing the capacities of SOEBGS primary schools to deliver
more innovative teaching approaches that are focused on improving child learning and academic performance?
Findings related to each of these questions are presented below.
Respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not effective to 10=very effective) how effective the
Programme was at preparing teachers to identify and assess the learning needs of students. Chart 6.5 shows that
the majority of respondents thought the Programme was ‘somewhat effective’ at preparing teachers to identify and
assess the learning needs of student, except for teachers. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the
Programme’s effectiveness related to this objective as a 5 on a 10-point scale. Coaches (mean=7.7) and school
heads (mean=7.1) were most likely to report that the Programme was ‘somewhat effective’ at preparing teachers
to identify and assess the learning needs of students, followed by SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=6.3).
Whereas teachers (mean=4.0) were more likely to report the Programme as ‘not effective’ at preparing teachers to
identify and assess the learning needs of students. This, in part, is because teachers were not trained in the same
way as school heads and coaches, and only 55 percent of teachers reported that the coaches trained them to identify
and assess the learning needs of students.

Respondents who ranked the Programme as ‘very effective’ (ranked 8 or higher on a 10-point scale) at achieving
this objective, included 55 percent of coaches, 40 percent of school heads, 33 percent of SOEBGS management
and counsellors and 9 percent of teachers. They gave this ranking because they felt that the Programme was ‘eye-
opening’ and taught teachers to learn more about their students learning needs and gaps, and encouraged teachers
to monitor student’s progress, and if necessary, provide students who need additional support with help. School
heads pointed out that the Programme forces teachers to use teaching methods that help them to assess the
learning needs of students and assign them to groups, along with students who learn at the same pace, where they
can provide students with more attention and support, as need. Yet, they recognized that it is not always easy for
teachers to determine whether students belong in the star 1, 2 or 3 groups for math and language.
Coaches were far more likely than teacher to rank the Programme as ‘very effective’ because they were trained to
identify and assess the learning needs of students using the three-star system; however, coaches were unable to
explain what the criteria are for categorizing students as star 1, 2 and 3. Some teacher considered the Programme

Respondents who ranked the Programme’s as ‘not effective’ (ranked 4 or lower on a 10-point scale) at preparing
teachers to adapt their teaching approaches to teach students with different learning abilities, included 42
percent of teachers, 13 percent of SOEBGS management and counsellors and 10 percent of school heads. School
heads tended to rank the Programme as ‘not effective’ because they do not see all teachers making an effort to
develop their lesson plans as they should or to teach using differentiated teaching approaches. Some respondents
felt this was because coaches were unable to explain how to adapt teaching approaches to teach students with
different learning needs. Some teachers reported the coaches came to their classrooms to observe and provide
them with guidance, whereas other teachers did not get this support.

out that the coaches were not even certified as trainers of the
Programme.
Other teachers took a more compassionate perspective. They recognized that coaches helped teachers as much as
they could, but were also busy teaching their own classes, so they did not want to disturb them; thus, it was not
always the coaches fault that they could not support the teachers. Some teachers recognized that “it was very

teachers complained that “it seems like no one cares about what you need in the classroom, like materials, but they
do talk about it” (School 4).
School heads pointed out that they often encourage teachers to use visual materials because they do help students
to understand the lessons and assignments. Coaches also recognized that “when you use playful ways of teaching,
the children are more active in the lesson and you see that they are more interested” (School 6).
The challenge is that it takes more time and energy for teachers think of the different ways that they can teach
students and to identify activities that they can use to teach, and to get the materials needed to create visual
teaching materials. Also, it is easier to use playful and visual teaching materials in the lower primary school grades,
but it is not as practical for teacher in the upper grades because there is no Programme workbook for the upper
grades.

for teachers, particularly those teachers who teach math
and language.
In some schools, prior to the pandemic, teachers were required to submit their lesson plans to both the school head
and coach, whereas in other schools they submit them to school heads only. After the pandemic, school heads are
typically being submitted to only the school head. In some schools, school heads and/or coaches have visited
classrooms to see if the lesson plans were being followed.

“When you make an ADI you really have to think hard about the steps and what kind of games to use for
the different lessons. You need to make more of an effort and think about what you can use when you give
them instructions, and which activating questions to ask when evaluating. It requires additional
preparation and as a teacher you need to make more of an effort to plan.” (School Head, School 4)
6.2.4. To what extent and how has the approach helped to make differences in students’ learning
behaviour and progress?
During Programme design, the plan was to use school and classroom grades to track the effectiveness of the
Programme. School and classroom level grades were available for AY 2018-2019 and up until the 1st Quarter of AY
2019-2020. During AY 2019-2020, after the start of the pandemic, MINOWC ended the grading system in primary
schools as part of educational reform and introduced the Automatic Promotion Policy. Thus, comparable school
and classroom grades are not available beyond the 1st Quarter of AY 2019-2020.
When it comes to the Programme making a
difference in student learning and progress, teachers
and coaches identified gaps in the Programme. On

6.2.5. How can the approach be more effective (e.g., training, materials, class and school
environment, resources, monitoring and measurement mechanism and tools, coordination,
and governance)?
Respondents were asked how the Programme could be strengthened and what they need to fully implement the
Programme. Chart 6.9 shows that nearly all respondents identified the need more training and training materials
(90 percent), as well as educational and teaching materials (90 percent). The majority of respondents also identified
the need for better collaboration, coordination and cooperation (72 percent), improvements to the classroom
environment (70 percent)and more resources (56 percent). Fewer respondents also identified the need for
improvements to the school environment (20 percent), improved Programme management (18 percent) and more
Programme monitoring and monitoring tools (9 percent). Each of these are explained in more detail in the sections
below.

6.2.5.1. More training and training materials
Any effort to bring about change in an institution, and especially in the educational sector, requires significant
training for school heads and teachers, as well as support staff, such as counsellors. Training should include in-
service trainings for all school heads, teachers and support staff, as well as induction trainings for all new school
heads, teachers and support staff. Under the aegis of this Programme, training was provided only to counsellors,
schools heads and coaches; however, the training for counsellors and school heads was not as in-depth as the
training for coaches. Refresher trainings that were planned for 2020, were cancelled due to the pandemic. Since
2019, there have been no additional trainings offered by SOEBGS as it relates to the Programme.
For these reasons, 90 percent of respondents maintained

all school heads, teachers and counsellors have a copy or access to these materials. One approach is to provide
several copies of all training materials to each school and guidance on how to place them in the school library where
they can be accessed by school heads and teachers (e.g., allowing them to be checked out by school heads and
teachers for several days).
To successfully implement and mainstream the Programme into all SOEBGS primary school, this will require trainings
that are designed to increase school heads, teachers and counsellors knowledge, attitudes and skills to properly
apply differentiated education and teaching approaches in the classroom. SOEBGS needs to ‘win the hearts and
minds’ of school heads, teachers and counsellors, and secure their commitment to implement the Programme.
6.2.5.2. Educational and teaching materials
To strengthen and fully implement the Programme, schools and teachers need educational and teaching materials,
including more activity workbooks and visual materials for each grade. This includes materials (e.g., paper, paints,
crayons/markers, glue, scissors, blocks, dice and more) that teachers can use in the classroom to engage students
to create visual materials (e.g., story boards) and learn through doing. Some teachers wanted their school to have
an inventory of visual materials that they could access and use in the classroom. These visual materials should be
replenished and updated every year and be appropriate for all primary school grades.
6.2.5.3. Better collaboration, coordination and cooperation
The majority of school heads, coaches and teachers
reported there needs to be better collaboration,
coordination and cooperation in schools to implement “We [teachers] do already collaborate and

are left out of the loop. Teachers did, however, express a
real desire to learn from each other.
They also reported the need for better collaboration, coordination and cooperation with SOEBGS management and
counsellors to support implementation of the Programme in schools. There is a need for more capacity building
training and guidance from SOEBGS management and counsellors to support implementation of the Programme, as
well as more education and teaching materials for use in the classroom.
Since they were trained in 2018 and 2019, some coaches were transferred to other schools, some were promoted
to be counsellors and school heads, and some left teaching all together. Thus, there needs to be better coordination
in SOEBGS to assess how many coaches remain and are located in each school and the proportion of those who are
still interested in serving as a coach to support implementation of the Programme. Coaches who are still interested
in coaching their colleagues to implement the Programme should receive refresher trainings and a certification to
service as a coach.

6.2.5.4. Improvements to school and classroom environments
School heads and teachers identified a variety of

differentiated education and teaching using the three-star
system.
6.2.5.6. Improved Programme management
SOEBGS management needs to develop a business plan for managing implementation of the Programme going
forward, i.e., if they plan to continue implementing the Programme. One approach could be to establish a
specialized Differentiated Education Unit that is made up of highly trained individuals who are champions for the
Programme and can conduct Programme-related trainings for school heads and teachers, and provide schools with
regular technical assistance and guidance on how to implement the Programme. A Differentiated Education Unit
can help to mainstream differentiated education into all schools and classrooms, including all grades and subjects.
56
From the perspective of school heads and teachers, improved Programme management would include more regular
trainings on differentiated education and teaching approaches, and providing schools with the resources and
educational and teaching materials needed to implement the Programme.
6.2.5.7. More monitoring and monitoring tools
SOEBGS management and counsellors thought that there should be more monitoring and better monitoring tools
for the Programme. Since the Programme’s inception, SOEBGS has not been able to effectively monitor the
Programme’s implementation, largely because it did not have a suitable or manageable monitoring framework or
monitoring tools that could be used by schools and SOEBGS management and counsellors. SOEBGS counsellors also
need more capacity building and training to monitor the Programme’s implementation in schools using the
monitoring framework and tools.
6.3. Efficiency
6.3.1. What are the different cost elements in implementing this approach in schools (e.g., training,
monitoring, material, classroom improvements)? To what extent does the Programme deliver
the necessary quality at the least necessary cost? Was the approach implemented in the most
efficient way, compared to alternatives (e.g., training all teachers instead of applying a
train/coach the trainer concept)?
This Programme was implemented with no donor funding; it was funded predominately by UNICEF.132 Table 6.1
provides a summary of Programme expenditures. The total cost of the Programme was USD 89,728 (SRD 663,989),
of which USD 81,355 (SRD 602,032) was UNICEF’s contribution and USD 8,373 (SRD 61,957) was a CSO contribution
(i.e., SOEBGS). SOEBGS did report that they had no budget short falls and that that financial resources available to
implement the Programme were sufficient for carrying out the planned activities.
SOEBGS and UNICEF signed a Programme Cooperation Agreement for implementation of the Programme. Initially,
the plan was that the Programme would be implemented over a three-year period (2018-2020), but the Programme
was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the national context and environment in which the Programme
was being implemented, UNICEF and SOEBGS were simply unable to pivot and shift the Programme to an online
platform during the pandemic. During the pandemic, lockdown measures and temporary school closures created
unique challenges for the whole educational system in Suriname, including SOEBGS schools. Thus, the
implementation phase and project management, monitoring and evaluation were interrupted. Since the pandemic,
there was also a change in SOEBGS management.
UNICEF and SOEBGS learned that two years (2018-2019) was not enough time to implement the Programme to the
extent that it was able to change the culture of schools and reform education in primary schools to include
differentiated education. Nor was there enough time to really assess the Programme’s effectiveness and impacts,
or to ensure sustainability. Schools need a longer period of time to be capacitated to possess the knowledge,
attitudes and skills to effectively implement the Programme as a whole school approach. SOEBGS schools would
benefit from an additional training and technical assistance to implement the Programme, and additional resources
to ensure that schools have the training and teaching materials needed to fully implement the Programme in all 56
primary schools.
132 Conducting a costing analysis was beyond the scope of this evaluation and the evaluator was not able to conduct cost
comparisons. The evaluator was provided with summary expenditures data presented by implementation phase and
result/activity.

6.3.2. What are the challenges faced in sourcing funds for these costs? How can different cost
elements be made more cost effective and sustainable?
Mobilizing national resources for children in Suriname is critical to ensure sustainable and equitable impact on the
lives of children. Part of this includes influencing national budget processes. For the rights of children to be fully
achieved, sustainable resources that yield sustainable results for children’s in education is important. During the
four-year period of 2014-2017, on average, the Government allocated 1.7 percent of the government’s budget to
education.133 Chart 6.9 shows public expenditures, as a percent of the GDP, that are allocated to education in
Suriname, in comparison to averages for Caribbean Small States, Latin American and Caribbean countries (not
including high income countries) and upper middle-income countries. According to the data, from 2015-2019,
Suriname contributed an estimated one percent more of public expenditures, as a percent of the GDP, to education,
compared to Caribbean Small State Latin American and Caribbean countries (not including high income countries)
and upper middle-income countries; this difference ended in 2020.

Going forward there is a real need for more financing reinvigorate the Programme and ensure its continuity. This is
especially important given the fact that the country has experienced significant inflation since the pandemic. From
2019 to 2020, the inflation rate (average consumer prices) increased 4.4 percent to 34.9 percent, and climbed to
59.1 percent in 2021 and remained at 47.6 percent in 2022.134 The rising inflation rate has caused the Programme
to become more expensive to implement.

6.4. Sustainability
6.4.1. To what extent is the differentiated learning approach and interventions sustainable? To what
extent have the stakeholders undertaken the necessary decisions and course of actions to
ensure sustainability of the approach?
Respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not sustainable to 10=very sustainable) how sustainable
is the Programme. Chart 6.8 shows that the majority of respondents thought the Programme is ‘somewhat
sustainable’. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the Programme’s sustainability as a 6.0 on a 10-
point scale. School heads (mean=6.8), SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=6.7) and coaches (mean=6.4)
were equally like to report that the Programme is ‘somewhat sustainable’, whereas teachers (mean=5.6) were
slightly less likely to think the Programme is sustainable.

ensure sustainability, however, teachers need additional training on how to implement the Programme, including
training on how to develop lessons plans and how to teach using differentiated teaching approaches and testing.

there is a lot of resistance to the Programme. Teachers considered developing lessons plans a lot of work and
writing. Some teachers developed daily lesson plans only because it is mandatory. Yet, they explained, “We don’t

explained, “I don’t use it [the Programme], so why should I develop the lesson plans if I don’t use it [differentiated
teaching approaches]” (School 3).
Another challenge to sustainability is that new school heads and teachers have not been trained on the Programme,
so they do not understand the Programme or know how to implement it. For a variety of reasons, since the
61
pandemic and the enactment of the Automatic Promotion Policy, the Programme is not being implemented at the
same level as it was prior to the pandemic.
6.4.2. To what extent the contents of the approach and its implementation modality have a potential
for scaling and mainstreaming? Is there political will to support the mainstreaming of principles
and approach in the education system?
Respondents were asked to rank on a scale of 1 to 10 (1=not likely to 10=very likely) how likely is it that the
Programme will be scaled up and mainstreamed into all SOEBGS schools. Chart 6.9 shows that the majority of
respondents thought it is ‘somewhat likely’ that the Programme will be scaled up and mainstreamed into all SOEBGS
schools. On average, the full sample of respondents ranked the likelihood of the Programme’s scale up as a 6.9
on a 10-point scale. SOEBGS management and counsellors (mean=7.4), were slightly more likely than school heads
(mean=6.9) and coaches (mean=6.6) to believe it is likely that the Programme will be scaled up and mainstreamed
into all SOEBGS schools. Teachers were not asked this question.

across the country. SOEBGS also needs qualified/certified personnel who can provide trainings and technical
assistance to schools heads and teachers on all components of the Programme and how to properly implement the
Programme in schools and classrooms.
6.4.3. To what extent did the Programme build upon and contribute to increasing existing national
and local government capacities to deliver child-centred learning in primary education? What
new capacities within education services have been established or restored?
As previously mentioned, prior to the pandemic, the Programme was highly relevant to the Surinamese context
and national primary education curricula; and it remains so today. In the years prior to the launch of the
Programme, MINOWC had been discussing the need to reform the national primary education model and introduce
differentiated teaching approaches that tailor instruction to students’ learning needs. MINOWC recognized that the
traditional teacher-centred pedagogy that has long been at the centre of the country’s primary education model
was not effective for all students, as many students were having to repeat primary school grades and were not
transitioning from primary to secondary education. Given the high rates of grade repetition and school dropout,
MINOWC envisioned differentiated teaching approaches as a way to meet the learning needs of all students,
regardless of the differences in their abilities.
In 2012, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) provided the GoS with a USD 13.7 million loan to help improve
the quality of education from pre-primary through lower secondary education. The funds supported the GoS’s plans
to strengthen the efficiency and quality of the new basic education system and increase the learning outcomes in
core subjects of language (Dutch) and mathematics for students in pre-primary, primary and lower secondary
education. The Basic Education Improvement Programme (BEIP) was to be implemented in two phases. Phase I
focused on developing the curriculum framework for the entire basic education system and on increasing learning
outcomes of students in grades 1-8; whereas Phase II centred on improving learning outcomes in the lower
secondary grades.135 A review and analysis of the BEIP was beyond the scope of this evaluation; however, it was
discussed at times by a handful of teachers who participate in trainings related to the BEIP or spoke about the new
135 Suriname to improve education with IDB support. IDB News Release, 22 June 2012. Retrieved on 26 March 2023 from:
Suriname to improve education with IDB support | IADB
63
BEIP textbooks and assignments that target different types of students. It was reported, however, that BEIP-related
teaching materials are only available up to grade 3.
Thus, the UNICEF-supported Differentiated Education Programme has built upon and contributed to increasing
efforts of the MINOWC to deliver student-centred learning in primary education, particularly by capacitating
SOEBGS school heads and teachers to assess the learning needs of students and to teach using differentiated
teaching approaches to meet the learning needs of students. Still, however, there is a need for increased investment
and more capacity building and technical assistance to build upon the progress made and ensure differentiated
education and student-centred learning are scaled up and mainstreamed into all SOEBGS schools, and adopted by
MINOWC for rollout in government-run primary schools and other faith-based school systems.
6.4.4. To which extent is the approach externally driven and owned or managed by SOEBGS schools?
How have UNICEF and stakeholders ensured SOEBGS and school ownership of the approach
(i.e., intrinsically driven to apply the approach)?
The Programme is owned and managed by SOEBGS management, but has not yet been fully embraced and owned
by all SOEBGS school heads and teachers. Because the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted Programme
implementation, progress that was made at scaling up and mainstreaming the Programme into all SOEBGS primary
schools was diminished. Still, however, SOEBGS management recognized that “some school really own it [the
Differentiated Education Programme] and do it [use differentiated education and teaching approaches].”
Thus, as the pandemic comes to an end and schools return to operating normally, SOEBGS management and UNICEF
saw this as an opportune time to assess and evaluate where the Programme is at and how it can be reinvigorating
the Programme. Based upon these evaluation findings and lessons learned, it is also an opportune time to make
revisions to the Programme and strengthen it going forward.
6.4.5. How much of a continuous “external input” does it require (e.g., monitoring, training and
provision of materials) for sustainability? What are the implications and requirements for
potentially transitioning to a completely SOEBGS- run/owned approach? To what extent does
the SOEBGS have sufficient financial and human resources and capacities to maintain the
benefits produced by the Programme?
Any effort to ensure sustainability of the Programme requires continued external inputs, including financial support
and technical assistance to support a review and revisions to the Programme manual and workbook based upon
lessons learned from this evaluation, and the development of improved capacity building trainings and training
materials for continued trainings of counsellors, school heads and teachers. Ongoing trainings should focus on
‘winning the hearts and minds’ of counsellors, schools and teachers to be change agents and champions of
differentiated education and tailored instruction that meets the learning needs of students. This includes financial
support to ensure that Programme-related manuals, workbooks and teaching materials are readily available to all
teachers in all SOEBGS schools.
External inputs are also needed to ensure that schools and teachers have the resources and materials they need to
practice differentiated education in the classroom. This includes reusable educational and teaching aids, such as
visual teaching materials, blocks and furniture to create reading and math coroners in schools and classrooms.
External inputs are also needed to support results-based monitoring, including the development of a results-based
monitoring framework and tools that can be implemented and utilized by SOEBGS management, counsellors and
school heads. SOEBGS counsellors should also be capacitated and supported to visit schools and deliver trainings,
provide technical assistance and do monitoring to support implementation of the Programme. Monitoring
information and data should then be used to inform bi-annual results-based monitoring meetings of SOEBGS
management, counsellors and school heads to ensure Programme implementation is progressing as planned and
differentiated education is being mainstreamed into all schools and classrooms.
It is also important to create a community of practice for and opportunities for school heads and teachers from
different schools to learn from each other and see for themselves that there is a movement to implement the
Differentiated Education Programme in all SOEBGS primary schools and the Programme is benefiting students and
teachers alike.
64
If it is considered a good approach, external inputs would be need to support the establishment and rollout of a
specialized Differentiated Education Unit that is made up of highly trained individuals who are champions for the
Programme and can conduct Programme-related trainings for school heads and teachers, and provide schools with
regular technical assistance and guidance on how to implement the Programme. A Differentiated Education Unit
can help to mainstream differentiated education into all schools and classrooms, including all grades and subjects.
6.5. Equity, Gender Equality and Human Rights-Based Approaches
6.5.1. To what extent have human rights-based approaches and equity and gender equality goals and
processes been incorporated into planning documents and resource materials of the
Programme interventions? To what extent has the approach been effective to advance
equitable access to education and learning?
The Programme was developed to ensure that all children have access to education and supported education
equity, as differentiated education is necessary to ensure equity in the classroom. As previously mentioned, the
traditional teacher-centred pedagogy, that has long been at the centre of the country’s primary education model,
has been recognized as ineffective, and many students were having to repeat primary school grades and were not
transitioning from primary to secondary education. Given the high rates of grade repetition and school dropout
(particularly among children living in poor households and the rural interior, and among Surinamese Maroon
children), differentiated teaching approaches were envisioned as a way to meet the learning needs of all students,
regardless of the differences in their abilities. Thus, the Differentiated Education Programme was designed
specifically to capacitate teachers to develop and use differentiated teaching approaches, materials and assessment
measures to ensure that all students within a classroom can learn effectively, regardless of the differences in their
learning needs and abilities.
6.5.2. To what extent did the different groups, including children with disabilities and other most
marginalised children, benefit in different ways from the approach?
Initially, the Differentiated Education Programme was introduced in the two special schools operated by SOEBGS.
After seeing the benefits of differentiated education on children in the special schools, SOEBGS and NGO SAGA
Foundation decided to partner and adapt differentiated education initiative in special schools to SOEBGS primary
schools. Since its inception in primary schools in 2018, it has been used by some teachers to work with children with
learning disabilities who are studying in primary schools. This includes children in star 1 groups who have not been
officially diagnosed with a learning disability, but teachers believe the child may have some form of learning
disability given the challenges they face in the classroom. However, not all children with learning disabilities have
benefited from differentiated education because they need more specialized education.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The section offers conclusions that are derived from the findings and present a picture of the strengths and
limitations of the Programme as it relates to the Programme's goal, objective and aims, and the Programme’s
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. The conclusions are followed by evidence-based lessons
learned and recommendations which are forward-looking and offer short-, medium- and long-term opportunities
to strengthen and scale-up the Programme to the next phase. The conclusions, lessons learned and
recommendations are grounded in the evaluation findings and based upon good practices for implementing similar
programmes in educational systems.
7.1. Conclusions
Conclusion 1: The three-year Implementation plan for the Programme (2018-2020) was interrupted and impacted
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Training of SOEBGS counsellors, school heads and coaches occurred in 2018-2019, as
initially planned. In 2019, coaches began to train other teachers in their schools to implement the Programme;
however, activities planned for 2020 were interrupted in March 2020 by the pandemic. Because of the pandemic,
SOEBGS management and NGO SAGA Foundation were unable to perform school visits and provide refresher
trainings that were initially envisioned. During the pandemic, SOEBGS management and school staff shifted their
focus to delivering education to students remotely, largely via television and radio; as a result, teachers had limited
contact with students and were unable to assess their learning or use differentiated teaching approaches. When
students returned to the classroom, school heads and teachers were focused on reintegrating children into the
classroom, delivering curriculum and limiting contact between children to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools.
At the time of this evaluation, Programme activities had ended although were not fully completed due to the
pandemic, but schools were still implementing the Programme to varying degrees (paragraphs 177-181).
7.1.1. Relevance
Conclusion 2: In 2020, during the pandemic, the MINOWC enacted the Automatic Promotion Policy, a practice of
allowing students to progress from one class/grade to the next higher class/grade at the end of the school year
regardless of academic performance or educational attainment. The Automatic Promotion Policy has had a
significant impact on the effectiveness of the Programme. The challenge is that teachers perceive students as being
less motivated to learn, and as a result, teachers are less motivated to expend more time and energy to help to
address students learning gaps and needs, because both groups know that the student will be promoted to the next
grade at the end of the year, regardless of their learning outcome and academic achievements, or lack thereof
(paragraphs 235-237).
Conclusion 3: The Programme was designed and implemented to support SOEBGS to implement differentiated
education in their 56 primary schools in an effort to tailoring instruction to students’ learning needs. SOEBGS
recognized that the traditional teacher-centred pedagogy that has long been at the centre of the country’s primary
education model was not effective for all students, as many students were having to repeat primary school grades
and were not transitioning from primary to secondary education. Given the high rates of grade repetition and school
dropout, SOEBGS envisioned that a student-centred pedagogy that relies upon differentiated teaching approaches
as a way to meet the learning needs of all students, regardless of differences in their abilities. It was envisioned
that the Programme would help to reduce grade repetition and improve academic performance. The Programme
was also aligned with educational reforms that MINOWC had been discussing (paragraphs 182-183).
Conclusion 4: The Programme’s objectives, strategies and activities were relevant to the national context and
primary education. On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.3 on a 10-point scale (1=not relevant to
10=very relevant) as being relevant to the national context and primary education. This included strengthening
teacher trainings and building teachers’ knowledge and skills to apply differentiated teaching approaches in the
classroom to teach all students, and to give additional attention to students who struggled to learn. The aim of the
Programme was also to improve student learning and academic performance in the areas of literacy and numeracy.
The Programme was also recognized as important at preparing teachers to use differentiated teaching approaches
in the classroom. On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.8 on a 10-point scale of importance (1=not
important to 10=very important) (paragraphs 184-194 and 197-204).
66
7.1.2. Effectiveness
Conclusion 5: The Programme was evidence-based and modelled after a similar programme introduced in SOEBGS
special schools, in cooperation with NGO SAGA Foundation. To support the Programme, NGO SAGA Foundation
developed a Programme manual and workbook for teachers; then trained school head and two teachers (coaches)
from each of the 56 primary schools. The coaches were expected to return to their schools and deliver trainings on
the Programme to their colleagues, as well as to coach their colleagues to properly develop daily lesson plans, apply
a three-star system of categorizing students and use differentiated teaching approaches in the classrooms. Not all
coaches followed through with these responsibilities for a variety of reasons, including: lack of commitment or buy-
in to use differentiated education in the classroom; lack of understanding of differentiated education based upon
the trainings received; lack of capacities and/or time to train and coach their colleagues; resistance from their
colleagues; and lack of support from school heads (paragraphs 195-204).
Conclusion 6: There were several advantage and disadvantages to the Programme’s teacher trainings. Advantages
included: The Programme’s teacher training reinforces good differentiated education and teaching that school
heads and teachers recognize benefit students and help them to move from one grade to the next, particularly
before the pandemic; teachers who were trained to be coaches were provided with a Programme manual and
workbook; Programme’s teacher training, if delivered properly and in its entirety, can capacitate teacher to
understand and apply differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom; and the Programme’s teacher training
succeeded at capacitating teachers to develop daily lesson plans, to varying degrees (paragraphs 208-213 and 221-
229).
In comparison, disadvantages included: SOEBGS counsellors were not fully capacitated or committed to support
schools to implement the Programme; there was no clear criteria or guidance provided to school heads for selecting
teachers to be trained as coaches to support the implementation of the Programme, and teachers who were
selected to be coaches were not clearly informed as to what would be their roles and responsibilities as coaches in
their schools; school heads should have received the same trainings that coaches received so that they full
understood all components of the Programme, as well as additional trainings on how to manage the Programme’s
implementation and support teachers education in the classroom; and to varying degree, teachers were capacitated
to use differentiated teaching approaches in the classroom, but they were not capacitated on how to use
differentiated testing; and the cascade training approach was wrought with challenges (paragraphs 214-220 and
221-229).
Conclusion 7: The Programme helped to improve teacher performance and abilities to address the different needs
of students, and to mad teaching and learning more inclusive, but to varying degrees. On average, respondents
ranked the Programme as a 6.0 on a 10-point scale (1=not at all to 10=very much) at contributing to increasing the
capacities of SOEBGS primary schools to use differentiate teaching approaches that are focused on improving child
learning. Some respondents pointed out that before the pandemic many more teachers were more actively applying
the Programme, but now there are new teachers who have never heard of the Programme; thus, they called for
more trainings on differentiated education. Some schools have expanded the Programme beyond grades 3-6, as
originally planned, and are now trying to implement the Programme in pre-school and the upper grades. At the
same time, however, not all teachers are implementing the Programme in the classroom and teachers complain
that developing daily lesson plans is a lot of writing and time consuming. As a result, teachers from many of the
schools reported that they have reverted back to using traditional teaching-centred pedagogy (paragraphs 235-
243).
Conclusion 8: The Programme was ‘somewhat effective’ at achieving its objectives, including: preparing teacher to
identify and assess the learning needs of students; adapting teaching approaches to teach students with different
learning abilities; and preparing teachers to use visual teaching materials during lesson plans to teach students in
more playful and interactive ways. On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 5.0 on a 10-point scale
(1=not effective to 10=very effective) at preparing teachers to identify and assess the learning needs of students,
and ranked the Programme as a 5.3 on 10-point effectiveness scale at preparing teachers to adapt their teaching
approaches to teach students with different learning abilities. Teachers were more likely to rank the Programme at
‘not so effective’ at accomplishing these the first objectives, due largely to the fact that the cascade training
approach was not so effective. As it relates to preparing teachers to use visual teaching materials during lesson
plans to teach students in a more playful and interactive way, respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.2 on a 10-
67
point scale of effectiveness. Teachers complained, however, that schools lack the resources and materials that
teachers need to create their own visual teaching materials (paragraphs 247-267).
Conclusion 9: On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.5 on a 10-point scale (1=not effective to
10=very effective) at preparing teachers to take a more active role in developing their lesson plans. Coaches
recognized that spending more time on developing lesson plans improves the way teachers teach and their relations
with students; however, not all teachers are developing daily lesson plans or understand the importance of the
lesson plans. Many teachers tend to see the lesson plans as time consuming and not very useful. Teachers also
complained that they have to pay to photocopy the lesson plan forms and the costs can be high for teachers,
particularly those teachers who teach math and language (paragraphs 268-273).
Conclusion 10: This evaluation found that nearly all respondents identified the need more training and training
materials (90 percent), as well as educational and teaching materials (90 percent). The majority of respondents also
identified the need for better collaboration, coordination and cooperation (72 percent), improvements to the
classroom environment (70 percent)and more resources (56 percent). Fewer respondents also identified the need
for improvements to the school environment (20 percent), improved Programme management (18 percent) and
more Programme monitoring and monitoring tools (9 percent) (paragraphs 277-292).
Conclusion 11: UNICEF and SOEBGS learned that two years was not enough time to implement the Programme to
the extent that it was able to change the culture of schools and reform education in primary schools to include
differentiated education. Nor was there enough time to really assess the Programme’s effectiveness and impacts,
or to ensure sustainability. Schools need a longer period of time to be capacitated to possess the knowledge,
attitudes and skills to effectively implement the Programme as a whole school approach. SOEBGS schools would
benefit from an additional training and technical assistance to implement the Programme, and additional resources
to ensure that schools have the training and teaching materials needed to fully implement the Programme in all 56
primary schools (paragraphs 293-295).
7.1.3. Efficiency
Conclusion 12: Given the lost learning time and learning losses experienced by children during the pandemic,
additional resources are needed to support programming, such as the Differentiated Education Programme, that
aim to help students recover from learning losses and to catch-up from unfinished learning. Ultimately, there is
much work to be done, yet the challenges for educators, students and parents are considerable and will require
educational reforms and interventions that include a focus on differentiated education and tailored or remedial
instruction that focuses on helping teachers to deal with students who are not prepared for the classroom and the
materials and at very different levels of understanding (paragraphs 297-298).
7.1.4. Sustainability
Conclusion 13: : This evaluation found limited evidence that the Programme will be sustainable after only two-years
of implementation; more time is needed for Implementation. On average, in terms of sustainability, respondents
ranked the Programme as a 6.0 on a 10-point scale (1=not sustainable to 10=very sustainable). : There were
challenge and barriers to Programme implementation that need to be addressed for the Programme to be
sustainable. To ensure sustainability, school heads and teachers need additional training on how to implement the
Programme, including training on how to develop lessons plans and how to teach using differentiated teaching
approaches and testing. They also need educational and teaching materials, and differentiated tests that are aligned
with teaching based upon the three-star system. Respondents also recognized that there needs to be better
cooperation among teachers in schools and support from school heads to implement the Programme; this is
because there is a lot of resistance to the Programme. (paragraphs 299-307).
Conclusion 14: On average, respondents thought it ‘somewhat likely’ that the Programme will be scaled up and
mainstreamed into all SOEBGS schools. On average, respondents ranked the Programme as a 6.9 on a 10-point scale
(1=not likely to 10=very likely) that it has the potential for scaling up and mainstreaming. Schools, however, need
to be provided with the resources and educational and teaching materials for the Programme to be scaled up and
mainstreamed into all SOEBGS schools. Additional invests also need to be made to ensure that the Programme is
implemented in schools in the interior, to ensure that teachers in the interior are properly capacitated and provided
with the technical assistance they need, coupled with the resources and educational and teaching materials
(paragraphs 308-312).
68
Conclusion 15: Any effort to ensure sustainability of the Programme requires continued external inputs, including
financial support and technical assistance to support a review and revisions to the Programme manual and
workbook based upon lessons learned from this evaluation, and the development of improved capacity building
trainings and training materials for continued trainings of counsellors, school heads and teachers. This includes
financial support to ensure that Programme-related manuals, workbooks and teaching materials are readily
available to all teachers in all SOEBGS schools. External inputs are also needed to ensure that schools and teachers
have the resources and materials they need to practice differentiated education in the classroom. This includes
reusable educational and teaching aids, such as visual teaching materials, blocks and furniture to create reading and
math coroners in schools and classrooms (paragraphs 318-322).
7.2. Lessons Learned
There were several lessons learned that emerged in the findings from this evaluation. Given the formative nature
of this evaluation, the lessons learned are forward-looking with considerations for the short-, medium and long-
term. If there are plans going forward to continue to support the Programme’s implementation and to scale-up the
Programme, these lessons learned will be relevant to SOEBGS, as well as MINOWC and other faith-based school
systems in Suriname that plan to implement differentiated education. Lessons learned include:
1. In Suriname, educational institutions and educators are slow to change, including to transition from teacher-
centred pedagogy to student-centred differentiated education and teaching pedagogy. Thus, efforts to ‘win the
hearts and minds’ of school heads and teachers to implement the Programme on a daily basis in the classroom
requires significant capacity building and technical assistance, as well as a demonstration of results and proper
allocations of resources.
2. Counsellors, school heads and teachers all need to be properly capacitated and mentored to implement the
Programme and to work together as a team to implement the Programme, as a whole school approach. A whole
school approach will increase the responsibility and engagement of all teachers in the Programme. SOEBGS
primary schools need school heads and teachers who are willing to champion the Programme.
3. SOEBGS counsellors need to be agents of change and champions of the Programme, and they need to be fully
capacitated and certified to train school heads and teachers on all components of the Programme, and to assess
its implementation in the classroom. They should also be required to participate in annual refresher trainings
related to the Programme and re-certified every five years. Each SOEBGS counsellor should also have an annual
plan for visiting schools and deliver refresher trainings and technical assistance to each of the SOEBGS primary
schools in their cluster to strengthen the roll out and mainstreaming of the Programme in all SOEBGS primary
schools.
4. School heads need to be committed to the Programme and capacitated to support a whole school approach for
Programme implementation. In keeping, school heads need to serve as role models to teachers and regularly
communicate and demonstrate their commitment to the Programme, and ensure that all teachers are
capacitated to implement the Programme. To achieve this, all school heads should receive the same in-depth
training that coaches received, as well as additional trainings on how to manage the Programme’s
implementation and to support teachers to use differentiated education in the classroom. This includes training
on how to review and provide feedback on lesson plans to ensure that they are built around differentiated
education and teaching pedagogy.
5. There should be clear criteria and guidance for school heads to recruit and select teachers to be coaches, and
clearly defined roles and responsibilities for coaches. Teacher should know what is expected of them prior to
agreeing to be a coach. Also, teachers who are trained to be coaches should be offered an incentive and/or a
reduced teaching load to fulfil the defined roles and responsibilities as a coach.
6. All teachers should receive the same training that the coaches received, and should provide refresher trainings
on an annual basis. More specialized and advanced trainings on differentiated education should also be
developed and made available to teachers and school heads.
7. All teachers should be capacitated to develop lesson plans using differentiated teaching approaches, and to
align their lesson plans with required learning outcomes as per the subject and grade. These do not necessarily
need to be daily lesson plans, which is time consuming for teachers, but could be weekly lesson plans.
69
8. All school heads and teachers should be provided with a hard and/or digital copy of the Proramme manual and
workbook, and a copy of these documents should be made readily available in each school library, so that
teachers can easily access and/or sign out them for a few days at time.
9. SOEBGS needs to invest more resources in the Programme and identify a cadre of change agents and champions
of the Programme and imbed them in schools across the country.
10. SOEBGS needs qualified/certified personnel who can provide trainings and technical assistance to schools heads
and teachers on all components of the Programme and how to properly implement the Programme in schools
and classrooms.
11. The Programme’s trainings and tools should include differentiated testing and tests that teachers can use in the
classroom at each grade level. This will help to create more consistency across classes and primary schools as
to which students belong in star 1, 2 and 3 groups.
7.3. Recommendations
The recommendations that follow are based upon the evaluation findings and conclusions and lessons learned from
this evaluation, and were discussed with UNICEF CO staff, as well as SOEBGS school staff during data collection in
the field to understand if they are practical. Recommendations have also been guided by good practices identified
through the desk review. The level of participation of UNICEF CO and SOEBGS management and school staff in
helping to formulate recommendations was not in proportion to their level of participation in the intervention or
this evaluation.
The recommendations presented below aim to support the process of strengthening the implementation of the
Programme, particularly given the fact that it was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The recommendations
also aim to support scaling up and mainstreaming the Programme in all SOEBGS primary schools to encourage the
Programme’s sustainability. Following the recommendations is a prioritization and classification of each
recommendation based upon urgency, impact and difficulty (Table 7.1 ).
7.3.1. Strengthen Differentiated Education Programme-Related Materials
Recommendation 1: SOEBGS should review and revise all of the Differentiated Education Programme-related
materials, including training manuals and materials, and workbooks for teachers. Based upon the evaluation
findings, now is a good time (following the COVID-19 pandemic) for SOEBGS management to form a working
group/committee that will review and revise the Differentiated Education Programme-related materials, including
training manuals and materials, and workbooks for teachers. They should also develop additional Programme-
related materials to support Programme-related trainings and roll-out of the Programme in all primary school
grades, from pre-school to grade 8. The working group/committee should include representatives from SOEBGS
management, along with counsellors, schools heads and teachers, including those who have a solid working
knowledge of the Programme and are champions of the Programme. The advantage of having a whole of
organization approach to reviewing and revising Differentiated Educated Programme-related materials is that it will
help to support greater buy-in and commitment to the Programme throughout the organization.
It is very important that the working group/committee include one or two technical experts on differentiated
education. At least one of the technical experts should be an international expert who can bring to the table
international best practices on transforming education from the traditional teacher-centred pedagogy to student-
centred differentiated education and teaching approaches. Yet, they must also understand the challenges and
barriers, and lesson learned that have already been documented when it comes to rolling out the Differentiated
Education Programme in Suriname from 2018-2023, in particularly findings outlined in this evaluation. The technical
expert(s) should work very closely with the working group/committee to review and revise Programme-related
materials to strengthen them and address their shortcomings, which were brought to the forefront in this
evaluation, and will continue into the future (e.g., financial, human and material resources in the education sector).
As part of the review and revise process, the working group/committee and technical experts, should strengthen
and expand Programme-related materials (i.e., training materials, manuals and workbooks) to cover pre-school and
grades 1-8 (all primary school grades). In keeping with lessons learned, Programme manuals and workbooks need
70
to be grade-specific to ensure that the curricula, lesson plans and activities are relevant to students of all grades
and ages. To accomplish this, Programme-related materials need to advance with each grade and be transformative
in ways that promote progression or advancements in student-centred learning in literacy (language) and numeracy
(mathematics), as well as social and emotional learning.
Recommendation 2: SOEBGS should develop standardized differentiated testing for star 1, 2 and 3 students at
each grade-level to support the Differentiated Education Programme. This evaluation found that school heads
and teachers need standardized differentiated tests that can be used for star 1, 2 and 3 students at each grade-
level, because the current practice of having one test for all students does not allow teachers to properly measure
student learning and assess whether star 1 and 2 students are progressing, and when to move students from star 1
to 2 and star 2 to 3. Thus, to improve the Programme, Programme-related materials should include standardized
differentiated test for star 1, 2 and 3 students at each grade-level, along with clear guidance to how such testing
should be used in the classroom to monitor student’s progression and advancement in literacy (language) and
numeracy (mathematics).
Standardized differentiated testing should be developed and built around grade-specific rubrics in education that
define the expectations, criteria and quality levels for students performance on a test or assessment. Rubrics are
used to promote consistency in evaluation, measuring learning outcomes and to provide feedback to students based
upon the national curricula by grade-level, which means that students are judged against a set of standards, not
against each other. Standardized differentiated testing will help to ensure consistency in testing across classes and
schools, and proper categorizations of students by grade into star 1, 2 and 3 groups, which will help to reduce bias.
Differentiated testing should be used periodically throughout the school year to ensure that children’s learning
progress is regularly assessed during the school year, so student can move from one star group to the another when
they are ready to ensure a progression of learning that is aligned with their capabilities, which should improve
throughout the school year. Students should not remain stuck in a star group from which they have advanced.
Recommendation 3: SOEBGS needs to establish an annual budget for and invest in purchasing materials that
schools and teachers need in the classroom to teach using differentiated education and teaching strategies. This
evaluation found that schools were not provided with the materials need to teaching using differentiated education,
including materials needed to create educational and visual learning aids that can be used it the classroom to engage
children in the learning process. Thus, it is crucial that SOEBGS have a budget for and invest in purchasing materials
that schools and teachers need in the classroom to teach using different education and teaching strategies. This
includes materials needed to teaching using art, which is a key component of the Programme, and materials to
create story boards, words walls, and reading and math coroners. Schools should also be provided with an inventory
of reusable visual teaching aids that can be regularly in the classrooms of each grade to teach students language
and mathematics. The investment in such materials, including educational and visual aids, will demonstrate and
communicate to teachers their commitment to differentiated education and teaching strategies in primary schools.
7.3.2. Strengthen Differentiated Education Programme Implementation and Monitoring
Recommendation 4: SOEBGS should establish a Differentiate Education Programme Unit to strengthen
Programme implementation and monitoring. This evaluation found that SOEBGS counsellors have not been
effective at supporting or capacitating primary schools to implement the Programme; moreover, the majority of
counsellors were not change agents or champions of the Programme. Thus, if SOEBGS is committed to
strengthening Differentiated Education programme implementation and monitoring, they should consider
establishing a Differentiated Education Programme Unit that would be staffed with change agents and champions
of the Differentiated Education Programme. Members of this Unit should be fully capacitated to understand the
Differentiated Education Programme and all Programme-related materials and tools. Thy should also be certified to
train school staff on the Differentiated Education Programme, and capacitated to monitor how schools are
implementing differentiated education. Members of the Unit should work with school heads to develop capacity
building plans to strengthen and improve their abilities to implement the Differentiated Education Programme in
their schools, in partnership with teachers, and to do so in the proper way using all Programme-related materials.
Members of this Unit should be key players in school’s capacity building plans, serving as trainers and coaches for
school heads and teachers, and monitoring partners.
To improve the Programme and its implementation, member of the Differentiated Education programme Unit
should be agents of change and champions of the Programme. Members of the Unit should also be required to
participate in annual refresher trainings related to the Programme and be re-certified every five years. Each
71
member of the Unit should also have an annual plan for visiting schools and delivering refresher trainings and
technical assistance to each of the SOEBGS primary schools in their cluster to strengthen the roll out and
mainstreaming of the Programme in all SOEBGS primary schools. If a Differentiated Education Programme Unit is
not established to fulfil the above roles and responsibilities, than SOEBGS counsellors should be capacitated to do
the same.
Recommendation 5: SOEBGS should expand the Differentiated Education Programme to include Teaching at the
Right Level (TaRL)136, which is a form of differentiated instruction that would help students who have fallen
behind in learning due to the pandemic to catch-up, particularly in literacy and numeracy. This evaluation
revealed that one of the major challenges teachers are facing in the classroom at the primary level is that students
are at very different levels of learning the curriculum, particularly for language (literacy) and mathematics
(numeracy), which are subjects crucial to be a productive member of society. As teachers are confronted with
students at very different levels of the curriculum, they are often unable to devote the time and attention needed
to help students who have fallen behind to catch-up in literacy and numeracy; thus, it is crucial that SOEBGS think
about and deal with this situation in a way that supports teachers and benefits students.
To address this situation, SOEBGS should introduce TaRL137, an approach that has been proven successful in Africa,
and builds upon good practices promoted by the World Bank and UNESCO to address learning losses due to the
pandemic. TaRL aims to build foundational skills in math and reading for all students before exiting primary school.
At the instruction level, the approach works by assessing children’s learning levels using simple tools or tests and
then grouping children based on learning levels, rather than age or grade. Students can learn in their grade
appropriate classroom for most of the day, but subjects such as language and mathematics, they are not in the
classrooms that respond to their age, but in the classroom that respond to their learning level. Thus, classes are
rearranged according to basic learning levels and teachers are assigned to teach a group of students at the same
learning level, regardless of their age. For instance, all students who have language skills at a 2nd grade level will be
grouped together in the same classroom, regardless of their age. This way the teacher that is assigned to teach
language at the 2nd grade level can work with a classroom of students with similar language skills, regardless of their
age. The same would hold true for mathematics, all children who have math skills at a 4th grade level will be group
together in the same classroom, regard of their age. Such as approach, allow students who learn at a lower level
than their age can learn with other students who are at the same level, but also student who learn at a higher level
than their age can learn with other students who are at the same level.
TaRL focuses on foundational skills, rather than solely on the curriculum and tracks children’s progress. Also, TaRL
helps to ensure that teacher receive the support that they need to ensure that all children are being taught and
learning at the level that is appropriate to their learning level and not their age. If done properly, TaRL will allow
children to catch-up and allow teachers to not be overwhelmed in the classroom.
7.3.3. Strengthen Capacity Building Trainings for the Differentiated Education Programme
Recommendation 6: SOEBGS should roll out Differentiated Education Programme-related trainings to all SOEBGS
school heads and teachers over a two-year period. This evaluation found that the Programme was integrated to
varying degrees in each of the schools, however, none of the primary schools were able to fully implement the
Programme in the two-year period. At this stage, the Programme’s sustainability is limited in each of the primary
schools because they have not had enough time, commitment or buy-in from the majority of school staff to
implement the Programme as originally envisioned, i.e., as a whole school approach. Moreover, not all school staff
felt that they had been capacitated enough to understand how to implement the Programme. This is largely because
a cascade training approach was used, that involved coaches, but did not work well.
To improve Programme implementation, all counsellors, school heads and teachers should be required to complete
the same intensive training that was delivered to coaches under the aegis of the Programme. Thus, SOEBGS would
benefit from another two years of support to ensure all school heads and teachers are properly trained on the
Programme. SOEBGS should consider a combination of Paramaribo-based trainings for school heads and staff who
are able to travel to Paramaribo to participate in the trainings, and region- or district-based trainings for school
heads and staff who are unable to travel to Paramaribo to participate in the trainings. School heads and staff should

Programme. The induction training should be the same
intensive training received by all other school heads and
teachers (see Recommendation 5). Such induction trainings on the Differentiated Education Programme are
important because they will help to ensure that all new school heads and teachers have the relevant information,
knowledge and skills needed to teach using differentiated education pedagogy and teaching approaches effectively
and to become productive members of the school team. It also helps team adjust to their new work environment
and the other teachers and students who are around them. Such an induction training can also help to curb the
current practice of teachers who are resistant to differentiated education from negatively influencing new school
and teachers through a process of occupational or organization socialization that reinforces resistance to
differentiated education.
Recommendation 8: SOEBGS should consider developing a full-package of content and ‘how-to videos’ for school
staff that will capacitate them on how to roll-out all components of the Programme. This evaluation found that
SOEBGS counsellors, school heads and teachers need more resources that will help them to understand the
Programme and how to implement the Programme in the classroom, including teaching Programme-related
activities from the Programme’s manual and workbook. During the evaluation, the evaluator explored teacher’s
interest in having access to a full-package of Programme manuals, workbooks and ‘how to videos’ that would help
to build their capacities and show them how to roll out all components of the Programme in the classroom, and to
do so properly. School heads and teachers expressed a desire in having access to a full-package of content and
‘how-to-videos’ that can be access by and used by school heads and teachers, both when and as needed, to support
school-based capacity building on differentiated education.
Both written and video content should be easy to navigate and consume for the users. This includes content related
to, but not limited to: how to identify and assess student’s learning needs; how to teach using visual and teaching
aids; how teach and work with students in groups; how to deliver differentiated education in the classroom (what
does it look like?); how to effectively support and communicate with students who are having a difficult time
learning; how to support and communicate with students who excel academically; and more. Teachers expressed
interest in having access to such materials readily available in an online platform, but also built into tablets that can
be distributed to schools. Many schools lack access to the internet and to computers; thus, distribution of tablets
that are built specifically for this Programme was viewed as a practical and viable way of making sure that all schools
have equal access to the same Programme materials and capacity building opportunities. Such video content should
be available to all school staff free of charge.
It is recommended that SOEBGS should consider developing a full-package of content and ‘how-to videos’ for school
staff on how to roll out and implement all components of the Programme. Such content should include a
combination of written, lecture and video content that are available online and/or on tables. The full-package of
content and ‘how-to-videos’ should provide very practical guidance on how to implement all components of the
Programme, effectively and properly. These how-to videos can be made part of a resource package of materials for
school staff and is available online at the Differentiated Education Programme website, and on tablets that are built
to contain Programme-specific content and are distributed to schools (one tablet per school).
Recommendation 9: SOEBGS should develop a schedule for delivering refresher trainings related to the
Differentiated Education Programme on an annual basis, as well as for more specialized and advanced trainings
on differentiated education for counsellors, school heads and teachers. Training for the Differentiated Education
Programme should not be a one-off, counsellors, school heads and teachers needs refresher trainings on an annual

design and implementation and approach, which
meant that not all counselllors, school heads and
teachers were provided with Programme-related materials, including the manual and workbook for teachers. Thus,
it is important that going forward all school heads and teachers are provided with a hard and/or digital copy of the
Programme manual and workbook for teachers. If SOEBGS plans to review and revise Programme-related materials,
they should wait to roll out these new Programme-related materials to all all counsellors, school heads and teachers,
until the revised materials are ready and will be used during Programme-related trainings.
In the meantime, each school should have at least one or two copies of each of the original Programme-related
materials, including the manual and workbook for teachers, made readily available in their school libraries, so that
teachers can easily access and/or sign them out for a few days at a time. In most schools, school heads and/or
coaches have one or both of the these documents, which they are not using, and they can be instructed to palce in
the school’s library for all school heads and teachers to use and access. School should inform school staff as to when
they are placed in the library with instructions as to how to access them.
7.3.4. Secure External Support for the Differentiated Education Programme
Recommendation 11: UNICEF and SOEBGS should continue to partner in an effort to strengthen and support
ongoing rollout and implementation of the Differentiated Education Programme. This evaluation found that the
Programme was integrated to varying degrees in each of the primary schools, however, none of the schools were
able to fully implement the Programme in the two-year period. At this stage, the Programme’s sustainability is
limited in each of the primary schools because they have not had enough time, commitment or buy-in from the
majority of school staff to implement the Programme as originally envisioned, i.e., as a whole school approach.
Moreover, not all school staff felt that they had been capacitated enough to understand how to implement the
Programme; in part, this is because the Programme was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For these reasons,
SOEBGS would benefit from another three years of support to strengthen and implement the Programme, and to
ensure the Programme is sustainable. If UNICEF and SOEBGS decide to no longer continue to support the
Programme’s implementation, these schools will most likely not continue to implement or scale up the Programme
as a whole school approach as originally envisioned.
Recommendation 12: SOEBGS should develop a ‘community of practice’ for the Programme where counsellors,
school heads and teachers can learn from each other, share good practices and lessons learned, and discuss and
solve challenges related to Programme implementation. This evaluation found that counsellors, school heads and
teachers from primary schools want opportunities to engage with school staff from other primary schools to learn
from each other as to how the Programme is being implemented, and to learn more about good practices. Even
within schools, school staff wanted to have a school-based community of practice where school staff in a particular
school can come together and receive capacity building trainings, develop plans to implement the Programme,
address challenges faced and possible solutions, and share good practices and lessons learned. Establishing a
Differentiated Education Programme Unit would help to support creating a community of practice.
74
Given the desire for and benefits of a community of practice among school staff engaged in implementing the
Programme, SOEBGS should develop a platform to establish a community of practice and organize exchanges at the
national level to support school staff from across schools to strengthen their capacities and commitments to
implement the Programme, and to learn from each other and share experiences and approaches. At the national
level, the community of practice can be encouraged through an online social media platform and an annual
Differentiated Education Programme conference. This requires a budget to support a national community of
practices for the Programme.
School staff should also be encouraged and supported with technical assistance and a budget to have a school-
based community of practice in which school heads and teachers can strengthen their work as a team, and learn
from each other as they implement the Programme. By strengthening cooperation between and among school staff
and schools through a community of practice, the Programme will become a larger movement among educators in
Suriname, particularly among those who take pride in career development and advancement.

1. Background
Access to quality education is one of the most effective interventions to empower children and adolescents with
the skills to function in and contribute to society. Access to education has broad effects on children and adolescent’s
development and well-being, including physical and mental health, social development, civic engagement, and
protection from hazardous and exploitative practices.
With the adoption of the SDGs, the Government of Suriname has committed to achieving universal completion of
primary and secondary education by 2030, with a greater focus on inclusiveness in education, including gender
parity. The primary education completion rate in Suriname is comparable with the average primary education
completion rate for Caribbean Small States, but lower than the average for Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Bear in mind, Suriname does not have an automatic system of promotion from one grade to another.
The Surinamese curriculum in basic education is partly out of date. There is an ad hoc system of strengthening
teaching skills and training of teachers. Generally, the teaching methods can be categorized as being ineffective
hence the high repetition rates (average repetition rate primary education was 15% in 2019). Students fall behind
on their academic performance which is evidenced by statistics. The various teacher training courses have so far
not led to a significant improvement in school performance. The data from several studies, (IDB Quarterly Bulletin,
World bank, UNESCO institute for Statistics, Onderzoek en Planning, Ministry of Education Science and Culture
(MinOWC)), show the following:
8. In the Caribbean region Suriname has the highest number of repeaters: 20% of the pupils in grade 1 of the
Primary School (GLO) are repeaters.
9. The national completion rate in primary education between 2012 and 2017 is on average around 54%. Thus,
almost half of the number of students in primary education do not pass the final exam to proceed to secondary
education.
80
10. Teachers are insufficiently trained in providing a differentiated approach to learning which responds to the class’s
dynamic
11. situation, talents and learning differences of pupils. By running a rigidly prescribed lesson plan, teachers
are not sufficiently responsive to differences between pupils and thus not all children get an equal opportunity
to excel in school and in everyday life
SURINAME EDUCATION SYSTEM
In Suriname, the educational system consists of pre-school, primary school, junior and senior secondary schools,
and vocational and tertiary education. Pre-school is a two-year program for children ages four and five and is usually
housed in a primary school. Currently pre-school is not compulsory. Compulsory primary school consists of Grades
1 to 6 for children ages 7-12. Completion of primary school was determined by examinations conducted nationwide
at the end of Grade 6 until 2020. Children enter lower secondary school at 12 years of age and upper secondary
education starts at 16 years of age; neither lower nor upper secondary education are compulsory. The Ministry of
Education aims to reform the education system and education legislation which dates to the 1960s when Suriname
was a Dutch colony. Reforms would focus on increasing the compulsory schooling for children ages 4-16, which would
include pre-primary, primary and lower secondary education, bringing compulsory education up to Grade 10. Almost
50% of the schools are faith based subsidized by the ministry and managed by the several religious organizations. The
SOEBGS owns and manages the majority of primary schools in the interior of Suriname.
Although some progress in capacity development of teachers has been made in past years through training by the
Education Foundation SOEBGS as well as the Ministry of Education, an integral structural policy for teacher’s
capacity development, which is in line with contemporary best practices on learning, is not yet in place. Existing
solutions have mostly been disintegrated refresher training programs which put a lot of pressure on the educational
process and is proven to be ineffective especially in the interior and other regions of the country where children do
not benefit from “the one fits all solution” as they have a different (ethnic) background, different needs, different
language skills. It has been observed that most schools still practice a more teacher-centred pedagogical approach.
This traditional approach limits the teachers in identifying the fast from the slow learners (students that take time
to understand core concepts or have specific issues why they are lagging behind) and the undertaking of remedial
(for slow learners) and enrichment (for fast learners) activities required for the different learning styles. Further,
although robust classroom assessments are included in the teacher instruction manuals and in teacher trainings,
they do not take place in a structured manner in the classroom and all students are treated the same, with minimal
adaptations to the teaching process.
2. OBJECT OF THE EVALUATION: PROGRAM ON DIFFERENTIATED LEARNING
It can be noted that the SOEBGS has made investments in capacity development of teachers in past years through
training. However, an integral structural policy for teacher’s capacity development, which is in line with
contemporary best practices on learning, is not yet in place. Existing solutions have mostly been disintegrated
refresher training programs which put a lot of pressure on the educational process and is proven to be ineffective
especially in the interior and other regions of the country where children do not benefit from “the one fits all
solution” as they have a different (ethnic) background, different needs, different language skills. It has been
observed that most schools still practice a more teacher-centred pedagogical approach. This traditional approach
limits the teachers in identifying the fast from the slow learners (students that take time to understand core
concepts or have specific issues why they are lagging behind) and the undertaking of remedial (for slow learners)
and enrichment (for fast learners) activities required for the different learning styles. Further, although robust
classroom assessments are included in the teacher instruction manuals and in teacher trainings, they do not take
place in a structured manner in the classroom and all students are treated the same, with minimal adaptations to
the teaching process.
In light of the above illustrated challenges, the current program on differentiated learning, by emphasizing the
mutual relationships between the training programs clearer and by integrating the training subjects, teachers are
81
strengthened in providing differentiated learning from a more holistic view on education. In 2018 the differentiated
learning program was developed which includes: differentiation in the classroom, multilingual support, anti-
bullying, creativity, and Activating Direct Instruction (ADI) centred around the taxonomy of Bloom. In the first stage
of the implementation 134 teachers received professional development in one module of the program. The goal of
the differentiated teaching method is to strengthen the skills and knowledge of teachers to enable transitioning into
innovative teaching methods to improve student’s learning. Through this program a teachers’ capacity development
concept was developed and is being implemented in the SOEBGS schools, with associated assessments/evaluations
to measure the success of the concept. The school grades of year 2017-2018 serves as a baseline.
Objective of the program on differentiated learning: The creation of an integrated capacity development
programme for teachers, training of coaches and supporting staff and the simultaneous implementation of the
teaching method to transition to differentiated student learning.
The program aims at achieving the following at the student level:
• By another way of asking questions (Socratic questioning) by the teacher, pupils creative thinking will be
activated.
• By differentiated teaching the teacher responds dynamically to the class situation, talents and learning
differences of pupils.
• By means of group overview the teachers get a good picture of the learning needs of the pupils and adapt
their approach (interpersonal, professional-pedagogical, didactic, and organizational) accordingly.
• Through better understanding of and working with flexible grouping there is more room for the teacher to
pay attention to the weak students and by doing so increase their opportunities.
The aim of the programme was to train 117 education staff (110 coaches from the SOEBGS, 5 education counsellors
and 2 project leaders), divided into 5 groups, that each received the same training offer (13 training days)
simultaneous. The 13 training days were spread over 5 modules in the period November 2018 – July 2019 t which
allowed the participants to immediately bring into practice what they had learned. The aim was also to
simultaneously implement the programme at the 56 primary schools SOEBGS through peer-to-peer coaching of 224
teachers (see annex 1: Result Framework). The integrated training programme consists of 5 parts, all of which, in
addition to the interconnectedness, are all connected with Bloom's Taxonomy (all teachers are already trained in
this) that stimulates higher thinking. The program components are:
• Working with non-native speakers (Dutch language development while retaining one's own language).
• Differentiated working in the classroom (use of Active Direct Instruction Model).
• No mek dreigi tron wan soro (Programme on bullying to raise awareness about the consequences and how to
stop bullying).
• Substantiated: a structured cognitive learning offer around development material and teaching material).
• Power of Art (Developing game and development materials to support the learning process). Key activities
included:
- Development of the differentiated teaching handbook and tools.
- Information sessions with key partners.
- Capacity building of coaches.
- Peer-to-peer coaching of teachers on the job.
- Monitoring of teacher development and progress.

The national stakeholder is the Ministry of Education (division responsible for teacher training CENASU and the
inspection department), as well as the board and management of the Moravian Foundation. Local stakeholders
other than mentioned in table above include School principals and teachers.
Education in Suriname has been interrupted since March 2020, as a result of COVID-19. More than 139,912 children
had been out-of-school as of September 2020, of which approximately 48 percent are primary school students.
While local schools instituted distance-learning initiatives, inequalities regarding access to computers/laptops and
other electronic devices, as well as the internet have exacerbated inequalities in education. Significant losses with
respect to learning and human capital development risk deepening inequalities over the long term.
Programme monitoring and pre- and post-assessment
• Pupil assessments: The effects of the transformation to a different way of teaching have been tracked through
administrative data on student performance. For more than 4 years now, St. Onderwijs der SOEBGS is keeping
track of the average grades per school, per quarter, at classroom level. The pupil’s performance of 2017-2018
serves as the baseline. In the 2 school years (2018-2020) thereafter (the period of the project), the grades /
students’ performance is compared per school year against the baseline. This to keep track of the progress.
Obviously, there are many variables that influence performance of the children, but these assessments are
crucial to confirm the success of the concept.
Teacher assessment: Coaches and teachers were assessed through portfolio assessment method and participation
in sessions.
3. PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION
It is proposed to carry out an evaluation that is formative and hence its main purpose will be to learn about
enabling factors, bottlenecks and challenges as input for learning and future action for improvement and scale up.
As this is a formative evaluation, its main aims are to further gain insight. It is expected that the evaluation will
gather information, data and evidence about UNICEF supported schools implementing the Differentiated
Education Programme, including data and evidence from before and during the pandemic determining the
relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability.
83
The evaluation is intended to draw recommendations for further improvement of the programme and exploring
potential for scaling up differentiated teaching to other grades, schools and inform national teacher training
programmes. Furthermore, provide strategic guidance to UNICEF in sharpening its focus areas of support to the
ministry for mainstreaming the differentiated teaching approach in education as well as the overall approach to
quality of education.
The intended utilization of the evaluation is to inform the fine-tuning of the ongoing implementation in the
Moravian primary schools (SOEBGS), to summatively assess the performance of the approach, and to provide
evidence to the national stakeholders on the pedagogical approach which could be incorporated into the national
curriculum for education.
The main users of the evaluation will be as follows. Those key stakeholders will be engaged through participatory
evaluation methodologies (which will be further determined at the inception phase):
• Management of faith-based schools
• Management of Moravian schools
• Ministry of Education (MINOWC)
• UNICEF
• Counsellors and coaches
4. OBJECTIVES OF THE EVALUATION
The main objective this formative evaluation is to assess to what extent, before and during the COVID-19
pandemic, the Differentiated Education Programme was successful in improving the performance of the SOEBGS
schools supported by UNICEF in terms of targeted components (learners, teachers, programme management and
alignment with MINOWC and policy frameworks) considering gender, equity and child rights; and analyze what
has or has not been working and why.
Specific objectives of this formative evaluation are the following:
• Assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of the differentiated student-oriented
programme in the 56 SOEBGS schools as a key enabler in promoting child-centred teaching and student’s
performance considering the interruptions in education during 2020-2021 due to COVID. More specifically:
- To assess the relevance of the differentiated learning approach in terms of the justification for such an
intervention (design relevancy).
- To assess the efficiency of the implementation process and to assess the cost related with the teaching and
learning approach, identifying the different cost components needed to take place to plan/inform budgeting
for scaling the programme.
- To assess the effectiveness of the implementation process of the programme and to see to what extent the
differentiated approach has achieved its objectives. Thereby identify areas that need further strengthening
in the way that the approach is understood and implemented.
- To assess the sustainability of the intervention. Is this sustainable and how feasible is the approach to be
rolled out to other schools?
- Assess what has or has not been working in supported schools regarding the components of the
Differentiated Education Programme, identify differences and commonalities regarding targeted
components among schools before and during the pandemic, and analyse causal factors that explain success,
failure, differences and commonalities before and during the current pandemic.
- Assess how gender, equity and child rights approaches have been applied in the components of supported
programme before and during COVID-19
84
The evaluation needs to document and critically analyze good practices, lessons learned, gaps, bottlenecks and
challenges considering pre-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Based on findings and conclusions related to actual
performance of the UNICEF supported schools the evaluation needs to propose pragmatic and measurable
recommendations for its future improvement considering the pandemic.
5. SCOPE OF THE EVALUATION
Thematic scope: The evaluation will cover all related programme interventions and references – including the
developed differentiated learning curriculum and syllabus, materials (lesson plan tool) and delivery mechanism,
the level and modality of adoption in schools and classrooms, planning and monitoring mechanism, monitoring
reports, awareness and capacity building of stakeholders etc. The focus is on primary education. The evaluation
will consider the regulatory Framework, including relevant policies, plans, strategic and legal documents.
Due to unavailability of a comprehensive baseline for all schools and other robust comparable data, the nature of
the evaluation being formative, and taking into consideration the disruptions due to COVID the attributable
‘impact’ of the approach will not be assessed and determined in this evaluation. Nonetheless, as specified in the
evaluation questions, the evaluation needs to assess how the programme is making a difference in teaching
practice and students’ learning behaviour and learning progress1; as well as any differences among other
beneficiaries such as education officials, principals and parents.
Geographic scope: the evaluation will be focused on the (56) SOEBGS (municipality) schools supported by UNICEF
located in several districts and interior of Suriname. The municipality schools are autonomous in terms of
management and deliver its public services but follow the policies and regulations and national curriculum and is
accountable to the ministry of education.
Temporal scope: The period to be covered is the implementation period of the Differentiated Education
Programme starting from 2019 to present. This means that this formative evaluation covers part of the previous
Country Programme (2017-2021) and includes COVID-19 implications.
Stakeholders: The suggested stakeholders to be consulted include (to be finalized at the inception phase):
• Central level: MINOWC,
• Sub-national level district level MINOWC staff, Management EGBS
• School and community level: teachers, school principals, students, parents
• UNICEF: Suriname office
• NGO SAGA Foundation
6. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND CRITERIA
The assessment will focus on the interventions supported by UNICEF in the ALL-primary schools governed by the
Moravian Foundation. The evaluation criteria to be used will be the standards OECD-DAC covering relevance,
efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability. Additionally, in line with the guidance of the United National Evaluation
Group (UNEG) human rights, gender equality and equity are integrated in the evaluation criteria.2 Impact will not
be assessed in this evaluation due to lack of baseline and other essential data for measuring ‘impact’, and disruptions
caused by the COVID pandemic.
The overarching question is: Whether the approach is relevant, efficient, effective, sustainable and equitable? The
specific evaluation questions by criteria are the following:
85
➢ RELEVANCE
Relevance of the teaching approach for delivering the primary curricula
• How relevant is the differentiated teaching approach for the Surinamese context and the national primary
education curricula?
• How does the MINOWC and SOEBGS define Child-centred teaching-learning and how well does the
differentiated teaching approach work towards/against the approach they have in mind?
• To what extent are the tools, methodologies and the concept accepted by national and local stakeholders?
• How does the approach work within the existing classroom space and classroom/school environment?
Relevance of the training of teachers in preparing them to adopt the approach in the classroom
• How relevant is the training of teachers in preparing them to adopt the differentiated learning approach in
the classroom?
• What are the different approaches/modalities of teacher training applied?
• How relevant are the current contents, methods, materials and delivery mechanism used for the training?
• What are the advantages and disadvantages? How could it be improved?
Relevance of the teaching-learning material used
• What are the different types of material used for implementing the approach?
• How relevant are these materials developed by teachers to achieve the objectives?
• What are the positives and negatives? How could it be improved?
➢ EFFICIENCY
• To what extent does the programme deliver the necessary quality at the least necessary cost?
• What are the different cost elements in implementing this approach in schools (i.e., training, monitoring,
material, classroom improvements)?
• Was the approach implemented in the most efficient way compared to alternatives (training all teachers
instead of applying a train/coach the trainer concept)?
• What are the challenges faced in sourcing funds for these costs?
• How can different cost elements be made more cost effective and sustainable?
➢ EFFECTIVENESS
• To what extent and how has the approach achieved its objectives?
- How well has the approach been integrated and applied into the daily teaching-learning practices?
- To what extent and how has the programme helped improve teacher performance in effectively addressing
different needs of students? And making teaching-learning more inclusive?
- To what extent and how has the approach helped make difference in students’ learning behaviour and
learning progress?
- What and how differences have come about for other beneficiaries – education officials, principals and
parents?
• What were the major factors influencing the achievement or non-achievements of the differentiated learning
objectives? How can the approach be more effective? (training, materials, class and school environment,
resources, monitoring and measurement mechanism and tools, coordination, and governance, etc)?
• Were there any barriers/negativities surrounding the approach by stakeholders? How were these addressed?
86
➢ SUSTAINABILITY
• To what extent is the differentiated learning approach and interventions sustainable?
- To what extent did the programme build on and contribute to increasing the existing national and local
government capacities in delivering child-centred learning in primary education?
- To which extent is the approach externally driven and to which extent owned/managed by SOEBGS. How
much of a continuous “external input” does it require (e.g., monitoring, training, provision of materials)
and what are the implications and requirements for potentially transitioning to a completely SOEBGS
run/owned approach?
- What new capacities within education services have been established or restored?
- To what extent does SOEBGS has sufficient financial and human resources and capacity to keep up the
benefits produced by the programme?
- To what extent have the stakeholders undertaken the necessary decisions and course of actions to ensure
the sustainability of the approach?
- How have UNICEF and stakeholders ensured SOEBGS and school ownership of the approach (intrinsically
driven to apply the approach)?
• To what extent the contents of the approach and its implementation modality have a potential for scaling and
mainstreaming? Is there political will to support the mainstreaming of principles and approach in the education
system?
➢ EQUITY, GENDER EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH (HRBA)
• To what extent have equity, HRBA and gender equality goals and processes been incorporated into the
planning documents and resource materials of the Differentiated Education Programme interventions?
• To what extent has the approach been effective to advance equitable access and learning?
• To what extent did the different groups, including children with disabilities and other most marginalised
children, benefit in different ways from the approach?
7. METHODOLOGY
7.1. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN
Applicants for the consultancy are required to present their best ideas as part of the technical proposal. The quality
and relevance of the methodology section will determine whether an applicant is deemed technically qualified.
Applications should display the ability to identify, conceptualize, and manage a range of methods to answer the
evaluation questions. The following is intended to offer useful information on actual or potential resources and
limits.
• It is proposed to carry out the evaluation in four phases: i) Inception ii) Data collection iii) Analysis and reporting
iv) Knowledge dissemination.
• For the bid, the consultants are requested to provide as detailed technical proposal as possible. The technical
proposal should present (not limited to) a detailed strategy for collecting and analyzing data, comprising of both
primary and secondary data and utilizing both qualitative and quantitative tools, even if not all the tools or
timetables. Other methodological design could be included in the technical proposal as possible, otherwise in
the detailed inception report, including: a sampling strategy, the target groups, the sample size and analytical
framework; a series of specifically designed tools; and a detailed work plan. An outline of the final report should
also be shared during the inception stage if not included in the technical proposal.
• Data should be disaggregated by relevant criteria (wherever possible): age, grade, gender, marginalized and
vulnerable groups, etc. All findings to the largest possible extent be triangulated (use of three or more sources
of information to verify and substantiate an assessment) and validated.
• Before finalizing the report, a participatory validation workshop should be organized, during which main
findings, conclusions and recommendations of the evaluation will be discussed, validated and finalized. This will
also be the opportunity to receive clarifications and/or request additional information to fill in data gaps before
87
the final report is drafted.
• In preparing the evaluation report, the findings should be evidence based and should have clear references to
the source. The conclusions and recommendations should be firmly based on evidence and analysis, be relevant
and realistic and presented in a comprehensive manner that makes the information easy-to- understand by the
intended audience. Furthermore, recommendations need to be actionable and identify the responsible
stakeholders to allow for a management response. The final report in hard and electronic copies should be in
standard format for printing. A PowerPoint presentation highlighting the key components of the final report
should also be presented.
In addition, the final report should contain the following annexes (to be finalized during the Inception Phase):
• Terms of Reference for the evaluation
• Evaluation tools
• List of meetings/interviews/focus groups discuss etc. conducted
• Names of Key stakeholders interviewed
• Records of interviews and focus group discussions etc.
• Photos taken during field missions of interventions
• List of documents reviewed
• Any other relevant material
The following core activities will be completed by the evaluation consultant to be selected:
a) Comprehensive desk review: the evaluation consultant is expected to analyze key secondary sources of
information related to the program. This critical review must include the current situation of education in SOEBGS
schools.
Key documents include training manuals, program design documents, program progress/monitoring reports, tools
including lesson plan formats and templates to monitor student progress.
b) Elaboration and submission of a detailed and thorough inception report: based on the results of the desk
review, it is expected that the consultant produces a complete inception report (first deliverable),
operationalization of proposed evaluation approach, limitation of the scope, specification of methodology,
elaboration of a final evaluation matrix (including criteria and questions and sub-questions) and evaluation tools,
tentative evaluation schedule (specifying proposed sequence of activities), definition of the structure, length and
characterization of the formative evaluation report and other expected evaluation deliverables. More evaluation
components could be added to the inception report.
c) Collection, analysis, and triangulation of evidence related to the UNICEF supported program: in addition to
the desk review and after the approval of the inception report, the consultant will gather qualitative and
quantitative information, aligned to the evaluation purposes, objectives, evaluation criteria and questions, etc.,
The period dedicated to collecting primary information must be aligned to the proposed timeframe described in
the approved inception report. The collection, analysis, and integration of the information to be collected must be
defined based on the evaluation matrix (evaluation criteria and questions) which is a key part of the mentioned
report.
Its maximum length must be 20 pages (excluding annexes). This document must be approved by UNICEF
The application of quantitative methods can be based on a sample survey and analysis of existing quantitative
secondary data. For this purpose, student assessment data (grades per quarter) is available and student star
profiling assessment. Participatory approach, what, with whom, when will be further be elaborated in the
inception report, and will include semi-structured interviews and focus groups for gathering the views of a
selection of participants (coaches and targeted teachers) on topics and issues in the data collection stage. In the
88
design stage Counsellors at central level will need be involved in instrument development to ensure alignment to
local context of schools. Participation at validation stage of analysis and findings will include Counsellors, selection
of coaches and teachers.
Program cost data are available and need to be analysed to address the efficiency questions of the evaluation.
d) Elaboration and submission of a draft version of the formative evaluation report: based on the triangulation
of the collected (quantitative and qualitative) information and according to the evaluation matrix, the selected
evaluation consultant will develop the draft version of the formative evaluation report offering straight forward
evidence-based answers to the evaluation criteria and questions and highlighting evidence about how gender,
equity, and child rights The structure of the draft version of the formative evaluation report will be the one
proposed and approved in the inception report.
7.2. EVALUATION NORMS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The evaluation will be guided by commonly accepted evaluation norms, standards and approaches. Specifically,
the evaluation should be guided by the UNEG norms, standards and guidance.3 The evaluation must be external
and independent and will be carried out in an objective, impartial, open and participatory manner, based on
empirically verified evidence that is valid and reliable.
UNICEF’s Evaluation Report Standards4 should be followed when preparing the evaluation report. Final evaluation
report will be with all annexes in digital format incorporating feedback and comments from UNICEF along with
specific, simple and achievable recommendations for future policy and programmatic improvement to be made by
the government, as well as specific recommendations for UNICEF’ assistance to address the key issues highlighted
through the evaluation results. The report will be externally reviewed through UNICEF’s Global Evaluation Reports
Oversight System (GEROS)5, therefore, the evaluation report needs consider the GEROS quality assurance criteria.
Ethical considerations - The UNEG Code of Conduct6 and Ethical Guidelines for Evaluations7 shall apply to all stages
of the evaluation, as well as UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis.8 Where the evaluation involves the participation of members of vulnerable groups, children in particular,
evaluators must be aware of and comply with legal codes governing interviewing children and young people and
the evaluation design and instruments need to be reviewed by an external ethical review board (see UNICEF
Procedure on Ethical Standards). Evaluators shall respect people’s right to provide information in confidence and
make participants aware of the scope and limits of confidentiality. Evaluators must ensure that sensitive
information cannot be traced to its source so that the relevant individuals are protected from reprisals
The ethical principles that will guide the evaluation are independence, impartiality, credibility, responsibility, honesty,
and integrity. Similarly, it is essential for the evaluation team to maintain respect for the dignity and diversity of the
individuals interviewed, and to take into consideration respect for human rights, gender equity and equality9
throughout the evaluation process. The team will take the appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality of
information and data of the individuals involved, while respecting the right to provide information in confidence.
Here, it is essential that informed consent be obtained when the information is collected.

Teaching practice: differentiated teaching by adjusting lesson plans with regards to either the content being
discussed, the process used to learn, or the product expected from students to ensure that learners at different
starting points can receive the instruction they need to grow and succeed. Student learning behavior: active
participatory role during the lessons, increases participation and peer-to-peer learning. learning progress: this is
based on the student grades as well as growth throughout the 3-star system.

meeting with and talking to as part of this evaluation. Everyone who participates in this evaluation is guaranteed
confidentiality to protect their privacy. No names or identifiers will be included in any documents or reports. Only
summary data for all respondents will be presented in an evaluation report of the Differentiated Education
Programme. It is also important that you know that participating in this focus group will cause no risk to you or
your child.
We anticipate the focus group discussion will take about 45 minutes.
Is it mandatory for your child to participate in this focus group discussion?
It is up to you and your child to decide whether your child will participate in this focus group; their participation is
voluntary. If you decide that you do not want your child to participate in this focus group, you can withdraw your
consent at any time without giving any reason why. Even if you agree that your child can participate in the focus
group, we will also ask your child if they want to take part in the focus group, so that they can decide for
themselves. It will be explained to your child that can stop their participation at any time without reason, and
they can answer only those questions that they want to answer.
About 18-24 primary school students (grades 3-6) from your child’s school will asked to participate in one of three
focus groups that we have scheduled (6-10 students per focus group).
Who will have access to the data from this focus group discussion?
The focus group is designed to protect your child’s identity. All information collected as part of the focus group
will be held as confidential by the evaluator. Only the UNICEF-contracted evaluator will be allowed to examine
focus group responses. All information from focus groups will be stored on a password protected computer, which
is accessible only to the evaluator.

How will the anonymous answers given by your child in this focus group discussion be used?
The answers given by your child in the focus group will be used to evaluate how the Differentiated Education
Programme was implemented in your child’s school. We are interested in the general responses shared by all
students who participate in focus groups. We plan to conduct a total of 24 focus groups in 8 SOEBGS primary
schools in Suriname. Your child is one of more than 100 primary school students (grades 3-6) who have been
asked to participate in a focus group.

Everyone is encouraged to participate. You may be asked to share what you think or I may ask for
comments from those who haven't spoken. It is always OK to "pass" when you are asked to share a
comment.
Familiarity with and Relevance of the Programme
Let’s get started. I want to ask you some questions about the Steps Together Programme.
I know that in your classroom, your teacher has used different activities and lessons to teach you the subject
matter. I also know that student learn at different paces, some student learn very fast and other students need
a bit more time to learn and understand the subject, and that is okay. For instance, some students are good at
math, but other students have a difficult time learning math and need more time and practice. Also, some
students are good at reading, but other students have a difficult time reading and need more time and practice.
I want to hear about the different types of activities and lessons learned in the classroom that have helped you
to learn subjects, such as reading, writing, math and more.
1 What are some of the activities or lessons that you have done in the classroom with your teachers that
have enjoyed and they have helped you to learn? It could be his year or last year.
2 What did you like about those activities or lessons? Are they commonly used or rare?
3 Sometimes we are slow to learn a subject or we are having a hard time learning. When you are slow to
learn a subject or are having a hard time learning, does your teacher know this? How do they know this?
Do teachers talk with you to make sure that you learning oaky? Has your teacher been able to understand
why you are having a hard time learning? Were they kind about it and willing to help you?
4 When you are slow to learn a subject or have a hard time learning, what did your teacher do to try to
help you learn the subject and to catch up with your classmates? Can you tell me about that. Did that
help you?
5 Sometimes we are fast to learn a subject, maybe you are a good reader or good at math, or good at art.
When you are learning fast and find classroom activities and lessons to be easy, does your teacher know
this? How do they know this? Do they talk to you about it? Were they kind about it?
6 When you are learning fast and find classroom activities and lessons to be easy, does your teacher give
you additional teaching materials or activities to help you to keep learning faster? Can you tell me about
that. Did that help you to keep learning fast, without getting bored?
7 Whether you are a slow learner or a fast learner, what type of activities and lessons help you learn in the
classroom?
8 Are there any classroom activities and lessons that do not help you learn? Maybe they are boring? What
would you change in the classroom to make learning more fun?
9 Do you have any thoughts on how to improve classroom activities or lessons to help you learn better? Do
you want the teacher to provide more explanation? Do you want more activities that you can do with
your classmates, so you can learn together? Do you want more activities to do with your hands?
Wrap-up and Closure
