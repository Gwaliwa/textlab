Executive summary
Background
The practice of child marriage has been a critical area of focus for Bangladesh. Currently, it is ranked
at 134 out of 175 countries on the End of Childhood Index 20201 and has the fourth highest rate of
child marriage in the world after African countries of Niger, the Central African Republic, and Chad2
Statistics from the MICS 2019 show that 19.8 per cent of women before turning 15 years of age (aged
15-49 years) and 60 per cent (aged 20-49 years) before turning 18 are married.3 Drivers of child
marriage are complex, diverse, interlinked4 and at times, context specific. Gender and social norms
interact with several socio-economic factors to form a complex web of interrelated facets to place a girl
child at risk of marriage.
The key drivers of this pervasive practice are rooted in gender-based violence and inequality,
intergenerational cycles of poverty, lack of access to education, poor income generating
capacities, vulnerability caused due to climate change and natural disasters, and limited access
to resources for girls and women, especially a lack of their own income and financial planning skills.5
Distinctions also exist for factors such as differences in the rates of employment among young women,
economic conditions of those who facilitate child marriage and economic pressures related to dowry
payments. Further area of concern is the linkage between an ageing population and the occurrence
of child marriage. Moreover, the influence of religion in the context of Bangladeshi society has also
been highlighted as a key driver of child marriage in the country.
Programme description
At a global level, in 2015, United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF launched their Global
Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage (GPECM) across twelve programme
countries.6 Bangladesh is one of the 12 countries in the world that is a part of the joint UNICEF and
UNFPA GPECM that also implements its strategies with a goal to delay marriage, address associated
conditions that are contributing factors to child marriage nationally and provide support to girls who have
already been married off early.
To work towards Ending Child Marriage (ECM), Government of Bangladesh, UNICEF BCO and its
partners support various programmes that engage adolescents in increasing their awareness on the
adverse consequences of child marriage while simultaneously providing them with adequate skills to
help improve their lives and delay marriage. In 2015, the BCO received initial funding and the New
Country Programme Document of 2016 acknowledged the opportunity to sharpen the approach
on ECM across the country. The strategy note on ECM was used as a basis for the GPECM when
Bangladesh became one of the three GPECM countries in UNICEF’s South Asian Region for Phase 1
of the joint UNFPA-UNICEF GPECM programme.
Objective and scope of the evaluation
The overall objective of the evaluation was to assess the progress made by BCO towards achievements
of results of its ECM programmes. The evaluation has analysed the relevance of BCO’s work on ECM,
effectiveness and added value of the joint UNFPA UNICEF GPECM and BCO’s ECM interventions

outside the GPECM funded through OR of different sections. It has identified opportunities and barriers
of the implementation of cross sectoral evidenced based intervention strategies. Additionally, it has also
identified good practices of convergence among sectors and lessons especially from Phase I of the
GPECM.
The evaluation has included all activities under the CP 2017-2020 and the GPECM Phase 1 (2016-
2019). Additionally, aspects of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have also been covered. Further,
the evaluation has covered work undertaken at the national level and aspects of the programme that
were conducted at ECM districts, either through GPECM interventions or other ECM activities.
Our approach and methodology
The evaluation incorporated a theory-based evaluation framework, and the OECD DAC criteria of
relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability was applied in the evaluation of the
programme. Further, a non-experimental evaluation design was adopted wherein qualitative data
collection in all five divisions as stated in the ToR namely, Mymensingh, Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna
and Rangpur were undertaken. The evaluation was approached through highly consultative and
participatory lenses.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic our team adopted a “blended methodology” as the way
forward to allow flexibility in design. To initiate the organisation of data collected, a workshop mode
was adopted wherein the objective was to triangulate the data collected against the information
provided by the various stakeholders in order to derive final conclusions/answers against each
evaluation question. After analysing the information, the insights obtained was grouped as per various
heads related to the evaluation questions. They were then summarised and critically analysed to find
answers to the evaluation questions.
An evaluation rubric was also developed to map BCOs performance against each evaluation question.
The parameters of assessment include Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor.
Limitations
Overall limitations in undertaking the evaluation may be attributed to the extensive delays caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel and mobility restrictions. Despite rigorous sampling,
due to the time lag and unavailability of key stakeholders, it is possible that some significant aspects of
the programme were missed, and some biases crept in reaching out to the respondents in the
community. The COVID-19 induced restrictions made it challenging to access data and information on
how the pandemic has impacted the programme and its beneficiaries in sampled Upazillas and districts.
Further, programmatic and financial, reporting undertaken by UNICEF during the implementation did
not have clear compartmentalisation between the two. Therefore, maintaining clear separation or to
avoid overlap in terms of findings related to the two programmes was not possible.
Key findings
Relevance
Ending child marriage (ECM), is a relevant and required priority area for both the Government of
Bangladesh (GoB) and its development partners. Additionally, through the adoption of an area-based
approach, life cycle approach and multisectoral approach. the programme was excellently
designed in a comprehensive manner, accounting for varied contexts of different groups in society.
The programme has also incorporated a gender-transformative approach to address the drivers
of child marriage and structural drivers of inequality in the context of Bangladesh. However, while there
have been efforts to correctly implement the programme following a human rights, equity and culturally
sensitive approach, inclusion of certain vulnerable groups can be further strengthened. Further,

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
ECM work in BCO is found to be guided by two Theories of Change. One at the National level
and the other proposed by GPECM. Bangladesh was one of the few GPECM countries that formally
adapted the global ToC to the country level. Moreover, while the programme was found to be aligned
to the objectives of the NAP to ECM to a good degree, there were challenges with respect to
awareness, resources, collaboration and monitoring impede NAP’s seamless implementation.
Effectiveness and Impact
BCOs ECM efforts have made an adequate impact in terms of contributing to the process of
reduction in number of child marriages. The evaluation finds that predominant focus of the
interventions was on Adolescent empowerment through Adolescent Clubs, and Community
Mobilisation. Additionally, partnerships at the highest levels developed through advocacy carried out
by UNICEF and UNFPA will ensure that ECM remains a significant agenda of the Government.
However, a stronger focus also needs to be placed on the promotion of income generation and
livelihood opportunities for girls. Overall review of the progress of the strategies highlights that BCO
will need to continue its concerted efforts at all levels (individual, community, institutional, state
and policy) to effectively combat child marriages. Further, wider and more focused engagement
is needed with different stakeholders for a longer period for achievement of gender transformation.
Further, ECM efforts and its planned results for its five strategies needs to be seen
corroboratively with the Outcome on Adolescents as well as GPECM reporting as the entire gamut
of ECM efforts does not adequately report against a combined RBM. It is key to note that the evaluation
team has also been limited in its ability to comment on the entire impact of the programme due
to COVID-19 induced discontinuity in regular ECM efforts and challenges to accessing protection
services that threatens the momentum gained for ECM as well as restrains spillover effects.
Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness
UNICEF and UNFPA, have worked jointly for the GPECM programme. However, both the
organisations predominantly implemented GPECM interventions in Bangladesh without any
combined planning, except at the national or policy advocacy level, limiting impact at the sub-
national and sub-district levels, further challenged by gaps in coordination at field level. Moreover, the
GPECM helped streamline good efforts and aid the process of evidence generation which was
critical for strengthening the overall ECM agenda. While funding priorities were aligned to
organisational mandates as well as sectoral priorities within UNICEF BCO, GPECM funding,
though limited, helped streamline various ongoing efforts under a comprehensive programme.
With regards to cost-effectiveness, it was seen that most of the ECM funds were allocated to
Education and Child Protection interventions aimed at reducing child marriages.
Sustainability
BCO’s ECM interventions promoted sustainability through various good practices and
strategies, including advocacy, institutionalisation, strengthening systems, developing capacities and
mobilising complementary funding. However, there is scope for enhanced advocacy and
engagement to sustain gains in social norm change and redressal of harmful behaviours. For sustained
efforts and scaling up interventions, adequate system strengthening needs to be embedded at all
levels including national policies, programme planning and design and in implementation, especially at
the sub-district levels.
Conclusions and lessons learnt
BCO’s ECM interventions and the GPECM have made some significant inroads in propelling collective
efforts to meet the stated national targets. The evaluation notes that cross sectoral convergence and
collaboration and the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA was a key strength of BCOs ECM
efforts. Moreover, partnerships with stakeholders including women’s groups have been found to be
Page | 11 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
diverse and effectively leveraged to further the agenda for ECM. Advocacy at the highest levels has
also contributed to the creation of government ownership and commitment to ECM through the
development of the NAP. There is however scope for improvement with respect to monitoring and
tracking results achieved against BCO ECM Strategy Note and the GRF as current systems are
collecting data aligned to Outcome 3 of BCO CPD. While there is ownership at the highest levels of
government, the same rigour is absent at the district and Upazilla level and requires focused and
consistent capacity building. Significantly, while interventions have recorded success at different
degrees, some strategies worked better than others and recorded better results. Key lessons learnt
from the evaluation are as follows:
• Joint programming by UNICEF and UNFPA has enhanced ECM efforts in Bangladesh.
There is enough reason to believe that the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA has
worked well to this programme. Both the organisations have their unique strengths which have
complemented each other and strengthened the voice of the United Nations on this issue
• Incentives and conditional cash transfers seem to have worked well in some parts. This
needs to be examined more closely. In case it is found to make a positive impact, a solution
to this may be found to provide incentives to girls, perhaps by helping the Government to design
a suitable scheme
• The existing monitoring system within UNICEF is not designed to collect relevant data
for ECM. The mismatch in monitoring programmes makes collation of relevant data collection
very challenging and there is likelihood of missing out of information that may provide evidence
for planning
Overarchingly, each question of the evaluation criterion has been given a ranking of
Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor. General improvement may be required to enhance effectiveness of
strategies with respect to mapping the results achieved, and over all sustainability of interventions rolled
out.
Recommendations
• UNICEF should work towards providing social protection to vulnerable children and their
families for overall poverty reduction. As per the definition of UNICEF “Social protection
covers the range of policies and programmes needed to reduce the lifelong consequences of
poverty and exclusion.” Therefore, the focus of interventions in future should be to ensure that
essential services are provided to all vulnerable families to reduce inequality, poverty and
vulnerability. This would require working together with other organisations with similar mandate
of poverty alleviation
• Vulnerability mapping needs to be more nuanced and evidence based where factors
other than incidence of child marriage should also be considered. The scope of
vulnerability mapping should be increased by including other factors such as low level of
education (including drop outs and out of school children); economically disadvantaged
population, incidence of gender-based violence, disaster prone areas and other
vulnerable sections such as migrants. This will help in identifying other vulnerable pockets
and interventions can be designed accordingly
• UNICEF should limit the number of interventions it carries out to address the issue of
ECM. Research has shown that programmes with fewer interventions reaches out to a larger
population and shows better sustainability. Therefore, UNICEF may consider focusing on
fewer interventions where it has achieved better results and aim at scaling up the pilots
• There is a need for greater engagement and involvement with the Ministry of Law, Justice
and Parliamentary Affairs, Ministry of Social Welfare and Ministry of Home Affairs to act
on child marriage within their own sectors. UNICEF has been working primarily with
MoWCA on the issue of ECM. It may consider working more closely with other Ministries too

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
which have a significant role in formulating policies, enforcing law, offering schemes to the
disadvantaged communities
• There is a need for a more robust and user-friendly surveillance system and research to
analyse the impact of interventions and to collate information related to an area effectively.
It is also important to collect disaggregated data for disadvantaged groups to analyse the impact
on vulnerable groups
• UNICEF should limit its intervention in skill development programmes to extending
technical support to identify vulnerable adolescents and develop soft skills. There are
organisations which have significant experience in this area and can be more effective in
implementing programmes related to skill development. UNICEF can extend technical support
to identify vulnerable adolescents and develop programme for soft skill training
• It is recommended that the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA be sustained as it can
make greater impact by leveraging their core areas of strength
• Capacity development of officials at the district and upazilla level would be a key factor
to the success of the ECM programme. It was found that the level of awareness and capacity
to execute programmes effectively was not uniform in all Upazillas. Leadership provided by the
CO was extremely important in this regard. Therefore, UNICEF may collaborate with local
government representatives across all departments to undertake capacity development
programmes at this level

Chapter 1: Background
1.1 Situation and context of child marriage in Bangladesh
Globally, 12 million girls are married before the age of 18, accounting for 23 girls a minute and one in
almost every 2 seconds.7 As a practice, child marriage transcends geographical boundaries, cultures
and religions, augmented by poverty, gender inequality, age old traditions and insecurity. While it
pervades across the world and differs in nature across communities, economically emerging countries
tend to display higher incidences, with a vast majority of such cases stemming from South Asia. One
such country in the global South is Bangladesh with the fourth-highest rate of child marriage in the
world.8
Defined by UNICEF as “marriage of a girl or boy before the age of 18”9, child marriage is essentially a
form of early and forced alliance, steeped in adverse traditions and practices passed on between
generations10. It is not only a complete disdain of human rights but given that it disproportionately affects
girls who are more likely to be married off before attaining legal age11, risks associated with early
pregnancy, increase in school dropout rates, spousal violence, poor health of maternal and child
health12, plague several young women globally and in Bangladesh.
Key drivers of child marriage in Bangladesh
Currently, Bangladesh is ranked at 134 out of 180 countries on the End of Childhood Index 202013
and 60 per cent of girls (aged 20-49 years) in Bangladesh marry before reaching their 18th birthday,
while 19.8 per cent are married before the age of 15 years (aged 15-49 years).14 It has the fourth-
highest rate of child marriage in the world after African countries of Niger, the Central African Republic,
and Chad.15 With 36 million adolescents who make up 22 per cent of the country’s population,
Bangladesh’s focus on the many challenges associated with child
marriage is critical for the country.16 On the positive side, as part
of the broader process of economic transition and social change,
in the last two decades, gender relations in Bangladesh have
undergone a course of progressive transformation. As reported
in MICS 2019, 32.9 per cent girls between the ages of 15-19
years are currently married.17 This is a clear indication to sustain
efforts to encourage shifts in policies, programmes and socio-
cultural values that continue to shape implicit societal
understanding of roles and responsibilities of women and girls.

Social understanding and typology of gender is instrumental in perpetuating harmful gender roles and
socio-cultural expectations that act as underlying causes for child marriage. Drivers of child marriage
are complex, diverse, interlinked18 and at times, context specific. Gender and social norms interact with
several socio-economic factors to form a complex web of interrelated facets to place a girl child at risk
of marriage. Gender-based discrimination begins early for a girl. Even before birth, patriarchal gender
norms and values reinforce early subordination and limit choices and opportunities over her life course.
The key drivers of this pervasive practice are rooted in gender inequality, intergenerational cycles
of poverty, lack of access to education, poor income generating capacities and limited access
to resources for girls and women, especially a lack of their own income and financial planning skills.19
Distinctions also exist for factors such as differences in the rates of employment among young women,
economic conditions of those who facilitate child marriage and economic pressures related to dowry
payments. As a strategic indicator of gender equality, young women and men who are more educated,
tend to marry at a later age, while women with primary, secondary, and higher education, were 24 per
cent, 72 per cent and 94 per cent less likely to marry at a young age respectively, compared to their
counterparts with no formal education.20 Furthermore, research confirms vulnerability to poverty
continues to have concrete gender dimensions and gender-based capability poverty is an issue in
Bangladesh.21
While Bangladesh has made significant progress in enhancing accessibility to education at all levels,
dropout rates at the secondary level of education, especially amongst girls is a recurrent
challenge. Dropout rates for girls has been recorded at 46 per cent compared to 34 per cent for
boys in the country. Concerningly, a large portion of these girls have been found to dropout due to child
marriage.22 Relatedly, recent data shows that the women’s labour force participation rates stand at
a mere 36.4 per cent compared to 84 per cent for men.23
While poverty, lack of education and opportunities for girls and overall limited awareness have
consistently been identified as key drivers of child marriage, gender inequity and norms concerning girls’
sexuality need to be highlighted as well. Research has found that the linkage of child marriage with
control over girls’ sexuality in Bangladesh manifests itself as
preserving their marriageability, virginity and family honour. Engaging in child marriage is seen as
a medium of protection against the possibility of girls being involved in sexual activity that would bring
“shame” to the family.24
Relatedly, research carried out by Human Rights Watch found that the prevalence of widescale sexual
harassment of girls is a key factor in families encouraging the practice of child marriage in
Bangladesh.25 Girls are subjected to gender-based violence in private and public spheres
which greatly undermines their agency, health, social and economic status. Violence in the form
of discrimination faced in the family along with social norms affecting their experiences outside it at
places like school, often becomes a push towards child marriage. Social pressure on families coupled
with status of girls as liabilities further exacerbates their vulnerability to rampant oppression.

Further, to avoid expenses on the sustenance of girl children, families look to offload this deemed
burden by getting them married as soon as possible. Studies highlight that perceived benefits of child
marriage in a country like Bangladesh are viewed by some households to outweigh the alleged risks
associated with it.26 Given this belief, for some families, marrying of girl children early is associated with
benefits of dowry, decrease in household size, and the ability to transfer human capital among
households. Additionally, some evidence suggests, child marriage is linked with higher prestige among
families and considered better for child safety.27
Social attitudes determined by patriarchal structures and notions further propagate the concept of
'safety' of girls ensured by marriage. Aligned to this, research in Bangladesh has found
that of households that display knowledge of the negative consequences of child marriage, 45.9
per cent had a girl child who was married before the age of 18. An analysis of this suggests that despite
being aware of the negative consequences, factors such as “having one less mouth to feed,
securing a groom and protecting honour” outweigh the harmful impact of child marriage.28
A review of literature additionally highlights the role religion plays in the context of Bangladesh as a
driver for early child marriage. It has been argued that the duty of families
to comply with religious practices of maintaining purdah and related aspects results in early marriage
of girls as a divine command.29
In the context of Bangladesh, a further area of concern is the linkage between an ageing population
and the occurrence of child marriage. Research shows that the growth rate of the population aged
60 years and above in the country is faster than other developing and least developed countries.30 A
key driver of an ageing population has been found to be a decrease in fertility rates.31 Relatedly,
research has found that child marriage results in a higher fertility rate as girls who marry early are likely
to bear children earlier and a larger number of children compared to if married at a later age. Therefore,
with an increasingly ageing population, the need for a younger population that is capable of effectively
contributing to the economy is likely to see an increase, exacerbating the risk the girls in the country
face with respect to child marriage.
Furthermore, in Bangladesh, natural disasters and climate change have exacerbated child
marriage in many regions.32 A 2014 study finds that the economic crises created by the challenges of
climate change are accentuating child and forced marriages because dowry is cheaper for younger
girls.33 The phenomenon of child marriage has been found to be highly prevalent in such areas as it is
inter-linked with poverty, vulnerability to disaster induced-displacement in the face of socio-economical
disadvantages and deprivation. In the anticipation of recurring natural disasters, families choose to
marry of their young daughters to ameliorate the hardships due to hunger, poverty and loss of home.34
Within this context, it is also key to note that since 2017, an influx of over 720,000 Rohingya refugees
to Bangladesh has resulted in the fastest growing refugee crisis in the world. The vast majority of this

population are women and children35. Refugee crises are characterised by loss of livelihood, reduced
economic opportunity, heightened insecurity and the absence of education, all of which leads to an
increase in practices such as child marriage.36 Research suggests that extreme poverty, widespread
violence, fear of gender-based violence and political strife37 has exacerbated the incidence of child
marriage in humanitarian settings in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. Moreover, while early
marriage is a common practice amongst the Rohingya communities, several young girls have also
reported food rations to be a key motivating factor influencing early marriage decisions.38
It is key to note here that given this overall scenario, achievement of targets set out in GoB’s 8th Fifth
Year Plan (July 2020 - June 2025) to shift the country out of the Least Developed Country category as
well as transition to a Middle-Income Country by 2031 and subsequently to a High-Income Country
2041 is fraught with challenges stemming from low empowerment and agency of girls and women in
the country.
Preserving the rights of girls: A look at policies and programmes
The policy landscape:
Child marriage has been illegal in Bangladesh since 1929 with a minimum age set at 18 for women and
21 for men since the 1980’s. In 2014, the government pledged to end child marriage before the age of
15 by 2021 and end marriage before the age of 18 by 2041.39 Moreover, the Ministry of Women and
Children Affairs (MoWCA) with technical and financial support from UNICEF Bangladesh, is in the
process of developing a costed National Adolescent Strategy which brings together different sectors
including Ministries of Social Welfare, Education, and Health. Bangladesh is also a part of an eight-
member countries of South Asia pact called the South Asia Initiative to End Violence Against Children
(SAIVAC) that has developed a Regional Action Plan to End Child Marriage in South Asia.40 While the
country has over time witnessed the adoption of policies, legislation and schemes, the practice of child
marriage continues to engulf Bangladesh.
Drawing from several global policies and conventions, the Government of Bangladesh enacted specific
laws and policies geared towards addressing this social evil. However, in Bangladesh, the national laws
often come in conflict with customary religious laws and practices, making it difficult to enforce or
implement the national laws.41 Moreover, with a confluence of cultures and religions in the country,
the concept of marriage differs across Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Christian communities, resulting in
overlapping legal systems.42 Each religion has separate laws that govern marriage, separation and
divorce and the personal laws of each of these communities are officially recognised laws.
Additionally, the 1929 Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA), which had set the legal age of marriage
for girls at 18 and boys at 21 was amended over the years, most recently leading to the 2017 Child
Marriage Restraint Act that introduced a retrogressive exception that allows child marriages without
any minimum legal age in “special cases.” The act states that “if a marriage is solemnised in such
manner and under such special circumstances as may be prescribed by rules in the best interests of

as the case may be, it shall not be deemed to be an offence under this Act.”43
Amidst widespread criticism from the international human rights communities, including organisations
such as the Human Rights Watch that stated that the law was a “devastating step backwards for the
fight against child marriage in Bangladesh,”44 the law came into effect on 10th December 2017, repealing
the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929.45
Combating child marriage is further aligned with the fulfilment of Sustainable Development Goals.
As a core development issue, child marriage is both borne out of and causes intersectional
disadvantages. Making progress on ending child marriage is crucial to the achievement of interlinked
SDGs including those related to poverty, food security, health, education, gender equality, economic
growth and peace and justice.
Programmes and partnerships: A collaborative effort to ending child marriage
On the ground, various stakeholders from both government and non-governmental organisations have
programmes and partnerships in place to help tackle issues associated with high prevalence of child
marriages. Evidence from studies highlight the impact of interventions such as encouraging girls to
stay in school and strengthening their abilities to negotiate later marriages by empowering them
and providing them with skills that can increase their financial prospects. However, often, these
interventions fall short of directly addressing the complexities of child marriage in South Asia, and
especially in Bangladesh where the role of parents in determining age of marriage and sexual onset is
extremely influential and critical in an adolescent girls’ life.46 Interventions such as financial incentives
to families of adolescent girls have instead, proven to be effective in a country like Bangladesh, and
have reduced likelihood of child marriage.47
Efforts by prominent global development organisations such as Save the Children’s to ensure
availability of quality maternal, new born and family health planning services at community levels, or
Plan International’s programme to provide family planning, nutrition, life skill straining to married and
unmarried young women, are other key efforts running in various districts of the country. Similarly, UN
Women’s programme on combating gender violence in Bangladesh aims to work with marginalised
women, partner with district based and high-level leadership of key institutions such as local
government, civil society organisations, women’s organisations, education institutions and work places
and implement a strategic approach prevent violence against women and girls.
These programmes and several others by local and global organisations have been working in the
country addressing various determinants of child marriage. However, driving transformational change
will continue to require multiple stakeholders to jointly deliver results for children and ensure that their
contributions are cohesive and complementary rather than duplicative in nature.

(GoB) and its development partners. UNICEF Bangladesh Country Office (BCO) and its partners
support various programmes that engage adolescents in increasing their awareness on the adverse
consequences of child marriage while simultaneously providing them with adequate skills to help
improve their lives and delay marriage. A multi-stakeholder meeting took place in December 2014 to
develop an extensive analysis of the situation of child marriage in Bangladesh and developed a Theory
of Change for the work around ECM in the country, which was in turn the basis of the BCO strategy
note for ECM.48 BCO’s ECM Strategy Note was aligned to Bangladesh’s National Action Plan on ECM,
that identified a combination of strategies to combat concerns of child marriage through community
engagement, advocacy and institutional strengthening with the aim to increase access to quality
education for girls, providing livelihood support and establishing ways to empower adolescents.
A key area of focus for the GoB and BCO has been on gender equality, recognising that bridging the
gender gap is instrumental in achieving several other linked development targets. Moreover,
acknowledging the multipronged and cross-sectional issues, the UNICEF Country Programme
Document for Bangladesh mentions a life-cycle approach to address the challenges of child marriage
in the country. The focus overall is to improve social inclusion and increase awareness of children’s
rights by strengthening capacities at the national and sub-national levels and develop robust
systems that address inequity issues through a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches.49
Additionally, efforts were also made to encourage a shift in perceptions surrounding harmful gender
norms by establishing access to knowledge and information to motivate parents and community. The
inherent ethos is to work with adolescents, families, communities and other relevant key stakeholders
and provide the required information, knowledge, skills, exposure and channels through which informed
choices can be made that are not stripped from the realities of the country.
UNICEF and UNFPA: A joint effort to eliminate child marriage
At a global level, in 2015, United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF launched their Global
Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage (GPECM) across 12 programme countries.50
Bangladesh is one of the 12 countries that is a part of the joint UNICEF and UNFPA GPECM that also
implements its strategies with a goal to delay marriage, address associated conditions that are
contributing factors to child marriage nationally and provide support to girls who have already been
married off early.
For the first time, strategies across key sectors such as health, education, child protection and
water and sanitation, are brought under a holistic programme with shared goals and plans. Aligned
to government, civil society organisations and the youth of the country themselves, in Bangladesh the
GPECM programme aimed to reach more than 425,000 girls over four years.51 The GPECM results
framework (Annexure 1) draws on the logic defined by the Global Theory of Change, with five key
outcomes and seven outputs.
UNICEF BCO efforts to end child marriage
The Government of Bangladesh worked with UNICEF and UNFPA on a National Plan of Action to
implement commitments made by the Prime Minister at a Girls’ Summit in July 2014. The following
year, in 2015, the BCO received initial funding and the New Country Programme Document of 2016
acknowledged the opportunity to sharpen the approach on ECM across the country. The Strategy Note
on ECM was used as a basis for the GPECM when Bangladesh became one of the three GPECM

countries in UNICEF’s South Asian Region for Phase 1 of the joint UNFPA-UNICEF GPECM
programme.
A combination of strategies was curated to address the complexities associated with the prevalence
of child marriage:
• Empowerment of adolescent girls with interventions aimed at mobilisation of out of school
adolescents into adolescent clubs to build their leadership and life skills, and their
understanding of development issues that affect them directly such as health, Water, Sanitation
and Hygiene, HIV/AIDS prevalence and nutrition.
• C4D strategy focus was Social and Behavioural Change through an emphasis on
Community Engagement interventions, combined with other interventions and approaches,
that recognised the instrumental role played by families and communities and underlying social
norms in the high incidences of child marriages. Interventions were developed to mobilise,
engage, and develop a dialogue among important stakeholders who can help build ownership
and facilitate collective action to ensure girls attend school and are not pulled out to get married
at an early age.
• At the root of some of the strategies was
institutional strengthening, advocacy
and law enforcement. Under this,
UNICEF and UNFPA
worked together to advocate
against the Child Marriage
Restraint Act 2017 (CMRA) and support
the development of the National Action
Plan on ECM.
• Improving accessibility to quality
formal education for girls by enabling
them to continue their education and delay
their marriages was another key strategy.
This included providing safe and hygienic
conditions for girls in school, providing
second-chance education for girls who
have dropped out for various reasons, equipping girls Figure 1: Strategies developed by UNICEF
with skilling opportunities that include life skill BCO to end child marriage
building, vocational training, teacher training, and
additional help with job matching and job placements to become financially independent and
contributing members of their families, thereby also increasing their bargaining power and
decision making.
• Provision of livelihood support and financial incentives through cash transfers to provide
families with financial backing so they can support their girls’ education. The BCO aimed to
provide the GoB with the technical support required to develop and reinforce suitable financial
incentives for families.
While the programme at the national level did not have any formal and consolidated National Theory
of Change document52, UNICEF BCO aligned their programmes with the National Action Plan drawn
up by MoWCA and wherever possible concretely included related outputs and activities in the rolling
work plans, in partnership with the government. Moreover, as the specific strategies identified by
52 BCO ECM Strategy Note 2016
Page | 20 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
UNICEF BCO were aligned to the main outcomes of the government’s action plan, advocating with
government partners at the local and national level and implementing the activities in identified UNICEF
target districts would roll out systematically.
When GPECM was launched in Bangladesh, the BCO aligned all interventions aimed at ECM to
global strategies under the GPECM and brought them under the joint programme with
UNFPA. These interventions were then funded by the GPECM funds received by UNICEF for Phase
I. The indicative budget for Phase I stood at an estimated USD 246.7 million for a period of four years
(2016-2019) with contributions from Canada, the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom and the
European Commission.53 While the GPECM fund, as will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections of
the report, acted as a catalytic fund, BCO’s ECM efforts were also carried out through utilisation of
funds received from other donors.
An “Area-Based Programming Approach” was adopted both the BCO ECM Strategy and UNICEF-
UNFPA GPECM, recognising that different regions of the country had different prevalence rates of child
marriage and varied causes and consequences of the same.
• BCOs ECM strategy note
When the first proposal for funding on child marriage was developed in 2015, 11 upazillas and two city
corporations with high prevalence of child marriage were selected as target implementation areas.54

In Bangladesh, an ‘Area-Based Programming Approach’ was adopted for efforts to end child marriage

Table 2: Geographical Coverage of GPECM
Key results to be achieved by BCOs ECM can be summarised as follows:56
• In the target districts and city corporations there should be a reduction in child marriage by at
least 30 per cent for girls under 18 years of age.
• The Country has endorsed a full costed five-year National Action Plan for Ending Child
Marriage.
• A nationwide communication for development (C4D) campaign against child marriage
comprising both media and on-ground community engagement initiatives is launched in
Bangladesh in 2016, bringing together key sectoral partners, NGOs, adolescents, young people
and women’s rights networks and academia to achieve behaviour and social norm change.
• There is a positive shift in attitudes and practices around child marriage which includes both
condemnation and prevention of child marriages at the ward level in the UNICEF target
upazillas and city corporations.
Both Phase I of the GPECM and BCO’s ECM efforts under the CPD 2017-2020 have been concluded.
Phase II of the GPECM was commenced on the 1st of January 2020 and is slated to continue till 31st
December 2023. It is also key to mention that BCO CPD was extended by a year and activities were
carried out during 2021 as well. At the time of writing this report, a new CPD (2022-2026) had been
designed by BCO and was under review. The evaluation's findings will be used to develop the specific
and detailed annual workplans for the new CPD and refine the Phase II plans for GPECM.

COVID-19 and its impact
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in global devastation, governments across the
world adopted stringent measures to combat it. On March 26, 2020 the Government of Bangladesh
announced a nationwide lockdown for a few weeks as a preventive step to contain the spread of this
virus. The sudden lockdown and the consequent shutdown of public transport and other services
created a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. While this impacted the evaluation itself
with subsequent changes in methodology and timelines, initial ground reports highlighted its devastating
impact in the country.
Months after the initial outbreak, as COVID-19 continued to disrupt systems and increase the
susceptibility of vulnerable groups, its impact on child marriage was a crucial focus among child
protection stakeholders. Given its unprecedented nature, research from the early days of the pandemic
indicated an increase in incidences of child marriage, potentially impeding the gains made in ending the
age-old practice thus far. Furthermore, studies also indicated an increase in violence among married
adolescent girls (35 per cent) during the COVID-19 imposed lockdown compared to their unmarried
peers (16 per cent).57 Correspondingly, a study conducted recorded the occurrence of 462 and 174
child marriages during the months of June and July 2020 respectively.58 The study found that parents,
relatives and community members facilitated child marriages as a means to reduce the burden families
faced during the lockdown period.
These findings are intrinsically tied to the overall context of child marriage discussed in this report and
were exacerbated by the lockdown. Loss of social protection measures, economic downfall of already
underprivileged families, increasing gender discrimination and exposed vulnerabilities of girls and
women, as a result of the pandemic, contributed to an increase in child marriages. Additionally, due to
diverted priorities, the resulting limited focus of local community and law enforcement structures
responsible for the aversion of child marriage also contributed to an increase in child marriages. Thus,
cooperation and coordination among various stakeholders will be critical as the country continues to
battle not just COVID-19, but child marriage as a phenomenon.

Chapter 2: Evaluation purpose and methods
2.1 Theory of Change for Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
The following ToC’s are of particular relevance to ECM efforts in Bangladesh (Annexure 7):
National level ToC
A two-day workshop (February 24-25th, 2014), “Theory of Change: Ending Child Marriage in
Bangladesh,” was conducted jointly by UNFPA and Plan Bangladesh, and developed and facilitated by
the Asia Regional Office of International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW).59 The workshop
brought together different stakeholders and members of the community, including Government, NGOs,
INGOs, donors, religious leaders, and adolescent children under one platform to address issues related
to child marriage.60 The intent was to jointly conceptualise a ToC that should serve as a framework in
developing strategies, identifying goals and activities, and possibly developing monitoring and
evaluation indicators to ensure that short-term and long-term goals for ECM are met. This multi-level,
dynamic approach was then built into an overall comprehensive ToC framework at the national level.61
Based on an analysis of the drivers, consequences and solutions of child marriage, an ecological
framework, where a girl’s life impacts and is impacted upon by factors that operate at various levels
was undertaken to form the ToC. Participants identified five layers of influence on a girl’s life, considered
as five pillars of the ToC intended to end child marriage: Child, Family, Community, Institutions and
Policies.62 The strategies proposed, including using information and communication technologies to
inform and educate the family on child marriage prevention laws and change family and community
attitude to female child cut across all levels, and were particularly important to achieve gender
transformative results. Further, one of the five programme strategies explicitly state, “engage men and
boys”, a critical component to successfully eliminate child marriage in the country.
2017-2020 country programme ToC
The CP was developed in close dialogue with the GoB to ensure its alignment with the Seventh Five-
Year Plan, sectoral plans, the in-country process to define Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
indicators, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2017-2020, Concluding
Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and lessons from the Mid-Term
Review of the previous Country Programme.63 The vision of the ToC was noted as, “By 2020,
adolescent girls and boys in Bangladesh, especially the most disadvantaged, utilize quality basic social
services in a safe and protective environment, and are resilient and empowered as active agents of
change”.64 Headline results included improving equitable access to quality inclusive education and
reducing out-of-school children, and preventing violence against children.65 Of particular mention are
the implementing strategies prioritising children with disabilities which included addressing deprivations
of children with disabilities and leveraging mass media and communication efforts around social norms
and practices surrounding violence against children, disability and inclusive education. However, it is
critical to note that the Outcome 3 ToC is not an ECM focused one, but rather provides a framework for
child protection as a whole for adolescents in Bangladesh.

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
GPECM ToC
The global ToC was constructed to address the main recognised determinants that lead to child
marriage, though gaps were identified in the intervention logic. The ToC, which informed the programme
design, allowed for country-level contextualisation and adaptation, though only a few countries,
including Bangladesh, formally adapted the ToC.
2.2 Purpose and objectives of the evaluation
The UNICEF Bangladesh Country Office (BCO) contracted Ernst & Young LLP’s (EY LLP) services
for undertaking the final evaluation of their work on Ending Child Marriage (ECM).
Purpose
The overall objective of the evaluation was to assess the progress made by BCO towards the
achievements of results of its ECM programmes. The evaluation has analysed the relevance of
BCO’s work on ECM, effectiveness and added value of the joint UNFPA UNICEF GPECM and BCO’s
ECM interventions outside the GPECM funded through OR of different sections. It has identified
opportunities and barriers of the implementation of cross sectoral evidenced based intervention
strategies. Additionally, it has also identified good practices of convergence among sectors and
lessons especially from Phase I of the GPECM.
Based on the ToR, the specific objectives of the evaluation include:
1. Assess results against the strategies outlined in the Strategy Note on ECM and the results
framework and workplan of the GPECM.
2. Assess cross sectoral convergence and collaboration and if the comparative advantage of each
sector was leveraged.
3. Assess to what extent the scale and sustainability have been built into the interventions.
4. Assess the extent to which equity and gender equality have been address in the programme
implementation.
5. Assess whether the programme was gender transformative in its design and whether it has led
to gender transformative results.
6. Assess how UNICEF BCO used its standing with the GoB to push the ECM agenda and how it
leveraged the local consultative groups (LCG) Women Advancement and Gender Equality
platform for national level advocacy.
7. Assess how BCO built and promoted partnerships with all stakeholders especially the women’s
organisations and civil society.
8. Assess the extent to which policies and laws at the national level have been translated and
used at the district and upazilla level.
9. Calculate the cost-effectiveness of the programme.
10. Develop a methodology that uses existing information to estimate the number of child marriages
that are averted and prevented.
11. Assess the impact of COVID-19 on Child Marriage
Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional objective (objective 11) was added to the
scope of the evaluation. With the added vulnerabilities created by COVID-19 and the consequent
restrictions and lockdown, it was vital to capture the phenomenon of child marriage in Bangladesh in
the light of the current pandemic.
The findings from this evaluation will help understand lessons learnt and in informing the next phase of
the GPECM. Additionally, the findings will help UNICEF and Government of Bangladesh in developing
the next Country Programme Document 2021-2025. Moreover, the findings will act as accountability
and help donors who support the various programmes on ending child marriage.

2.3 Scope of evaluation
Reference period of the evaluation: The evaluation notes that ECM related work was covered under
the current Country Programme (2016-2020) and GPECM Phase 1 (1st January 2016-31st December
2019). However, this evaluation includes not only activities covered till the end of GPECM Phase 1 but
has also looked into 2020 as the evaluation was deferred by UNICEF on account of the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic. This allowed the evaluation to cover aspects of the COVID-19 impact. Specific objectives
and evaluation questions on the COVID-19 aspect were defined further in close consultation with
UNICEF.
Geographic coverage for the evaluation: The evaluation has covered work undertaken at the national
level and aspects of the programme that were conducted at ECM districts, either through GPECM
interventions or other ECM activities. All activities implemented during the period of evaluation have
been covered with a focus on the progress towards achieving outputs and contributions towards
outcomes as defined in the GPECM and BCO CP Outcome 3 Theories of Change (ToC) (Annexure 7).
Based on this point, we incorporated a non-experimental evaluation design in all five divisions namely,
Mymensingh, Dhaka, Barisal, Khulna and Rangpur. In each division, one district and one upazilla
within (ECM, GPECM or both) the selected district was covered for primary data collection (see
sampling below).
2.4 Approach and methodology
2.4.1 Approach
As a part of our overall approach, our team structured and rolled out OECD DAC criteria-based
framework in order to capture the data/information required to comprehensively assess the progress
towards achieving results of the ECM programme across intervention districts, including the value and
impact of the joint UNFPA-UNICEF GPECM programme as well as the impact of interventions outside
of the GPECM. The evaluation has incorporated assessment a theory-based evaluation framework,
which has been attached as Annexure 6. The evaluation framework was developed using the DAC
criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. It also maps the evaluation questions
and the tools that have been used to collect the same.
2.4.2 Methodology
This section explains various steps that were undertaken during the course of the evaluation along with
research methods and strategies that were applied.
Phase I: Inception Phase
The kick-off call followed by an inception meeting in Dhaka (February 2020) was attended by key
stakeholders from UNICEF with the objective of developing a common understanding of
the ToR and confirm expectations, scope of the evaluation, timelines and deliverables.
Post the inception meeting, the evaluation team was preparing for the data collection to
commence in March 2020. However, with COVID-19 exploding the evaluation was
halted. As a response, alternate methodologies were proposed by the team for UNICEF’s consideration
in April 2020. In May 2020 a decision was taken to defer the evaluation by four months. Unfortunately,
with the situation not improving, a decision was taken in September 2020 consultation with UNICEF to
adopt a “blended methodology” as the way forward to allow flexibility in design considering the ever-
changing circumstances posed by the pandemic.
COVID-19 response: Blended methodological approach through remote data
collection, supplemented with face to face interactions and literature review
Page | 26 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
The revised methodology included data harnessed through a review of literature along with remote data
collection through telephonic interviews with key stakeholders. Remote data collection was further
supplemented by in-person interactions where possible after assessing its feasibility and necessary
clearance from UNICEF and Ethical Review Board. In order to undertake face to face interactions,
the evaluation team brought on board local consultants in Bangladesh.
Role of local consultants in data
collection
The team of local consultants was
onboarded to primarily carry out
field-based interactions at the
district and upazilla level. This was a recognition
of the fact that critical strategies used for
qualitative interactions such as observations,
rapport building with key stakeholders and
developing a primary understanding of potential
Figure 2: Blended approach
impact of local customs and cultural norms of the
participants, was not possible through remote
interviews. For certain stakeholders, especially those at the community levels such as adolescent girls
and boys, community members, and parents, among others, building trust is imperative. The local
consultants were engaged to gain a detailed account of respondents’ experiences with the ECM
programme.
Remote stakeholder consultations
Amidst the circumstantial constraints, the evaluation team from India undertook
extensive remote interactions with the National level and UNICEF staff which was
supplemented by field-based interactions that was led by our local consultants in districts
and upazillas in Bangladesh. The remote interviews were used to gather narrative data
on the stakeholder’s participation, experience, opinions and assessment. The remote
interviews were conducted using the convergent interviewing technique as it seeks to resolve
the dilemma of broad versus specific questions with a structured approach.
With the adoption of the blended approach the evaluation team took necessary steps to ensure
adequate protocols were set in place as the engagement navigated through the pandemic. Some of the
measures included (but not limited to) the following:
• Crucial role of our lead local consultant, Rashida Parveen (Senior Thematic Expert based in
Dhaka) who played a frontal role in enhancing rapport building with participants over the
telephone and to improve the quality of interactions with stakeholders at all levels
• Survey instruments were reformulated to meet certain best practices criteria for remote
interviews as given by prominent organisations66
Literature review
The blended data collection approach was complemented with a review of
literature and documents that covered programmatic and non-programmatic
facets. The evaluation utilised programme and result reports prepared by the
programme implementers and UNICEF’s sectoral teams. Further, a logically precise
review of the programme results-based framework, programme cooperation agreements and work
plans helped to record occurrences and variances over the programme duration. Understanding the
programme’s theory through existing documentation was an integral part of our secondary research in

practices-conducting-phone-surveys
Page | 27 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
providing evidence for why certain aspects of the programme “worked” or “didn’t work”. Secondary data
analysis was also carried out by aggregating, analysing, and synthesising previous research reports
from empirical literature or existing databases.
Data collection methods
Specific revisions were made to methods and tools to adapt to the blended approach for
data collection. Overall, adjustments to tools were made in terms of length, number of
open-ended questions, and re-phrasing of sensitive questions, as a practical step in
carrying data collection.
The following section elaborates on the data collection methods and tools:
In-depth Interviews (IDI) were conducted with adolescent girls and boys who are affiliated and not
affiliated with adolescent clubs to develop an understanding of the impact of the programme. It was
designed to develop a narrative that helped reveal gaps and potential areas of improvement and gauge
the level of inclusion of the programme of the most marginalised communities.
Semi-structured Interviews were undertaken with community stakeholders to gain relevant insights
into the extent of behaviour change and their engagement towards a collective action to prevent child
marriages within target intervention areas
Key Informant Interviews (KII): These interviews facilitated the emergence of a broader perspective
and specific recommendations to make the evaluation findings more useful for stakeholders. These
interactions additionally helped in understanding the policies, programmes and initiatives that the
various stakeholders have put in place for eliminating child marriage, mobilisation, institutional
strengthening, advocacy, and law enforcement to support policy and legal reform against child
marriages. Further, the tool also allowed us to clarify the reasons for any incongruity that emerged
between the document review and the qualitative interactions.
U-Report polls: The team also reviewed the u-report polls that have already been conducted on child
marriage by UNICEF. While these polls included non-representative samples of adolescents, their
review helped in developing a wider understanding of the programme strategies and the contextual
variables that appear to facilitate or prevent progress towards achieving project outcomes.
Data Checklist: These were used to gather programme specific data that helped provide benchmarks
for comparing the analysis that was drawn from the data collected through the other qualitative tools. It
also helped us in collecting data pertaining to programme activities and was primarily used for collecting
data/information required to comment upon the programme’s effectiveness.
Mapping of key stakeholders
UNICEF’s ECM programme is structured around the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) to ensure
targeted interventions. It guides the programme with an effective framework to understand
the multiple levels of a social system and the interactions between individuals and
environment within this system.
Recognising the importance of SEM as an approach, we have applied the model to contribute in
identification of relevant key stakeholders at various levels. At an individual level, key target groups
included adolescent girls and boys. Similarly, second level, interpersonal, comprised family and
community members & leaders. The figure below maps the various stakeholders covered in the
Page | 28 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
evaluation against the five hierarchical, closely related and interconnected levels of the model 67
.
Figure 3: Socioecological Model
Adopting such an approach also assisted in understanding the multifaceted and interactive effects of
personal and environmental factors that determine behaviours that either propagate or deter practices
surrounding child marriages.68 It has also informed the designing of our relevant data collection
instruments to gauge the effectiveness of the interventions targeted at specific stakeholders under
UNICEF’s ECM programme.
In line with the same, a stakeholder mapping exercise was undertaken to identify and ensure the
inclusion of a broad range of stakeholders in the evaluation. It must be also noted that the evaluation
team was flexible to include any additional stakeholder suggested by respondents during interactions
subject to respondent availability and overall COVID – 19 context. A list of stakeholders mapped for
data collection along with the tools used has been placed in (Annexure 2).

Figure 4: Respondent selection criteria
Respondent selection and identification
The listed categories of respondents from the community, particularly the adolescent girls and boys
(affiliated and not affiliated to adolescent clubs), were selected to adopt a maximum variation approach.
Further, it must be noted that adolescents’ boys & girls (10-19 years) and young women & men who
were married in the last two – four years (as a minor) were primarily considered for the evaluation.
The parameters mentioned in Figure 4 were considered for identification of respondents to account for
the varying backgrounds and inclusivity of the participants. With support of the implementation partner,
a list of adolescent girls and boys (affiliated and not affiliated to adolescent clubs) along with their
telephone numbers was shared with the evaluation team, in addition to details of other community and
district level stakeholders. In this regard, varying backgrounds and inclusivity of the respondents was
taken into consideration by including more women, differently abled people, and respondents from
marginalised population, while also keeping respondents who may not belong to disadvantaged
sections.
The districts have been selected consultatively with UNICEF and a purposive sampling has been
adopted to ensure that the selected districts have upazillas covered through GPECM interventions or
other ECM activities or a combination of both and are a convergent programme district for UNICEF’s
sectoral teams. The evaluation team further selected upazillas with convergent programming by
UNICEF’s sectoral teams from the list of upazillas provided by UNICEF. Finally, our purposive sampling
technique at the upazilla level is followed up with the method of convenience sampling to arrive at the
final data collection sites. However, in the face of the restrictions posed due to COVID-19 induced
lockdown, data collection in only selective upazillas was carried out post consultation with UNICEF.
Establishing an Evaluation Reference Group (ERG)
An oversight body was constituted: Evaluation Reference group (ERG). This group assisted in
guiding the evaluation and met at the specified points during the engagement lifecycle to review and
comment upon the work. A brief ToR for the ERG has been appended as Annexure 14 for reference.
Phase II: Primary data collection
Data collection began with the Team Leader and Senior Thematic Expert holding an online workshop
with all team members. This was followed by a face to face workshop held at DCN office by the Senior
thematic Expert with the data collection team. KIIs with key stakeholders at the national level were
Page | 30 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
remotely led by the Team Leader. Field-based interactions in April 2021 and May 2021 were undertaken
by the team local consultants in Bangladesh. A copy of the field plan has been attached as Annexure
10. As per the plan primary research had to be carried out with 96 respondents. However due to the
prevailing situation it was possible to cover only 79 respondents (15 IDIs with adolescent girls and boys,
50 KIIs with stakeholders within UNICEF and the government and 14 SSIs with community level
stakeholders at the Upazilla level like parents and members of CBCPCs).

Table 4: Data Collection Tool with Achieved Sample
The ToR was developed for the field team also keeping COVID-19 protocols in mind and the same has
been attached as Annexure 9.
Phase III: Analysis and report writing phase
a) Qualitative data analysis
The qualitative information formed a larger part of the report, due to the range of
information that was obtained from the multiple stakeholders of the ECM and GPECM
programmes. To initiate the organisation of qualitative data, the KIIs, IDIs, and semi-
structured interviews, a workshop mode was adopted wherein the objective was to triangulate the data
collected against the information provided by the various stakeholders in order to derive final
conclusions/answers against each evaluation question. Once this workshop was completed, the team
had a set of four excel sheets disaggregating information into main sections of the evaluation framework
including Relevance and Responsiveness, Effectiveness and Impact, Efficiency and Sustainability. The
same files were then referred to for the entire set of data/information/insights which would feed into the
evaluation report.
Given the nature of the evaluation design being predominantly qualitative in nature the focus of the
evaluation was to garner perspectives, document changes that have taken place and create an element
of traceability between where things were and where things currently stand. An attempt was therefore
be made to discern the role played by stakeholders, especially change agents. The analysis was
therefore inductive in nature where responses provided by diverse user groups were analysed for usage
of matching terms or similar sentence patterns. These in turn were assessed for consistency to see if
there are shared perceptions or sentiments being aired across similar user groups across diverse
regions, indicating consistency in delivery of activities in the project. Notes maintained during the course
of interactions were reviewed to see if views expressed on themes are individual in nature or have an
element of group-view about them. The analysis was therefore evaluative, iterative but progressive,
with information gathering and analysis proceeding together. At an aggregate level, the following
analysis techniques were used to glean maximum information and use of these analysis techniques
depended on the type of information or pattern that was being reported.

Type of analysis Objective
Content analysis To enable categorisation of verbal or behavioural data. It is usually analysed at
both a descriptive level as well as at an inferential level
Narrative analysis Transcribed experiences basis a KII or an IDI with the stakeholder concerned
Evaluative analysis To respond to the evaluation questions, taking the evaluation criteria into
consideration
Gender analysis To understand if the programme had different impact on girls, boys women and
men, while ensuring that the different needs of girls, boys, women and men were
clearly identified and addressed by the interventions. Further, note any
differences between and among women and men, based on the unequal
distribution of resources, opportunities, constraints and power among other
factors.
Table 5:Type of Analysis and Objective
b) Applying triangulations and complementarity
After analysing the information, the information obtained was grouped as per various heads related to
the evaluation questions. They were then summarised and critically analysed to find answers to the
evaluation questions. In case of any incongruence in one topic from primary source, the data was
triangulated from a secondary source. The exercise enabled us to also validate the primary data
collected during the field visit. Additionally, all types of data arising from the literature review was
triangulated with the findings from the field to ensure that internal validity is maximised. Apart from
triangulation, we also use complementarity to use data generated from the desk review to elaborate on
information generated from the qualitative interviews.
The data gathered was analysed to ascertain to what extent the interventions had contributed to achieve
the 4 key result areas mentioned in the previous section. A causal connect between the strategies and
related interventions and the ECM strategy note was examined to ascertain what had worked well and
which strategies or interventions needed to be relooked.
Methodology for cost effectiveness
The cost effectiveness analysis was carried out by triangulating data collated by UNICEF
and secondary research. Data provided by UNICEF BCO contained the number of
beneficiaries across the programme’s output indicators and the expenditure of UNCIEF
across outcomes (in USD). A key component of the cost effectiveness analysis of the
GPECM programme was the per-beneficiary cost. This cost was calculated by summing
the number of beneficiaries for outputs and dividing it by the total expenditure for their
respective outcome. The same methodology was adopted to calculate per-beneficiary
costs for other countries. While costs were calculated in this manner, benefits could not be
measured using the data shared by UNICEF. As a result, the effectiveness of the
programme was gauged by comparing the actual number of beneficiaries of various outputs to their
respective targets. Finally, Bangladesh’s per-beneficiary costs (2017-19) of Outcome 1, Outcome 2,
and Outcome 3 were compared with other GPECM countries.
This analysis was used to calculate the per-beneficiary cost for the abovementioned sectoral
interventions in Bangladesh. Due to the absence of any known targets for the abovementioned
interventions, the actual per-beneficiary costs could not be compared with the targets to gauge
effectiveness or success. As a result, through secondary research, studies were found that established
the benefits that could be accrued through interventions in the abovementioned areas. The costs were
then compared to these benefits.
Report writing
Page | 32 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
The evaluation report has been structured around the OECD DAC criteria where ‘relevance’,
‘effectiveness & impact’, ‘efficiency’, and ‘sustainability’ are separate chapters. Gender and
equity perspectives have been clearly highlighted but incorporated across the five sections to
avoid duplicity. Further, the report attempts to provide detailed gender analysis and organise
information about gender differences wherein the focus includes analysis of key national laws and
policies, difference in access to assets, services and resources. Additionally, the evaluation attempted
to capture the wider community social norms, traditions and contexts that helped set the context and
identify causality and key drivers of child marriage among target beneficiaries. Similarly, findings related
to the 5 major strategies of the ECM have also been interwoven across the section.
Evaluation Rubric
A key component of the evaluation was the creation of a rubric that enabled mapping of the key
questions. This was assessed against a ranking matrix with the parameters of
‘Excellent/Good/Adequate/Poor’. This rubric aims to gauge the performance of BCO’s ECM efforts and
highlight areas that require improvement. It is key to note here, however, that rankings have been
provided for evaluation questions suited to be mapped against the rankings. In general, the rankings
may be interpreted aligned with the description provided below in Table 6.
Rating Description
Excellent implies that the programme has met all set targets for the context to be
Excellent
addressed. Gradual improvements may be required, if the context so demands
Good implies that while the programme has shown correct efforts to address the context.
Good There may be room for improvement with respect to strengthening efforts in a manner that
allows for sustainable and long-term change
Adequate implies that the programme has met basic expectations on the whole. Significant
Adequate
enhancement may be required for better overall impact
Poor implies that the programme has not met basic expectations and/or not shown
Poor minimally acceptable progress on the whole. Immediate and major improvements are
critical
Table 6: General Rubric Ranking Descriptors
2.5 Quality assurance procedures
The evaluation team put in place a robust engagement management plan through which ensured the
quality and relevance of our deliverables. The final deliverable is an output of a carefully planned and
well executed approach and methodology; one which has in place sufficient number of quality checks
and measures. Detailed steps of our QA plan have been Annexed in this report as Annexure 11.
2.6 Risk and mitigation measures
As per our understanding of the TOR, the evaluation team had enlisted few risks which may have had
the potential to undermine the reliability and validity of the evaluation results. Mitigation strategies were
proposed for countering the potential risks based on our strong understanding of risk management
systems. (Attached as Annexure 12)
2.7 Ethical considerations
The evaluation team understands that there is a need for evaluators to consider the dimensions of
human rights and gender equality and for these to reflect in the tools and framework for the evaluation.
The approach and methodology used to carry out this evaluation is developed in accordance with and
adhering to the ‘UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection and
Analysis’. Further, the team has adhered to the guidelines for Ethical Research Involving Children and
integrated Human Rights (HR) and Gender Equality (GE) perspectives while carrying out the required
field-based research. Ethical considerations for the respondents and a code of conduct was developed
Page | 33 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
(Annexure 3) and was an important part of training to the team members and researchers.
Obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) Clearance
Institute of Health Economics (IHE) has an Institutional Review Board (IRB) registered with the
Federal wide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of Human Subjects. It is an authorised panel of
members that provide ethical approval for conducting research. For the purpose of this evaluation/
Ethical clearances from IHE- IRB has been obtained for the adoption of blended approach and
evaluation tools. Approval was received post incorporation of changes suggested by IHE-IRB. IRB
approval letter has been added to Annexure 4.
2.8 Limitations
• Given that the programme started in 2016, a number of key stakeholders closely involved in the
conceptualisation and implementation of the programme in Phase I were difficult to reach
especially in the case of UNICEF officials, local government officials and implementing partner
organisation staff who had been replaced, and adolescents who were not be residing in the
intervention areas any more for various reasons. As a result, there was limited institutional memory
of the process of design and implementation of the programme. Moreover, the COVID-19
pandemic and ongoing restrictions further limited the ability of participants to be reached and
engaged with.
• The sampling plan was prepared after extensive consultations during the kick-off meeting. The
districts and upazillas were identified after taking into consideration a number of factors as
mentioned above. Similar rigor was followed in identifying criteria for the respondents too.
However, due to the time lag and resulting limited availability of adolescents who had participated
in the ECM programme, all the respondents could not be reached. In view of this, it is possible that
some significant aspects of the programme were missed, and some biases crept in reaching out
to the respondents in the community. Since the adolescents were the end users of the programme,
establishing a causal relation to the interventions may have been impacted.
• As Phase 1 of the programme ended in December 2019, the findings can inform and strengthen
strategies to be used in subsequent phases but cannot assess and comment upon the final impact
of programme. Relatedly, given the gap of almost two years between completion of Phase 1, delay
caused by COVID in the start of the Phase 2 of the programme and the evaluation being
conducted, it was noted that community stakeholders particularly had to be probed to recollect
their association with the ECM interventions. Further, field interactions in Bhola and Khulna districts
found that with the support of UNICEF, the respective Implementing Partners are currently carrying
out similar interventions for ECM outside of the scope of activities identified for this evaluation. As
a result, there was lack of clarity among respondents on the impact of previous BCO ECM
interventions.
• The ToR sought to maintain a difference in terms of programme and funding related findings
associated with the GPECM and ECM interventions of UNICEF BCO. However, whether
programmatic or financial, reporting undertaken by UNICEF during the implementation did not
have clear compartmentalisation between the two. Therefore, maintaining clear separation or to
avoid overlap in terms of findings related to the two programmes was not possible. Additionally,
field interactions highlighted that the respondents were unable to distinguish between GPECM and
BCO ECM interventions. This lack of clarity was palpable even among Implementing Partners.
• While undertaking cost benefit analysis, in both the analyses (for GPECM and BCO ECM
programmes), it was assumed that the number of beneficiaries shared by UNICEF BCO are unique
beneficiaries. While comparing the per-beneficiary cost of Bangladesh to other GPECM countries,
Page | 34 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
it was assumed that data on number of beneficiaries and expenditure was collected in the same
manner. Moreover, the comparative analysis does not account for the purchasing power of USD
in different countries. The benefits in the ECM analysis were calculated from different secondary
sources for various areas. It may be noted that the methodology to calculate the costs and benefits
are not the same. Due to the absence of data with respect to the number of beneficiaries married
prior to the interventions and the number post the intervention, it is difficult to attribute causality to
specific interventions carried out in Bangladesh.69
• The COVID-19 induced restrictions made it challenging to access data and information on how the
pandemic has impacted the programme and its beneficiaries in sampled upazillas, districts.
Further, with the ongoing restrictions, commenting on the impact relied heavily on the availability
of such information. Therefore, any comment aligned to this angle was limited to assumptions and
predictions from key stakeholders interacted with.
69 Non-robust analysis and insufficient data has limited the cost effective analysis from presenting conclusive findings

Chapter 3: Evaluation findings
Data generated through the desk review and remote and on-field consultations were analysed to answer
key questions of the evaluation framework. The following section presents the key findings across the
identified evaluation criterion of Relevance, Effectiveness and Impact, Efficiency and Sustainability.
Findings have been mapped to specific evaluation questions under each category. Based on the key
findings, a rubric has also been created to identify the status of progression that has been achieved by
BCO strategies and interventions for ECM in Bangladesh aligned to the evaluation questions. The same
has been categorised as Excellent, Good, Adequate or Poor (Annexure 16).

To what extent is the programme relevant and responsive to contribute toward ending child
marriage in Bangladesh? To what extent has the programme been designed in a way that is
responsive to different groups in the society, their own contexts and needs?
3.1.1 Programme objectives are excellently relevant and responsive to needs of girls and
adolescents who are vulnerable to early marriage in Bangladesh.
Recognising the adverse impact child marriage has on the lives of girls and adolescents, ECM
programming in Bangladesh aimed to change harmful social norms and structures, while also
addressing immediate drivers in target districts over a short to medium-term period. Through a focus
on adolescent empowerment, community mobilisation and awareness, institutional strengthening and
law enforcement, BCO’s efforts have appropriately identified and responded to the need of the hour.
BCOs ECM efforts saw application of a gamut of strategies and interventions that targeted adolescent
girl well-being, community engagement with key stakeholders for the creation of an enabling
environment as well as high level advocacy with authorities to allow for a supportive legal and policy
framework. Efforts were carried out through a combination of strategies that recognise the fact that
while the occurrence of child marriage is primarily attributed to underlying harmful gender norms and
structures, causality analysis highlights the multi-faceted nature of key drivers in the country.70
To elucidate, through adolescent clubs BCOs ECM efforts aimed to mobilise out-of-school adolescent
(especially girls) and those in school, and provide them with leadership training, life skills development
and peer education training with a focus on ECM and adolescent development issues. Additionally, as
part of the C4D strategy, targeted partnerships with the Islamic Foundation of Bangladesh and other
faith-based organisations were formed to promote the ending of child marriage through dialogue and
messaging among families, especially parents. Further, BCO ECM efforts also focused on engaging
out of school adolescent girls and providing them with access to vocational training through existing set
ups. Moreover, ECM strategies also aimed to focus on identifying livelihood opportunities to adolescent
girls within the community to promote financial independence and break out of the cycle of
intergenerational poverty.71
3.1.2 Programme objectives are excellently aligned to international and national laws and
priorities that seek to prioritise ending child marriage and protecting the rights of women and
girls.
The Government of Bangladesh has placed a strong focus at the highest political levels on ending child
marriage. At the UK Girls’ Summit in 2014, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, committed
Bangladesh to end marriage for children younger than 15 by 2021, and for all girls under age 18 by
2041.72 The commitment to address this child rights violation is also evidenced in the National Seventh
Five Year Plan which set a target of reducing the proportion of child marriage to 30 per cent by the year
2020.73 These high-level commitments have paved the way for both Government and development
partners to prioritise and accelerate investments in targeted solutions to end child marriage.74 Already,
the Government has formulated the National Women Development Policy- 2011, the National Children
Policy- 2011, the Children Act- 2013 and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2017 to ensure and protect
child rights.75
The government of the people’s republic of Bangladesh has also committed to fulfilling various
international commitments, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the

Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Declaration,
including the Action Plan and Beijing platform.76 Further, the SDGs, specifically target 5.3 aims to
“eliminate all harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage.” This is a critical tool to help
drive action, hold governments around the world accountable to their commitments, and track progress
on ending child marriage at the global scale.
This evaluation finds that BCO’s ECM programme was aligned to the UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child (CRC). While the CRC does not explicitly address early marriage, nearly the entire Convention
is relevant to its harmful consequences, especially the right to protection from violence (Article 19), the
right to health (Article 24), the right to education (Article 28), and the right to protection from sexual
exploitation and abuse (Article 34).77 A UNICEF Paper Series (2007) states that “while child marriage
is not referred to directly in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, child marriage is connected
to other rights - such as the right to express their views freely, the right to protection from all forms of
abuse, and the right to be protected from harmful traditional practices”.78
Additionally, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)
provides for the prohibition of Child Marriage in Article 16.79 Unlike the CRC, CEDAW contains a specific
provision prohibiting the practice of early marriages. CEDAW Article 16(2) provides that child marriages
shall have no legal effect. Thus, child marriages in those states that have ratified CEDAW not only
violate international law but are void.
Lastly, UNICEF BCO’s CP 2017-2020 is found to contribute to national priorities, including the Seventh
Five-Year Plan, to complete the remaining agenda of achieving the social and economic outcomes of
the Government’s Vision 2021 and the Perspective Plan 2010-2021. Further, it also aligns with national
priorities with the achievement of nearly all of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the
objectives of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Bangladesh 2017-
2020.80
3.1.3 Programme was designed in a comprehensive manner, excellently accounting for different
groups in society and their own contexts and needs.
BCO’s ECM efforts were designed using three approaches – area-based approach, lifecycle approach
and multisectoral approach. A combination of these three approaches helped in looking at the design
of the programme from different perspectives.
The selection of geography was based on several considerations including the 2012-2016 UNDAF
priorities, UNICEF’s programme presence, scope of local government partners, and presence of NGOs
and other partners, among others. As per the Strategy Note, the choice of intervention districts
considers child marriage prevalence rates and geographical proximity, to address the issue of scale,
both by addressing beneficiary numbers and seizing the opportunity of positive contamination and
cross-district learning at the divisional levels. Districts with high prevalence rates of child marriage were
identified from MICS 2013. The life cycle approach is followed in the Country Programme and it guides
the planning process. Besides, multisectoral interventions has been the core strength of UNICEF.
These approaches were used to identify diverse areas that provided an opportunity to address the issue
in different contexts.
Field interactions also highlighted the relevance of the area-based programming approach adopted.

security as well as acute gender discrimination among other key factors, child marriage records a high
rate in the selected geographical areas for programme implementation. Additionally, interactions also
highlighted the district specific factors that contribute to the high rates of child marriage. For instance,
ECM interventions in Dhaka focused on marginalised and low-income slum areas that recorded high
rates of child marriage. Moreover, the selected districts of Khulna and Bhola are highly prone disaster
areas and the resulting economic vulnerability further adds to the high rates of child marriage. Further,
Bhola is also an island district, isolated from the mainland and adolescent girls are at a high risk of
exploitation and abuse from local landlords and religious fundamentalists. With respect to Jamalpur,
field findings highlighted the role the district plays in the supply of day labourers81 to Dhaka city as a
critical factor of high rates of child marriage. Additionally, as a highly flood prone area, children’s
vulnerability to child marriage is high.
With an aim to reach the largest number of beneficiaries and remain aligned to funding and other
priorities, interventions were chosen based on the context on the area. For example, respondents in
Bhola highlighted that due to a limited number of schools and colleges in the district, parents prefer
sending their adolescent children to madrasas. As a result, adolescents are largely unaware of their
rights and the national laws that exist for their protection. Recognising this, BCOs ECM interventions
placed a strong focus on generating awareness on the adverse impact of child marriage and the existing
legal provisions to protect adolescents from the same. Simultaneously, adolescent girls and boys were
mobilised through the formation of adolescent clubs to provide them with knowledge and skills and
serve as platform for them to raise their voices.
Overall, this evaluation highlights that the ECM programme adopted a combination of strategies to
address the complexities associated with prevalence of child marriage. Interventions to address
unequal gender norms and practices and overall empowerment for girls were piloted in one district.
Similarly, cash incentives through a case-management CCT initiative were rolled out in specific
upazillas. Focussed initiatives such as institutional strengthening, law enforcement, social mobilisation
and awareness raising, however, were rolled out across all selected districts. Further, the evaluation
found that the programme correctly considered DRR, disability and vulnerable groups in their approach,
however, the implementation and effectiveness of the same will be explored in subsequent sections of
the report. Across interventions, there was a concentrated focus on building the capacities of girls and
adolescents and making them agents of change.
To what extent do the programme strategies and activities address structural drivers of (gender)
inequality?
3.1.4 Programme correctly adopted gender-transformative interventions and strategies to
eliminate child marriage. These were focused on tackling harmful gender roles, norms and
power relations in the context of Bangladesh for good impact.
UNICEF BCO adopted a combination of intervention strategies to address both demand and supply
side constraints to leverage results in accelerating an end to child marriage in the target geographies.
The intervention strategies in themselves had a strong gender dimension– separate interventions for
adolescent girls and boys; involvement of fathers in parent groups to sensitise them on the harmful
impact of child marriage; enhancing the value of girls in society and building assets for adolescent girls
among others– in order to ensure that there was a shift in perceptions and practices that adversely
impact girls and women in society. The programme also relied heavily on strategies of adolescent
empowerment, attainment of education for girls, and livelihoods and financial incentives for adolescent
girls and their families.82
81 Respondents in Jamalpur highlighted the dire economic situation as a key factor that leads to early child marriage. As such,
many children are also sent to Dhaka as day child labourers to supplement family income. Resulting from this many adolescent
girls are entered into illegal marriages as a way to keep them “safe” and reduce the economic burden on the family.
82 BCO ECM Strategy Note 2016
Page | 39 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
The strategic interventions chosen to address adolescent empowerment and to ensure that girls were
able to complete secondary schooling and have access to livelihood options are expected to bring about
a ‘shift’ in perceptions – specifically those that emerge in a highly patriarchal society where girls and
women are considered ‘less valuable’ and deserving of a ‘lesser stature’. This was reinforced during
field interactions that highlighted that BCO ECM messaging and efforts focused on the importance of
gender equality to ending child marriage and creating an environment of value for girls.
The incorporation of boys (30 per cent) in adolescent clubs and increased engagement of fathers and
mothers were positive actions to encourage a shift in power relations between girls and boys or men
and women. Most adolescent clubs in the country received life skills training and support in assessing
financial means to facilitate income generation. Nationally, approximately 15 per cent of adolescent girls
between 12 and 18 years were participating in one form of club or group.83 A key intervention strategy
was the mobilisation of out-of-school adolescents (especially girls) into adolescent clubs, alongside
those who are in school, with the aim of providing them with leadership, life skills development and peer
education training with a focus on the prevention of child marriage and adolescent development issues
(health, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, HIV/AIDS, nutrition). 84 Union level monitoring reports that have
been submitted to the district office, for instance, in a few of the intervention districts, and confirmed by
the implementing NGO BRAC, have shown that in the wards where both young girls and boys as well
as out of school children frequent adolescent clubs regularly, less cases of sexual harassment of girls
have been reported, with young boys often playing the role of a protective companion when girls have
to venture out of their community.
Additionally, the global programme evaluation also found that BCOs efforts towards involvement of men
as fathers, gatekeepers and leaders in community dialogues has helped to create a more supportive
environment for adolescent girls to exercise their rights and to challenge gender norms and stereotypes.
The involvement of women as mothers and gatekeepers has also been critical and integrated into many
community-level approaches.85 The scale-up of courtyard community meetings is noteworthy in this
regard.
Other gender-transformative interventions included accelerating cooperation in the protection of women
and children by activating the Community Based Child Protection Committee (CBCPC), union women
and child abuse prevention committees. Under Outcome 3 of the Country Programme, families and
communities, including local and religious leaders, as well as other key influencers, were informed,
mobilised and engaged, enabling them to take action to protect adolescent and child rights, especially
those around gendered social norms and practices. These efforts included the creation of Community-
Based Child Protection Committees and support to public declarations to end child marriage.86 As found
by the evaluation group, these actions correctly address the drivers of child marriage and structural
drivers of inequality in the context of Bangladesh.
To what extent is the ToC that guides the ECM work in Bangladesh well developed, aligned with
the Bangladesh context, based on robust evidence and realistic in its assumptions and
pathways of change?
3.1.5 ECM work in BCO is found to be guided by two Theories of Change. One at the National
level and the other proposed by GPECM. The one proposed by GPECM has helped to develop
good strategies which are followed to address the issue.
The National level TOC was developed through participation of a number of organisations. A multi-
stakeholder meeting took place in December 2014 to develop an extensive analysis of the situation of
child marriage in Bangladesh and developed a theory of change for the work around ECM in the country,

which was in turn the basis of the BCO strategy note for ECM.87 Additionally, MoWCA88 developed
elements from documents by organisations such as Plan/ICRW/UNFPA, Girls Not Brides Alliance and
Maxwell Stamp, a study that had been commissioned by UNICEF, and used the main findings to form
the basis of the National Action Plan to End Child Marriage (2018-2021).89 Thereafter, UNICEF BCO
aligned their programmes with the National Action Plan and wherever possible concretely included
related outputs and activities in the rolling work plans, in partnership with the Government. When
GPECM was launched in Bangladesh, the BCO aligned all interventions aimed at ECM to global
strategies under the GPECM and brought them under the joint programme with UNFPA.90 With respect
to the BCO Country Programme 2017-2020, ECM has been incorporated within the TOC for Outcome
3. It is critical to note, however, that the Outcome 3 ToC is not an ECM focused one, but rather provides
a framework for child protection as a whole for adolescents in Bangladesh.
The ToC developed as part of GPECM was constructed to address the main recognised determinants
that lead to child marriage, though gaps were identified in the intervention logic. The ToC, which
informed the programme design, allowed for country-level contextualisation and adaptation, though only
a few countries, including Bangladesh, formally adapted the ToC.
Drivers and causes of child marriage as identified by the Global ToC include:
• Discrimination against girls and women
• Gender roles that restrict girls and women to family and household roles
• Economic opportunities/structures of the economy
• Inaccessible and/or low-quality services such as schools or health facilities
• Legal and policy frameworks that do not protect adolescents
The Strategy note on ECM developed by BCO identifies similar drivers for child marriage, including
gender-based violence. However, in the global programme TOC, gender-based violence has not been
explicitly identified as a key driver of child marriage although it does recognise discrimination against
girl child as a factor. The strategy has not made an explicit mention of violence against girls including
sexual harassment as a driver for child marriage. As elaborated previously, gender-based violence in
private and public spheres limits the agency of adolescent girls, pushing them into child marriage as a
‘safety net’. Since the global TOC also guides BCOs ECM efforts to a large extent, by not focusing on
it, this has also not found a direct place in the strategies identified by BCO.
A global evaluation of the TOC highlighted that there were gaps in the results framework, such as a lack
of outputs/indicators measuring Social and Behaviour Change (SBC) and advocacy as well as cross-
cutting issues related to programming principles. The reliance on quantitative indicators was also noted
as a weakness in understanding progress in terms of changes in perceptions, attitudes and behaviours
that contribute to the elimination of child marriage.91 This is a big gap because in the absence of relevant
indicators to monitor progress, it would be challenging to ascertain the impact.
The five strategies that guided BCOs ECM efforts are all very relevant to address the problem of ECM.
However, given the time frame results can be achieved only if it is building on its existing core area of
strength. For instance, UNICEF’s strategy on livelihood included moving people out of poverty through
livelihood training and financial incentives. However, several respondents reported reservations on the
success of this strategy. It was seen that Implementing Partners across visited districts faced challenges
with respect to adequate funds to apply this strategy, limiting its effectiveness. On the other hand, the
strategies of adolescent empowerment and community mobilisation and social behaviour change

recorded significant successes on ground. Moreover, given the socio-cultural context of Bangladesh
and widespread gender discrimination, creation of livelihood options for adolescent girls goes beyond
technical training and skilling. It requires focused efforts to create a holistic and empowering
environment within the community that will enable girls to translate their technical training into practical
experience. Therefore, by adopting an approach that builds on the strengths of BCOs ECM work while
simultaneously addressing the root causes of child marriage is critical.
As per the global evaluation of the TOCs, despite limitations, it drew on secondary evidence, primarily
from South Asia, as well as both UNICEF and UNFPA programming experience. The drivers of child
marriage identified in the ToC were also based on evidence and include a combination of structural and
socio-cultural factors.92 As mentioned previously, Bangladesh was one of the few GPECM countries
that formally adapted the global ToC to the country level.
How well aligned is UNICEF ECM programme with the National Plan of Action strategies and
pillars? Are there clear strategies of the NPA that UNICEF should focus on during the next ECM
programme given UNICEF’s expertise?
3.1.6 Programme is aligned to the strategic directions and objectives outlined in the Government
of Bangladesh’s Draft National Action Plan to End Child Marriage to a good degree. However,
areas for improved collaboration and capacity building remain.
To ensure alignment, strategies selected by UNICEF in their ECM efforts are in line with the strategic
directions outlined in the Government of Bangladesh’s Draft National Action Plan to End Child Marriage,
sector priorities outlined in policy documents of line ministries, and development priorities enlisted by
key donors who have identified ECM as a priority.93 For instance, the NAP to ECM objective focusing
on “empowerment of adolescents including increased opportunities for adolescent girls to acquire life-
skills and participate in decision-making within the family and community on issues that affect their
lives”94 is aligned to Outcome 3 of BCO’s CP, BCOs ECM Strategy Note as well as the various ToC’s
discussed in previous sections. Other objectives, including enhancing “access to quality education,
health, nutrition, protection, and water and sanitation services” are covered under the various UNICEF
sectoral programmes to ECM in the country.
Further, the activities proposed in UNICEF Bangladesh’s strategy to combat child marriage on one hand
will strengthen the existing legislation and its enforcement by raising awareness among key decision-
makers, while supporting the operationalisation of the costed five-year national action plan. To ensure
institutional strengthening it will engage with the kazis or marriage registrars, union parishad
chairpersons and members/commissioners towards holding them accountable for upholding the Child
Marriage Restraint Act. As such, it will be possible for UNICEF to concretely include related outputs
and activities in the rolling work plans of the CO, which are prepared in partnership with the Government.
Further, as the strategies identified by UNICEF are well aligned with the main outcomes established in
the government plan, advocating with national and local government partners as well as implementing
programme activities in the UNICEF target districts will take place more systematically.95
To what extent has the programme been implemented following a human rights, equity and
culturally sensitive approach?
3.1.7 While there have been good efforts to correctly implement the programme following a
human rights, equity and culturally sensitive approach, inclusion of certain vulnerable groups
can be further strengthened.

Programmes adopting the United Nations Human Rights and Gender Equality perspective integrate a
gender component and address issues such as power relations and social transformation, equal
inclusion and participation, as well as the empowerment of women.96 In the context of Bangladesh,
adopting United Nations Human Rights and Gender Equality in programming is of upmost importance.
Field interactions highlighted the limited acceptability of children’s rights and participation and the high
reluctance amongst parents to discuss challenges that adolescents face, that challenge the
implementation of a culturally sensitive programme. Additionally, BCO’s efforts for culturally sensitive
programming in Bangladesh has also been constricted by widespread acceptance of child marriage
among key stakeholders like parents, community level influencers, marriage registrars to name a few.
Under the 2017-2020 Country Programme, Outcome 3 specifies a focus on the most deprived
adolescents and their communities. Further, the equity for adolescents’ approach emphasises the
disaggregation of data that is sex- and age-specific and highlights sub-national differences. Active
involvement of decentralised structures, communities and adolescents is encouraged in the
development of evidence-based policies and strategies and implementation of high-impact
interventions to achieve universal coverage of basic social services.97 Further, it mentions that
addressing the particular vulnerabilities of adolescents with disabilities will be a key component of
Outcome 3.98 UNICEF BCO also supported Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in designing and launching
the first National Disability Survey in July 2021. It is key to note here that despite this, field interactions
highlighted the need for more robust programming to cater to the needs of children with disabilities.
UNICEF BCO Water, Sanitation and Hygiene interventions focused on access to safe sanitation and
water, designed to address cultural sensitivity and local issues. For example, the menstrual hygiene
management sessions in school were conducted by the female teachers. For adolescent girls, bathing
cubical were also provide in the community, with separate toilets for boys and girls. Additionally, MHM
facilities were also provided for the girl’s toilets of school/madrasas. This was done in consultation with
female students.99
UNICEF BCO efforts have also focused on scale up strategy for Alternative Learning Program (ALP)
for the most disadvantaged out-of-school adolescent, which was scaled up as Generation Unlimited in
February 2019.100101 Efforts also focused on Madrassas through the production of a Madrasa Resource
book on life skills for adolescents, which was to be rolled out in 2020 in selected Madrassas.102
Additionally, to address the micronutrient deficiency among adolescents, a major public health issue in
Bangladesh, evidence has been generated for policy makers on the cost effectiveness of adolescent
nutrition intervention for implementation and scale up.103
Progress has also been made in terms of evidence generation. To support GoB monitoring of the
adolescent clubs an on-line monitoring system through GIS Mapping and digital platform has been
developed. Generation Parliament initiative engaged 525,000 adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) in an
online platform to engage with parliamentarians.104 However, while there is a strong focus on upstream
work, implementation, monitoring and funding for policies, laws and strategies at the sub-national levels
remain weak.105 Other limitations also include programming overlooking key vulnerable communities

and a lack of focus on equity in programming under Outcome 3 of the existing CP. For example, the
remote location of tea gardens in Bangladesh means the labourers that cultivate them tend to be very
isolated. The abuse of children, child marriage and child labour are common in the tea garden
communities. These violations of children’s rights are associated with poverty, illiteracy and traditional
social norms, making girls particularly vulnerable.106 However, UNICEF BCO’s ECM Strategy Note and

UNICEF’s concerted efforts have led to the beginning of limited but desirable changes in its programme
areas. To elaborate further, data from MICS 2019 (Table 6) shows that there is a decline in child
marriages in the country. However, the process of this decline has been slow. Therefore, to fully
understand if the combination of strategies really worked, one needs to analyse the same in light of
following considerations:
Firstly, the five strategies were not implemented for the same duration everywhere and often
were short term interventions that did not necessarily cover entire duration of our evaluation
period. Both, the GPECM and ECM interventions in terms of its coverage were limited and lacked scale
even at the district level to ensure full targeting. Therefore, commenting on the overall impact of the
programme across geographies is fraught with challenges. Thus, there still remains the need for
evidence at scale to detail its effectiveness. This also finds resonance in GPECM’s annual report in
the year 2018 which notes that while there is adequate evidence to confirm what works at a small scale,
there is still limited knowledge about what will work to achieve results at greater scales. This was further
reinforced through field interactions where respondents reported differences in project implementation
time periods across the districts visited that had varying influences on programme impact. For instance,
while in Dhaka the implementation period was of 37 months, in Bhola and Nilphamari it was recorded
at 18 months and 24 months respectively.
Attempts at scaling faced challenges in terms of making trade-offs between reaching the largest
number of girls and reaching the most vulnerable and most marginalised girls. Scaling up life
skills through social schemes and education systems in Bangladesh may not have reached the most
vulnerable girls, while the use of media did reach large numbers. However, the same may be limited to
awareness-raising, compromising the quality of the intervention. Scaling up of the programme needs to
have continuity with the earlier phase which at times poses an additional challenge. For instance, field
interactions in Dhaka highlighted that within the programming area, migration is a regular phenomenon.
Therefore, in many instances after a period of time, many beneficiaries were not found to be present or
benefitting from interventions.
The operationalisation of a multisectoral approach to ensure convergence between strategies
is difficult with the predominant sectoral mindset. Interactions with UNICEF zonal offices revealed
that the adoption of the multisectoral approach for the first-time opened sections to seek ideas and

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
direct a convergent approach to strengthen BCO’s commitment towards elimination of child marriages.
However, the multisectoral method with a life-cycle approach to programming showed that each sector
continued to focus on the attainment of their related goals and agendas. The collaboration and
coordination among the sectors required to actually achieve integrated goals was limited. Therefore,
there still remains the need for a structured approach for goal setting and robust M&E to strengthen
sectoral collaboration and avoid duplicity. Thus, the usefulness of the strategies should not only be seen
its terms of its relevance but also how well it coordinated with sections to accomplish joint goals.
Overall review of the progress of the strategies highlights that BCO will need to continue its
concerted efforts at all levels (individual, community, institutional, state and policy) to
effectively combat child marriages. The evaluation recognises the adoption of the relevant holistic
approach to engage varied stakeholders especially at the community level across generations and
gender to drive social norm change. However, the same needs to be more gender transformative and
involvement of boys and men need a systematic approach. It was also reinforced through field
interactions that engagement with married girls and girls with disabilities needed a more enhanced
focus.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned factors in mind, combination of these strategies provided
the required momentum to consolidate efforts to address the complex challenge of child
marriage. Some remarkable results were achieved for Adolescents in Bangladesh preserving
millions of childhoods. UNICEF Bangladesh promoted adolescents’ empowerment and their
participation in the community as social change agents through the establishment of adolescent clubs
and the provision of tailored packages of services in all UNDAF districts. The services package included
life skills-based education (LSBE), civic engagement training, stipends for the most vulnerable
adolescents, and orientation and sensitisation of parents and communities to create the foundation for
a supportive environment. In 2016, these interventions received recognition and were adopted by the
Government of Bangladesh through MoWCA. In 2016, within, the first year of its implementation, 1,500
new adolescent clubs were established in seven additional districts, which are contributing to preventing
child marriage through life skills and livelihood options.107 Field interactions further commended the
formation of adolescent clubs as central spaces for adolescents to share information, gather knowledge
and skills and raise their voice against child marriage.
In 2017, adolescent girls were provided with access to remain in secondary education in three districts
with high rates of child marriage and in six sub-districts. An additional 24 districts and 50 sub-districts
received support through UNICEF’s regular education programme in the same year. The main
strategies include curriculum development for both in school and out-of-school adolescents, teacher
training and capacity building of relevant stakeholders. Likewise, in 2018 manuals for life skills-based
education, comprehensive sexuality education, menstrual hygiene management and prevention of
school-related gender-based violence in Bangladesh was integrated into government curricula.108
Even in 2019, UNICEF BCO’s ECM interventions made significant strides in undertaking social
mobilisation and community engagement, reaching out to over 320,000 community-members and local
leaders and leading to 93 unions declaring themselves child-marriage free. In addition, the trans-media
initiative “#Raisethebeat4ECM/Dhol Campaign” reached an estimated 186 million people across TV,
radio and social media, engaging close to 95 million through social media since its launch, and received
two new awards. The adolescent drama-series “Icchedana” also reached an estimated 50 million
viewers through all media, engaging approximately 10 million through social media.109 However, it is
key to note that the endline report of the same also highlighted that overall coverage and outreach of
the series was too low to estimate its effectiveness accurately.

Field interactions also highlighted the focus of ECM efforts to work with key community influencers such
as teachers and religious leaders, and local government officers such as the Union Parishad Chairman
and other members has empowered them to raise their voices against child marriage. Further,
engagement with local law enforcement officials and agencies was also commended. The evaluation
also recognises the positive effect of the ECM interventions in Zone 2, DNCC wherein UNICEF’s efforts
to regularise the functioning of CWBs and CBCPCs encouraged the Deputy Director of the district to
strengthen the same in wards outside of the UNICEF programme.
Further, recognising that the dropout rate in secondary schools remains a concern, UNICEF BCO
focussed on addressing the issue of quality of learning to improve dropouts of girls and boys from a
systems approach. Therefore, the overall effort during 2019 was on improving the quality of learning,
strengthening school-based planning, informal apprenticeship and alternative pathways for out-of-
school adolescents especially girls, in partnership with the GoB and private sector.110

3.2.2 M&E and reporting systems lack adequately clear guidelines for capturing the results
directly attributable to the ECM interventions versus others.
The entire gamut of UNICEF BCO’s ECM efforts do not report against a combined RBM to track the
progress of multi-sectoral indicators contributing towards the planned results in each of the five
strategies. Interactions with UNICEF’s sectoral teams revealed that typically a programme like ECM is
accompanied with a results and monitoring framework which is the designated responsibility of the
respective sector lead implementing the interventions. As a result, progress against activities and
indicators are reported through sectoral team Information Management Officers to PD Manager.
Additionally, programme level indicators are included in the sector’s annual work plan and therefore not
as reflective in the Result Assessment Module report. Furthermore, with the M&E and reporting
systems lacking clear guidelines for capturing the results directly attributable to the ECM interventions
versus others like the GPECM programme, it was noted that tracking of progress against planned
results was not without confusion and with chances of reporting overlap between the two.
The same is highlighted during the 2017 ECM Programme Review Meeting at Mymensingh and Field
Visit to Jamalpur. It was noted that some of the sectoral initiatives that were included in the 2014-2015
proposal did not critically prioritise sectoral interventions based on the extent to which the selected
initiatives could accelerate the reduction of child marriages. Moreover, in 2015 with the
conceptualisation of the ECM Strategy Note, UNICEF BCOs programme went through subsequent
changes in 2016. Resultantly, the changes in terms of reporting requirements and variance in
110 2019 EYR - End Year Summary Report - Outcome 3 20191214
Page | 47 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
implementation of activities between the two years also led to some anomalies in data collected and
reported.
3.2.3 In view of the above finding, BCOs ECM efforts and their planned results for its five
strategies needs to be seen collaboratively with Outcome on Adolescents as well as GPECM
reporting for an adequate understanding on impact.
UNICEF Bangladesh’s 2017-2020 Country Programme adopted a life-cycle approach to programming,
with a standalone Outcome on Adolescent Girls and Boys. Prioritised areas include ending child
marriage (ECM), adolescent health and nutrition, secondary education and adolescent participation.
While Outcome/Output Performance on Adolescent Girls and Boys is reported to be on track,
the evaluation notes that reporting was not always independent. Additionally, a clear
demarcation between ECM and GPECM interventions of BCO, whether programmatic or
financial reporting, was blurred.
Nevertheless, it must be recognised that some remarkable results were achieved for adolescents in the
country and major milestones were reached through UNICEF’s ECM programme. For instance, the
evaluation notes the launching of the National Plan of Action (NAP) to End Child Marriage in August
2018 with UNICEF support as a landmark. Furthermore, to address the issues adolescents and youth
(15-24 years) face in terms of skills and employment, a partnership approach between government, the
private sector and development organisations was adopted; Gen U111 was launched in Bangladesh in
February 2019. A National Steering Committee to oversee Gen U was also rolled out in this regard.
Moreover, a major milestone to address the challenges in accessing age and gender appropriate quality
health services was the approval of the multi-sectoral National Plan of Action for Adolescent Health
Strategy (2017-2030). Correspondingly, UNICEF has continued its focus on capacity building of
government and other stakeholders to deliver the package of quality services for adolescent boys and
girls. 112
With regards to the GPECM programme, interactions with stakeholders highlighted its strength in terms
of its design to foster change processes with outcomes that include top-down, bottom-up and individual
empowerment interventions. The programme is reported to be on track to achieve its outputs with
aggregate tracking showing signs that the GPECM is extending its reach and accelerating its
approach in 2018 under most outputs despite significant reductions in funding, largely due to
the strategic use of pool funding. Various country offices not only used the GPECM resources for
designing stand-alone country interventions but GPECM funds were used to integrate ECM
components in existing programmes that have shown promising impact and scale at the country level.
Therefore, the use of this ‘pool funding’ as this approach is known, has been noted by stakeholders as
a strategic and effective means to extend the outreach of GPECM despite limited funding.113
However, it is also crucial to mention that the programme also faced challenges in meeting certain
targets over the course of its implementation. For example, while the NAP narrative was finalised and
all consultations with partners were completed in 2015 and early 2016, the expectation was that the
final draft of the NAP would be reviewed and endorsed by the Ministry so that the costing exercise could
be initiated. However, the Ministry took a firm stand to not proceed with finalising the NAP until the Child
Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) was passed in Parliament. This led to extensive delays resulting in the
target for 2016 not being achieved. It is also crucial to note that while the monitoring of higher-level
indicators was undertaken, data availability and reliability across countries, especially for qualitative
measurements, remained an issue.114
111 To address the issues adolescents and youth (15-24 years) face in terms of skills and employment, Gen U was launched in
February 2019 as part of BCO ECM efforts

Furthermore, interactions with UNICEF’s zonal and sectoral teams highlighted that in the absence of a
robust mechanism to consolidate the results of the multi sectoral action for ECM, there are also
possibilities of certain activities and its achievements remaining unenumerated. This seems to be
particularly true when one notes the extent of efforts undertaken by the various sectoral teams to
mainstream thematic interventions to tackle child marriage. On the other hand, UNICEF Bangladesh
aligned its country programme with the UNICEF Gender Action Plan, 2018–2021, and continued to
integrate gender results in and across programme areas. Designating the outcome on adolescents and
ending child marriage a targeted priority (high-level result) significantly stepped-up efforts to target
adolescent girls. While, other priorities including girls’ secondary education and skills, adolescent girls’
health and nutrition, and gender-based violence in emergencies (GBViE) also retained its major focus.
Therefore, there remains a strong need for strengthening reporting of sectors that align to ECM and
also closely looking at the opportunities and merits of linking ECM with other broader programmes of
UNICEF—like GenU.
3.2.4 COVID-19 induced discontinuity in regular ECM programming and challenges faced in
accessing health care and social services threatens progress against child marriage and
restraining spill over effects of ECM interventions.
Fears that the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant restrictions and exacerbated vulnerabilities may cost
years off the country’s progress towards ECM were echoed across all stakeholder interactions. Growing
economic insecurity, discontinuity in education and interruptions in services along with the overall
prevalence of child marriage in the country is likely to intensify the risks of child marriage and jeopardise
the gains of UNICEF’s ECM interventions. While the evaluation notes the significant successes made
by BCO, it is crucial to also note that the impact of the ongoing pandemic is likely to adversely impact
the progress made, creating a gap in efforts being made and results being achieved. This is particularly
crucial to recognise as any gender-transformative change typically requires sustained engagement and
takes a long time, while, more than often the progress does not occur in a linear fashion.
Interactions with UNICEF’s Zonal offices also revealed that the hard-earned momentum
moulded by the ECM interventions is waning in its effect. For example, in 2018 some 50,000
adolescents were informed of the ECM helpline and 10,000 community members were educated on
what to do when child marriage is suspected; the helpline received reports of 870 suspected cases and
150 child marriages were stopped. 115 However, the pandemic-related travel restrictions and physical
distancing adversely effected a girl’s access to community support to protect her from child marriage.
The evaluation notes similar examples to highlight how the expected spill over effects of a multi
sectoral approach remained constrained. For instance, in the year 2016, 1,500 new adolescent clubs
were established in seven additional districts to contribute to preventing child marriage through life skills
and livelihood options. In the same year, 5,305 girls were successfully mainstreamed back to formal
primary schools.116 However, as schools remain closed, girls are more likely to drop out of education
and not return. Additionally, increased economic insecurity may also force families to marry their
daughters to ease financial burdens. Likewise, the ECM programme prioritised adolescent health
services with health sector programmes focussing on scaling up and allocation of funds for enabling
the facility for services (200 facilities/year). The Country Programme Document 2017-2020 also
designated outcomes specifically for adolescent development to address the rights of adolescent girls
and boys to quality services, and participation. However, COVID -19, as a humanitarian crisis with a
public health dimension is repressing the strides made by BCO’s ECM interventions by
exacerbating the challenges faced by vulnerable girls to access health care and social services.
The pandemic also delayed the implementation of certain ECM activities, in addition to regular
ECM programming efforts having to be rolled back, re-proposed and sectoral teams focusing
115 GPECM 18 Report

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
on minimising the impact of the outbreak. For instance, to encourage lesson learning amongst
programme and non-programme districts, the GPECM programme intended to conduct study tours/
exchange tours. The tours were supposed to be organised in close consultation with MoWCA, Ministry
of Education, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and with support from district officials to exchange
lessons and good practices from high performing GPECM districts. However, the same had to be
deferred.
Considering the 5 strategies, what have been the supporting and constraining factors? Were
there any unexpected results (positive or negative)?
With respect to unexpected results (positive or negative), the evaluation team is constrained in the ability
to comment on the same. This may be attributed to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and the limitations posed by the same. The resulting delay in commencement of the
evaluation limits the visibility on the immediate impact of ECM efforts, therefore restricting the ability to
comment on unexpected results. However, certain factors have been identified as
supporting/constraining factors to the ECM efforts. The same has been elaborated upon below.
3.2.5 Joint efforts for focused advocacy by UNICEF and UNFPA adequately supported
institutionalisation and collaboration to ending child marriage
The findings note that joint advocacy at the highest levels of national programming in Bangladesh
supported the institutionalisation of the key commitment to ECM within the government agenda.
Additionally, both agencies played a significant role by presenting a joint front as the national advocacy
group “One UN Voice” for the drafting of the CMRA 2017, the NAP and for the design of the National
Adolescent Health Strategy 2017.117 Further, UNICEF also supported the development of an action plan
for the Adolescent Development Strategy till 2030, and a costing plan for the same.118. Moreover,
UNICEF and UNFPA were able to effectively leverage partnerships with platforms such as GNB and
LCG WAGE to consolidate commitments to ending child marriage.
3.2.6 ECM interventions leveraged schools as an adequate effective entry point for interventions
to enhance outcomes on ECM and extended it beyond the schools by forming adolescent clubs.
However, there remains a need for a creation of an enabling environment for adolescent clubs
to flourish and place greater focus on income generation and livelihood opportunities for girls
Nested within an institutional set-up, schools provided the momentum necessary to sustain long-term
change for girls by providing them with the autonomy to make their own decisions.119 The programme
interventions in Bangladesh were able to leverage and utilise schools as effective entry points to
strengthen the approach to ending child marriage. For instance, in Bhola, programme interventions
incorporated the capacity building of teachers to take action as caregivers against child marriage.
Additionally, girls and boys were also trained to raise their voices for ECM.
ECM programming in Bangladesh placed critical focus on leveraging Adolescent Clubs to empower
adolescents and equip them with the necessary skill sets to successfully raise their voices for ending
child marriage. Community level adolescent platforms were established to encourage dialogue to
support awareness generation and mobilisation for a change in gender norms and structures.
Additionally, it also fostered crucial linkages with other government and non-government platforms for
greater advocacy for child rights and protection. It is found that adolescent clubs were also able to create
an awareness on action to take in the event of child marriage, encouraging accountability of law

enforcement officials to respond promptly and decisively. For example, the highest number of calls to
the 1098 helpline to report child marriages were recorded in Bhola from members of adolescent club.
In 2018, support to 1,873 adolescent clubs was provided in order to focus on peer-learning around
livelihood skills and preventing gender-based violence. It was reported that 108,780 adolescents
including 87,024 girls and 21,756 boys successfully finished 38 life skills sessions in adolescent clubs
in the same year. Specifically, in Bhola district, 28,759 girls in adolescent clubs positively impacted from
sessions on menstrual hygiene management and effects of child marriage.120
However, within the confines of a traditional and conservative society such as Bangladesh, the creation
of an enabling environment is crucial to prevent a potential backlash against and branding of adolescent
girls who participate in programme interventions as rebels and troublemakers.121 During field
interactions, adolescent girls reported that the formation of Adolescent Clubs and girls who participate
in them were not always responded to positively by community members, further heightening their
vulnerability. Additionally, discrepancies in the continued functioning of Adolescent Clubs across the
visited districts were also noted during field interactions. For instance, while in Dhaka Adolescent Clubs
are still operational through the government or other NGO partners, the same was not found in Jamalpur.
Addressing this heightened sense of risk is central to effective programming to delay the age of
marriage. Field interactions in Nilphamari highlighted that while adolescent clubs had been formed, no
designated place had been identified to run them. Additionally, balancing political pressures was also
recorded as a challenge. Interactions with UNICEF’s zonal offices in Mymensingh division and Gazipur
City Corporation highlighted the challenges faced in maintaining attendance at virtual sessions
organised for adolescent clubs. Relatedly, changes in enrolment rates is also believed to impede the
outreach of clubs.122 Furthermore, the findings also highlight the difficulties in engaging with and
retaining the most marginalised children such as those with disability and/or are already married.123.
Further, the evaluation notes certain challenges in provision of Adolescent-friendly health services124
such as limited logistical capacity; inability to account for privacy; insufficient number of trained service
providers; limited BCC material and inadequate supply of medicines.
Interactions also highlighted the need to focus on the demand and supply of gender-responsive services.
System strengthening both at national and sub-national levels remains critical to ensure uptake and
delivery of gender-responsive services. Therefore, the evaluation findings suggest systematic
interventions and efficient inter-sectoral collaboration between schools, adolescent clubs and service
providers in Bangladesh for sufficient generation of demand and supply of services.125
A stronger focus also needs to be placed on the promotion of income generation and livelihood
opportunities for girls. The information recorded through field interactions highlights that the predominant
focus of the interventions was on Adolescent empowerment through Adolescent Clubs, and community
mobilisation. However, other aspects such as the provision of stipends did not find a similar focus and
outreach. Across the visited upazillas, it was reported that there were challenges to identifying and
selecting beneficiaries to provide livelihood support and financial incentives as the budget allocated was
not sufficient.
3.2.7 Successful piloting under GPECM adequately enabled continual learning and opportunities
for improvement in future programming. Further, implementation of ECM interventions through

the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) enabled greater ownership amongst municipal and
ward officials
The evaluation finds that Phase I of the GPECM placed a strong focus on piloting interventions in the
targeted districts of Rangpur, Mymensingh, Barisal and Khulna. Acting as a catalytic seed fund, the
following interventions were successfully modelled in the four districts:
• Establishing and capacitating Adolescent Clubs
• Imparting Life-skills based education training module
• Strong focus and promotion of social and behaviour change through the national multimedia
Dhol Campaign (#RaiseTheBeat4ECM)
• Support to the development of the National Menstrual Health Management Plan that is to be
costed
• Setting up of Adolescent Friendly Health Centres
• Alternative Learning Pathway Project
As evidenced in various sections of this report, the above-mentioned interventions have shown high
potential for long term positive impact and change. Additionally, stakeholder interactions have
highlighted that the learnings through the piloting of interventions is expected to reinforce the programme
design and implementation for Phase II of the GPECM.126
The evaluation also finds that the implementation model in DNCC through the city corporation enabled
strong involvement of municipal and ward officials, and greater incorporation of the agenda to end child
marriage in their routine functioning. This involvement also fostered enhanced capacity building and
training of key stakeholders such as members of Child Welfare Committees and Community Based
Child Protection Committees contributing to the creation of a supportive environment to combat child
marriages. This was further reinforced through interactions on field with DNCC representation. Further,
as a result of this partnership, monitoring of programme implementation was made possible at different
levels. While the Chief Executive Officer was designated at the central level to oversee monitoring
efforts, programming efforts were also monitored by the Regional Zonal Officer, Project Focal Point and
the Project Planning and Monitoring Officer.
3.2.8 Government ownership and leadership towards balancing political commitments and
addressing policy anomalies remains adequately limited
Ending child marriage, as already noted, has been recorded as a key government priority in Bangladesh.
However, it is important to recognise that national laws often conflict with customary religious laws and
practices, making it difficult to enforce or implement the national laws in Bangladesh.127 Additionally,
despite continuous and rigorous advocacy with the government on the CMRA 2017, inclusion of the
Special Provision that allows for child marriage under the age of 18 years under special circumstances
is a major setback to the overall agenda to ECM. Therefore, while the political commitment to ending
child marriage is clearly visible, the inclusion of the Special Provision is directly contradictory to it.
Relatedly, the GoB passed the Children’s Act in 2013 aligned to the CRC (ratified by Bangladesh in
1990) to ensure effective protection of children through a specific child-oriented law. Significantly this
Act identifies any person below the age of 18 as a child.128 However, this Act does not specifically
address exposure to violence and physical and humiliating punishment.129 Additionally, formulation of
rules for implementation of the Act had still not been completed.130 Further, there has been no costing

activity for implementation either. The Act has also been criticised for the lack of complete
implementation with respect to child friendly police desks, adequate number of probation officers and
child welfare boards.131
As such, in the absence of holistic government accountability, the agenda to child protection and
specifically ending child marriage faces legal impediments and cannot reach its maximum potential.
Further, national level efforts were severely impacted by significant delays in receiving approval from
relevant government authorities. Similar delays were also recorded at the district level in 2017 resulting
in the inability to implement planned UNFPA interventions.132
3.2.9 Limited adequate enforcement and implementation of NAP and CMRA 2017 and limitations
of MoWCA to spearhead and coordinate a multisectoral approach to ending child marriage
Evaluation findings highlight that translation of legal instruments and operationalisation of national action
plans at sub-national level to strongly drive the ECM agenda on the ground has been inadequate. For
example, the CMRA 2017 lays down clear provisions for the establishment of committees for child
protection at all levels. However, CBCPCs have either not been established or adequately
operationalised across the country. Significantly, field interactions with upazilla level stakeholders
highlighted the lack of awareness among concerned authorities around the legal age of marriage as per
the current Child Marriage Restraint Act 2017. Sustained efforts will be required to translate the
objectives of the NAP and CMRA at sub-national level through hand holding support and focused
capacity building initiatives for duty bearers.
Further, the evaluation finds that MoWCA, though designated as the lead ministry on the government of
Bangladesh’s agenda to ending child marriage, is limited in many ways to drive a multisectoral approach
to ECM. ECM interventions in Bangladesh have recorded several challenges with respect to MoWCA’s
limited capacity, specifically in the absence of an on-ground cadre. For instance, no representation at
the upazilla and union level resulted in restricted engagement in actual implementation, technical
support and monitoring of adolescent programmes at the community and household level.133 Moreover,
MoWCA is represented by a Project Director, further limiting its ability to coordinate a multisectoral
programme. The aforementioned factors are also found to restrict MoWCA’s ability to effectively
leverage available resources and mobilise prompt action from other key ministries. Therefore, it is
unsurprising to note that several challenges were faced by MoWCA in convergence and coordination
with other line ministries and the same was consistently recorded during the implementation of the
GPECM.134
“Marriage Registrars are one of the key problems for occurring child marriage. Many of them
help the parents/guardians to get their children married before reaching at the legal age. They
often accept fake documents like birth certificate to justify child marriage”.

Strategy 1: Empowerment of Adolescents
Are there signs that adolescent girls who have been part of the programme have been
empowered and have increased skills? Have the interventions built the agency of girls as
influencers and decision-makers, especially on marriage decisions? If so, has this led to a
decrease in child marriage? Has this led to an overall increase of adolescent wellbeing?
A number of observations were noted by the research team which highlights that the programme
has helped in the empowerment of adolescent girls and overall wellbeing.
• The Bangladesh 2017-2020 country programme facilitated MoWCA to set up Adolescent Clubs
and implement the Life-Skills Based Training module across the country. The focus of these
training sessions was empowerment training, support to MHM and creating awareness on SRH.
In certain conservative areas like Bhola, the programme also established mixed safe spaces for
girls and boys for shared interaction, while simultaneously providing life skills training. Adolescent
girls interviewed in Bhola highlighted that despite the conservative nature of the district, ECM
programme interventions had provided them with the confidence and ability to exert control over
their lives.
• Study findings135 suggest that among participants of Adolescent Clubs and LSBE sessions there
was a heightened sense of agency and awareness on their rights and harmful gender norms and
practices. Participants also reported that they have taken prompt action at the community level
against child marriage, either individually or with the Adolescent Club.136 This was reinforced
through field interactions. For instance, in Bhola, a peer leader reported that on multiple occasions
complaints have been registered with the police and the Upazilla Nirbahi Officer and prompt action
had been facilitated.
• Adolescent girls have also been supported through an increased focus on their secondary
education through capacity building of the secondary education system to carry out skill-based
education. Additionally, the programme also contributed to the enhancement of sub-national
systems to address issues of retention and regular attendance to increase the completion of
schooling. Further, an alternative learning programme was also imparted to out-of-school
adolescents.
• In 2018, 78.3 per cent and 62 per cent of adolescent club members under the age of 15 years and
17 years respectively were found to be unmarried, recorded as higher than the national average.137
• Further, through the launch of the Generation Parliament initiative, the Bangladesh Country
Programme (2017-2020) engaged with 525,000 adolescents (aged 13-17 years) to enable

• Technical support was also provided to set up Adolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS) at
service delivery points. Additionally, the government was assisted to develop Accreditation
Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on AHFS. Training in AHFS was also
carried out for 200 service providers and field workers in programme districts, with a focus on
ending child marriage, and 67 AHFS were made operational in the districts on Nilphamari and
Bhola.139
• Across programme areas, 1,15,609 adolescents (75,738 female adolescents and 39,871 male
adolescents) were able to benefit from AHFS provided.
135 A documentation of the adolescent programme was carried out with technical support from Manheim University and UNICEF
ROSA.

“Adolescent clubs genuinely made us empowered. We don’t feel like we are girls and
should keep us down. We know how to protect us from gender-based abuse and
exploitations. We are even now playing football in the playground with boys.”

Is there evidence of the spill-over effects from adolescents who have been part of the
programme to other adolescents in the community who have not been part of the interventions?
Field interactions did record spill-over effects with respect to adolescents who had not participated in
the interventions in programme areas. However, there is limited data available to be able to adequately
comment on this aspect. Given the gap between the end of the programme and commencement of the
evaluation, the evaluation team finds limited institutional memory amongst available stakeholders.
Additionally, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has halted and caused significant delays to
programme activities. As such, it is difficult to gauge whether the impact of interventions benefitted key
stakeholders outside of programme areas.
Have the interventions reached the most vulnerable? (out of school adolescents, those from low
quintiles, adolescents with disabilities, already married girls
Significantly, interactions on-field found that the majority of adolescents reached through interventions
belonged to families of the lowest quintiles. However, the focus on adolescents with disabilities and girls
who are already married remained limited. The wide range of vulnerable adolescents reached through
outreach interventions are mentioned below:
• Transgender adolescents in Mymensingh City Corporation were reached out to through virtual
models of the APC project. DESH expanded the outreach of the project through the formation of
virtual clubs140 to equip target adolescents with the skills to transform their own lives, and
community perceptions on non-normative gender identity groups.
• Approximately 10,372 out-of-school girls across the 8-14 year age group in Satkhira and Dhaka
urban slums were also supported with the second chance education programme. Further, 5,305
girls were mainstreamed within the primary education system.141
• Additionally, an estimated 500 girls from child marriage prone areas of Khulna City Corporation,
Khulna Division and the upazilla of Dacope were provided with training in basic literacy and
numeracy, and the pilot programme on life skills education.142

• The ECM programming in Bangladesh adopted a mentorship approach in community safe
spaces or adolescent clubs143 in order to reach out to the most vulnerable girls (those who are
out-of-school, extremely poor, pregnant, young mothers, married or at-risk of marriage, HIV
positive, orphans, victims of violence, or suffering from obstetric fistula).
• Further, LSBE training sessions were equipped with provisions to ensure flexible hours and home
visits by peer leaders to mobilise family members to enable access for married and disabled
girls.144
Strategy 2: Community Engagement and Behaviour Change
Have prevailing mindsets, beliefs, and attitude towards child marriage and gender norms
changed in the communities and among the key community level influencers described in the
strategy?
It is key to note here that community-based interventions were multi-faceted in nature. In some
programme areas while the focus of Child Protection activities was focused on adolescent clubs, C4D
activities focused on community engagement through adoption of the SEM approach. In other
programme areas there were C4D initiatives with adolescents who were not members of the clubs as
well as community engagement activities.145
Through adolescent clubs, the programme demonstrated good potential to contribute to a change in
existing systems of belief and behaviours that encourage child marriage.146 More than 10,000
community people comprising parents, lawyer, teacher representatives, woman ward / union members,
representatives from Child-Led Organizations (CLOs) were also trained on referral mechanisms for any
form of violence including child marriage.147
Research carried out on the impact of the edutainment series ‘Icchedana’ focused on assessing the
extent of visible change in respondents understanding and traditional beliefs around child marriage.
Data shows that 54 per cent of the respondents at the endline reportedly displayed accurate knowledge
on the legal age of marriage for both boys and girls, an increase from 49 per cent at the baseline.148.
With respect to community perceptions around the right age of marriage for girls and boys, 90 per cent
respondents reported it to be over the legal age.149 Findings of the study on respondents understanding
of the impact of social norms on the practice of child marriage, suggest that a higher percentage of
respondents believed that child marriage had reduced at the endline: 150
• Data from the endline survey on the Icchedana series shows that 93 per cent respondents
believed that less than half the number of girls in their community were married before the legal
age, whereas 96 per cent reported that less than half the number of boys were married. At the
baseline, this stood at 86 and 94 per cent respectively.
• A drop of 3 per cent was recorded at the endline from 88 per cent at the baseline in respondents’
intent to prevent child marriage within their own families.
• Contrastingly, the average across exposure groups of those who were inclined to prevent child
marriages within their communities was recorded at 83 per cent at both the baseline and
endline.151
• With respect to respondents’ inclination to report on incidences of child marriage, the study
recorded an increase from 7 per cent at the baseline to 10 per cent at the endline.152

• Survey results on child marriage during COVID-19, however, show that 31 per cent
respondents153 believe that child marriages were carried out for reasons of greater security and
safety for girls.154
Perception around the incidence of child marriage was not found to be linked to respondents’ level of
education or economic capital but was found to be varied across study districts.155. Significantly, at the
endline a higher number of respondents’ reported disapproval of child marriage, including amongst their
families and communities. Furthermore, interactions with key community stakeholders highlighted the
growing recognition of the importance of education for girls to enable them to be empowered and
consequently delay their age of marriage.
How effective has work on multiple platforms and different levels (national, district, upazilla)
been on achieving social mobilisation and community engagement? Have families, community
members and key community level influencers taken concrete action to protect adolescents
from child marriage and to stop and prevent child marriage? Have actions varied across these
key stakeholders? Has saying no to child marriage become the common norm in the programme
communities?
The research team found some evidence to state whether community level influencers have taken
concrete actions to stop and prevent child marriage. A positive response to the adolescent clubs and
the AFHS does indicate that the interventions are finding resonance among adolescents and they do
have a need to discuss their issues. BCO’s ECM programming focused on catering to demand
generation for AFHS, crucial to ensuring that necessary action was taken by community members and
influencers to create an environment of safe and regular access and uptake by adolescents. Information
dissemination sessions on available AHFS were conducted during assemblies in school. This resulted
in the increased uptake of services by adolescents in school.156
Fostering gender equitable beliefs and attitudes is key to the overall agenda of the GPECM. Accounted
for as Outcome 2 of the Global Results Framework, programme interventions have focused on
engaging with community members, local leaders and key influencers through dialogues that promote
gender equality, including a delay in and prevention of child marriage157. In 2018, the country recorded
a success rate of 44.7 per cent against a targeted 45 per cent for Outcome 2 of the GPECM GRF.158.
Data for the GPECM shows that in 2018, 870 cases of child marriages were reported on the child
helpline, while a 150 were prevented by CBCPCs in ECM districts 159. Field findings highlight that in
many instances mothers in the community reported that they were able to challenge traditional
patriarchal norms and encourage their daughters to complete their education, thereby delaying their
age of marriage. With respect to preventing marriages during the on-going COVID 19 pandemic, survey
results show that only 23 per cent were stopped by family and community members.160
153 Respondents were segregated by age, gender and geographical area

However, survey results on child marriage during the COVID-19 pandemic show that 54 per cent of the
respondents161 reported that no attempt was made to stop child marriage, whereas a minimal 8 per cent
recorded a success in preventing marriages.162 Additionally, 41 per cent also reported that child
marriages had taken place since March 2020. 163. This is indicative of a setback to the overall progress
made under the ECM programme.
The Government of Bangladesh was also supported by UNICEF Bangladesh Data and Analytics team
on data generation activities through the implementation of the MICS Survey in 2019. Significantly,
stakeholder interactions highlighted that data from MICS 2013 and MICS 2019 shows that prevalence
of child marriage in the country has not seen a notable decrease, reducing by only two to three per
cent.164
Strategy 3: Institutional Strengthening, Advocacy and Law Enforcement
How effective has UNICEF and UNFPA been in advocation for a normative and legislative
framework that protects adolescent girls from child marriage? Were there any missed
opportunities in the advocacy strategy that needs to be addressed? Has the process been
timely? Has the legislative and normative framework trickled down into specific policies and
programmes?
UNICEF and UNFPA together have been quite successful in bringing about new policies and plans that
would help in addressing the issue of early child marriage. Partnerships at the highest levels will ensure
that this remains a significant agenda of the Government.
Strategic leveraging of the LCG WAGE platform enabled enhanced advocacy and promotion of ECM
with government ministries and other development partners. The forum allowed for government
accountability on ECM, specifically from MoWCA, and encourage cross sectoral collaboration and
convergence.165. The advocacy agenda of UNFPA-UNICEF with the Government of Bangladesh drew
strength from its strategy of ‘One UN Voice’.166. A National Plan of Action to End Child Marriage was
drawn up and finalised with technical and financial support from UNFPA and UNICEF. The programme
advocated for the development of an associated Monitoring and Evaluation Framework.167. Moreover,

the programme also supported the institution of a costed National Adolescent Health Strategy.168
Further, issues such as cybercrime and mental health were also incorporated within National Guidelines
and SOP for Adolescent Friendly Health Services.169 Advocacy was also undertaken with the
government to finalise the Child Marriage Restraint Act (CMRA) 2017 with the exclusion of the Special
Provision.
Under the Bangladesh Country Programme, efforts led to the development of the first National
Curriculum Framework from K to secondary school and the adoption of an adolescent skills
framework.170 Additionally, rigorous advocacy on the importance of menstrual hygiene to remove
barriers for adolescent girls in secondary girls led to the establishment of a multi-sectoral National
Strategy on Menstrual Health Management.171 Further, the development of a National Adolescent
Strategy was also undertaken as a result of advocacy through the BCO Country Programme.172.
Significantly, a formal partnership was also launched between UNICEF and the Governance and
Innovations Unit of the PMO to enhance local government capacity to take preventive action against
child marriage and encourage social mobilisation at the community level. Additionally, technical support
was also provided for the development of the District Action Plan and building the capacity of authorities
on child rights.173
What role has evidence played in UNICEF advocacy strategy? Are there any evidence gaps that
could strengthen UNICEFs capacity to strengthen institutions and legal and normative
frameworks around child marriage? Does the existing evidence provide enough information on
the different needs of adolescents depending on their various contexts? (wealth quintile,
location, family context, level of ability, schooling situation etc.)
GPECM has used baseline and midline surveys in the programme districts to inform both policy and
programming interventions. Moreover, BCO country programme additionally contributed towards the
overall evidence generation focus by producing a study titled ‘Context of Child Marriage and its
Implications in Bangladesh. Additionally, in collaboration with the Implementation Monitoring and
Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Planning and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the GPECM
established a module on normative beliefs and attitudes that act as drivers of child marriage for
implementation in 64 districts. Further, an in-depth study, ‘Context of Child Marriage and its Implications
in Bangladesh’, on the causes and consequences of child marriage, and key recommendations to end
it was also published.174.
Consistent advocacy with the GoB carried out by UNICEF, UNFPA and other development partners
also led to the establishment of the CMRA 2017, an enhanced version of the 1929 Act. However, there
is scope for greater advocacy around the inclusion of the Special Provision that allows for marriage
below the age of 18 years under special circumstances. While the evaluation notes that the increased
robustness of the Act can be recorded as an improvement175, continued and stronger evidence
generation on what works to prevent marriage176 and advocacy is needed to provide a holistic and truly
protective legal framework for at-risk adolescent girls.
While the programme has generated rich evidence and lessons to be learnt, proper documentation is
extremely crucial to strengthen knowledge management and scale-up. Additionally, standardisation of

templates to capture necessary information is critical to accurately record the peculiarities and
particularities of child marriage in varied contexts in the country.
Strategy 4: Enhancing the accessibility and quality of formal schooling for girls
How effective has UNICEF been in enhancing accessibility and quality of formal schooling and
alternative learning pathways for adolescent girls? Has a focus on girls had a negative impact
on boys? Have adolescent girls who have benefitted from this strategy been more able to access
the job market and to make decisions about their lives, including marriage? What external
factors have influenced the effectiveness of this strategy?
Education being a core area of UNICEF, it has taken a number of pilots in addition to extending support
to improve quality of education in formal schools. One relevant intervention has been provision of
conditional cash transfers to encourage girls to continue with their formal education. The longer they
remain in school, there are more chances of delay in marriage.
Schools were also leveraged to act as monitoring mechanisms to ensure that children being provided
with incentives are remaining in school. The list of identified children was made available to the Upazilla
Child Welfare Board and Union Parishads. For the duration of the programme, 3500 CTCs of 36,000
Bangladesh Taka each were provided to children and their families in the division, placed in the care of
the family so that it can be appropriately invested for the child. The programme adopted a rigorous and
systematic case management process to identify vulnerable children, supported by the Child Welfare
Board and a member of the Community Based Child Protection Committee.177
Interventions in Sylhet also incorporated a component of life skills training for income generation
through the grant of stipends to an estimated 1500 adolescent girls and boys. The focus target group
for this intervention were girls at risk of child marriage. It engaged extensively with Adolescent Club
members, peer leaders and CBCPC members to effectively target and identify vulnerable girls. Though
a limited amount was allocated for the stipend, the main purpose was to provide adolescents with an
avenue of income generation to delay child marriage. Enrolling in and attending the yearly skills training
sessions offered by MoWCA was made mandatory to receive the stipend amount.178
While the evidence suggests that cash-based interventions are somewhat effective for ending child
marriage, research also highlights the importance of a multiple pronged approaches to programming.
For example, results from the Bangladeshi Association for Life Skills, Income, and Knowledge for
Adolescents (BALIKA) show that programmes to educate girls, build their skills for modern livelihoods
and engage their communities can reduce the likelihood of child marriage by one third and produce
better health, educational and social outcomes for them.
Strategy 5: Provision of livelihood support and financial incentives
How effective has UNICEF been in supporting the government to provide financial support to
families and adolescent girls at risk of child marriage so that they remain in school and
unmarried? Has the government expanded its financial support and social protection schemes
as a response of UNICEFs advocacy and technical support? Has UNICEF been effective in
changing the perception of families around the value of the girl child and the relevance of
education for adolescent girls?
Alternative Learning programme (ALP) for the most marginalised out of school adolescents through
informal apprenticeship was positioned as a key strategy of the programme.179 It was developed in
recognition of the fact that out-of-school adolescents are among the most vulnerable to abuse and

violence. In the absence of alternative learning opportunities, they are likely to enter the unskilled labour
workforce, putting them at-risk to work in hazardous conditions with minimal pay, and to be forced into
child marriage. The programme was planned in coordination with ILO and BRAC for out-of-school
adolescents and provide them with opportunities to employment and further education.
A key strength of this intervention was its linkage with the National Technical and Vocational
Qualification Framework (NTVQF). Employment training modules were standardised and linked with
the national qualification framework. As such, through the Recognition for Prior Learning (RPL)
mechanism, learners received certification that would enable them access to further education. Further,
cash incentives were also provided to learners to encourage retention and completion. Learners were
also provided with on-the-job training in the form of a supervised informal apprenticeship after receiving
theoretical competency training and completing an assessment. Additionally, social mobilisation
techniques were leveraged to engage with the community to orient and inform them as well as source
feedback from them.
Key results180
• An estimated 28000 out-of-school adolescents were provided with access to learning, relevant
skills and livelihood opportunities
• More than 50 per cent of participation was from the most disadvantaged and vulnerable
adolescent girls, while at least 10 per cent of learners were children with disabilities
• 95 per cent of learners were able to secure employment one month after completing the course.
Significantly, a BRAC tracer study highlighted that 77 per cent were continuing with their
secured employment after a period of two and a half years
• Delaying early marriage for young adolescents has been recorded as a key achievement of this
intervention. Study findings show a decrease in early marriage by 62 per cent
• Supported and contributed to the transformation of structures that encourage gender-biased
employment
• Increased employment and monthly income for out-of-school adolescents compared to non-
participants in the intervention by about six times. Savings of participants showed an increase
by an estimated 7.5 times and per day per capita food expenditure increased by about 9 per
cent. Non-food expenditure also increased by about 5 per cent
• Gender disaggregated analysis showed that the impact was greater for female participants than
for males. A cost benefit analysis was also done assuming that benefits will last for 10-15 years.
BCR ranges between 2.75 to 4.42 which is significant
The programme had its set of challenges181
• Limited capacity and facilities of the system to conduct assessments for certification
• Lack of interest of middle or large entrepreneurs to engage with on-the-job training for learners
• Inadequate standardisation of trades
• Increased risk of child labour for learners in popular trades involving children
• Absence of a robust policy and legal framework for apprenticeship for the informal sector.
• Limited acceptance in the community of girls and women participating in traditionally
unconventional job roles
Some other sectoral interventions helped in enhancing access to schooling. For instance, Water,
Sanitation and Hygiene sectoral interventions included capacity building and training of teachers, SMC
members, adolescent girls and district and upazilla level authorities. It had a focus on bringing forth
long-term change in the lives of girls.182 Additionally, interventions also facilitated the installation of

Water Sanitation and Hygiene blocks, handwashing stations supported by the GoB, separate latrines
for girls and boys with MHM facilities for girls at Adolescent Clubs and secondary schools/madrassas,
resulting in preventing girls from being absent from their schools. Further, facilities were constructed in
a manner to be disabled friendly and inclusive.183
Alignment to the Theory of Change
As previously elaborated upon, ECM efforts in Bangladesh are guided by the GPECM ToC and the
National level ToC. Both ToC’s have been found to be aligned to the country context and deliver in line
with the needs of the country, albeit with certain limitations. For instance, a National Plan of Action to
End Child Marriage was drawn up and finalised with technical and financial support from UNFPA and
UNICEF. The programme also advocated for the development of an associated Monitoring and
Evaluation Framework.184 Such efforts are likely to contribute to the creation on a robust policy and
legal environment for effective implementation of the law. However, the evaluation also finds that limited
awareness of the NAP at the sub-district levels acts as key deterrent to implementation on ground.
With respect to fostering positive attitudes and behaviours for transformation in social norms and
practices, interventions with a focus on increased awareness and capacity of community gatekeepers
and adolescents to prevent child marriage has recorded significant successes. Across districts visited
by the evaluation team, it was found that majority of adolescents reported an increased sense of
confidence in demanding their rights driven by the training they had received through Adolescent Clubs.
Similarly, the increasing role of mothers in preventing child marriage was highlighted in certain areas.
However, the evaluation team was not able to analyse individual attitudinal behavioural trends in the
absence of Focussed Group Discussions (FGDs).185
Incorporation of boys within adolescent clubs has also been highlighted as a key strength of the
intervention, contributing to creating a safe environment for girls. For instance, adolescent girls
interacted with in Bhola highlighted that as a result of this incorporation, incidence of sexual abuse and
harassment had reduced thereby contributing to an increased sense of safety. With respect to the
outcome on improved civil registration systems, however, the evaluation team was not able to collect
any conclusive data as concerned stakeholders were not available due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic. Further, interactions also highlighted the focus on vulnerable constituencies of girls, but
simultaneously highlighted the need for a stronger focus on adolescent girls already married and
adolescents with disabilities.

Has the programme been gender transformative and achieved gender-transformative results?
While the GPECM programme and BCO’s Outcome 3 recognise the importance and significance of
ensuring interventions are fitted with a gender transformative lens (Figure 5).186, transformation of such
nature requires time and consistent focus to be institutionalised to the extent where external influences
are not required to facilitate it. The need to strengthen the programme with a gender transformative
model and shift from a gender sensitive framework has also been recorded as key for Phase II of the
Global programme.187
3.2.11 ECM interventions and strategies have been fitted with
a gender lens and incorporate good and strong elements of a
gender transformative approach.
The strategies and interventions rolled out as part of the ECM
programming in Bangladesh have been designed with the clear
purpose of identifying and addressing root causes of gender
inequality that encourage and allow for the practice of child
marriage. By adopting cross-sectoral interventions, ECM efforts
undertaken by BCO aimed to address elemental causes of gender
inequalities and modify gender roles. Correspondingly, the
interventions adopt a human rights-based and gender
transformative approach to ensuring that adolescent girls and their
families and communities’ benefit from the programme, and
Figure 5: Gender transformative eventually take on an active role as an agent of change.188
approach
To elucidate, such an approach was well adopted in the LSBE
Training module that UNICEF carried out through Adolescent Clubs. The underlying theme of the
module was to build the capacity and empower adolescents to act as agents of change. Additionally,
the module was designed to strengthen current knowledge systems and to prevent negative and
discriminatory attitudes and behaviour.189 Carried out through a peer education model, the objective of
the LSBE Training package was to amplify the confidence, self-worth, independence and empathy of
participants.
Though initially catering only to girls, over the course of the programme, several clubs had incorporated
boys, at 30 per cent of total membership in many areas. As a result of this, many girls reported a
reduction in sexual harassment and violence.190 While such an approach has shown promising results
and high potential, scope for enhancement is visible with respect to linkages with service delivery and
livelihood options. Creating alternative opportunities to marriage and domestic work, such as access to
work, savings or loan activities provides girls with strategic control over their life choices, including
marriage and sexual and reproductive health.191 Providing adolescent girls and their families with
appropriate livelihood opportunities has been recognised as a key strategy to ending Child Marriage.192

The evaluation finds that BCO C4D interventions recognised the fact that communication is
critical to changing social norms, placing consistent emphasis on messaging and interventions
that promoted long-term and sustained change.
C4D strategies have recognised that child marriage is not necessarily a result of only individual
behavioural patterns, rather there is a strong linkage with community behavioural trends and traditions
that have been cemented as social norms 193. A key strategy highlighted by the GPECM ToC and BCO
ECM strategy note is placing a strong focus on the community within communication interventions to
bring about gender transformative social behaviour change. The impact of the same has been quantified
as Outcome 2 of the GPECM: Households demonstrate Households demonstrate positive attitudes and
behaviours regarding gender equality and equity.
Interventions utilised methods that included media campaigns through radio, TV and drama as well as
innovative social media platforms and toolkits to reach more community members with social behaviour
change messaging. The activities aimed to support community-focused dialogues, including creating
an understanding on the risks of child marriage.194 Additionally, a review of the data generated by the
programme in Bangladesh on the Number of individuals in programme areas who regularly participate
in dialogues promoting gender-equitable norms, including delay in child marriage (recorded as Output
Indicator 2.1 of the GPECM programme Outcome 2) shows that targets set for Phase I have been
consistently met. In 2019, 1,560,412 individuals were found to be participating, while the target had

activities to identify and address key issues, including child marriage and adolescent health and well-
being. These discussions were held as part of the Friday Khutba, primarily attended by male members
of the community.196 Additionally, the National Multimedia Campaign197 launched in July 2017, also
known as the ‘Raise the Beat’ or ‘Dhol’ campaign mobilised over 320,000 community members and
local leaders, resulting in 93 unions (local councils) declaring themselves as ‘child marriage-free’. Since
its launch, the #RaiseTheBeat4ECM campaign has been viewed an estimated 186 million times across
television, radio and social media, reaching out to almost 95 million viewers on social media, and has
also received two international awards in 2019.198
Further, Icchedana, an entertainment educational drama series was developed and broadcasted on
national platforms to engage maximum viewership.199 The series, adopting an entertainment approach,
highlighted critical social issues like child marriage, dowry, adolescent nutrition, health, and wellbeing.
Data on the impact of the Icchedana programme showed an enhancement in respondents’ knowledge
on the legal age of marriage, while an understanding on the legal consequences of child marriage was
high both at the baseline and endline.
As such, the evaluation notes that interventions focusing on community engagement through
interpersonal communication and recurrent dialogue is a human and financial resource
intensive process. Therefore, sufficient financial investment and capacity building of those

199 An Endline Evaluation by BRAC University found that the overall impact of the Icchedana series was difficult to estimate due
to limited overall viewership. This has been attributed to an unforeseen cultural preference amongst adolescents for Indian
soaps and shows. It was therefore recommended that to increase viewership, the series needed linkages with social media
platforms popular amongst Bangladeshi adolescents, integrate with other national-level programming to enhance the scope of
outreach and focus on capacity building of media professionals to embed socially sensitive messages in their mainstream work
to allow for cost effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions

engaged at the community level will remain critical to bringing about transformation of
structural systems of inequality and discrimination.
3.2.12 ECM interventions in Bangladesh engaged with key stakeholders at all levels. However,
with respect to bringing about gender transformation, wider and more focused engagement is
needed with different stakeholders for a longer period for good results.
To elaborate further, it is important to closely look at some of the interventions by BCO to
understand its gender transformative elements and areas that require strengthening.
SBCC strategies focusing on girls and at the community level in Bangladesh have been supported by
a focus on enhancing existing systems of education, health and
child protection. Programming efforts fostered close linkages
between Adolescent Clubs, schools and communities with
adolescent-friendly health services (see figure 6).200
To ensure that services were utilised, and adolescents were
encouraged to access them, courtyard sessions were conducted
with parents and community gatekeepers. Additionally, advocacy
sessions with local authorities, teachers and religious leaders on
available services, and encouraging engagement of other key
government personnel201 were carried out to ensure demand
generation for adolescent-friendly health services. BCO also
supported the training of trainers on the national guidelines and
standard operating procedures for adolescent-friendly health

In addition to AFHS, the enhancement of education systems was
also supported with gender-friendly Water, Sanitation and Hygiene facilities. This included MHM
provisions, hygiene promotion sessions in school and capacity building of teachers, SMC’s and School
Brigades on hygiene management. ECM efforts also facilitated training on operation and maintenance
of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene amenities and advocated with the government on the importance of
financial investment in such facilities to allow for long-term benefit and wider outreach.203 Aligned to
Outcome 3 of the country programme, the production of economical sanitary pads by girl members of
Adolescent Clubs was also facilitated, referred to as Sani-Mart.204

Within the confines of a traditionally conservative society in Bangladesh, safe and easy access
to AFHS however remains a consistent challenge. Despite carrying out demand generation activities
with key stakeholders, AFHS saw limited uptake205, which can be attributed to limited awareness and
acceptability of available services and the stigma attached to Sexual and Reproductive Health and
Rights. Consequently, service providers were less inclined to proactively address and respond to
adolescent health issues, limiting the impact of such services.
Therefore, the evaluation notes that a gender transformative approach to addressing adolescent
health issues and well-being requires consistent and focused targeting of all stakeholders.
An increased emphasis on boys as gender equality envoys and supporters of ending child marriage is
a key strategic requirement to ensure equitable and safe access and uptake of services. Additionally,
there is also a need to enhance engagement with parents and communities so that adolescents can
leverage service delivery points easily,206 while programming also requires a stronger focus on divorced
and married adolescent girls to achieve real gender transformative results.207. Significantly, a gender
review carried out by ROSA in 2019 also noted that greater investment in addressing violence against
women208 was crucial to strengthen future programme efforts through a gender transformative
approach.
Correspondingly, it is reiterated that within the prevention approach engaging with boys and girls in their
early childhood is crucial to change social norms, gender stereotypes and discriminatory socialisation
of children. This is particularly important because by the age of 10 children learn the gendered roles
and relationships which perpetuates existing gender biases. Research suggests that by the age of
three, children start understanding and inculcating stereotypes, resulting in the world to expand for boys
and shrink for girls by age 10.209 Between the ages of three and seven, conceptions of gender have
been found to be formed in children, including knowledge on gender norms, identities and
stereotypes210, and strong gender biases. As such, it is imperative to include an understanding on
gendered notions, norms, and practices within Early Childhood Education and development,

Eighteen-year old Rozina*, member of an Adolescent Club in Bhola, was being forced into marriage by her
parents under the influence of her brother-in-law. However, through information sharing sessions at the
club, Rozina was able to build her capacity to fight back and was successfully able to delay her marriage.
Currently, she is studying in a local college with dreams of a better future.
She says, “I was treated as a “bad girl” by my family and community members when I joined the adolescent
club and started talking against child marriage. I used to share information on menstrual health and hygiene
with my friends and other girls and advised them to use sanitary napkin during period. That is why many
people thought that I am a bad girl. I talked about things which I was not supposed to talk as per the
traditional social norms and thus I am spoiling other girls. But I did not care and kept going.”
Rozina has also supported a number of adolescent girls to continue their education and delay their age of
marriage. To prevent poor children from dropping out of schools, she also advocated with teachers for the
waiver of tuition/exam fees. In her words, “I feel proud that almost all the people in my community know me
as a fighter against child marriage. All the government officials at the Upazilla level know me personally.
You go and ask. You will find everybody recognize me for my contribution to end child marriage. This was
possible because of this ECM program.”

instead of a sole focus on adolescents within a gender transformative approach to ending child
marriage.
To conclude, evaluations findings, as elucidated above, highlight that programme strategies and
interventions have provided for components of a gender transformative approach, while the impact and
outreach of the same has been gender-sensitive to a large extent. However, gender transformation is
a time intensive process and cannot be achieved in the life span of a single programme cycle.211
What has been the impact of COVID-19 on child marriage?
3.2.13 COVID-19 exacerbated vulnerabilities faced by children, particularly girls and women.
Therefore, there were increased cases of child marriages reported through various rapid
assessments and studies that were undertaken.
The COVID-19 outbreak has been a human tragedy, pushing governments globally to launch
unprecedented public-health and economic responses. On March 26, 2020 the Government of
Bangladesh announced a nationwide shut down as a preventive step to contain the spread of the virus,
creating a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension.
UNICEF reports that COVID-19 poses a serious threat to the
futures of 600 million children in South Asia.212 Moreover, studies
highlight that while 240 million children in the region already live in
"multidimensional" poverty, the pandemic will push an additional
120 million children into poverty. Additionally, there are fears that
COVID-19 will impact Bangladesh’s long fight to eradicate child
marriage. Projections indicate the pandemic will disrupt the efforts
made to end child marriage thus far, resulting in 13 million more
girls forced into child marriages between 2020 and 2030
globally.213 While it is early to estimate the true impact of COVID-
19 on child marriage, experience from the Ebola crisis and other
emergencies suggest that girls and women will be
disproportionately affected, particularly the poorest and socially marginalised.214 Existing research also
shows that, “many of the complex factors that drive child marriage in stable environments are
exacerbated in emergency settings, as family and community structures break down during crisis and
displacement.”215
Field interactions across the visited districts recorded that closure of schools for an indefinite period had
extremely negative implications on the high incidence of child marriage in the country. In Bhola, a
secondary school teacher reported fears of an approximate 30 per cent of girls not being able to return
to school. Further, in Dhaka, it was found that as a result of loss of income and livelihood opportunities
of parents, many showed inclinations of marrying their daughters to address their heightened economic
vulnerabilities.
Between April 21st and April 30th, 2021, the Population Council Bangladesh conducted the first round
of a series of rapid surveys on COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) and social and other

impacts of COVID-19 on adolescent girls living in their programme areas in rural Bangladesh.216 The
findings highlighted that the negative economic impact of the pandemic was evident with girls reporting
food scarcity and income loss in their families. Half of the adolescent girls reported a stop in their
household income due to the lockdown and one fifth reported urgent concern for food and immediate
needs in the families. Further, 18 per cent reported facing some form of violence (rebuke, angriness,
beating), while 28 per cent reported increased cases of violence in their surrounding areas.217
Findings from the ‘Rapid Analysis of Child Marriage Situation During COVID-19 in Bangladesh’ (2021)
paint an equally bleak picture. Between April to October 2020, respondents were asked their estimates
on the number of child marriages occurring in their respective neighbourhoods. This figure amounted
to 13,886 child marriages (overlap unknown).218 Breaking down by geography, the highest numbers
were reported from Barguna (1,652), Nilphamari, (1,369), Kurigram (1,321), Laxmipur (1,064), and
Kushtia (950) districts. Further, in over three-fourths (78 per cent) of these marriages, the parents were
reported as initiating the child marriage. In approximately 35 per cent (4,866) of the marriages, the
Marriage Registrar was said to have registered the marriage.219 Gauging the factors that led to this
increase in child marriages, the research found that “while knowledge on the legalities and negative
impacts of child marriage were strong, COVID-19 increased the vulnerabilities of families, exacerbating
existing social norms and beliefs”.220
Given the devastating effect of COVID-19 on children, UNICEF has targeted interventions to tackle the
direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. For the reporting period of 1 January to 30 December 2020,
UNICEF supported the Government of Bangladesh and other humanitarian actors to prevent and
respond to the impact of COVID-19 in the Rohingya camps and host communities. This response
included accelerated risk communication and hygiene promotion, delivery of $4.5 million in personal
protective equipment and medical supplies to NGO and government health facilities and the
establishment of severe acute respiratory infection isolation and treatment centres.221 Government
schools across the country as well as Learning Centres in the Rohingya camps remained closed from
March through the end of the year, disrupting structured learning programmes for nine months and
increasing child protection concerns including child marriage and child labour. While remote learning
modalities were introduced, UNICEF reported that the most vulnerable children could not access these
modalities easily or equally.222
During the COVID-19 pandemic, safe spaces remained open for individual services to respond to the
escalating GBV incidents, including child marriage and intimate partner violence. 71,114 women, men,
boys and girls in camps and 15,079 in host communities were reached with messaging on GBV
awareness and countering negative social norms during the COVID-19 pandemic.223 Additionally,
15,175 women and adolescent girls received dignity kits to facilitate their dignified access to services
and 4,047 (2,641 female) frontline workers were trained on case management, psychosocial support
and GBV risk mitigation, as well as protection from sexual exploitation and abuse.224 UNICEF-supported
CBCPCs played a significant role during the COVID-19 lockdown, undertaking information and
awareness sessions at community-level and responding to protection concerns. Other services

provided during COVID-19 were psychosocial support, quality case management, positive parenting
sessions and life skills training for adolescents.225
Further, in the context of COVID-19 especially, innovations that leverage technology become all the
more relevant and pertinent. Therefore, under the GPECM programme, operational plans were adopted
to include measures such as Digital Platform /Virtual Platform. Adolescents were trained through the
mobile phone application called, “Digital Application for Adolescents on COVID-19 messages with an
aim to protect themselves, their families, peers and community members from COVID-19226.
Additionally, these messages were also geared towards enabling adolescents to stay vigilant against
GBV, child marriages and VAC during this time. Through a cascading model, the adolescents who
received these trainings, in turn reached out to 132,846 adolescents (70 per cent girls), 27,962 parents
and 63,517 community members through the application.227 Moreover, approximately 227,000
adolescents received Online Safety training all over the country. Subsequently, developing e-booklets
on Life skills, VAC, child marriage is a focus of the programme to enhance outreach to more adolescents
in the remote locations.228
UNICEF BCO also undertook efforts for awareness raising and information dissemination on COVID-
19 protocols and best practices. These include media campaigns such as ‘Meena: Let's stay at home,
remain free from coronavirus’ and ‘#WearAMask Campaign’, as well as leaflets on safe breastfeeding
tips, classroom etiquette, hand-washing among others.229 Additionally, it has conducted a number of
U-Polls to gauge the impact of the COVID-19 situation on adolescents, including data on child marriage,
violence against children and more.

Relating to the GPECM portion of work, has the joint programme and management structure
with UNFPA at the country level facilitated achieving results and efficient delivery? Which areas
have gained the most from this programme and which one the least?
3.3.1 The joint programme and management structure helped collate complimenting resources
and capacities of UNICEF and UNFPA and thereby enhance good outreach and outcomes.
However, these were primarily at the national level and policy level advocacy.
UNICEF and UNFPA, worked jointly for the GPECM programme. While UNICEF has a long track record
of addressing ECM through multisectoral efforts using education, social protection, C4D, changing
social norms, and child protection interventions, for UNFPA, its ECM efforts are rooted in a focus on
addressing reproductive health, culture and gender. Both the organisations were able to jointly
synthesise the global vision, while accounting for diversity in activities at the country level, and defining
specific roles and responsibilities aligned to their comparative advantages and experiences.
Both the organisations predominantly implemented GPECM interventions in Bangladesh without any
combined planning, except at the national policy and advocacy level. Geographically, Jamalpur was the
only common district, however, a conscious effort was taken by both organisations to ensure there was
no overlap or duplication of efforts at a district level. Therefore, there was no joint implementation of
interventions at the district level. However, the joint programme was important to pool in complementing
resources of both organisations and together work with various stakeholders in Bangladesh to inform
national level policies, planning and strengthen programme design. The regional offices worked
together with UNICEF BCO to contextualise the global theory of change to country level. Moreover, it
had a strong element of work that focused on developing the strategy on gender transformative
programming and aided efforts to engage more men and boys into the programme for better impact.
Both regional offices built a joint model of working where activities such as monitoring, research studies,
meetings, and knowledge management were undertaken jointly.
A common evidence framework was created that helped combine inputs from both organisations’
regional and country offices. This framework helped identify gaps and collate sectoral efforts such as
health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, education, child protection, cash transfer for social protection,
empowerment of adolescents through the implementation of adolescent clubs, among other key areas.
Additionally, the global programme supported programmes in the humanitarian context of Bangladesh
too. As a country with a high proportion of refugees and increased vulnerabilities resulting from disasters
and climatic conditions, looking at ECM efforts through a humanitarian lens was very important to the
Page | 70 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
wider ECM agenda. The global programme moreover helped institutionalise life skills education into the
national education system in Bangladesh.
Moreover, with a very critical focus on evidence generation, the global programme was instrumental in
undertaking research and studies. These findings were then used to refine strategies and strengthen
programmes that helped not just UNFPA and UNICEF in their programmes but also had a cascading
effect in strengthening interventions undertaken by their respective partners. To reinforce, BCO too had
a strong focus on evidence generation during Phase 1 of the programme, however, the use of evidence
to inform implementation was not always consistent. Regional support helped ensure more evidence-
based programming was undertaken. To summarise, at the national level, jointness of the global
programme helped strengthen the NAP and its costing, undertake the development of M&E
mechanisms, and enhance efforts such as Dhol Campaign under C4D initiatives. Moreover, it had an
added value at the national level and together both organisations were able to push the ECM agenda
and enhance complementarity at a larger scale. However, the joint programme had limited impact at
the sub-national and sub-district levels except in Jamalpur. Further, as highlighted during interactions
with zonal offices, there were gaps in coordination at field level between UNFPA and UNICEF, further
limiting the impact.
3.3.2 The joint programme helped enhance efficiency of good results in key areas such as
national level coordination and policy and advocacy. Further, it helped streamline efforts and
aid the process of evidence generation which was critical for strengthening the overall ECM
agenda.
Policy level advocacy efforts
The joint programme was instrumental in enhancing national advocacy efforts with a focus on legal
reforms and national strategies. Together UNICEF and UNFPA helped strengthen the NAP under the
leadership of MoWCA to make it more comprehensive. Both organisations provided technical and
financial support to develop the document as well as conduct consultations/workshops with key
development partners (DPs). Therefore, the NAP development resulted in stronger ownership of the
action plan and in identifying key areas for contribution of the partners during the implementation phase.
Through a joint effort, the NAP was submitted to the MoWCA for their approval and endorsement. The
result contributes to Outcome 4 of the GPECM.
Additionally, along with various partners, UNICEF and UNFPA helped advocate for the Child Marriage
Restraint Act 2017 (CMRA). In 2017, during Phase 1 of the programme, the government finally adopted
the CMRA after two years of consistent technical engagement and support.230 Moreover, efforts were
taken by both organisations to advocate with the government to exclude the Special Provisions clause
that allows for marriage of children below 18 years given specific circumstances. Both organisations
continued their support to MoWCA to develop the 2018 rules of CMRA to define exceptional
circumstances vetted through a rigorous process under which the Special Provision could be used.231
To streamline operations and coordination of various stakeholders, country offices had a focus in
supporting several external and internal coordination mechanisms. For instance, UNFPA and UNICEF
are both members of the National Alliance to End Child Marriage and Female Genital mutilation steering
committee.232 Moreover, in 2018, every ministry in countries such as Bangladesh that had costed
national plans approved, had integrated ECM into their design, implementation and monitoring. This
was at a policy and programmatic level to maximise impact on ECM. Additionally, parliamentary sub-
committees on preventing gender-based violence including a focus on ECM, were set up. Both

organisations through collaborative efforts supported and engaged with key line ministries including
MoWCA in these aspects.233
Enhancing evidence generation and strengthening Communication for Development (C4D)
initiatives
As noted during discussions with the C4D representations at the zonal offices, the global programme
and joint working of UNICEF and UNFPA were important in streamlining various C4D initiatives and
bringing about cohesiveness on C4D interventions such as ECM messages and community
engagement. As highlighted during discussions, designing C4D initiatives requires convergent
programming and alignment with other sectors to enhance outcomes. Therefore, the GPECM and joint
efforts under it, helped the sectoral teams adopt stronger evidence-based mechanisms in addition to
providing financial support. For instance, C4D initiatives for UNFPA were primarily on an ad hoc basis,
however, as a result of the joint programme, along with UNICEF support, they worked together on C4D
engagements which supplemented and complimented each other. Moreover, joint efforts helped in
designing and rolling out Phase II of the national multimedia campaign in 2018. With UNICEF’s
communication team as the technical lead and UNFPA financial contribution, the collaboration helped
enhance the efforts. It supported the integration of messaging on Sexual and Reproductive Health
Rights (SRHR) in the EE series.234
The joint community-based initiatives that complimented each other, enabled the C4D team to augment
their reach through LCG wage and other platforms. As noted in discussion with child protection unit,
while ECM was a key priority for the unit, it was with the GPECM funding that they could curate more
in-depth programming. It helped expand their programming focus, train 40,000 teachers, initiate
adolescent clubs focusing on ECM, reach out to children, parents, community members as well as
policy makers. Though the funding was limited, it enabled the unit to revisit ongoing programmes,
undertake studies to understand why child marriages persist in their implementation areas and identify
areas of intervention required. The fund brought about more cohesiveness in efforts with a strategic
focus on ECM interventions under GPECM, from grassroots to policy level.
Additionally, in the joint programme district of Jamalpur, UNFPA and UNICEF both worked on
community-based interventions for enhanced outreach and outcomes. Further, as mentioned earlier, in
Jamalpur, UNFPA implemented their work in five sub-districts and UNICEF in two. It was a strategic
decision to not jointly implement activities and avoid overlapping areas. The joint efforts were
undertaken at the district and administration level, joint meetings with district coordinators, meetings
with school representatives, among other key elements. These helped streamline work from the districts
to sub-district level. Moreover, both organisations were also able to leverage networks and platforms
such as LCG WAGE group to enhance advocacy for ECM. The jointness helped impact these efforts
and also improve the quality and improve the comprehensiveness of the interventions.
It is important to reinforce, the jointness of programmes is reflected in adequately testing and using the
same approaches to identify and implement what could work towards ECM in the country. Thereby, it
helps provide an integrated package to address ECM through complimentary resources and skills of
both organisations. In this context, various country offices not only used the GPECM resources for
designing stand-alone country interventions but GPECM funds are used to integrate ECM components
in existing programmes that have shown promising impact and scale at the country level. Therefore,
the use of this ‘pool funding’ as this approach is known, has been noted by stakeholders as a strategic
and effective means to extend the outreach of GPECM despite limited funding.235 Moreover, with
support of the programme, a costed National Adolescent Health Strategy was launched in 2017.
Further, it is important to note, during the design phase, the conceptualisation of the programme was

not comprehensive and had resulted in certain gaps. A joint programme policy approach at the sub-
national level was non-existent and the project primarily aimed at targeting certain outputs for which
numbers needed to be tracked and collected from various stakeholders.236 However, over time and with
consistent coordination, the “jointness” of the programme was built with clearer mechanisms in place.
Relating to the GPECM portion of work, to what extent has being part of a global programme
facilitated linkages and synergies to accelerate efforts to end child marriage within UNICEF and
its partners?
3.3.3 GPECM helped augment good synergies and cohesiveness among various key actors
within the ECM ecosystem, however, these were primarily fostered at the national level. At sub-
district level, coordination was weak and limited.
ECM being a multidimensional issue, the transformational change required to address it in entirety
requires collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In this context, the evaluation finds the programme
was cognisant of the need for convergent and multisectoral programming. This is evidenced through
the various convergence efforts across different areas that found focus. The horizontal sectoral
convergence focus aimed at coordination between sectors, departments, ministries and agencies while
the thematic convergence aimed to link child marriage with Violence Against Girls, Sexual and
Reproductive Health, education and health.237 Congruently, the vertical (multi-level) convergence was
between levels of government at national, district, sub-district level as well as between government and
civil society organisations. Geographic convergence had a critical focus whereby multiple stakeholders
addressed different aspects of an identified issue with the same set of population in one geography.238
Tracking of geographic convergence between 2016 and 2017 under the global programme highlighted
for countries like Bangladesh number of areas where both the agencies were working remained
relatively unchanged.239
It is important to note, the government of Bangladesh focused on strengthening thematic convergence
through several ways. This included linking legislation between child marriage and related sectors
included education. sexual and reproductive health, child protection and gender-based violence. For
instance, harmonising legislations to enable pregnant and married girls to continue their schooling.240
Through collaboration and engagement among various stakeholders, the global TOC was
contextualised for the country level. Moreover, as noted during interactions with the social protection
team, a concerted effort was taken to advocate for social protection programmes. Local consultative
groups and committees who were involved in the development of the action plan were engaged. Efforts
such as the development of NAP, M&E mechanisms or C4D initiatives such as Dhol campaign were
not reflected at sub-district level. Further, UNICEF and UNFPA worked together in critical aspects such
as the development of an adolescent club learning package.
While the extent of the impact of the joint programme is not known comprehensively, UNFPA and
UNICEF worked jointly in Jamalpur district, as noted in prior sections of the reported. At the sub-district
level, upazilllas were divided between the two agencies to avoid duplication or overlap of work. While
UNFPA worked primarily on health aspects aligned to their mandate and experience, UNICEF BCO
drove the majority of the GPECM efforts in the country. In terms of pulling resources, as noted during
KIIs, both organisations were committed to building the capacity of relevant stakeholders at district and
sub-district level on child marriage related legal and policy frameworks as well as on enhancing
capacities to support implementation efforts. For instance, while UNICEF developed training modules
to train government officials on key aspects pertaining to ECM such as awareness on the CMRA or on

implementation of NAP, for better collaboration, UNFPA joined hands with UNICEF and provided their
technical support to strengthen training modules. With the jointly developed training module, both
organisations could undertake training in their respective implementation areas. This helped synthesise
training, enhance outreach and deliver a more standardised set of information to stakeholders without
duplication of efforts. Moreover, in terms of management, both the organisations had their own
respective management with no sole management. Funds disbursed under the joint programme
stemmed from individual headquarters and there was no single pool of funds for both organisations
together. In addition, fund management too was aligned to each organisation’s agency structure with
no overlap.
What key principles have determined where UNICEF has mainly spent its resources for ending
child marriage? Have high impact areas been prioritised?
3.3.4 Funding priorities were adequately aligned to organisational mandates as well as sectoral
priorities within UNICEF BCO. However, overall, while GPECM funding was identified as
inadequate to address the extent of ECM challenges, it helped streamline various ongoing
efforts under a comprehensive programme.
The evaluation notes, government priority and UN priority both governed the allocation of resources.
Several stakeholders the team interacted with, highlighted resources were limited when it comes to
addressing root causes, therefore the criticality of having concerted efforts with various development
partners and pushing for coordination with PMO and MoWCA to influence ECM agenda is key to
enhance the impact of the programme. Moreover, as highlighted through the evaluation, MoWCA which
is the nodal ministry for driving ECM efforts and leading implementation of NAP has limitations.
Therefore, substantial increase in investment, resource building and capacity building efforts for them
is needed to drive and lead ECM efforts mandated by the ministry and act as strong support to other
partners.
Moreover, sectoral teams identified specific priorities aligned to their individual mandates and
requirements. The social protection team with UNICEF BCO for instance had ECM as a strong priority
area in the Eighth Five Year Plan. It supported the government to undertake six background analyses
to help inform the new five-year plan. Through consistent engagement with the government, social
protection alongside ECM was a priority for the government in the Eighth Five Year Plan. However, for
the priority to materialise, adequate budgeting for ECM will be needed under the Plan. For the child
protection unit too, GPECM funding was limited. It was inadequate to cover all CP initiatives for ECM.
Interventions in four zones of Rangpur, Khulna and Barisal received technical support under the
GPECM funding. While the unit supported many adolescents and programmes in these areas, only
around a quarter was supported directly under the GPECM fund. However, as noted during KII’s with
sectoral teams, the GPECM programme streamlined efforts with a strategic focus on ECM, helped
teams revisit existing programmes and reconfigure them to enable programmes to be more gender
transformative. Thereby, it helped teams look beyond their sectoral mandates and refine programming
efforts through a multisectoral lens.
3.3.5 Given the complexities and extent of challenges, to translate commitments into effective
interventions, there is a need to adequately enhance financial and human resources and
streamline fund management for overall impact.
An overall challenge for both organisations was limited and insecure sources of finances under the
GPECM programme. As highlighted in KIIs, country offices were given an approximation of allocated
funds, in different batches across a two-year period. This proved to be challenging as it hindered long
term planning. Additionally, with each organisation and sectoral team working closely with
implementation partners who require an understanding of definite funding over the duration of the
project to help map out interventions accordingly, the lack of information about the availability of funds
was a challenge. Furthermore, GPECM was primarily catalytic funding and limited considering the
Page | 74 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
complex need of the country. As a result, programmes also leveraged other funds and tried to integrate
ECM in the activities of community engagement even outside the GPECM fund. Stakeholders
additionally noted that reporting mechanisms were drawn from the priority indicators mandated against
the fund. This runs the risk of inadvertently not reporting against priority indicators of other external
funds drawn upon, limiting the ability to gauge the overall effectiveness of the interventions.
To reiterate, ECM programmes require multi-sector collaboration, adequate sector funding and
appropriate monitoring mechanisms. For sectors like education, social welfare and health, stronger
technical support and financial resources is required to further invest in relevant initiatives that provide
access to quality services for girls, particularly those that result in their economic empowerment and
provide tangible alternative pathways for secure livelihoods.241 However, the considerable impact is
predominately dependent on the ability of the government to support scale up of programmes at all
levels of governance. With limited government capacity, this often acts as a hindrance to overall ECM
impact. For instance, for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene sector, as a result of limited government
capacity for timely delivery coupled with inadequate funding of schools to operationalise and sustain
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene facilities, providing adequate support services to girls in schools proved
to be a challenge.242 This in turn could lead to higher dropouts among girls and thereby increase
vulnerabilities to early marriages. Congruently, additional and adequate funding would be needed to
sustain the momentum built around the media campaign. To mobilise and enhance community
engagement efforts, dedicate on ground cadre with a dedicated budget focusing on SBCC is key.
As the evaluation notes, prioritisation of funds is aligned to individual mandates of sectoral units and of
organisations working on the ground, however, this is not often enough for desired results. Prioritising
all related aspects together is needed in order to enhance outcomes given the socio-political cultural-
economic context of the country. However, efforts to enhance social protection and livelihood measures
simultaneously with adolescent girl empowerment or SBCC, is often constrained by inadequate funds.
Enhancing funding gaps would help in increasing prioritisation to enable addressing a lot of root causes
that may not otherwise be covered under individual programme mandates. Subsequent programmes
and phase II planning requires concerted focus on these aspects holistically and strategically.
Has the country programme structure of a life cycle approach facilitated efficient delivery of
results?
3.3.6 While the life-cycle approach fostered adequate convergence, collaboration and systems
thinking across sections towards ECM programming, documentation on how the same was
achieved remains limited. Further, given that delivery of results for ECM requires long-term and
sustained efforts, it remains too early to comment of the efficiency of this approach.
As highlighted in stakeholder interactions, the life cycle approach under the 2017-2020 Country
Programme fostered collaboration and partnership among the various sectoral teams towards ECM. It
also brought line ministries and stakeholders at various levels under one agenda. By adopting a life-
cycle approach, efforts were made to target issues such as maternal health, child mortality and child
poverty, which have a relation to early marriage and early pregnancy. Through this approach, efforts
addressed the persisting negative social norms which are key drivers for the high prevalence of child
marriage in Bangladesh.
However, as the life-cycle approach was adopted for a four-year period and with BCO making a shift
from the life-cycle approach to a life-cycle lens to guide its next country programme (starting 2021), it
remains too early for this evaluation to comment on the efficiency of the life-cycle approach and its
delivery of results. Especially because delivery of results for ECM requires long-term and sustained

efforts. However, some notable achievements under Outcome 3 pertaining to education, adolescents’
access to health services and community engagement have been discussed in the previous section.
Despite the successes under the life-cycle approach, challenges and gaps remain, as reflected in RAM
Narrative for Outcome 3243 and stakeholder interactions:
• Human and financial resource constraints across sectors on adolescent programming hindered
overall progress towards the outcome
• Alignment of multi-sectoral interventions to ensure convergence between strategies was
challenging due to sectoral mind set and weak coordination mechanisms
• Monitoring and funding for policies, laws and strategies at the sub-national levels remain weak
• Engaging private, public, development partners and CSOs in one platform to work for youth
skills and employability remains challenging
• While theoretically, the life-cycle approach enhances sectoral partnerships, programming,
prioritisation and structures remain sectoral. For instance, funding provided to sectors with
limited coordination on collective usage
• As the life-cycle approach is a UNICEF framework, there remains a lack of incentivisation for
stakeholders, particularly government counterparts at the sub-national level to follow it
effectively on the ground
• To see efficient delivery of results, a longer time frame of monitoring the programme is needed
3.3.7 Cost effectiveness of GPECM and BCO ECM Programmes
The following sections attempted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of GPECM and ECM programmes
in Bangladesh. The cost per beneficiary has been calculated for interventions wherever possible.
Additionally, the benefits from such interventions have been estimated using results from similar studies
in Bangladesh. Finally, in the case of the GPECM programme, the per-beneficiary costs were compared
with the average per-beneficiary cost in all GPECM countries. The following analysis has been
conducted based on the information shared by UNICEF.

• Outcome 3: Relevant sectoral systems deliver quality and cost-effective services to meet the
needs of adolescent girls.
• Outcome 4: National laws, policy frameworks and mechanisms to protect and promote
adolescent girls’ rights are in line with international standards and are properly resourced
• Outcome 5: Government(s) and partners within and across countries support the generation
and use of robust data and evidence to inform policy and programming, track progress and
document lessons.
Outcome 1:
As per the Indicator Reference Sheet by UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to
End Child Marriage, there are two outputs under Outcome 1:
• Output 1.1. – Adolescent girls (aged 10-19) are actively participating in a targeted programme
(life skills, health information, economic empowerment, social protection).
• Output 1.2. – Adolescent girls are supported to enrol and remain in formal and non-formal
education, including through the transition from primary to secondary education.

it exceeded the number of adolescents who were supported to remain in primary/lower-secondary or
non-formal education in 2015. However, it is worth noting that no such data is available from 2017-
2019.
Outcome 2:
As per the Indicator Reference Sheet by UNFPA -UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to
End Child Marriage, there is one output under Outcome 2:
• Output 2.1. – Households are increasingly aware of the benefits of investing in adolescent girls
and ending child marriage.

Outcome 4:
As per the Indicator Reference Sheet by UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to
End Child Marriage, there is one output under Outcome 4:
• Output 4.1. – Whether country had developed a costed national action plan/development plan
on ending child marriage across more than one ministry.
In Bangladesh, prior to the commencement of the GPECM programme, there was no national action
plan or development plan on ending child marriages in more than one ministry. The GPECM programme
set targets to ensure such national action plans under more than one ministry from 2017 onwards.
Results show that the more than one ministry in Bangladesh adopted national plans to end child
marriages from 2018.
Outcome 5:
As per the Indicator Reference Sheet by UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to
End Child Marriage, there is one output under Outcome 5:
• Output 5.1. – Country-specific, high-quality data and evidence generated and shared on what
works at scale to accelerate ending child marriage.
UNICEF conveyed that a costed action plan on the ECM NAP was placed in a ToR which has been in
the contracting stage for 6 months. This plan was developed in late 2019 for implementation in early
2020. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has disturbed the process. As a result, it is planned to be
implemented under UNFPA's oversight (with UNICEF support) in 2022-23.
However, unlike in other GPECM countries, in Bangladesh, a costed national action plan was not
formed, and neither was the national action plan financed.

Cost-effectiveness of ECM Programme
Under the ambit of the BCO’s Country Programme 2017-2020, as mentioned in previous sections,
within Outcome 3, Adolescents as Agents of Change, ending child marriage was selected as one of the
headline results highlighted by all UNICEF programme sections Office (BCO). The program essentially
focussed on five channels. A summary of expenditures244 on each channel is stated as follows:
Water Sanitation
Year* and Hygiene Health Education Communication Child Protection
244 The cost effectiveness analysis of the ECM programme relied on data shared by the BCO on expenditure and number of
beneficiaries for all activities and outputs. It may be noted that not all of the expenditure for Outcome 3 contribute to ECM

Research shows that poverty and low literacy rates are the key factors that cause child marriages in
Bangladesh. Although the child marriage rates have fallen in Bangladesh in the last 30 years, these
practices still prevail in the interiors of the country. The following section provides a cost-benefit analysis
of each of the interventions stated above. Due to lack of concrete data on the benefits accrued due to
these interventions, this analysis relies on a method of estimating such benefits from similar
interventions in the past and various other research papers.
1. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Bangladesh has achieved significant success in the last three
decades in terms of improving sanitary conditions. Research in Bangladesh shows that over 98 per
cent of clean drinking water came from technologically improved man-made sources as opposed to 79
per cent in 1990s245. Although this success is remarkable compared to that of other countries,
Bangladesh is still yet to reach the goal of universal access to clean water and sustainable sanitation
as defined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). BCO interventions aim to achieve this goal
through its impact on ending child marriage. Based on the funding data, a total of USD 387,482 was
spent on interventions pertaining to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene targeting 205,526 beneficiaries
across the years 2016 to 2020. This amounts to a per-beneficiary cost of USD 3.98.
A study from the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Programme (WSP) estimates an average per-
beneficiary gain of USD13.83 across multiple interventions to improve sanitation and hygiene practices
in Bangladesh. Based on the report’s calculations, an average gain of UDS 10.2 can be envisaged from
projects pushing towards improved access to clean water.246 The gains from improvements could be
largely due to a reduction in absenteeism at schools, low open defecation sites, etc. Since there are
large externalities to socio-economic interventions, these gains are likely to have a greater inter-
generational impact as the target groups included young children, mothers and adolescents. Moreover,
if one accounts for the potential losses that Bangladesh may incur in the future if attempts to improve
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene facilities were neglected, the economic gains could potentially increase
to a much larger per-capita benefit. These economic as well as financial gains could lead to an increase
in enrolment rates and investment in education among the lower strata of the economy thereby reducing
the incidence of child marriages in Bangladesh.
2. Health: Bangladesh is home to 36 million adolescents who comprise 22 per cent of the total population.
However, the healthcare infrastructure for adolescents is not well developed in Bangladesh. Thus, high
rates of child marriage lead to multiple complications like early pregnancies, lack of nutrition, and
violence. In order to address these concerns, the ECM programme has devised various interventions

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
to spread awareness about healthcare needs. The total expenditure across the four years amounted to
USD 387,482 which benefitted 445,149 adolescents. Thus, the cost per beneficiary for this
programme was USD 0.87.
Awareness programmes related to healthcare among the youth would have intergenerational effects.
In monetary terms, awareness campaigns like these would encourage the target groups to take
preventive measures and thereby save on medical bills that they would have incurred in the absence
of the intervention. Since economic interventions have large externalities, these gains would exceed
the cost incurred in implementing them.
3. Education: The main deciding factors in child marriage are poverty and low literacy rates. Research
across education intervention programmes show that an additional year of education causes the
probability of child marriage to reduce significantly. Further, interventions through education
programmes are one of the most effective ways to reduce child marriage which throws light on as to
why the ECM programmes allocate the largest share of the ECM funds to reduce child marriages
through education programmes. A summary of the interventions is stated below.
a) The education for adolescents’ programme started working in 250 secondary schools and 50
Madrasahs in the initial stages to reduce dropout rates and increase student engagement. However,
the work was subsequently mainstreamed to 20,000 secondary schools under the Directorate of
Secondary Education (DSHE).
b) The Programme also worked with National Curriculum & Textbook Board to develop the
Comprehensive Skills Framework for Adolescents and support the National Curriculum revision process
which would benefit all primary and secondary school-aged children in Bangladesh.
c) For adolescents who were out of school, the programme implemented an alternative learning
programme (ALP) through which 4250 most marginalized adolescents have already received skills
training and are now gainfully employed. Based on estimates, 6550 learners will be reached by end of
2021.
Based on the data provided by the BCO, a total of USD 6,405,648 was incurred in the intervention
pertaining to education campaigns in Bangladesh. Given that the intervention was conducted in over
20,000 schools, a per-school cost of USD 320 was incurred. Further, based on an assumption that an
average school in Bangladesh comprises of 500247 students, this would result in a per-student cost
of USD 0.64.
4. Child Protection and Communication: The Bangladesh ECM programme has conducted
interventions through campaigns by spreading awareness about child protection rights to reduce the
incidence of child marriage in Bangladesh. While the communication campaigns mainly focussed on
larger target groups through social media, child protection campaigns empowered marginalized
adolescents in various regions of the country. A summary of the interventions in given as follows:
Communication
a) A drama series about girls’ football “Icchedana” was produced and a PSA on child marriage by
activist Keshab Roy that was funded by Communication for Development.
b) Adolescent boys and girls selected and trained to play at the tournaments where male and
female caregivers participated in the tournaments of national talent hunt as audience.

c) A series of videos in celebration of 30 years of the Convention on Child Rights on empowered
girls from across Bangladesh was made. The videos featured girls discussing child rights and
how they tried to bring change in their communities in different ways. The series was
broadcasted on social media and projected in CRC30/World Children’s Day 2019 Event.
Child Protection
a) Empowered marginalized adolescents (70 per cent girls) through LSBE training following Peer
Leader Model under EECR project with MoWCA (Ministry of Children and Women Affairs).
b) Empowered marginalized adolescents (70 per cent girls) in ECM zones under EECR project
through LSBE training with MoWCA and implemented through CSO/NGOs partners in all the
zones.
A summary of the expenditure incurred on the two interventions is provided in the table below:

Child Protection 3,010,784.44 626,023 4.81
Table 15: Expenditure across Child Protection and Communication interventions
Since child protection and communication campaigns are targeted on a community-wide level, it would
be more appropriate to assess the benefits on a macro-level (unlike the intervention programmes
assessed earlier).
5. Communications for Development (C4D): The C4D programme in Bangladesh aimed to engage the
community and encourage public commitment towards ending harmful practices of child marriage. To
this end, the C4D programme used mass media and entertainment-education models to create
awareness and increase engagement with the community.
Following are the points that summarise the implementation strategies of the C4D programme in
Bangladesh248:
• Evidence: generation, analysis, and utilisation
• Guidance standards: models, and packages
• Capacity development: needs assessments, partnerships, training, packages, mentoring
• Coordination, Partnerships and Leveraging of Resources: at national, sub-national, and
community level
• Advocacy and Social Accountability: for institutionalisation of C4D and community/public
engagement mechanisms within policies and systems
The following chart provides a summary of the expenditure on C4D programme in Bangladesh from
2016-20. It can be observed that the expenditure has been inconsistent across the duration.

The above table summarises that the highest expenditure was allocated to the SMCE program. Since
the abovementioned programmes engage with the community directly and through media platforms, it
is difficult to gauge the impact or the number of beneficiaries of such programmes.
To conclude, from the above data it was seen that most of the ECM funds were allocated to Education
and Child Protection interventions aimed at reducing child marriages. The maximum amount of
investment was in activities related to Child Protection amongst all other programmes and has been
gradually increasing over the years of programme implementation. Additionally, Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene initiatives have incurred the highest per beneficiary cost while the Health initiatives incurred
the lowest per beneficiary cost between the years.

Table 17: Summary of Sustainability EQ Findings
To what extent are there sustainability considerations built into programme implementation?
3.4.1 ECM interventions by BCO incorporated a focus on fostering sustainability through
adoption of good practices in planning and implementation of programme interventions.
ECM interventions promoted sustainability through various strategies, including advocacy,
institutionalisation, strengthening systems and social workforce, developing capacities and
mobilising complementary funding. Aligned to this, interventions at the community level were
delineated keeping long term achievements as a key expectation.249
A review of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene interventions carried out by BCO clearly shows that
sustainability and long-term change have been recorded as essential components of programme
planning. Sectoral interventions were divided into two units, software and hardware. Through capacity
building and training of teachers, SMC members, adolescent girls and district and upazilla level
authorities, interventions had a focus on bringing forth long-term change in the lives of girls.250
Interventions such as installation of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene blocks, handwashing stations
supported by the GoB, separate latrines for girls and boys with MHM facilities for girls at Adolescent
Clubs and secondary schools/madrassas, had the effect of preventing girls from being absent from their
schools. The establishment of the SLIP Fund, which encourages schools to provide financial
investments for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene facilities251, is also key to ensuring that impact and
uptake of facilities is possible in the long-term. Further, creation of Operational Guidelines for

maintenance of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene facilities in schools will also enable sustainable benefits
and change.
In Dhaka, as highlighted during interactions, through community dialogues that saw the participation of
predominantly male members (reported to be 80 per cent in many cases), the focus of was to emphasise
the harmful impact of child marriage and the active role that they can play to prevent it. Training of
members of CBCPCs to respond to ending child marriage interventions was also carried out by C4D
and Child Protection teams. Furthermore, the inclusion of a police officer as a part of the CBCPC
structure also allowed for quick response in cases of child marriage and other forms of violence against
children.
Moreover, a key target group for ECM interventions were religious leaders, with a focus on highlighting
elements of religious texts that condemn violence against women.252 This is significant as within a
conservative society such as Bangladesh, the position of religious leaders is critical and can aid in the
establishment of positive norms and behaviours for ending child marriage. Faith leaders can play a
crucial role in transforming systems of inequality for girls and women through awareness generation,
advocating for the strengthening of law enforcement structures and encourage a change in harmful
social norms and practices.253
Institutionalisation of programme strategies and approaches is also essential for sustainability
and achievement of long-term benefits. While institutionalisation of interventions has not been
recorded as a clear target in the Global Results Framework254, significant efforts have been
made by the programme in Bangladesh for the same.
Through continuous advocacy on adolescent health issues, the GPECM enabled the incorporation of
adolescent health indicators in the health management system. This is significant in contributing to
sustaining services as data recorded has a significant impact on the planning and monitoring of
interventions.255 Manuals on key areas of sexuality education, MHM, prevention of gender-based
violence in schools have also been merged with government curricula.256 Further, in Dhaka North City
Corporation (DNCC), the entire ECM programme was overseen by government authorities. Such
integration is direct evidence of institutionalisation of programme interventions as part of routine
functioning, enabling an environment that will allow for sustainable and long-term change. This was
further reinforced through interactions on field with DNCC representation.
3.4.2 ECM programming in Bangladesh has strengthened the ability of key stakeholders to
further the commitment to ending child marriage. However, greater mentoring/coaching and
incorporation of key stakeholders within programme implementation is needed to ensure good
and sustainable outcomes.
For sustainable outcomes, it is important to ensure that key stakeholders are capacitated to carry out
their roles and responsibilities beyond the duration of the programme interventions. In line with this,
BCO’s efforts that focused on adolescent girls’ empowerment had a strong impact on enhancing girls’
knowledge and abilities, resulting in an increase in their sense of confidence. After the acquisition of
these skills, target groups were likely to carry over their learnings and understanding to the household
level, thereby enabling positive change for themselves and other girls in the community. Additionally,

through the adoption of a mentorship strategy, women from the same or nearby communities were able
to consistently support adolescent girls.257
Interventions carried out by the Communications team of BCO also showed promising results for the
sustainability of the programme agenda. Targeted children were trained in the essentials of journalism
and were provided with access to an online portal (HelloBD portal) to publish their stories and videos.
For these child journalists, ECM has been mandated as a compulsory focus area, encouraged to collect
and narrate compelling stories through social media.258 Child journalists trained through the programme
have also been presented with several awards in recognition of their work.259
As mentioned in previous sections of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has highly exacerbated the
risks posed to children in Bangladesh. Recognising this ECM programming in Bangladesh adapted the
following approaches to identify and respond to the heightened vulnerability of children:260
• C4D interventions through public service announcements, adolescent clubs and community radio
programmes with radio partner Bangladesh Betar
• Adolescents were trained to use the ‘Digital Application for Adolescents’ to learn and communicate
to other community members about COVID-19, gender-based violence, child marriage, and mental
health and psychosocial support
• Face-to-face counselling by front-line workers was transferred to online
platforms/telecommunication
• A U-Report perception poll on child marriage in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic was
conducted
Significantly, the platform for child journalists was also effectively leveraged during the COVID-19
pandemic261, providing evidence of how focusing on building capacities helped in responding and
adapting to the challenges posed by the pandemic. It is important to note, such adaptation was key to
ensuring that efforts to ECM remain consistent and bring about desired change.
However, the evaluation notes that the sustainability of the ECM agenda is heavily dependent
on the ability and capacity of key stakeholders to further enhance it and carry it forth in the
absence of external influences.
Efforts in Bangladesh do not record any evidence on the provision of rolling membership and building
the capacity of newly enrolled children in the Adolescent Club model, crucial to ensuring that the design
and purpose of the Adolescent Club achieve its desired results and can be sustained in the long-term.
Additionally, ensuring the regular engagement of members of adolescent clubs was fraught with
challenges that inhibited the outreach of adolescent clubs.262 For instance, girls and their families have
been found to be increasingly inclined to attend Adolescent Clubs if there is training on practical skills,
such as learning English and using computers. Additionally, amongst the most marginalized out-of-
school adolescents, while married adolescents, especially girls, and adolescents with disabilities were
restricted by family norms and limited accessibility to the adolescent clubs with respect to safety, hours

of operation and distance, adolescents in labour were further burdened by economic priorities that they
had to fulfil.263
While CBCPCs have been identified as a community-based network with the necessary influence to
bring about a change in social norms and further the agenda to protect the rights of children, the
evaluation notes the importance of focusing on increasing women and adolescent girl participation in
the same. In other words, custody of men over the lives of girls and women offers a strong defence to
the power and control that emerges from a patriarchal system. Resultantly, this has strong linkages with
the enablement and encouragement of violence against and discrimination of girls and women.264 While
members of adolescent clubs are included in CBCPC membership265, UNICEF efforts must recognise
that long-term sustainable impact requires adequate gender representation, so that women are able to
exercise the fundamental right of choice.
To what extent has the programme generated/is in the process of generating robust evidence
that supports the scaling up of a successful intervention to allow for the government to take
these over in the future?
3.4.3 Evidence generation found adequate resonance in ECM efforts with BCO focusing
extensively in using data and evidence to strengthen programmes. However, prioritisation and
use were driven considerably through the GPECM programme.
The generation and use of robust data and evidence, both qualitative and quantitative, is recognised as
key in the context of addressing child marriage practices in the country. Programmes like GPECM have
used studies, baseline, and midline surveys in the programme districts to inform both policy and
programming interventions. To elaborate, the programme has focused on evidence-based advocacy by
sharing of data briefs on ECM based on MICS 2019 and ‘Study on Child Marriage in Humanitarian
Settings’. These have been key to influence relevant and responsible ministries. Further, MOWCA has
used new evidence generated by the report on “Ending Child Marriage: A profile of progress in
Bangladesh” which was published along with UNICEF headquarters in New York. MoWCA used
evidence to revise the national targets for Ending Child Marriage (ECM) for Bangladesh’s Eighth Five
Year Plan.266 Moreover, BCO country programme contributed towards the overall evidence generation
focus by producing a study titled ‘Context of Child Marriage and its Implications in Bangladesh.” It
provides insights into the causes and consequences of child marriage in the country. The findings and
insights were disseminated with locally elected representatives to encourage key stakeholders,
especially at sub-district levels, to speak out and help in generating community awareness on the
consequences of child marriages.267
Correspondingly, use of evidence to strengthen programmatic efforts was an important element of
interventions for other BCO sectors such as child protection and data and analytics unit, among others.
For instance, child protection unit undertook a knowledge management study in December 2018 with a
focus on Sylhet and Barisal districts under the supervision of ROSA. Additionally, they developed a
digital platform for adolescent development in 2019. As noted in the discussion with the education unit,
evidence generation was a part of national-level ECM planning. An implementation research on
“Keeping girls in school to reduce child marriage in rural Bangladesh” was conducted to test a few
standardised interventions through the education system & measure its impact on reducing child
marriage.

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
With funding support under the GPECM, UNFPA undertook a national study268 with an exclusive focus
on child marriage. It was conducted in 14 districts and is representative at district level and are a rich
data source that could be leveraged to inform policy briefs, advocacy and programmatic efforts on the
ground. It is key to note, as mentioned, UNICEF Bangladesh undertook several studies to refine, inform
and strengthen critical areas of ECM efforts. For instance, UNICEF focused on developing and
strengthening modules within real-time monitoring systems that helped track variations in norms of child
marriage practice over time.269 This data aimed to generate information around incidences of child
marriage and further aid the process of timely and accurately available information on the prevalence
and situation of child marriage at sub-national levels, which is a critical element to enhance ECM efforts.
In addition, BCO conducted a scoping study in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance to analyse
government resource allocation to ECM efforts.270 Based on the dissemination of findings from the
scoping analysis, at sub-national levels budget allocation analysis was being undertaken with the aim
to increase investments towards ECM. Further, according to the GPECM Annual Report of 2018, with
the goal to improve government accountability for adolescent health programmes, UNICEF supported
efforts to integrate adolescent health indicators into national health management information system.
3.4.4 For sustained efforts and scaling up interventions, adequate system strengthening needs
to be embedded at all levels including national policies, programme planning and design and in
implementation, especially at the sub-district levels.
To reiterate, for sustaining the several multidimensional and multisectoral interventions and activities
being undertaken, it is important for organisations to recognise those practices that have the potential
to help in uniting and scaling efforts within the ECM movement. There is cognisance among key
stakeholders interacted with that this identification of key interventions is critical and needs to be rooted
in robust use of data and evidence, as not all interventions are scalable.
In this context, the evaluation finds, the GPECM has a strategic aim to identify and mobilise catalytic
models and scalable platforms that would augment systems-level change. At a country office level,
efforts are being taken to identify key programmes that have shown success and would stand as
important examples for scaling up efforts and enhancing outreach to empower more adolescent girls. It
is key to note, UNICEF had an aim to support the government in scaling up programmes that directly
benefit girls. For instance, BCO’s country programme’s effort enabled the institutionalisation of life skills
within the national education systems. Moreover, it was able to influence skills-based education and
alternative learning programme for out-of-school adolescents in the education sector-wide approach
(Swap).271 Further, it aims to integrate other key sectors of health, nutrition, Water Sanitation and
Hygiene, MHM interventions into schools for adolescents.
Moreover, BCO’s adolescent empowerment project proved to be a successful strategy in target districts.
With nearly 150,000 girls reach with at least 1 intervention related to the empowerment of adolescent
girls, the government agreed to roll out 5000 new adolescent clubs through the country. With technical
support to MoWCA and through UNICEF’s “Kishori Abhijaan” programme from the past, the country
now has 2000 adolescent clubs supported by both government and non-government organisations.272
This was to be done by the government from using their revenue budget and based on lessons learnt
from the adolescent empowerment project by UNCIEF.273 Since 2016, MoWCA was allocated a
revenue budget to scale up such clubs, owning to their promising impact. Additionally, a scale-up

strategy for the Alternative Learning Program (ALP) focusing predominantly on disadvantaged out of
school adolescents was drafted and with plans for scale-up as part of the Generation Unlimited.274
Furthermore, investing in gender-responsive Adolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS) was
identified as a key priority area. While UNICEF set up and implemented AFHS plans in target upazillas,
they were monitored by the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) and Director General of Family
Planning (DGFP). With a continuous focus on gender disparities, teenage pregnancy and access to
SRSH for both married and unmarried adolescent girls and also boys, UNICEF leveraged resources
from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN) to scale up AFHS in 4 ECM/AFHS priority
districts.275 These instances highlight notable efforts taken for engaging with the government, providing
technical support where required and help scale efforts.
It is key to note, despite a strong focus on evidence generation and isolated examples of successes
across intervention areas, at present, there is no proven model for national level success on ECM. As
noted in prior sections of the report, ECM is deeply rooted in Bangladesh’s complex socio-economic-
cultural practices that have regional variations. Therefore, as noted during interactions, an intervention
that works in one context may not in another. To understand scalable practices, the country has an
opportunity for the first time through the GPECM to test and understand which strategies and
combination of strategies could do impact at various levels of governance across the country. To
leverage this opportunity and understand medium- and long-term impact in addressing ECM, more
resources and dedicated budget is needed. Finding the balance between contextualising while
simultaneously working at scale, would be critical to enhance ECM outcomes. Moreover, often with
limited government resources, strengthening collaboration with stakeholders and engaging in
innovating ways to scale up, would be needed for system wide transformation.
To what extent has the programme been able to generate an enabling environment and strong
involvement of key stakeholders at different levels (individual, family, community and local
authorities) that will prevent gains in social norms to go back to pre-programme levels even in
the absence of further interventions? Has the programme reached a tipping point where social
norms and gender transformative results are strongly rooted in all these levels?
3.4.5 BCO’s ECM interventions have adequately contributed to the creation of an enabling
environment and interventions have targeted engagement with key stakeholders at all levels.
Capacity building of and advocacy with stakeholders on ending child marriage has been a key
approach. However, there is scope for enhanced advocacy and engagement to sustain gains in
social norm change and address overarching harmful behaviours.
Improving quality of life for adolescent girls and providing them with knowledge and access to
resources and services, resting on the assumption that this combined with addressing drivers
of gender inequality, will delay marriage was a key objective of the BCO’s ECM efforts.
Simultaneously, the interventions also focussed on fostering a supportive environment (laws,
policies, data and services) through engagement with concerned authorities and community
members (Table) to aid and enhance the process of transformation.276
C4D interventions through regular and constant engagement with stakeholders and partners proved
necessary to ensure sustainability and scale (especially with the Government), use available resources
and assure quality. UNICEF adopted a public–private partnership approach that enabled greater
outreach and impact of media dissemination in 2018.277 The strategy for C4D activities also recognised
the cruciality of advocacy with ministries, departments as well as the media at national and local level.

Table 18: Stakeholders engaged
Moreover, a notable example of concretising and recording learnings and approaches to ECM in
Bangladesh can be seen in the development of the “Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh: What Matters
for Change?” discussion paper presented by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and UNICEF in 2018.
The paper attempted at providing a more wholesome understanding of which variables are correlated
with child marriage in Bangladesh, and which may be the ones that have the strongest importance in
people’s decision-making process.280 Studies such as this have the potential to go a long way in
informing the ideology behind programmatic approaches, providing the necessary local context and
also serving as an effective base to initiate discussion with and involve MoWCA and other line ministries
to ensure sustainability and scale up of programme interventions.
The evaluation notes that advocacy through the Global Programme, along with other
development partners and NGOs, proved to be critical to mobilise governments and promote
ownership.281 However, there is greater scope to strengthen the approach.
UNFPA and the Speaker of Parliament, a parliamentary sub-committee on ‘Preventing Gender-Based
Violence (GBV) Including Eliminating Child Marriage’ was constituted within the Standing Committee of
MoWCA. This strategic partnership provided UNFPA and partners an extended area to propagate the
agenda to end child marriage and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls.282 Further,
anti-sexual harassment committees were set up in 72 secondary schools in two target districts aligned
to guidelines of the Bangladesh High Court, and members were trained on the prevention of sexual

abuse. This has successfully enabled a change in the approach of teachers to sexual violence and
school283, aligned to Outcome 3 of GPECM, wherein relevant sectoral systems deliver quality and cost-
effective services to meet the needs of adolescent girls. Members of these committees have also been
provided with information on relevant health and legal services in close proximity, and a complaint and
referral mechanism has been drawn up to address any incidence of sexual harassment within or near
school premises.284 Additionally, this contributed to the creation of a safe environment in schools,
resulting in retention and regular attendance of girls in school. Ensuring the same is crucial so that girl
children are protected from violence and discrimination and can prevent child marriage and early
motherhood.285 Relatedly, support was also provided for the operationalisation of existing parent-
student forums in schools. The focus has been to encourage communication to facilitate continued
learning and retention in schools for girls.286
Interactions with representatives of the UNICEF highlighted that the Global Programme enabled joint
effort among UNICEF sections, development partners and government counterparts. Additionally, it
also created a specialised focus on ECM at the grassroots level, key to ensuring that interventions are
sustainable and to the creation of a positive environment that upholds the rights and value of girls.
Further, evidence-based programming reinforced the approach to ending child marriage through a
gender lens. Significantly, field interactions with the Deputy Commissioner in Bhola district highlighted
the attempts being made to envisage and implement a common programme that addresses cross-
cutting issues of child protection and child rights, supported by UNICEF.
Addressing structural systems of inequality and transforming gender norms and practices is a time-
intensive process and requires greater intensity and scale to achieve desired results. It is important to
note here that the Global Programme focused on select districts, whereas for scale and sustainability
increased geographical coverage is key. Data from MICS 2019 highlights that the registration of birth
rates of children under the age of five shows makes a strong case for geographical scale-up of
programme interventions. To elucidate, non-programme districts such as Kushtia and Sirajganj record
registration at 24.8 per cent and 32.1 per cent287 respectively, whereas programme districts of Barishal
and Jamalpur record significantly higher rates (72.9 per cent and 64.4 per cent).288
Relatedly, stakeholder interactions with the representation of the Social Protection/Policy team in
Bangladesh suggested that a restricted eligibility criterion prevents many girls from the uptake of social
protection schemes, in effect having no actual impact on the high rates of child marriage. It was noted
that the amount received is nominal and does not effectively incentivise families or at-risk girls to not
engage in child marriage.289 Greater advocacy is needed to expand set criterion, as well as focusing
on alternative avenues for adolescent girls and their families to effectively delay the age of their
marriage.290 Significantly, during field interactions, it was reported that while the government has the
necessary financial capacity and inclination to further the agenda to ECM, there is a strong dependence
on support from UNICEF, UNFPA and other development partners.
3.4.6 The programme has placed emphasis on enabling social and behaviour change and
addressing the structural causes and drivers of gender equality. Achievement of the ‘tipping
point’, however, needs adequate, longer and more intensive investment and focus. Behaviour
change, and transformation of embedded systems and structures requires consistent and

focused engagement at all levels for a sustained period, going beyond the duration of a single
programme.
Transformation of gender norms, relations and roles moves beyond empowerment of girls and
women to changing the underlying structures and systems that perpetuate inequalities and
legitimise gender discrimination.291
A key approach of the GPECM design was the focus on the critical mass theory to create agents of
change to encourage and support transformation within the community.292 This theory advocates that
on reaching a critical group size, a dedicated proportion of the population can influence and drive
sustained social and behaviour change.293 The point where this critical mass is achieved and self-
sustained change is visible is known as the Tipping Point. Though the Tipping Point does not have a
fixed value, it is commonly accepted to present itself at 25 per cent.294 The evaluation finds that while
the tipping point may not have been achieved, BCOs efforts for ECM have contributed in multiple ways
to the process of change. Focused efforts, as seen through this evaluation, have achieved significant
positive results, that have sustainability built in their design and immense scope for scale up. However,
behaviour change and transformation of harmful gendered and social structures requires consistent
engagement at all levels for longer than the duration of a single programme.
Addressing long-term social norms and behaviour change around gender norms and transforming
patriarchal and conservative systems that perpetuate gender inequalities requires consistent
engagement with all key stakeholders, including men and boys.295 BCO programme efforts have
significantly included a strong focus on investing in masculinities, through engagement with religious
leaders, C4D communication and community-based strategies and interventions. A communications
campaign focused on boys and men as fathers and grooms, fostering positive attitudes amongst boys
around masculinities through Adolescent Clubs and the Generation Breakthrough project have been
recorded as successful interventions that propagated and advocated for the transformation of gender
norms and systems that drive it.296 However, while funds have been utilised to engage with boys in
terms of health interventions, a limited number of boys have been found to regularly utilise available
services, suggesting that the country is not entirely ready for gender transformation model, rather it is
in a gender-responsive stage.297 Therefore, while interventions of the BCO have shown a focus on men
and boys, it is crucial for future programming to consistently reinforce this approach, and ensure
comprehensive engagement to overhaul traditional concepts of masculinity and encourage and
promote equity at the household and community level.298
Additionally, under the ambit of Water Sanitation and Hygiene focused interventions, UNICEF has been
working with the government to construct sanitation facilities in schools, however, maintenance of the
same has emerged as a challenge. Further, supported has also been provided to the Directorate of
Primary Education (DPE) in preparing Operations and Maintenance guidelines for Water Sanitation and
Hygiene facilities. Currently it is under review with the Director General, DPE for final approval to go for
printing. Stakeholder interactions suggest that unless the governmental system has the capacity and
willingness to carry forth interventions and benefits, sustainability and scale-up is difficult to achieve.299

Behaviour change in order to achieve the tipping point is an intricate process that needs focused
investment, in terms of the messaging being delivered, and the creation of access to services in a
protective and dignified environment.300
Therefore, while the evaluation notes that BCO’s ECM efforts have laid down the groundwork and
established a starting point for transformative results and towards the achievement of the tipping point,
significant and continued investment and support is essential to achieve desired results and secure the
tipping point where transformative results and gains are embedded and self-sustained at all levels.

Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
Chapter 4: Conclusions and lessons learnt
The urgency to end child marriage in Bangladesh is recognised by all. There is political will and keen
involvement of civil society organisations to address the issue. BCO ECM efforts and the GPECM – the
joint programme of UNICEF and UNPFA – have made some significant inroads in propelling collective
efforts to meet the stated national targets. The achievements, gaps and challenges have been
discussed in the previous sections of the report. In this section the evaluation team takes an overview
of the ECM efforts and draws conclusion on each of the objectives of the study. The same has been
mentioned in parenthesis. Being a third-party, we also share our views of the direction that the
programmes need to take in future through an objective analysis. The feedback shared is on the basis
of insights gained through review of documents and interactions with the respondents.
Conclusions
Relevance
4.1 The ECM programme in Bangladesh was guided by GPECM and CPD 2017-2020. This limited
its work at the household level although it was identified as an area of intervention in the ECM
strategy note developed by the BCO (Objective 1)
BCO has a strategy note on ECM that provided a well-articulated view of the causal factors, strategies
to address the problem. However, the actual interventions were guided by the CPD 2017-2020
(Outcome 3) and the Theory of Change formulated by GPECM. There was synergy between the BCO
ECM Strategy Note and the TOC (GPECM) except that it took a more lenient view of focusing on gender
discrimination instead of gender-based violence. It also aimed to work towards getting families to
provide space to girls in decision making. In effect this would mean designing interventions to do more
in-depth work at the household level.
The other guiding document for ECM was Outcome 3 of the CPD which took a broader view of designing
interventions for adolescent empowerment. There was no explicit focus on ECM, but the assumption
was that this multiprong approach – involving different units of UNICEF - would be able to deal with the
complex problem of child marriage. The funds made available through the GPECM programme were
aligned to Outcome 3. In addition, it also provided the opportunity to BCO demonstrate some
interventions that could have greater impact. While this worked well for most strategies, interventions
were not designed at the household level. At best these were designed at the community level.
4.2 Three approaches were used to develop the ECM programme. With each of these approaches
separately had its advantages as well as limitations, together these complemented each other
to help in better design (Objective 2)
As stated, there is recognition that ECM is an important issue to be addressed by all stakeholders.
Everyone wants to see that Bangladesh does not remain among the top ten countries where early
childhood marriage is still exists. It has been a priority area for UNICEF. Specific to the evaluation
period, three approaches were followed by UNICEF to strengthen their work: the lifecycle and multi
sectoral approaches that were aligned to the CPD and the area-based approach was largely propelled
by the GPECM programme. All three approaches have been useful in building understanding on the
issue. While there are advantages in following each of these approaches, each approach also has its
limitations:
• Multi sectoral approach – There is convergence of different units at the CP level to achieve all the
outcomes. Interventions by all units to deal with the problem of ECM are part of Outcome 3. There
is an existing mechanism within UNICEF to distil relevant information and monitor its outreach. In
the case of the GPECM, like other donor supported projects, it is not an explicit part of the Country
results-based framework. There is a different mechanism to track progress and report for donor
Page | 97 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
supported projects which have limited duration. In such projects it is a challenge to bring about
convergence across different units on one particular issue. There is a possibility of the focus getting
lost while implementing sector specific programmes which may have other priorities and geographic
areas where there are ongoing programmes.
• Life cycle approach is very useful because to deal with such an issue which is deep rooted, requires
long term work with a number of people. However, in order to see the impact of these programmes
these need to be implemented over a long period of time. It is difficult to see the impact of these
interventions which are of short duration. Projects following this approach may not last to see the
impact.
• Area based approach– It is easier to see the impact of interventions are confined to a geographic
area because effective monitoring can take place. However, it is not possible for any organisation
or even for a collective to cover the entire country. Besides, the UNICEF units may choose to work
in a different geographic area to support a project but may choose to discontinue their work after the
project duration is over.
Either of these approaches used in isolation may not have been as insightful as a combination of all
three. It helped to design the programme without much delay. The same approach may be adopted in
the next phase too where areas are selected on the basis of vulnerability and interventions may be multi
sectoral or seen from a life cycle lens.
4.3 The ECM programme provides some useful insights about working with the vulnerable
populations although it was carried out in limited areas. It identifies the need for providing social
protection to vulnerable families so that they do not get their daughters married out of distress
(Objective 4 and Objective 5)
Phase 1 of GPECM has helped to understand the efficacy of some interventions in addressing the issue
of child marriage. The programme was implemented in limited areas. In order to make an overall impact
at the country level, all vulnerable families need to be identified and given social protection. In addition
to CCTs there can be other ways to extend this protection. UNICEF is well positioned to help in
designing schemes/programmes in this regard for the government because of the work done with
adolescents in areas of education, health, child protection.
Effectiveness and Impact
4.4 Results against the strategies outlined in the Strategy Note on ECM and the results
framework and workplan of the GPECM are difficult to adequately quantify and monitor because
monitoring by BCO is being done for Outcome 3 (Objective 1)
The interventions planned and executed as part of both programmes were well designed and have
been useful in one way or the other. There has been merit in all activities carried out although the
interventions related to adolescent empowerment and community mobilisation appear to have made a
greater impact. This has come out clearly in the interactions with the respondents. It is, however, difficult
to quantify and monitor these because the existing monitoring systems within UNICEF do not leave
room for tracking progress of some interventions. As a result of which the impact of some of these
interventions cannot be gauged. Monitoring of Outcome 3 - which also included ECM but not in a
focussed manner – has been effective since the interventions and their impact get captured. However,
it does not specifically focus on ECM. Rather it provides insights about sectoral convergence towards
adolescent empowerment. Monitoring of interventions under GPECM has been in a form that is difficult
to analyse systematically.
4.5 Cross sectoral convergence and collaboration was there especially with the Education and
C4D related interventions (Objective 2)
Page | 98 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
The space to undertake cross sectoral planning to end child marriage was provided by the GPECM
programme. Each unit analysed the issue from their perspective and tried to address the problem
through their respective interventions. From the construction of toilets in schools to remove the barriers
related to basic services by Water Sanitation and Hygiene, to setting up adolescent friendly health
services by the health unit are all good examples of efforts to address the multi-faceted issue. Among
all sectors direct impact of education and C4D was most palpable especially the work done to form
adolescent clubs and effective C4D campaigns to create awareness. Child protection unit received
maximum support in terms of availability of resources which helped in deepening its work in this area.
Most significant one was the setting up of community-based child protection committees which can be
the backbone to put an end to the problem. There was little evidence of joint goals and the impact made.
4.6 National level advocacy has been very effective especially in the development of the National
Action Plan (Objective 6)
Development of NAP has been an achievement since it has been finalised through collective efforts.
UNICEF has been part of this effort. It is being viewed as a significant step forward. While the document
is good it is yet to be rolled out because costing for the proposed interventions has not yet taken place.
Efforts to convince the government to take appropriate steps need to continue.
4.7 Partnerships forged with stakeholders have been good, diverse and effective (Objective 7)
Several organisations had already been working on the issue of child marriage. The GPECM provided
another opportunity for different organisations to come together. Mapping their activities has been a
useful exercise and will help in getting a better understanding about the nature of interventions and
geographic presence. For instance, partnerships with platforms such as GNB and LCG WAGE have
proven to be highly effective on advancing and strengthening the agenda for ECM. If taken forward it
will help in minimizing duplication of work, forge collaborations based on areas of strength and presence
in the area. Disaster prone areas have been recognised as hotspots for early childhood marriage. It is
not possible for all organisations to be present there whereas some others have many years of
experience of work on this issue. Such partnerships will need to be strengthened in the coming years if
the target of reducing child marriages by more than one third is to be met. It is also a reality that each
organisation is bound by its own mandates. They will need to look beyond their own organisation.
4.8 Use of national policies and laws at the district and Upazilla level need to be strengthened
(Objective 8)
One of the strengths of the programme has been formulation of the NAP through collective efforts. The
LCG WAGE platform was also used effectively to involve civil society organisations. With regard to
translation of these policies at the district level, roles and responsibilities have been defined. MoWCA
is the nodal agency that takes the lead on ECM. It is working along with other Ministries to address the
problem holistically. While the interaction and partnership are strong at the national level, the same
cannot be said at the Upazilla level. In the absence of an on-ground cadre at the Upazilla level, there
are challenges in bringing convergence across different Departments at the sub-district level.
4.9 There is lack of sufficient and adequate evidence that ECM programme has adequately
addressed the causal factors (Objective 1)
Several examples have been given in the other sections of the report that show that the programme
has made successful attempts to develop some good replicable and scalable interventions. Adolescent
clubs and effective C4D programme are few examples. However, when one looks at the overall result
areas which BCO had planned to achieve, there is not sufficient evidence to prove that. The BCO ECM
Strategy Note has identified the following achievements it will contribute to by the end of 2018:
• In the target districts and City Corporations there should be a reduction in child marriage by at
least 30 percentage points for the under 18 age group.
Page | 99 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
• The country has endorsed a fully costed five-year National Action Plan to End Child Marriage.
• A nationwide communication for development (C4D) campaign against child marriage
comprising both media and on-ground community engagement initiatives is launched in
Bangladesh in 2016, bringing together key sectoral partners, NGOs, adolescents, young people
and women’s rights networks and academia to achieve behaviour and social norm change
• There is a positive shift in attitudes and practices around child marriage which includes both
condemnation and prevention of child marriages at the ward level in the UNICEF target
upazillas and city corporation
There is information available at the output level for some result areas. But there is no evidence that
the programme is reaching out to the disadvantaged communities because the data is not
disaggregated. Evidence for result area 4 should have been some KAP studies, but feedback has been
limited to baseline, midline and endline surveys.
4.10 Some strategies have been more effective than others in addressing the problem (Objective
1)
The five strategies adopted by UNICEF to plan for the ECM programme were all very well thought out.
A closer look at the impact made through the use of these strategies shows that some strategies have
been more effective than the others. For instance, a greater impact seems to have been made through
programmes related to community mobilisation and empowerment of adolescents. Work done with the
adolescents through the adolescent clubs and value addition done by UNICEF to make the clubs run
more effectively has been recognized. Similarly, UNICEF has contributed significantly in national
advocacy efforts especially in facilitating the development of NAP along with other organisations.
The same cannot be said about the livelihood options. Review of documents and interactions with the
stakeholders did not indicate that girls have improved their livelihood options by undergoing skill training
in a very significant way. Creation of livelihood options goes much beyond training. For the trainees,
especially girls, translating the skills acquired through training to generate an income would require
finding jobs or accessing funds to start businesses. Given the societal attitude towards them, they are
less likely to get support from their families. Unless the skill development and livelihood programmes
focus on those aspects, these interventions will not be very helpful to the girls. Yet addressing this issue
is important since poverty has been recognized as one of the drivers for early childhood marriage.
Efficiency and Cost effectiveness
4.11 There was greater cohesiveness in the programme especially the C4D interventions and
advocacy (Objective 2)
A number of examples were identified wherein partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA have resulted
in bringing in more efficiency in the implementation of the programme. Different efforts helped in more
effective advocacy and streamlining the C4D interventions which made the messaging more effective.
However, it was also realised that more resources would be required for taking the programme forward
and expanding it.
4.12 With respect to cost effectiveness of the programme, the highest allocation of funds has
been to education and child protection (Objective 9)
The programme has been successful in reaching out to more people and creating awareness through
effective media campaigns. Analysis of fund allocation shows that most funds were allocated to
implement education and child protection related interventions. Per beneficiary cost for the health sector
within UNICEF was found to be lower than that of other sectors. Since GPECM was a global programme
implemented in other countries too, when compared with the GPECM countries’ average, Bangladesh’s
Page | 100 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
cost per beneficiary is lower only for interventions related to only one outcome. For the other two
outcomes Bangladesh’s cost per beneficiary is higher than the GPECM countries’ average.
Sustainability
4.13 There is evidence of Gender equality on programmes and gender transformative results
especially in the adolescent clubs and community-based child protection committees (Objective
4 and Objective 5)
Both the GPECM and BCOs ECM efforts have planned interventions that are generating interest as
demonstrated by the baseline and end line surveys carried out. The reason for the success of these
interventions has been to carefully bring in changes to ensure gender equality while not losing focus on
the overall objective of reducing the number of child marriages. The decision to include 30 per cent
boys in adolescent clubs has been very helpful in sensitising boys who need to be involved. There are
indications from some of these clubs that there has been reduction in the number of cases of sexual
harassment towards girls where boys were part of the club. This demonstrates a change in mindset of
boys, which is so important for bringing about a sustainable change. Similarly having a diverse set of
people in the community-based child protection committees as influencers is likely to be more impactful
wherein the community takes the responsibility to stop early marriages. While law enforcement is
necessary, the real success would come if the problem is recognised and addressed by the community
itself. Both these programmes have shown that it is possible to do so.
4.14 Certain interventions can be scaled up further. Greater efforts would be required for
adequate capacity development at different levels in order to ensure sustainability of the
interventions (Objective 3)
Some interventions carried out as part of these programmes have already shown that these have the
potential to be scaled up. Adolescent clubs, for example, were replicated in seven districts in the year
2016 wherein 1500 adolescent clubs were formed. These can be further scaled up. Similarly, the value
of AFHS has been recognised from the response it is getting. However, in order to scale these up
greater efforts are needed to implement these effectively. For instance, in order to make the AFHS run
effectively the staff would need to be trained so that they are better equipped to deal with adolescents.
Similarly, while manuals have been prepared to guide the adolescent clubs, this would require training
of facilitators. This can be planned in a phased manner.
4.15 Impact of COVID-19 on Child Marriage has had an adverse impact on the campaign since
face- to face interactions are limited. UNICEF is making use of technology to bridge this gap
(Objective 11)
COVID-19 has certainly had an adverse impact not just in the execution of the programme but in
addressing the issue too. The planned activities had to be slowed down and some deferred. Rapid
analysis shows that there has been a rise in number of incidents of gender-based violence judging by
the rise in the number of calls to the helpline. Many showed inclinations of marrying their daughters to
address their heightened economic vulnerabilities arising due to loss of livelihoods. There is
apprehension among teachers that about 30 per cent girls may not return back to school, which will be
a huge setback to the campaign. UNICEF is making all out efforts to overcome the challenge. Since
face-to-face interactions are still not possible, digital platforms are being used to create awareness
about the pandemic and how to stay safe. Efforts have also been made to impart training to adolescents
on safety issues and in continuing to provide safe spaces to girls, should they face any incident of
violence against them.
Lessons learnt
UNICEF and UNFPA working together has enhanced ECM efforts
Page | 101 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
There is enough reason to believe that the partnership between UNICEF and UNFPA has worked well
for ECM efforts in Bangladesh. Both the organisations have their unique strengths which have
complemented each other and strengthened the voice of the United Nations on this issue. While
UNICEF has greater experience of working in sectors (Education, Social Protection and Health) and
C4D, UNFPA has done significant and more focussed work in areas like reproductive health and
gender. The joint knowledge pool can help in better planning of programmes related to adolescents and
finally that is what matters. With regard to this programme, the two organisations took care to carve out
their roles and responsibilities such that these did not overlap with each other. This partnership can be
further explored for other similar programmes since working with adolescents is a priority for both.
Incentives and conditional cash transfers seem to have worked well in some parts. This needs
to be examined more closely
Conditional cash transfers (CCT) to encourage girls to continue with their school education have worked
well in many countries. Even in Bangladesh, few respondents highlighted that it has worked well. In
particular, an example from Sylhet was given where a CCT initiative was taken along with the
government and the results were good. However, in line with the global guidelines wherein the focus of
UNICEF would be more towards social protection, this initiative was discontinued. This aspect needs
to be examined more closely through research and seen whether CCT is a significant factor in making
girls continue with their education. In case it is found to make a positive impact, a solution to this may
be found to provide incentives to girls, perhaps by helping the Government to design a suitable scheme.
The existing monitoring system within UNICEF is not designed to collect relevant data for ECM
UNICEF has a mechanism to collate information across different units to report against stated outcomes
through RAM. Therefore, information related to Outcome 3 is collected and its review gives a good
understanding of progress being made. While information related to Outcome 3 was readily available it
does not focus on ECM alone. Rather it focuses on overall adolescent empowerment. The GPECM
project has a separate process to gather information which is gathered by focal points in each unit by
the project lead. It is not part of the central monitoring system. This mismatch in monitoring programmes
makes collation of relevant data collection very challenging and there is likelihood of missing out of
information that may provide evidence for planning. While reporting maybe done for the donor, there is
a need to modify the existing system such that information related to programmes like ECM can be
accessed easily.

Chapter 5: Recommendations
The evaluation followed a systematic process of collecting relevant information through primary and
secondary research. The existing studies and data helped to understand the big picture. This was
validated by interacting with respondents at different levels including the leadership. The findings were
analysed, and certain key conclusions were drawn. Based on these conclusions, some
recommendations have been made with the aim to provide inputs for the next phase of this programme.
Draft recommendations were provided to both UNICEF on two occasions, and the ERG which allowed
for real-time and follow up documentation for refinement. Through these consultations, the
recommendations provided below have been further refined and prioritised for action. These
recommendations have also been categorised as medium and high priorities, with specific time frames
and addressees for each recommendation put forth.
Recommendation 1: UNICEF should work towards providing social protection to vulnerable
children and their families for overall poverty reduction, which is one of the main drivers for
early marriages
There is enough evidence to suggest that the problem of ECM is more pronounced in vulnerable
sections of Bangladesh. Girls are married off at an early age because of a variety of reasons of which
poverty stands out. There are various ways in which organisations have addressed this issue mostly
through short term support. It is increasingly being felt that a wider approach is required to pull the
families out of poverty. ADB301 recognises that investments in social protection help reduce poverty,
inequality, and vulnerability. As per the definition of UNICEF “Social protection covers the range of
policies and programmes needed to reduce the lifelong consequences of poverty and exclusion.”
Therefore, the focus of interventions in future should be to ensure that essential services are provided
to all vulnerable families to reduce inequality, poverty and vulnerability. This would require working
together with other organisations with similar mandate of poverty alleviation. With its experience of
working with children, UNICEF can contribute towards child protection which is one of the important
elements of social protection.

Recommendation 2: Vulnerability mapping needs to be more nuanced and evidence based
where factors other than incidence of child marriage should also be considered
Selection of geographies in the first phase of the ECM programme was based on two factors –
incidence of child marriage and presence of UNICEF and their partners. In the next phase, the scope
of vulnerability mapping should be increased by including other factors such as low level of education
301 ADB: Social Protection Operational Plan 2014-2020; December 2013
Page | 103 Final Evaluation Report:
Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards Ending Child Marriage in Bangladesh
(including drop outs and out of school children); economically disadvantaged population, incidence
of gender-based violence, disaster prone areas and other vulnerable sections such as migrants. This
will help in identifying other vulnerable pockets and interventions designed accordingly, especially
offering them social protection. Here one may add that the increase in vulnerabilities arising due to
climate change led disaster situations and pandemics like COVID-19 are raising new challenges
which need to be analysed more closely at the planning stage. Activity mapping of organisations
engaged in work related to ECM has provided useful information related to their focus areas and
geographic presence. GPECM, in its next phase should focus on developing a campaign along with
these organisations. Vulnerability mapping and sharing with partners and potential partners can help
them develop needs-based programmes aligned to their respective mandates.

Recommendation 3: UNICEF should limit the number of interventions it carries out to address
the issue of ECM
UNICEF had carried out a number of interventions in this phase, the impact of which is not very
visible for the project period. For instance, it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which Water
Sanitation and Hygiene related interventions have helped in reducing ECM. However, the impact the
programme has made by way of strengthening the adolescent clubs and carrying out C4D
interventions is discernible and better recognised. Research302 has shown that programmes with
fewer interventions reaches out to a larger population and shows better sustainability. Therefore,
UNICEF may consider focusing on fewer interventions where it has achieved better results and aim
at scaling up the pilots. Many areas such as AFHS – that provide safe places for adolescents - are
already being focussed under Outcome 3 activities. GPECM may support BCO in providing technical
support to other organisations to design and implement interventions in other geographic locations.
In doing so it may be noted that while UNICEF follows the adolescence age bracket of 10-19 years
as suggested by WHO, research303 shows that the period of early adolescence (ages 10-14 years)
which is very significant in imbibing gender norms is greatly overlooked. This aspect maybe
considered while designing interventions for adolescents.

Recommendation 4: There is a need for greater engagement and involvement with the
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Ministry of Social Welfare and Ministry of
Home Affairs to act on child marriage within their own sectors
It is not contested that a multidimensional approach to understanding, and addressing, child marriage
is needed in Bangladesh. Therefore, ensuring capacity building and costing of government action
plans and strategies that seek to end child marriage is not applicable only for the lead ministry, but
equally critical for related line ministries. UNICEF has been working primarily with MoWCA on the
issue of ECM. It may consider working more closely with other Ministries too which have a significant
role in formulating policies, enforcing law, offering schemes to the disadvantaged communities.
Greater engagement will also enable alignment with UNCIEF’s Child Protection Programme. The
role of different Ministries in addressing the issue has been clearly outlined in the National Action
Plan. Engaging with them by way of sharing of information, extending technical support whenever
required would help in more effective implementation of NAP. An area of support to the Ministries
would be to develop a robust monitoring system to assess progress of activities for which the
respective Ministries are responsible.

Recommendation 5: A better surveillance system and research to analyse the impact of
interventions is required
As mentioned previously, undertaking robust and accurate cost effectiveness analysis was
challenging (subsequently impacting impact analysis) due to how results and budget information are
recorded and managed in UNICEF reporting systems. There is a need to develop a more robust and
user-friendly system that is able to collate information related to an area effectively. It is also important
to collect disaggregated data for disadvantaged groups to analyse the impact on vulnerable groups.
It is also recommended that the GPECM, in the next phase carries out more social research in the
form of carrying out RCTs and KAP studies to have a better understanding of the ground level
situation. This will help in more effective planning too. Investing in and planning such an approach is
crucial to address issues like ECM that are cross-cutting across outcomes and outputs.

As shared in the earlier sections converting skill training into livelihood option is a complex process.
It involves identification of target groups, appropriate skills suited to their aptitude and market
demands, access to funds if they wish to be self-employed or find jobs. Challenges in implementing
livelihood programmes have been discussed in the section on Effectiveness. There are organisations
which have significant experience in this area and can be more effective in implementing
programmes related to skill development. UNICEF can extend technical support to identify vulnerable
adolescents and develop programme for soft skill training.

Both organisations may consider continuing with this partnership
The study has highlighted that partnership with UNFPA on the GPECM programme has been very
useful with both organisations complementing each other’s work. Both organisations have their core
areas of strengths which would help in strengthening the overall approach to address the issue of
child marriage and also making optimum use of resources by having a repository of tools and
resource material.

Recommendation 8: Capacity development of officials at district and Upazilla level would be
a key factor to the success of the ECM programme. UNICEF may focus more on this aspect
in the next phase of the programme
Our research shows that wherever the Child Welfare Committees and Community Based Child
Protection Committees were well informed and active, it contributed to creation of a supportive
environment to combat child marriages and it was easier to monitor the impact. However, it was found
that the level of awareness and capacity to execute programmes effectively was not uniform in all
upazillas. Leadership provided by the BCO was extremely important in this regard. Therefore,
UNICEF may collaborate with local government representatives across all departments to undertake
capacity development programmes at this level.

Accountability
27. Complete the evaluation deliverables within the timeframe and budget agreed
28. Give notice and record any change to the evaluation plan or any risks to the successful completion of the evaluation
Ethical considerations for respondents
• Code of ethics: The team has developed a code of ethics based upon the understanding of the UNEG code of conduct for evaluator’s (2008) which its
team members are expected to follow while carrying out field-based data collection. In order to ensure that the team members adhere to the Code of Ethics,
they were constantly monitored by senior resources and experts from Ernst and Young LLP India. Aspects such as consent, confidentiality, sensitivity of
questions, comfort of the respondents and equity were kept in mind while developing research tools and were strengthened on the basis of the pilot- testing
results.
• Training of team members: The code of ethics were explained to the researchers through a dedicated session nested under the ‘field orientation’
workshop. This ensured that the profile, competencies and skills of the team members are of a standard that prevents harm to respondents, both through
acts of commission or omission.
• Consultation with government stakeholders and UNICEF Bangladesh: The approach and methodology to carry out the evaluation, the key research
questions, the data/information collection instruments, profiles of the team members and consent forms are finalised in consultation with UNICEF and key
Government stakeholders. Further, data was collected after informing the Upazilla level officials, caregivers/parents and adolescents about the evaluation
objectives.
• Human rights and gender equality: The evaluation team proposed is gender-balanced and female researchers are entrusted with the responsibility of
interacting with female respondents. Further, the data collection tools to be used to conduct interviews to collect quantitative and qualitative data/information
will allow for gender disaggregated analysis and the same is expected to reflect throughout the report. Overall efforts were undertaken to ensure inclusion
of more females, differently abled and respondents from marginalised population.
• Consent form: Most importantly, interviews were conducted after receiving formal (verbal consent will be sought for telecommunication-based interactions)
consent from the respondents. The team drafted a consent form which required them to explain the evaluation objectives and nature of questions to the
respondents. Further, the researchers are required to explain to the respondents that they could choose not to respond to a question that made them
uncomfortable and could refuse to continue to participate at any point. This helped to ensure the autonomy of the respondents and recognise their capability
for self-legislation, ability to make judgments, to state their opinions and to make choices.

ToR Field Team for Evaluation of UNICEF Bangladesh’s work on Accelerating Action to End
Child Marriage in Bangladesh, May 2020
Purpose of the field team:
UNICEF Bangladesh is undertaking an “Evaluation of UNICEF’s work for Accelerating Action towards
Ending Child Marriage”. The evaluation aims to assess the progress made and achievements of results
of Ending Child Marriage programmes in Bangladesh, and the effectiveness of the joint interventions
by UNFPA- UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage (GPECM).
Additionally, the assignment aims to identify opportunities and barriers to the implementation of cross
sectoral evidence-based intervention strategies, identify good practices of convergence among sectors
and lessons learnt from the first Phase of the GPECM. Against this background, the evaluation team
comprises of technical and functional experts with experience in undertaking the requisite field level
interactions in Bangladesh with identified stakeholders. Additionally, field team consists of members
who understand the local language to streamline interactions, especially at the division level. Field team
members will play an instrumental role in the primary data collection phase as the findings from this
phase will drive the narrative of the evaluation.
Time frame of the study: April 2021-May 2021
Role of field team:
• Familiarise themselves with programme context, evaluation purpose, and objectives
• Contribute to the main evaluation design including inputs on evaluation methodology, identify
critical evaluation questions that align with the programme and objectives, identify outcome
indicators, data sources needed, and plan the timeline for field data collection
• Review survey instruments and translate them to local language
• Coordinate with programme implementation partners and be involved in route mapping for field
data collection. Overall field team members have to be heavily involved in strategically planning
all travel logistics
• Attend workshop in Dhaka, Bangladesh, led by team leader and senior thematic expert. Field
team members need to ensure they are well equipped with necessary equipment and materials
needed for travels and data collection (consent form copies, notepads, identification cards, if
any, etc)
• Travel to respective field destinations and undertake primary data collection, aligned to all
protocols agreed upon
• Prepare field notes based on interactions and attend field debrief meeting to address the same
• Some members of the field team will additionally be involved in the report writing phase of the
evaluation
• Field team members to validate report findings in the compiled draft report before submission
• The field team will ensure all necessary safety precautions are adopted including the use of
PPE kits and general safeguarding practices to ensure safety of both enumerators and
participants
Field team members:
• Dr Niraj Seth, Team Leader
• Rashida Parveen, Senior Thematic Expert
• Swandipta Sadique, Local Expert
• Junty Sharma Pathak, Execution Team Lead and Qualitative Research Expert
• Jija Dutt, Qualitative Research Expert

Please note: The report retains the original ToR that was developed for field team members,
however, given the COVID-19 situation and as elaborated in the report, the field team comprised
of local consultants in Bangladesh. The core team members from India were leading
consultations through e-communication means. Further, with finalisation of the methodology
COVID – 19 related precautions, safety measures and other field work related considerations
will be adequately included in this ToR to ensure safety of both facilitators and respondents.

Losing her father at the age of 12, Kabita and her mother were left completely on their own. Enrolled
in the local government primary school, Kavita was only able to complete her education till grade 5
and her mother had to take on work as a domestic helper to make ends meet. Kabita resides in
Beguntila slum under Mirpur Thana of Dhaka North City Corporation.
At the age of 17, Kabita joined the Beguntila Adolescent Club and was able to partake in all trainings
and empowerment sessions of BCO ECM programming. She proudly states “The ECM programme
has changed my life completely. I have learned many things from this program which made me
empowered to a great extent. I am capable enough to stop child marriage within my community. I
know where I should go, whom I should call to stop child marriage. I can talk about physical and
mental changes during adolescence period with boys and my family members. I know adolescents
should not feel shy to share this information with others. All these things were possible because of
my involvement with adolescent club.”
Kabita has been actively working to change the mind-set of her community regarding child marriage,
gender discrimination, adolescent friendly health services etc. Besides, she is also supporting out
of school adolescent girls to access technical and vocational education. She also works to protect
children and adolescents from child labour and all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation

From Rebel to Revolutionary
As a member of an Adolescent Club in Lalmohon Sadar Upazilla of Bhola district, eighteen year old
Rozina*, was able to build her capacity and gain awareness on the rights of adolescents and the
negative consequences of child marriage. As a result of this learning and opportunity, on being forced
into marriage by her family, she was able to fight back and successfully delayed her age of marriage.
Currently, she is studying in a local college with dreams of a better future.
She says, “I was treated as a “bad girl” by my family and community members when I joined the
adolescent club and started speaking against child marriage. I used to share information on menstrual
health and hygiene with my friends and other girls and advised them to use sanitary napkin during
their period. That is why many people thought that I am a bad girl. I talked about things which I was
not supposed to talk as per the traditional social norms and thus I am spoiling other girls. But I did not
care and kept going.”
Rozina has also supported a number of adolescent girls to continue their education and delay their
age of marriage. To prevent poor children from dropping out of schools, she also advocated with
teachers for the waiver of tuition/exam fees. In her words, “I feel proud that almost all the people in my
community know me as a fighter against child marriage. All the government officials at the Upazilla
level know me personally. You go and ask. You will find everybody recognize me for my contribution
to end child marriage. This was possible because of this ECM program.”
