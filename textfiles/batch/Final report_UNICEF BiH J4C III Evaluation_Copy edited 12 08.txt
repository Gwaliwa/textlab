Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of the evaluation of phase III of UNICEF’s Justice for Every
Child project (May 2018–November 2021). The evaluation covers the period May 2018 to
December 2020. With regard to assessing ownership by relevant institutions and
sustainability, as well as impact, a broader focus was taken into account as all key
stakeholders, including governmental partners, donors, and UNICEF itself, have invested in
support to justice for children throughout the three phases of the project, for nearly 10 years.
Overview of the project
Phase III of the Justice for Every Child project (2018–2021) is a continuation of UNICEF's
engagement to improve justice for children in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and builds on
the results and lessons learned gained through implementation of the first two phases of the
project (phase I from 2010 to 2013, and phase II from 2014 to 2017). The overall goal of the
project is that children in justice processes and children at risk are dealt with in compliance
with international standards on justice for children, and that decisions are taken in their best
interests. The specific focus of the interventions evolved with different phases of the project
from the introduction of the relevant legislation and establishment of the juvenile justice
system in the first phase of the project, to supporting implementation of the laws, promoting
support to victims and witnesses, and exploring the secondary prevention models in the
second phase, to focusing on continued support for full implementation of laws, further
capacity-building, and supporting the development and implementation of secondary
prevention programmes during the third phase of the project.
Purpose of the evaluation
The purpose of the evaluation, while taking into consideration social inclusion, gender,
or/and human rights were to:
• Provide evidence of the extent to which interventions in the third phase of the project
contributed to achievement of results, through the lens of relevance, effectiveness,
efficiency, sustainability and impact, and identify if there were any unintended project
results; and
• Identify gaps, lessons learned and provide feasible recommendations for exit
strategies or areas where interventions may still be warranted, for example
continuous capacity-building of justice for children (J4C) professionals,
implementation and countrywide roll-out of diversion/alternative measures and the
secondary prevention programmes.
Expected users and intended use
The primary intended users of this evaluation are UNICEF and the project staff, the Project
Coordination Board, and donors. In addition, the results of the evaluation will be shared and
used for policy dialogue and advocacy – in line with the Project Exit Strategy and Advocacy
Plan. This means that secondary users will be the relevant entity, cantonal, municipal
authorities and relevant institutions, as well as wider stakeholders in the area of child
protection/justice for children including civil society organizations (CSOs).

Evaluation methodology
The evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR) proposed seven key evaluation questions (EQs),
focusing on the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria of relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and synergies and coherence. Additional questions
relating to the cross-cutting issues of gender and social inclusion and the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic were also included. The evaluation matrix was developed around the
evaluation questions and criteria to map out the data sources, methods and analysis
approach. The evaluation was criteria-based, as this was the final phase of project support.
The primary evaluation methods included wide-ranging document review and analysis of
administrative data, key informant interviews (KIIs) with UNICEF and stakeholders, a series
of focus group discussions (FGDs) with stakeholders, partners and beneficiaries, as well as
a qualitative online survey. The data collection processes employed by the evaluation team
reached a total of 136 stakeholders and beneficiaries, through 31 KIIs, 6 thematic FGDs and
57 responses to the online survey.
Findings
Project Relevance
The project was relevant to the needs of children in accessing justice and was fully aligned
with UNICEF’s Country Programme 2015–2019 (extended to 2020), as well as the strategic
priorities of the project’s donors. Further, it is aligned with the overall Reform Agenda of BiH
and its Justice Sector Strategy, as well as contributing to BiH’s commitments to the 2030
Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The design of phase III of the
Justice for Every Child project was evidence-based and informed by extensive research,
analyses and data; however, there is less evidence that it fully captured the voice of children
in BiH, although views of children obtained in previous phases of the project were taken into
account. The project design contributed to its theory of change and no major programmatic
adjustments were made during the lifespan of the project, beyond adaptations to the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Project Efficiency
The project implemented a number of strategies to achieve efficiency gains that, when
analysed against its results, provided a good value for money coefficient. The project was
able to maximize partnerships with relevant entity and district levels, as well as cantonal and
municipal stakeholders. This included relevant entity and cantonal ministries, Centres for
Social Work (CSW), Centres for the Protection of Mental Health (CMH), courts, prosecutor’s
offices, academia and civil society. At the state level, the project engaged with the BiH
Ministry of Justice, the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council and the Institution of Human
Rights Ombudsman.
Project Effectiveness
The project has achieved tangible and quantifiable results, which have strengthened the
justice and social welfare systems and made them more adaptable and responsible to the
rights and needs of children participating in justice processes. Results have contributed to
the empowerment of children through prevention programmes, legal support and information
to enable them to access justice. Continued efforts are required to fully embed some of the
project results into the system and to ensure their financial sustainability.
7
The project generated important, relevant and effective results that contributed to the
achievement of the project’s overall objective, namely that children in justice processes are
dealt with in compliance with international standards on justice for children and that
decisions are taken in their best interests. However, these objectives have not yet been fully
realized and there is a need for greater budgetary allocation for justice for children,
leadership by relevant authorities and the potential introduction of stronger accountability
mechanisms to respond to gaps in implementation of the relevant laws.
Project Impact
It is indisputable that the project has had a large impact in improving the position of children
within the justice system and fundamentally changed the approach to children involved with
the system. It has brought the issue of children at risk and children in contact with the law to
the awareness of the relevant authorities; it has strengthened the legislative and policy
framework for children; it has improved their access to justice; it has created strong
multisectoral coordination; and it has embedded the “best interests of the child” principle into
the system.
Project Sustainability
Sustainability
The project results achieved sustainability in terms of promoting greater local ownership and
a change in attitudes towards children in contact with the law and children at risk. The results
of the project that have been integrated into the legislative framework or official procedures
are likely to continue in the long term and there is great scope for harmonizing the
approaches by promoting learning and exchanges of good practices and scaling them up
across BiH. Future sustainability will require additional efforts to integrate Justice for
Children (J4C) into ongoing reform efforts and funding opportunities, including the European
Union (EU) reform agenda.
Ownership
The project activities and results were focused on building the system and this has
encouraged a strong sense of ownership, which was in part promoted by the Project
Coordination Board. There is scope to further strengthen the ownership of local, cantonal,
district and entity processes.
Scalability
There is good scope for scaling up the Secondary Prevention Programme based on lessons
learned and best practices gathered during J4C Phase III. Similarly, there is good scope for
scaling up the good practices from one region to another to promote the use of diversion and
alternative measures,1 as well as of expert associates.
1 For the purposes of this report the diversion and alternative measures cover the continuum of measures aimed
at diverting children in conflict with the law away from formal judicial proceedings towards an alternative way of
resolving the offence, including by involving non-judicial bodies, up to promoting alternatives to detention in cases
where the formal judicial proceeding has taken place. Diversion and alternative measures are defined and
foreseen by the Laws on Protection and Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings.
8
Coherence
UNICEF has made positive steps in terms of leveraging contributions and catalyzing joint
work with the EU, and the two organizations are key allies with regards to policy dialogue
and advocacy efforts.
While there may have been a lack of opportunities to maximize resource potential and
strengthen complementarities with other UN agencies, UNICEF should continue to seek out
such opportunities where possible.
Cross-cutting Issues
The project successfully adopted a human rights-based approach (HRBA) in both its design
and in its implementation, working on both the supply and demand sides of development
programming. However, while the project does include some gender disaggregated data,
gender and social inclusion were not its primary focus.
UNICEF was able to respond swiftly to the COVID-19 context through amending certain
project activities and adjusting its implementation approach. All partners were satisfied with
the speed and manner with which UNICEF reacted to adapt the programmes to the
pandemic and address the newly emerging priority. However, while recognizing the
challenges of moving to online delivery of training and other project activities during COVID-
19, further opportunities could have been explored to promote the greater use of online
delivery of training and other project activities, such as through social media and other
modern technologies.
Conclusions
The evaluation findings show that UNICEF has successfully implemented three phases of
the Justice for Children project in BiH over a ten-year period, achieving meaningful and
quantifiable results. UNICEF has built and maintained close working relationships with its
key stakeholders, which has the effect of building trust through continually demonstrating
that UNICEF is a reliable and active partner. While it has positioned itself as an integrator,
coordination without UNICEF remains a key challenge and the overall fragmentation of the
operating environment represents a sizeable constraint.
Relevance
UNICEF positioned itself as the lead actor addressing issues pertaining to access to justice
for children in BiH. The J4EC project was relevant not only to UNICEF’s own strategic
priorities but, more importantly, to those of BiH and its entities and districts, and those of its
donors and development partners. The project design was evidence-based and informed by
extensive stakeholder consultations, although additional capturing of the voices of children
could have further strengthened the design and implementation.
Efficiency
The J4C project provided good value for money, with results being achieved beyond the sum
of the component parts. Cost efficiencies were achieved through a lean staffing structure
and utilizing to the greatest extent local or in-house expertise. Strong partnerships were
created with relevant stakeholders and the use of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and civil society organizations (CSOs) to support project implementation was not only cost-
effective but also had the knock-on effect of strengthening the relationship between
governmental institutions and civil society. Good examples are the referral mechanism
9
utilized in Republika Srpska as part of the school-based secondary prevention programme or
the implementation of community-based diversionary measures. The project had a
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework that was very much tied to the programmatic
M&E structures and the indicators used were purely quantitative and therefore not sufficient
to fully capture the project’s progress and results. A greater use of qualitative indicators that
measure perceptions and behaviour at the outcome level would better capture project
progress and results, as well as contributions towards outcomes and impact.
Effectiveness
The project has achieved tangible and measurable results contributing towards ensuring that
children in justice processes are dealt with in compliance with international standards on
justice for children, and that decisions are taken in their best interests. However, the project
was hampered to some extent by the complexities of the context within which it was
operational and fragmentation of the system across state, entity, district and cantonal lines.
This meant that UNICEF had to localize and tailor each of its interventions at the local level
which, while leading to measurable results, has meant that children throughout BiH do not
have access to the same level of support services. It is the evaluation team’s assessment
that without this level of localization and contextualized initiatives, progress and results
would have been less satisfactory. The lack of a fully harmonized approach and overall
fragmentation affects equal access to justice, as a result of which some of the interventions
and results were uneven.
Impact
The project has had a broad ranging impact in improving the position of children within the
justice system in BiH. Through integration of the best interests of the child principle, the
project has contributed towards completely changing the approach towards children in the
justice system. The principle is has been integrated into the normative framework through
legislative and policy reforms, as well as into service provision from a wide range of
stakeholders including courts and prosecutors’ offices, Centres for Social Welfare, Centres
for Mental Health, schools, free legal aid providers and NGOs/CSOs. While some activities
and results would have been achieved without UNICEF’s support, it is certain that results
would not have been achieved to such an extent, nor as quickly.
Sustainability
The project has had key successes with regard to ensuring sustainability of results after the
end of the project. In particular, those aspects which have been included in the legislative
and policy framework, official procedures of schools’ programmes, and will be budgeted for,
are likely to continue.
The biggest constraints to sustainability are the availability of funding and the absence of
sufficient political backstopping at the highest levels, to ensure that children’s access to
justice remains a key priority in the future. There are concerns among stakeholders that
once the project comes to an end, there will be a lack of supervision and quality control over
the process, as well as a lack of accountability, which may lead to previous results
regressing.
10
UNICEF was recognized as the lead coordinator in terms of access to justice for children in
BiH and among all the stakeholders had a niche role as integrator. While one of the biggest
impacts the project has had is in terms of developing multi-stakeholder coordination among
all relevant actors, this will remain a critical challenge going forward, particularly in the
foreseeable vacuum at the project’s end. This might be addressed by exploring opportunities
for the continued functioning and transformation of the Project Implementation Board into a
J4C, or broader, coordination body. This could provide an effective avenue for advocacy and
coordination and provide the drive for greater sustainability of results.
There is a strong sense of ownership among stakeholders with regard to the project’s
interventions, but UNICEF also played an important role in the overall reform of justice for
children in BiH and was often perceived as primary owner of the process. In this sense,
there is still scope for strengthening ownership.
Coherence
The key stakeholder in BiH in terms of development remains the European Union. UNICEF
established a strong working partnership with the EU, including a coordinated engagement
strategy and synergies across specific interventions. However, UNICEF could have
leveraged even more in terms of its partnership with the EU to move forward on certain
interventions and to coordinate further on policy dialogue and advocacy issues, such as
inclusion of J4C activities in the EU assistance available through the Instrument for Pre-
accession (IPA). Justice for children and access to justice, for example, could be ensured as
a rule of law priority by becoming an integral component of BiH's reform agenda for EU
accession.
During the third phase of the project implementation, there was limited scope for
strengthening collaboration with other UN Agencies, including UNDP. Opportunities for
collaboration should continuously be explored in the future to promote joint objectives and
coherence more efficiently.
Cross-cutting issues
Human rights-based approach (HRBA) and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI)
By adopting a human rights-based approach in the project’s design and implementation, it
was possible to address issues on both sides of the development equation. This provided an
opportunity to strengthen the normative framework and capacities of relevant institutions to
implement the Law and provide quality services, to better informed and aware children. A
stronger gender and social inclusion analysis and overall focus would have allowed a
stronger response to GESI issues, and additional efforts in capturing the voice of children
could have improved results.
COVID-19 response
UNICEF’s swift response and timely and appropriate adaptation of project activities provided
for its successful transition at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. By keeping children
in the centre of BiH’s response to COVID-19, it was possible to adjust the project and
continue with implementation of its activities. Despite this, COVID-19 has affected some
project activities and caused certain delays. Additional technical support to project partners
and recipients could potentially have allowed the transition of a greater number of capacity-
building programmes and awareness-raising activities to an online format, including by
11
utilizing social media and modern technologies such as podcasts, online forums and
chatrooms.
Lessons Learned
Lesson Learned 1: UNICEF’s name carried weight and it is recognized countrywide for its
technical expertise, its coordination role, and the major contribution it has made in the reform
processes of the justice system for children. Lessons learned show that care should always
be taken to ensure this does not impact on ownership by governmental institutions of the
processes and achievements, particularly with regard to budgeting and coordination.
Lesson Learned 2: In an institutionally and legislatively fragmented context such as BiH, it
is crucial to tailor each intervention to the specific local context to achieve results and
promote the sense of ownership, even though consistent harmonization of law, policies and
practices may not be achieved. However, peer-to-peer exchanges, multi-stakeholder
education programmes and coordination meetings can further promote harmonization.
Lesson Learned 3: The success of a wide-ranging and encompassing reform process
requires a strong Project Coordination Board with high-level membership and countrywide
representation to promote coordination, including between different sectors, and
harmonization of efforts towards justice for children across BiH. It is therefore important for
the Board members to have a full understanding of their role and of the follow-up expected,
including in planning and budgeting, to promote the results.
Lesson Learned 4: Without multisectoral coordination, the project would not have
succeeded in several important areas: achieving a high level of support for children
encountering the justice system in different ways, as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders;
introducing a holistic approach to ensuring their rights and identifying and supporting
children at risk; and promoting a better understanding of the roles of different sectors in
supporting children.
Lesson Learned 5: The success of interventions that require involvement and coordination
of different stakeholders, such as the implementation of diversion and alternative measures
or secondary prevention programmes, depends on sufficient capacities and involvement of
all relevant stakeholders. The project correctly recognized the need for strengthening the
social protection system for effective results in justice for children.
Lesson Learned 6: Effective implementation of the project, particularly for some diversion
measures, required bridging the gap between governmental representatives and civil society
organizations and creating the space for their effective cooperation.
Lesson Learned 7: It takes time to change mindsets when new policies and practices are
introduced, as seen from the differences in the adoption of diversion measures foreseen by
the Law by police and prosecutor’s offices. Changing mindsets requires multiple approaches
including continuous education programmes, coordination and peer-to-peer exchanges, and
accountability tools, as well as high-level ownership, instruction, promotion and lobbying by
relevant stakeholders, and public campaigning.
Lesson Learned 8: Elementary schools were shown to be highly successful in running
secondary prevention programmes, including through identifying and responding to children
at risk. With the exception of some secondary schools, the programmes were
enthusiastically accepted. Successful secondary prevention programmes can lead to
12
improved multisectoral cooperation, awareness-raising about the needs of children at risk
and the development of referral mechanisms.
Lesson Learned 9: The introduction of mandatory training and certification for professionals
working with children led to great progress in awareness-raising for child rights but this
requires sustainable access to continuous training and education programmes to make sure
that there is a sufficient number of certified professionals to cover the turnover of staff.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1: UNICEF’s role in improving access to justice for children in BiH should
shift from being responsible for project implementation to more of a monitoring, oversight,
technical support and advocacy role.
Recommendation 2: Coordination with the EU and other UN agencies should be capitalized
on going forward, especially after the end of the project, to ensure both reinforcement of the
results achieved to date, and continued improvements in access to justice for children in
BiH.
Recommendation 3: UNICEF should continue to advocate for adequate budgets to support
key project results. J4C activities and the strengthening of social and child protection
services should be included in the EU Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance to ensure
that project results are not jeopardized and remain sustainable.
Recommendation 4: UNICEF should prioritize any available funds and fundraising to
further embed project results in the system, contributing to greater ownership and
sustainability.
Recommendation 5: UNICEF should consider addressing the challenges for children in civil
and administrative proceedings.
Recommendation 6: Bearing in mind the objectives of the UNICEF Gender Action Plan, it is
recommended to undertake a gender analysis at the beginning of the planning process for
future projects and ensure monitoring of the implementation and results also from the gender
perspective. This will help to identify the specific needs of girls and boys, women and men,
as well as differences in access to information, resources and circumstances, and will assist
in planning of activities based on findings.
Priority recommendation addressed to the relevant authorities in BiH: The models of
service provision developed through the project, including specialized staff in police, courts
and prosecutor’s offices, the establishment and use of child-friendly rooms, models for
implementation of diversion and alternative measures, availability of free legal aid for
children, secondary prevention models, and ongoing capacity-building should be urgently
addressed and supported by adequate budgets to ensure their sustainability. Relevant local
authorities should take responsibility to organize peer-to-peer exchanges, multi-stakeholder
education programmes and coordination meetings, to further promote harmonization of
project results.
Priority recommendation addressed to donors: In order to further consolidate the results
of the project and to strengthen their sustainability, donors should consider allocating any
13
available funds to the priority areas identified in this evaluation. In addition, the donors
should support UNICEF in its advocacy and policy dialogue efforts with the EU and with the
relevant institutions, to fully finance and embed project activities and results in the system.2
2 Note that the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation communicated in 2017 that funds
would not be available beyond the current phase.

1. Introduction
This evaluation report has been prepared by IOD PARC, a UK-based company specializing
in results-based performance assessment in international development. The purpose of this
independent evaluation is to assess the third phase of UNICEF Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
(BiH) Justice for Every Child (J4EC) project (2018–2021) as the project comes to a close in
April 2021, with a requested extension until November 2021. The evaluation took place
between December 2020 and May 2021.
1.1 Purpose, Objectives and Scope of the Evaluation
As set out in the Terms of Reference (ToR), the main purpose of the final evaluation is: “to
review and assess the relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact of the
third phase of the Project [with] a particular focus placed on assessing ownership by the
relevant institutions and sustainability of programmes/activities/interventions put in place
during the implementation of phases I-III of the Project.”
As defined by UNICEF in the ToR, the objectives of the evaluation, while taking into
consideration social inclusion, gender, or/and human rights were to:
• Provide evidence of the extent to which interventions in the third phase of the project,
which are the object of this evaluation, contributed to achievement of results, through
the lens of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability and impact, and identify
if there were any unintended project results.
• Identify gaps, lessons learned and provide feasible recommendations aimed for exit
strategies or areas where interventions may still be warranted, e.g. continuous
capacity-building of justice for children professionals, implementation and
countrywide roll-out of diversion/alternative measures and the secondary prevention
programme.
1.1.1 Evaluation scope
The evaluation covers the period May 2018 to December 2020, meaning the third phase of
the project. With regard to assessing ownership by relevant institutions and sustainability, as
well as impact, a broader focus was taken into account as all key stakeholders, including
partners of governmental institutions, donors and UNICEF itself, have invested in support to
justice for children throughout the three phases of the project for nearly 10 years.
The scope focuses on the two project objectives and their 10 associated outputs. See
Section 1.4 below which describes the project in more detail.
While the project has a countrywide focus due to its overall aim of strengthening justice for
children and social welfare systems, certain components have been implemented in specific
locations. For example, the school-based secondary prevention programme has been
implemented in the entire Republika Srpska, Tuzla and Sarajevo Cantons in the Federation
of BiH, with foreseen roll-out in Una-Sana and Canton 10; municipal justice for children
action plans have been implemented in 17 project locations. Thus, the evaluation has
assessed all project interventions and their outcomes at entity and district levels, including
15
local-level interventions that took place in 17 locations (covering 29 municipalities/cantons/
districts).
1.1.2 Departures from the Terms of Reference
The main departures from the ToR are that the evaluation team have included an
assessment of how well the project has adapted to the COVID-19 context; that the data
collection was conducted remotely via online tools due to travel restrictions in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic; and that the evaluation team conducted an online survey of project
partners.
Evaluation Criteria and Questions
The evaluation was conducted in line with OECD DAC evaluation criteria: (a) relevance; (b)
effectiveness; (c) efficiency; (d) sustainability; (e) impact; and (f) coherence. As per the ToR,
the evaluation team was asked to consider a number of key questions shaped around these
criteria. The key questions are provided below, while the questions and sub-questions are
presented in the evaluation matrix in annex 2.
In keeping with UNICEF priorities, a human-rights based approach, gender and social
inclusion were taken into consideration across all evaluation criteria.

16
In addition, the team developed a number of indicators to measure progress, which are also
included in the evaluation matrix.
1.1.3 Expected users and intended use
The primary intended users of the evaluation are UNICEF and the project staff, the Project
Coordination Board, and donors. In addition, the results of the evaluation will be shared and
used for policy dialogue and advocacy – in line with the Project Exit Strategy and Advocacy
Plan. This means that secondary users will be the relevant entity, cantonal, municipal
authorities and relevant institutions, and wider stakeholders in the area of child
protection/justice for children, including CSOs.
1.2 Country Context
1.2.1 External context
A full analysis of the BiH context was conducted during the evaluation inception phase and is
provided in the inception report.
Governmental Institutions and International Commitments
BiH has a complex institutional structure with the Council of Ministers at the state level
consisting of two entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika
Srpska (RS) and Brcko District (BD). FBiH is further divided into ten cantons, with different
levels of decentralization. The state level authority, the two entities, including the ten FBiH
cantons, and BD, all have legislative power. This fragmentation of power can represent a
challenge for effective coordination, policy development and decision-making. The large
public sector, with many levels of authority, impedes effective policy and budgeting
harmonization. BiH has a multi-layered judicial system with the High Judicial and
Prosecutorial Council acting as the central coordinating body. Responsibility for the judiciary
primarily lies with the entity, cantonal and BD Ministries of Justice.
BiH adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which call for action and concrete
results by 2030, including by ending violence against children, promoting rule of law and
ensuring equal access to justice for all, developing effective, accountable and transparent
institutions as required by the Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions Goal (Goal 16) and the
Partnership for the Goals (Goal 17). In addition, 14 key priorities have been identified in
2019 by the European Commission for opening the accession negotiations, including in the
area of rule of law and fundamental rights.
Human Rights and Policy Frameworks
The Institution of Human Rights Ombudsman of BiH is the independent human rights
institution that responds to complaints or human rights violations (including violations of child
rights) committed by any organ of BiH, its entities and BD, and recommends actions. In
addition, Republika Srpska has a separate Ombudsman for Children.
BiH is a party to the main international human rights instruments, including the Convention
on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The Council for Children was established as part of the
BiH Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees as a coordination and advisory body, mandated
to coordinate the implementation of the Action Plans for Children (the last action plan
17
covered the period from 2015 until 2018, and was extended to 2019). The Republika Srpska
entity did not take part in this activity. The new action plan is under preparation. The UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC Committee) advised BiH to ensure sufficient
resources for implementation of the next plan.3
The content of the laws and policies governing child rights, including juvenile justice, have
been favourably assessed4 but the laws and policies across administrative jurisdictions are
still to be harmonized, and the implementation remains uneven. Child protection issues are
covered by different laws, policies and strategies at entity, BD and cantonal levels.5 In its
concluding observations from 2019, but also in 2012, the Committee on the Rights of the
Child has called for the adoption of an overarching law on children’s rights.
In its concluding observations from 2019, the Committee also expressed concern about the
continued lack of consistently disaggregated data applicable to children in BiH and called for
improved dissemination and use of data.6 The BiH Agency for Statistics maintains a
database of children charged with criminal offences disaggregated by age, gender and type
of offence, which relies on coordination with the entity Ministries of Justice. Based on the
data published, the number of juveniles convicted in criminal procedure has slightly
increased from 2017 to 2019 (96 in 2017, 96 in 2018, and 116 in 2019) while the percentage
of minors receiving alternative educational-correctional measures (warning and guidance
and increased supervision), instead of juvenile prison or institutionalization, decreased from
93.75 per cent in 2017 to 86.3 per cent in 2018 and to 79.3 per cent in 2019,7 indicating the
need to increase the use of alternative measures and to ensure that the detention of children
is used only as the last resort.8
Status of Children in Bosnia and Herzegovina
According to the BiH Agency for Statistics 2013 census, BiH has 3.5 million inhabitants,
including more than 600,000 children, representing about 18 per cent of the population.9
Children are at a high risk of poverty (estimated at 30.6 per cent in 2011),10 however there is
a need to ensure better monitoring and data on child poverty.11 Access to education for
children is assessed as satisfactory, with the exception of participation in preschool
programmes (assessed at 25 per cent).12 Children face challenges in accessing justice

equitably, with children from poor families, Roma and minority children, children with
disabilities and refugee and migrant children particularly affected and there is a need to
strengthen alternatives to detention.13
Juvenile Justice and Social Protection
Major improvements have been made in the reform of the justice system for children. The
Laws on the Protection and Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings
were adopted in 2010 in RS, 2011 in BD and 2014 in FBiH, strengthening the protection of
children in the justice system, including for child victims and witnesses. The laws mandate
the use of diversion and alternative sentencing for juvenile offenders. With the support of
UNICEF’s Justice for Children (J4C) project, multi-agency coordination working groups were
established in a number of municipalities, enabling secondary and tertiary prevention
measures for children at risk and children in conflict with the law. Child-friendly rooms have
been set up in several police stations, courts and prosecutors’ offices and the laws
mandated the greater involvement of social protection institutions, and the inclusion of
professionals trained in child psychology when questioning child witnesses, developing
treatment plans, identifying children’s best interests, and applying diversion and alternative
measures.14 However, the full and consistent implementation of these laws is yet to be
achieved.15
The responsibility for social protection in BiH lies with the entities; in FBiH it is also within the
competence of the cantons and BD, resulting in different standards of protection and varying
coverage.16 UNICEF reported that in 2019 an assessment carried out by the steering
committee for strengthening the social service workforce in child protection concluded that
strengthening of the social protection system is required, including by ensuring better clarity
on the roles and responsibilities of social service and child protection professionals.17 The
assessment further emphasized that the social welfare system is overburdened and
fragmented, and that there is weak coordination between different actors and service
providers, to the detriment of most vulnerable groups. The need for the standardization of
case management services for child protection has been assessed as critical.18 One of the
important outcomes of UNICEF’s Justice for Children project and the new juvenile justice
laws has been the mandated increased involvement of the social welfare system in cases

Action “Strengthening the Social Work and Social Service workforce in Europe and Central Asia as an
Investment in Our Children’s Future”. The Committee is coordinated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs
(MoCA) and composed of key social protection ministries, academia and professional organizations of
the social service workforce in BiH.

involving children.19 However, the social welfare sector needs better capacity, improved
countrywide harmonization and the resources to fulfil its responsibilities, including for case
management and the individual plans for prevention, direct services, recovery and
reintegration of children identified as being at risk of offending, children in conflict with the
law, victims and witnesses.
1.3 Justice for Every Child Project Phase III: Components and
Goals
1.3.1 The goal of the project
Phase III of the Justice for Every Child project (2018–2021) is a continuation of UNICEF's
engagement to improve justice for children in BiH and builds on the results and lessons
learned gained through implementation of the first two phases of the project (phase I from
2010 to 2013, and phase II from 2014 to 2017). The overall goal of the project is that
children in justice processes and children at risk are dealt with in compliance with
international standards on justice for children, and that decisions are taken in their best
interests. The third phase of Justice for Every Child is fully aligned with UNICEF's broader
goals to strengthen the child protection systems in BiH and enhance children's access to
justice, as outlined in UNICEF's Country Programme document 2015–2020 and agreed with
relevant BiH partners.
1.3.2 The main components of the project
The project aims to contribute to achieving the following two outcomes:
Outcome A: To strengthen the justice and social welfare systems, including the conditions
for financial sustainability, and make them better adapted and responsive to the rights and
needs of children participating in justice processes.
Outcome B: To empower children at risk, child victims and witnesses, children in civil
proceedings and children in conflict with the law with prevention programmes, legal support,
and information to enable them to access justice.
Adopting a human rights-based approach (HRBA), outcome A is focused on the supply side
and building the capacities of relevant institutions to improve their service provision, while
outcome B is focused on the demand side, through empowering children with enhanced
knowledge of their rights and the capacities to demand these.
The project has a total of 11 corresponding outputs, which are aimed at achieving the
outcomes. There are seven outputs under outcome A and four outputs under outcome B.
These are as follows:
• Output A1: Gaps in laws, by-laws and policies identified and recommendations for
reforms are made.

December 2013–November 2017, Coram International.
20
• Output A2: Budgeting of laws, by-laws and policies for justice for children and social
welfare systems are established and advocacy for financing by governmental
institutions has taken place.
• Output A3: Capacity-building programmes designed and implemented.
• Output A4: Correctional recommendations increasingly available.
• Output A5: Enhanced availability of data on child protection for administrative and
statistical purposes.
• Output A6: Municipal and Basic Courts are better equipped to conduct child-friendly
proceedings.
• Output A7: Child protection in emergency preparedness and response strengthened.
• Output B1: Increased availability of expert associates for children in conflict with the
law and child victims/witnesses.
• Output B2: Children at risk benefit from secondary prevention programmes in
selected locations.
• Output B3: Improved availability of and access to legal aid for children and their
families.
• Output B4: Increased knowledge and awareness among children and youth of how to
access the justice system.
This phase of the project aims to respond to a number of gender, equity and human rights
challenges recognized during the implementation of the previous phases of the project,
including the need for harmonization of the relevant laws, policies and practices across
jurisdictions to ensure the protection of all children with sufficient resources allocated for
implementation, and with a focus on the strengthened social protection capacity. It seeks to
secure the continued training of relevant professionals on the Laws on Protection and
Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings and child rights, and the
improved availability of trained professionals and child-friendly spaces dedicated to children
in contact with the law. It seeks to place a much greater focus on the availability of
secondary and tertiary prevention and measures, reintegration programming, and
multisectoral cooperation. It further seeks to identify ways for children to be consulted, and to
ensure child-friendly information sharing. Finally, it aims to ensure full ownership of the
process by the relevant authorities in BiH, monitoring and accountability through improved
data collection practices, and longer-term sustainability.
1.3.3 Project budget allocation
The third phase of the Justice for Every Child project will be implemented over a three-year
period (May 2018 to April 2021, and extended to November 2021) with a total budget of
US$5 million (of which a contribution of US$2,500,000 is from the Swiss Government,
21
US$591,129 from Sida) and US$1,909,282 from UNICEF.20 The table below reflects the
overall budget for the Justice for Every Child Project Phase III, including the financial
contributions from the Swiss Government, Sida and UNICEF.

1.3.4 Adjustments to the project
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reached BiH in early March 2020, UNICEF,
in collaboration with the competent ministries and NGOs, identified the following priorities in
terms of social and child protection, as detailed in the UNICEF BiH COVID-19 response
plan:
• Support BD, entity, including relevant cantonal and municipal institutions to conduct
rapid assessments of the situation of the social protection beneficiaries and based on
that, propose immediate response measures and social protection programmes;
• Ensure continuity of child protection services;
• Mitigate risks of all forms of violence and abuse of children; and
• Protect mental health and provide psychosocial support and stigma prevention.
As a result, activities under output A7 were amended and additional indicators were
identified relating to: the number of children both directly and indirectly affected by COVID-
19 benefiting from quality child protection support and standards; the number of children
directly and/or indirectly affected by COVID-19 benefiting from mental health and
psychosocial support; and the number of cantonal assessments completed and social
protection programmes developed.
1.3.5 Project theory of change
The project has a clear logic chain, and the theory of change is closely aligned with
UNICEF’s regional Theory of Change for Children’s Equitable Access to Justice. This was
largely informed by evidence-based findings from a study on children’s access to justice in
several countries in Europe and Central Asia and a multi-country evaluation of the impact of
juvenile justice reforms on children in conflict with the law. This found that where detention is

22
considered only as a last resort, there was space to intervene to expand the scope of justice
work to provide broader access to justice for children. Improved availability and awareness
contribute to the realization of the rights of all children seeking to access justice and/or
participating in criminal, civil and administrative justice processes in any capacity. The
regional theory of change is based on the understanding that the progressive realization of
child rights and reduction of equity gaps is best achieved through changes in systems at
state/regional/local levels and that sustained UNICEF engagement through its core roles
contributes to these system changes. The project’s theory of change expands on this to
reflect the BiH context and the fact that the child protection system in BiH is still largely a
statutory response system that primarily intervenes when children and their families are in
crisis, instead of intervening before risks escalate.
The theory of change for Justice for Every Child Phase III therefore articulates:
• The rights-based changes in the lives of children and reduction of the equity gap that
it is trying to achieve;
• The changes in the system that are needed to achieve the intended result, by
removing the bottlenecks identified in recent research;
• The UNICEF contribution, using its core roles that will enable/trigger the changes in
relevant institutions; and
• The causal linkages between each of the three levels and the assumption behind the
selection of the particular core roles to trigger specific changes in the system.
The project’s theory of change is articulated in the project document ‘Justice for Every Child’
(May 2018–April 2021) initially published in October 2017 and revised as of March 2020 to
reflect the COVID-19 response.
There is no visualization of the theory of change, but the project’s logic chain is reproduced
below.

2. Methodology
2.1 Approach and Methodology
The principal guide for the evaluation was the project document for Justice for Every Child
Phase III, and in particular the results framework containing its logic chain and M&E
framework, which contain indicators, targets and “means of verification” (i.e. data and
documents) for the project’s outputs. This allowed the evaluation team to conduct a critical
analysis of the project’s logframe indicators and targets.
The evaluation was criteria-based and not a theory-based evaluation. Because this is a final
evaluation of the third and final phase of a three-phase support process, the evaluation team
has not developed a new theory of change, since it will have no utility going forward.
The evaluation was multi-faceted, and the methodological approach used mixed (qualitative
and quantitative) methods, as the best vehicle for meeting the evaluation’s needs. The
evaluation team ensured to the extent possible that the evaluation was conducted through a
participatory and consultative process, which included all relevant state, entity and local
stakeholders, and the project partners. The methodological approach was synthesized into
an Evaluation Matrix (see annex 2), which guided the evaluation team and provided an
analytical framework for conducting the evaluation. The evaluation matrix sets out the
relevant evaluation criteria, key questions and sub-questions, assumptions, sources of
evidence and methods for data analysis, and also includes success indicators.
The evaluation team identified a cross section of data sources in order to optimize data
collection and ensure triangulation. A large focus of the evaluation was on obtaining
qualitative data through interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) with relevant
stakeholders, as per the stakeholder mapping in annex 6.
The evaluation team conducted as many interviews as possible, in order to ensure the
integrity and comprehensiveness of the evaluation, which included ensuring representation
across different stakeholder types. Wherever possible, data gathered both qualitatively and
quantitatively was triangulated through cross verification from two or more sources. For
interviews, this was done through posing a similar set of questions to multiple interviewees.
For the document review it was accomplished through cross-checking data and information
from multiple sources to increase the credibility and validity of the material. Data collection
tools in the form of interview protocols and protocols for FGDs, as well as the online survey
questions, are provided in annex 4.
The evaluation of the Justice for Every Child Phase III project consisted of three main
phases:
2.1.1 Phase 1: Desk research, document review and inception report – virtual
Phase 1 was focused on the desk research, document review and preparation of the
Inception Report, including the evaluation matrix and the data collection tools and
instruments. A bibliography of sources consulted is provided in annex 3.
25
2.1.2 Phase 2: Data collection and analysis – virtual
Phase 2 formed the largest part of the evaluation and consisted of the evaluation team
conducting the data collection remotely. The evaluation team conducted key informant
interviews (KIIs) and FGDs with relevant project stakeholders. A full breakdown is provided
below in annex 6. In addition, the evaluation team shared an online survey with project
stakeholders. All interviews were undertaken with full confidentiality and anonymity and the
evaluation approach was as participatory as possible, given the complex realities on the
ground. This allowed opportunity for stakeholders of the project to express themselves either
through FGDs as highlighted above, or through other means, such as the online survey. The
approach was also inclusive, in order to guarantee the effective participation of as wide a
range of stakeholders as possible. In addition to being participatory and inclusive, the
evaluation team’s approach was also based on the principles of gender equality and
ensuring fair gender representation. Due to the nature of the assistance, and the fact that
more women are working with the service providers than men, overall, the evaluation team
reached more women than men.
2.1.3 Phase 3: Drafting, revision and finalization
Phase 3 was focused on analysing and validating the data, findings and recommendations
and drafting this evaluation report. The evaluation team prepared a first draft of the report,
which has been submitted to UNICEF for comments. The evaluation team then revised the
draft evaluation report, addressing all received comments and suggestions and prepared an
updated version of the evaluation report. This was then presented to UNICEF and submitted
to the external quality assurance mechanism, following on from which any comments and
suggestions were addressed, and a revised evaluation report was prepared and submitted,
and presented to the Project Board. The evaluation team then prepared and delivered an
online presentation with key findings and recommendations to the UNICEF Country Office
and other relevant stakeholders. On the basis of discussions arising from the presentation,
as well as additional comments shared by the Project Board and UNICEF, the evaluation
team finalized the report.
Utility
Given that the purpose of the evaluation is both to learn from the past implementations in
order to adapt and scale up further programming, the utility of the evaluation process and
final report is focused on actionable recommendations.
2.2 Data Collection and Analysis Methods
2.2.1 Data collection methods
Four data collection tools were used:
• Desk review to systematically interrogate materials to obtain quantitative data and to
identify alignment and dissonance between the documented intentions and the
documented activities;
• Online survey for project partners used to gather a broad range of different views
from a number of stakeholders;
26
• Interviews to gather qualitative data from project stakeholders and relevant actors;
and
• FGDs to gather qualitative data from project stakeholders and to capture people’s
voices.
Desk Review
The evaluation team used in-depth approaches that IOD PARC has developed to
systematically interrogate materials generated by the client, and wider sources as
appropriate. For this evaluation, documents included Justice for Every Child project
documentation and monitoring data, and contextual research and analysis focused on justice
for children in BiH. Further documents suggested by UNICEF included decisions on
formation of Working Groups, Municipal Working Group Action Plans, NGO implementing
partner reports, Project Coordination Board minutes, and Project Exit Strategy. When
combined, these helped the evaluation team to identify alignment and dissonance between
the documented intentions and the documented activities of the Justice for Every Child
Phase III project in the context of its theory of change.
Online Survey
The online survey for project partners was conducted to reach a larger number of partners
and stakeholders to allow for comparison of results. The timing of the survey was staggered
until after the start of the KIIs and FGDs to allow for tailoring of the survey to specific issues
and questions that may have arisen from the stakeholder consultations. The focus of the
survey was on the overall impact of UNICEF’s programming in this area over the three
project phases and focused on key achievements, challenges and future direction. The
online survey is provided in annex 5, and survey results in annex 6. The survey was shared
with a total of 69 stakeholders and responses were received from 57 respondents, which
was an incredibly high response rate, indicating the level of interest and commitment from
the project’s stakeholders. The usage of the online survey allowed the evaluation team to
widen the participation of stakeholders across diverse geographies and provided an
additional avenue for confidential and anonymous responses. This approach also overcame
some of the challenges of conducting the evaluation remotely during the COVID-19 context.
Key Informant Interviews
18 KIIs with UNICEF staff and stakeholders at the community, local, entity and other relevant
levels of authority were an important method: semi-structured interviews allowed flexibility
within the conversation for issues important to the interviewee to come to the fore. At the
same time, they provided the parameters for gathering data on pre-selected topics for both
aggregation and disaggregation.
Focus Group Discussions
Six FGDs with a total of 28 stakeholders brought together diverse views and facilitated
greater understanding of where the convergent and divergent issues are for people. A list of
FGDs conducted is provided in the stakeholder mapping in annex 6, while the structure and
focus for the FGDs in the interview protocols is found in annex 4.
27
2.2.2 Analysis methods
The following analytical methods were applied:
• Political economy analysis;
• Scalability analysis;
• Quantitative and qualitative data analysis;
• Data synthesis;
• Triangulation; and
• Verification and validation.
Political Economy Analysis
A political economy analysis helped the evaluation team to understand who seeks to gain
and lose from the project’s interventions, as well as to identify who has vested interests and
the social and cultural norms that need to be taken into account.
Scalability Analysis
An important analytical element that complements the criteria-based approach is the focus
on scalability of the initiatives, particularly the school-based secondary prevention
programme, as well as diversion and alternative measures. The evaluation aimed to identify
what scaling up means for these interventions in their specific contexts, and according to
UNICEF and stakeholders. There are different ways of conceptualizing and implementing
scaling, and IOD PARC has developed its thinking in this area, creating a schema to map
interventions and scalability priorities. Sub-questions in the evaluation matrix were identified
where they are particularly relevant to how the project achieves results, and in what context.
These are therefore the priority for understanding the opportunities and limitations for
replicating or scaling the project. The basic schema used for analysing the evaluation matrix
is included in annex 7.
Quantitative and Qualitative Data Analysis
Most of the primary data collection methods (interviews and FGDs) collected qualitative
data. These were analysed using MAXQDA in which the code structure was aligned to the
key evaluation questions, sub-questions and indicators. The qualitative data from the
primary data collection methods was cross-referenced with other sources such as
documents. The survey results provided a mix of qualitative and quantitative responses. The
qualitative responses were analysed in MAXQDA as above. The quantitative data produced
descriptive analysis (rather than more complex regressions).
Triangulation
Triangulation is the process of using multiple data sources, data collection methods, and/or
theories to validate research findings. The evaluation team used more than one approach
(data collection method) to address the evaluation questions in order to reduce the risk of
bias and increase the chances of detecting errors or anomalies. The team applied three
approaches to triangulation: methods triangulation (checking the consistency of findings
generated by different data collection methods); interrogating data where diverging results
28
arise; and analyst triangulation (using multiple team members to review findings, allowing for
a consistent approach to interpretive analysis).
Data Synthesis
The process of bringing all the evidence together to synthesize the data and formulate
findings and conclusions took place in two ways. The first was the process of articulating the
key findings and cross-checking the strength of the evidence for each. Based on this, the
conclusions were then developed and cross-checked across the team members for their
relevance to the findings.
Verification and Validation
The above steps incorporate verification and validation of evidence during the data collection
and data analysis processes. In addition, there will be a further step to validate the findings
based on the evidence through a participatory validation workshop with key stakeholders
and the UNICEF Country Office. This is an opportunity to share key findings, offer mutual
challenges, and discuss the feasibility of and receptiveness to draft recommendations. It also
provides an important opportunity to foster buy-in to the evaluation process particularly for
the stakeholders who will have responsibility for implementing recommendations.
2.3 Sampling Methods for Qualitative and Quantitative Data
Collection
The geographical scope of the evaluation included FBiH, RS and BD. In addition, general
progress in the 17 project locations covering 29 municipalities was incorporated into the
evaluation, although a detailed assessment in each location is not included.
The evaluation team used a purposive sampling approach. The team consulted with
UNICEF to develop and refine a list of potential key informants to participate in the FGDs.
This included efforts to ensure a 50:50 ratio of female to male participants, as well as efforts
to ensure that all geographical locations where the project is implemented were represented.
The sampling approach was purposive due to the small scale of the evaluation, but criteria
considered the following contextual and operational factors as appropriate:
• Geographically proportional taking into account entities and Brcko District;
• Sex of participants;
• Sensitivity to the inclusion of diversity of participants;
• A balance of different levels and types of engagement with the project; and
• Socioeconomic diversity.
2.4 Methodological Limitations and Attribution of Results
2.4.1 Challenges and limitations
When conducting the evaluation, IOD PARC were faced with a number of challenges. These
are briefly outlined below, with mitigating strategies that were used by the team.
29
First and foremost was the challenge of conducting the evaluation remotely using virtual
tools. It proved challenging to build up a rapport and distil the essence of the project with
stakeholders and beneficiaries when the meetings were conducted remotely. Logistical
challenges included unstable internet connections. The team mitigated this by trying to put
participants at their ease at the start of the KIIs or FGDs, as well as trying to use cameras
where the internet connections allowed.
Availability of data was also a limitation, and the evaluation has relied on the most up-to-date
data provided by UNICEF as well as anecdotal data provided during the KIIs and FGDs. In
particular, due to the reporting schedule of UNICEF and its partners, some data for 2020
was not available, and not all data was disaggregated.
The evaluation team also faced the issue of recall bias, whereby key informants were
participating in several projects and potentially blended their experiences into a composite
response. The evaluation team mitigated this bias primarily through a semi-structured
interview protocol that contained questions about specific activities. There was also the
challenge of response bias where participants provided only positive remarks because they
would like to stay involved with the intervention in the future and think that a negative
evaluation could mean the end of project opportunities. To mitigate this, with each informant
the team stressed that it would maintain confidentiality as well as its independence from both
UNICEF and the project. There was also the potential challenge of selection bias, whereby
beneficiaries provided by the implementing partners could mean that the evaluation team
heard only from people who had positive experiences. As with the other forms of bias,
multiple sources of data and questions eliciting specific examples helped to mitigate the risk
of this bias. The conducting of the online survey also provided respondents with the
opportunity to contribute in a confidential and anonymous manner.
2.4.2 Non-participation of children
The inclusion of children and young people as evaluation participants was considered during
the inception phase for this evaluation. The ability to ensure appropriate ethical standards
and safeguarding protocols was dependent on the evaluation conducting in-person data
collection. With the decision made by UNICEF and the evaluation team to use virtual data
collection methods (due to the ongoing travel restrictions and health and safety concerns
related to COVID-19), children were not consulted during the evaluation. The decision not to
include children in virtual data collection was based on the experience of both UNICEF BiH
Country Office and the evaluation team, which have first-hand knowledge of the practical
challenges, and is in line with UNICEF guidance on data collection during the COVID-19
pandemic.21

Pandemic, April 2020.

2.5 Ethical Considerations
The evaluation observed the ethical principles and standards set by both UNICEF and IOD
PARC. This starts with the principle of ‘Do no harm’. The IOD PARC ethical code of conduct
contains IOD PARC’s ethical framework for all its work, including field visits, and has been
used in UNICEF evaluations in several countries. A copy of the ethical code of conduct is
available on request. It is based on international guidelines for all contexts:
• UN Evaluation Group Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation, 2008;
• UN Evaluation Group Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN System, 2007;
• UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection
and Analysis, 2015;
• Department for International Development (FCDO), Ethics Principles for Research
and Evaluation, 2011; and
• Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Framework for Research Ethics
Principles, 2012.
This means that the evaluation team upheld the appropriate obligations of evaluators,
including maintaining the independence, impartiality, credibility and accountability of the
individual team members and the evaluation process as a whole. The evaluation team was
not subject to any conflicts of interest and were able to carry out the evaluation without any
undue interference.
IOD PARC adheres to UNICEF’s triggers for formal ethical review board (ERB) approval
according to the ‘UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data
Collection and Analysis’. The requirement of ERB approval is automatically triggered when
there are any human subjects included. This is particularly important for community
members or disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, but equally the evaluation team had
responsibilities to all persons who participated in data collection, including those who acted
in an official capacity. The evaluation included a wide range of project stakeholders including
representatives from sectors such as education, justice, human rights, child rights, health
and social protection, civil society and UNICEF. Therefore, the evaluation methodology and
protocols were submitted to UNICEF’s Ethical Review Facility for ERB approval.
Informed consent protocols are included in the annex including guidance for interviewers
regarding managing referrals if a respondent becomes upset or distressed (see annex 4).
2.5.1 Data management
We take a Responsible Data Lifecycle (Oxfam 201722 and USAID 201923) approach to
managing client and evaluation participant data which is in line with UNICEF’s Procedure
22 Responsible Data Management Toolkit available at:
https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/responsible-data-management-training-pack-620235/.
23 Considerations for Using Data Responsibly at USAID available at: www.usaid.gov/responsibledata

(2015). This applies to both personally identifying information, as well as the content of
interviews, FGDs and surveys. In line with our Data Protection Policy and Ethical Code of
Conduct, we avoid collecting any data that is personally identifying, and if for any reason it is
necessary to collect such information, we protect individuals by holding the data on
encrypted hardware and anonymizing it at the earliest opportunity. We understand that
personally identifiable information refers to data such as someone’s name, address and
contact details, but it also refers to combined data such as a job title within an organization
or descriptive characteristics of individuals and their circumstances.
Within this evaluation, we have specifically ensured the following:
• Confidentiality: participants’ anonymity was protected and all participants were
assured of the confidentiality of any information they share with us.
• Preventing disclosure of identity: we have taken appropriate measures to prevent an
individual’s data from being published or otherwise released in a form that would
allow any subject’s identity to be disclosed or inferred.
• Informed consent: we sought informed consent from all participants and ensured that
participants have the contact details of the evaluation team so that they can withdraw
or change their consent at any time.
• Data security: our data is kept secure on our servers; once analysed, all data is
anonymized. We destroy all personal data within six months of the completion of a
project. Only team members will have access to password-protected folders
containing participant data for the duration of the project. Raw data (for example,
interview transcripts) are stored in a protected folder in IOD PARC’s document
sharing site on the secure server. This folder is accessible only by the evaluation
team. The evaluation team and all users of the shared folders have signed
confidentiality and data protection agreements.
Data Collection
Through all data collection processes, the evaluation team reached a total of 136
stakeholders and beneficiaries (94 female, 40 male, 2 undeclared), over 44 hours of
interview/discussion time. The evaluation team implemented the data collection through a
total of 31 KIIs (inclusive of March 31, 2021) with 51 (15 male, 36 female) stakeholders and
beneficiaries, totaling over 32 hours of interview time. This included meetings with UNICEF
management, programme and project staff, donors, project implementing partners, Project
Coordination Board members, Ministries of Justice, Education, and Social Policy at the
entities, cantonal and BD level, the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council, Prosecutor’s
Offices, and the Ombudsman for Human Rights. In addition, 6 thematic FGDs, were
organized reaching a total of 28 (19 female, 9 male) project implementation stakeholders
and beneficiaries, over a discussion time of 12 hours, covering schools, Centres for Social
Welfare, Centres for Mental Health, Centres for Free Legal Aid, Centres for Education of
Judges and Prosecutors, expert associates in Prosecutor’s Offices, and law universities. The
evaluation conducted an online survey for 69 project partners and stakeholders and received
57 responses (39 female, 16 male, 2 undeclared) representing different sectors, including
judiciary, police, education, local administrations, NGOs and donors, from both entities (52
per cent FBiH, 48 per cent RS). No responses were received from BD, although the survey
was shared with BD representatives.
32
2.5.2 UNICEF management of the evaluation
UNICEF managed the evaluation through its Evaluation Manager, Child Rights and
Monitoring/Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, with overall supervision provided by the
Resident Representative (or Deputy Resident Representative) in close collaboration with the
Child Protection Section.
UNICEF convened the Project Coordination Board, consisting of key stakeholders, and
facilitated the participation of members in the evaluation process, for example through
sharing drafts of key deliverables for their review and feedback, as well as facilitating their
participation in KIIs and FGDs.
UNICEF supported the evaluation through facilitating access to project stakeholders,
providing key documentation, and actively engaging in the process and liaising closely with
the external evaluation team leader. UNICEF’s Evaluation Manager arranged for external
quality assurance of key deliverables and, where required, facilitated the Ethical Review
Board approval via UNICEF’s long-term agreement with Health Media Lab. The UNICEF
Research, Study and Evaluation Steering Committee reviewed key deliverables.
2.5.3 The evaluation team
The evaluation team was relatively self-sufficient in terms of managing the evaluation
process, appreciating UNICEF’s support to access key project stakeholders and key
documentation. UNICEF facilitation was required, for example with formal introductions as
part of protocols for meeting with stakeholders, but otherwise the evaluation team managed
the majority of communications with stakeholders. UNICEF sent letters of announcement to
the stakeholders to be consulted, informing them about the evaluation. IOD PARC then
followed up to confirm the interviews and scheduling.
The team composition reflected the needs expressed in the ToR. In addition to the core
team specified in the ToR, IOD PARC appointed a Project Director and Project Manager to
support the delivery and quality assurance of key deliverables. IOD PARC has also drawn
on the support of a Research Assistant.
Team roles and responsibilities were as follows:
• Jo Kaybryn was the Project Director and had overall responsibility for quality
assurance. Jo’s role was to provide general oversight and leadership, as well as
ensuring that quality and consistency are maintained throughout the reporting
process.
• Joanna Brooks was the Evaluation Team Leader. As team leader, Joanna’s role was
to lead and coordinate all aspects of the evaluation as outlined in the ToR.
• Jelena Besedic was the Evaluation Regional Expert. She contributed to the desk
review and data collection phases as well as to the data analysis and reporting
process.
• Elisa Radaelli provided overall project management as per key deliverables in the
workplan.
• Joy McCarron provided research support for the evaluation and additional support as
required.
33
2.6 Quality Assurance
IOD PARC has well established approaches to evaluation quality assurance which provided
the team with tools and processes to document and maintain a high standard throughout the
evaluation cycle. We are well versed in United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) standards
and guidelines and have built our approach to quality control systems on our foundation as a
centre of excellence in the provision of both innovative and pragmatic M&E assistance.
Clients include organizations such as UN agencies and bilateral donors (including UNICEF’s
Global Evaluation Reports Oversight System (GEROS), FCDO’s EQUALS, World Food
Programme’s Decentralized Evaluations Quality Support (DEQS), and UN Women’s Global
Evaluation Reports Assessment and Analysis System (GERAAS). The team was introduced
to IOD PARC’s quality assurance approach from the planning stage. For this evaluation the
inception and evaluation reports were also assessed against UNICEF quality assurance
standards and frameworks.
Quality assurance mechanisms informed both key points in the consulting cycle (e.g. the
development of outputs) and the ongoing processes (e.g. our overall project management).
UNICEF’s quality standards were followed and adhered to according to the quality review
checklists used for external quality assurance. For example, this evaluation report has been
constructed in line with the expectations and requirements for the Quality Assurance
Checklist for Evaluation Reports, and the full draft of the report was checked carefully
against the checklist on its completion.

3. Findings of the Evaluation
3.1 Relevance and Design
EQ1: To what extent do the objectives address the real problems and the needs of the
project’s target groups, country priorities, associated policies and donor priorities? (Context
should consider children’s needs, BiH/RS/BD priorities, country and regional situation, and
partner landscape)
Finding 1.1: The project was relevant to the needs of children in accessing justice and
was fully aligned with UNICEF’s Country Programme 2015–2019 (extended to 2020),
as well as the strategic priorities of the project’s donors. Further, it is aligned with the
overall Reform Agenda of BiH and its Justice Sector Strategy, as well as contributing
to BiH’s commitments to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.
The Project is fully aligned with the overall goal of UNICEF’s current country programme
2015–2019 (extended to 2020 and agreed with the relevant authorities in BiH), which is to
support the efforts of BiH to accelerate the universal realization of children’s rights by
fostering greater social inclusion, especially of the most vulnerable and excluded children
and families, children with disabilities, children of minorities, especially Roma, children
without parental care, and children in impoverished communities. The project remains
relevant by falling in alignment with UNICEF BiH’s Programme Strategy Note 2021–2025,
which prioritizes three key issues, including “enhancing equitable access of children to
justice”. Access to justice for children was also more predominantly reflected in UNICEF’s
Strategic Plan for the period 2018–2021,24 thus the project is also aligned with this.
The project contributes to and is aligned with BiH’s European integration process and
supports the European Partnership’s political criteria, which focus on consolidation of the
rule of law, implementation of the Justice Sector Reform Strategy, and consolidation of a
judiciary25 which can guarantee the rule of law and equal access to justice. The Stabilization
and Association Agreement (SAA)26 between the EU and their Member States with BiH
underlines the importance of strengthening the institutions and rule of law in the area of
justice. It is also aligned with the EU acquis communautaire chapter 23 ‘Judiciary and
fundamental rights’, chapter 24 ‘Justice, freedom, and security’, and chapter 19 ‘Social policy
and employment’.
The project’s results contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, by supporting the SDGs and their corresponding targets, in particular those
that have a direct focus on access to justice (SDG Target 16.3 “Promote the rule of law at
24 UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2018–2021, E/ICEF/2017/17/Rev.1.
25 Council Decision 2008/211/EC of 18 February 2008 on the principles, priorities and conditions
contained in the European Partnership with BiH and repealing Decision 2006/55/EC: Official Journal L
80/18 of 19.3.2008, see Political criteria/ Democracy and the rule of law/judicial system, Section 3,

the national and international levels, and ensure equal access to justice for all”), and
violence (SDG Target 5.2 “Eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls”; SDG
Target 16.1 “Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere”;
and SDG Target 16.2 “End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against
children”), and to some that address risk factors, in particular harmful gender stereotypes
(SDG Goal 5). However, an opportunity was missed to align the project’s indicators and
targets with the corresponding SDG indicators and targets. In part this was due to BiH only
adopting its SDG Monitoring Framework in 2020.
Further, the Justice for Every Child project contributed to the Swiss Cooperation Strategy by
improving the treatment of children in the justice system and ensuring access to justice for
all children. This was in alignment with the Swiss Cooperation Strategy 2017–2021, which
aims to contribute to “progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina on its path towards regional and
European integration, fostering a democratic political system, a peaceful and cohesive
society, providing inclusive access to essential services, the rule of law and a social market
economy.”27
Finding 1.2: The design of Phase III of the Justice for Every Child project was
evidence-based and informed by extensive research, analyses and data, however
there is less evidence that it fully captured the voice of children in BiH, although
views of children obtained in previous phases of the project were taken into account.
Research and evidence: Phase III of the Justice for Every Child project was based on
evidence from a substantial range of studies, analyses and data, not least those conducted
during the previous two phases of the project.28 This includes the findings of evidence on
children’s access to justice in several countries in Europe and Central Asia and a multi-
country evaluation of the impact of juvenile justice reforms on children in conflict with the
law, the UN Common Country Analysis, and data and results obtained during the previous
project phases. The project development phase would have benefitted from undertaking a
gender and social inclusion analysis to identify specific needs of girls and boys, women and
men, differences in access to information and resources, and differences in circumstances.
Stakeholder consultation: The design of the project was informed by extensive
consultation with project partners, stakeholders and the project’s donors, that took place
over a period of six months prior to starting the project. The donors and partners were fully
involved in the development of the project’s logframe and its corresponding indicators.
Project partners consistently reported that they were consulted by UNICEF regularly and that
the project was designed and adapted to meet their needs.
Rights-holder consultation: There is little evidence that UNICEF consulted children in the
design of the project, either in the project document itself, or based on discussions held in
KIIs and FGDs. However, UNICEF did inform the evaluation team that children’s voices
captured during previous phases of the project were used to inform the project design.
During the project implementation, UNICEF undertook an assessment of children’s

36
knowledge on key child rights and how to access justice and other services, which was
initially anticipated to be finalized in February 2021, but the implementation was delayed
largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and at the time of finalizing this evaluation, the
results were not available.
Finding 1.3: The project design contributed to its theory of change and no major
programmatic adjustments were made during the lifespan of the project, beyond
adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The project’s theory of change was articulated in the project document ‘Justice for Every
Child’ (May 2018–April 2021) initially published in October 2017 and revised as of March
2020 to reflect the COVID-19 response. The project’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic
is discussed in full under EQ 7.2.
The project had a clear logic chain, and the theory of change was closely aligned with
UNICEF’s regional Theory of Change for Children’s Equitable Access to Justice. This was
largely informed by evidence-based findings from a study on children’s access to justice in
several countries in Europe and Central Asia and a multi-country evaluation of the impact of
juvenile justice reforms on children in conflict with the law.29
This report found that where detention is considered only as a last resort, there was space to
intervene to expand the scope of justice work to provide broader access to justice for
children. Improved availability and awareness contribute to the realization of the rights of all
children seeking to access justice and/or participating in criminal, civil and administrative
justice processes in any capacity. The regional theory of change is based on the
understanding that the progressive realization of child rights and reduction of equity gaps is
best achieved through changes in systems at state/regional/local levels and that sustained
UNICEF engagement through its core roles contributes to these system changes. The
project’s theory of change expanded on this to reflect the BiH context and the fact that the
child protection system in BiH is still largely a statutory response system that primarily
intervenes when children and their families are in crisis, instead of intervening before risks
escalate.
The theory of change for Justice for Every Child Phase III therefore articulated:
• The rights-based changes in the lives of children and reduction of the equity gap that
it is trying to achieve;
• The changes in the system that are needed to achieve the intended result, by
removing the bottlenecks identified in recent research;
• The UNICEF contribution, using its core roles that will enable/trigger the changes in
relevant institutions; and

• The causal linkages between each of the three levels and the assumption behind the
selection of the particular core roles to trigger specific changes in the system.
The project aimed to contribute to the theory of change, by achieving the following two
outcomes:
Outcome A: To strengthen the justice and social welfare systems, including the conditions
for financial sustainability, and make them more adapted and responsive to the rights and
needs of children participating in justice processes.
Outcome B: To empower children at risk, child victims and witnesses, children in civil
proceedings and children in conflict with the law with prevention programmes, legal support,
and information to enable them to access justice.
Adopting a HRBA, (discussed more fully under EQ 7.1) outcome A focused on the supply
side and building the capacities of relevant institutions to improve their service provision,
while outcome B focused on the demand side, through empowering children with enhanced
knowledge of their rights and the capacities to demand these.
The project had a total of 11 corresponding outputs, which were aimed at achieving the
outcomes. There were seven outputs under outcome A and four outputs under outcome B,
as presented above under section 1.4.1 (Project goals).
With regard to its indicator framework, the project included 3 indicators at impact level, 2
indicators per each outcome at outcome level, and 9 indicators at output level under
outcome A, with 6 indicators at output level under outcome B. The project’s success in
meeting its indicators is analysed under section 3.2 on project efficiency, however, it should
be pointed out that the indicators were exclusively quantitative with no qualitative indicators
being included, meaning that they were not able to fully capture the results of the project.
Qualitative indicators that measure changes in attitude and perceptions would have provided
more in-depth information and if adequately measured would have better captured the
project’s progress and results. A greater use of qualitative indicators that measure
perceptions and behaviours at the outcome level, as opposed to quantitative indicators that
measure activities at the output level, would likely have better captured project progress and
results, as well as contributions towards the outcomes and impact. These would also allow
for capturing the voices of people, which cannot be captured through quantitative indicators.
3.2 Project Efficiency
EQ2.1: Were inputs utilized or transformed into outputs in the most optimal or cost-efficient
way? Could the same results be produced by utilizing fewer resources?
Finding 2.1: The project implemented a number of strategies to achieve efficiency
gains which, when analysed against its results, provided a good value for money
coefficient.
During the first year of the project, the total funds received amounted to US$1,250,000 and
the overall spending amounted to US$640,952, representing 51 per cent delivery. UNICEF
38
contributed US$464,088 (including Sida country-thematic funds) and the Swedish Embassy
contributed US$391,357 from May to December 2018.30 The overall spending in the second
year (May 2019 to April 2020) amounted to US$1,299,841 out of which US$824,267 were
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) funds and US$475,574 were
UNICEF funds (including Sida country-thematic funds).31 In May 2020, the budget was
revisited to reflect changes in allocation of funds in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
revised budgets for the third and fourth years of the project amount to US$1,323,565
(compared to US$1,423,565 in the original budget) and US$237,911.
In early 2021, the project requested from its donors a no-cost extension (NCE), as a result of
funds not having been delivered in accordance with the workplan, largely as a result of a
delay in implementation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCE has been granted until
November 2021, when it is anticipated that the project will have achieved a 100 per cent
delivery rate.
The evaluation team finds that the staffing structure for the project was fit for purpose, while
also remaining quite lean. It consisted of one international staff member at 20 per cent, four
national staff members, one driver, one programme assistant, and various support staff. In
addition, the project utilized the UNICEF Regional Advisor and UNICEF BiH’s Child
Protection Specialist to provide quality control. The evaluation finds that the project made
good use of in-house or national expertise, and was less reliant on international consultants,
leading to sound efficiency gains, by not relying on external or more expensive international
support. All the stakeholders consulted consistently praised the high level of technical
expertise, substantive knowledge and commitment of the UNICEF project staff and
management.
The project was implemented using a mixture of execution modalities, and tried to balance
efficiency with the practical realities, for example, the majority of the ministries were unable
to receive cash transfers. Thus, the project used either direct cash transfer or reimbursement
modalities according to the realities of its partners. The project entered into a number of
partnerships with NGOs and local institutions, who were heavily scrutinized as part of due
diligence before and during implementation, with a sound risk analysis being undertaken
upfront, and strong M&E mechanisms being put in place during the partnership. This proved
to be an effective and cost-efficient approach. The civil society organizations as local project
implementing partners had relevant and extensive experience in project implementation
areas and during interviews have shown a great sense of ownership and enthusiasm for the
project achievements and future work.
During KIIs with the donors, the evaluation team was informed that communication with
UNICEF was always transparent and effective. The team were informed that the project
presented,

Monitoring and Evaluation
The project developed a sound system of monitoring and evaluation, as set out in the project
document and in particular its logframe. The project built on good practices and UNICEF
standards, such as annually updating its Operations Management System (OMS) table.
However, the M&E systems were more focused at the programmatic level and not at the
project level. In addition, a lot of updated data was not available, due to the annual reporting
approach that is used by UNICEF and its partners. The custodian of the majority of data
related to justice for children is the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council and the project
supported them to strengthen their Case Management System (CMS) for the judiciary and
(T/CMS) for the prosecutors, and successfully lobbied for the mandatory requirement of
gender disaggregated data. In September 2020, a Working Group was established, with the
support of the project, to further strengthen the T/CMS and to better align it with the Law/s
including the development of templates that judges and prosecutors can complete, which will
align with both the Law/s and the updated T/CMS for easy data entry.
With its partnerships with NGOs, the project had a strong focus on the development of M&E
systems, including regular field visits, reporting and communication mechanisms, however
these were not part of the project’s formal M&E structure.
Project Coordination Board
The Project Coordination Board included key stakeholders/project actors including: entity
and BiH Ministries of Justice, the BiH Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees, the High
Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC), Brcko District (BD) Government, entity Ministries
of Social Protection/Welfare, entity Ministries of the Interior, entity Ministries of Education, as
well as UNICEF and representatives from the Swiss and Swedish Embassies in BiH. All of
these stakeholders were considered vital as they played an important role in supporting the
Project Management Team in overseeing activities and ensuring that the project achieved its
goals. During KIIs and FGDs, the evaluation team were informed that there was some initial
confusion as to the roles and responsibilities of the project board. These were overcome by
developing a specific ToR for the Board, which was discussed in two Board meetings and
adopted unanimously.
Partnerships
Finding 2.2: The project was able to maximize partnerships with relevant BiH, entity
and district levels, as well as cantonal and municipal stakeholders. This included
ministries, Centres for Social Work, Centres for Mental Health, courts, prosecutor’s
offices, academia and civil society.
The state-level authority could have had a stronger role promoting legislative, policy and
implementation harmonization, and consideration should be given as to whether a state-level
Law on Protection and Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings would
also be beneficial for the small number of children falling under the jurisdiction of the Court of
BiH.
The project is implemented in partnership with the BiH Ministry for Human Rights and
Refugees (MOHRR), the BiH Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the High Judicial and Prosecutorial
Council (HJPC), the Federation of BiH (FBiH) Ministries of Justice, Interior (MOI), Education,
Labour and Social Policy, Republika Srpska (RS) Ministries of Justice, Interior, Education
40
and Health and Social Welfare, the Brcko District (BD) Government, as well as various
cantonal ministries, municipal authorities, academia, UN agencies, NGOs and CSOs.
Despite this impressive list of stakeholders, the evaluation team was informed during the
KIIs, FGDs and in the online survey that the state level could have been more involved.
Some stakeholders who were consulted also felt that a higher level of local community
involvement, in particular with regard to the secondary prevention programme and the use of
diversion and alternative measures, would further strengthen the project’s results.
3.3 Project Effectiveness
EQ3.1: To what extent have the objectives of the development intervention have been
achieved or are expected to be achieved, bearing in mind their relative importance.
Finding 3.1: The project has achieved tangible and quantifiable results, which have
strengthened the justice and social welfare systems and made them more adaptable
and responsive to the rights and needs of children participating in justice processes.
Results have contributed to the empowerment of children through prevention
programmes, legal support and information to enable them to access justice.
Continued efforts are required to fully embed some of the project’s results into the
system and to ensure their financial sustainability.
Prior to the UNICEF J4C project, there were no specific projects in BiH targeting juvenile
offenders, nor projects addressing protection and prevention measures. The J4C project
holistically approached this gap through interventions supporting the whole system – from
legislative and policy strengthening; capacity-building initiatives for institutions and
individuals; strengthening data collection mechanisms; and raising awareness among
institutions, key stakeholders, and children and their families, of the rights of children in
accessing justice, and the best interests of the child principle. While the results over the last
10 years of project implementation have been plentiful, this section will analyse in particular
the interventions that were supported during phase III of the project, while also considering
the accumulated results over all three phases of implementation. This section does not
attempt to provide an exhaustive list of all results but rather an analysis of the key results
and their contribution towards the achievement of the project’s specific and overall objectives
(outcomes).
When assessed solely against its indicators, the project’s results cannot be fully captured,
due to some gaps in updated data, as well as the limitations of the project’s M&E framework
as mentioned above. Thus, the evaluation has gone beyond the assessment of results
against indicators alone and the analysis below assesses both results against indicators as
well as a broader assessment of results achieved to examine the project’s effectiveness.
The impact of these results is explored under EQ4.1.
When looking at the outcome level indicators, the evaluation team were unable to assess
progress towards the indicator “By 2020, the number of children receiving psychosocial
support from specialized staff employed in police, prosecutors’ offices and courts is
increased by 20 per cent” because the data for 2020 was unavailable. However, anecdotally,
the number of children has increased, and results were achieved in increasing the number of
specialized staff, including victim and witness support providers, within police, prosecutor’s
offices and courts that are financed by local budgets, from 19 to 21 in 2020 and to 24 in
41
2021. This is a highly sustainable result. In addition, with support from the Working Group,
the HJPC developed and adopted minimum standards for child-friendly interviewing rooms,
which prescribe standards for interviewing children including psychosocial support as
mandatory for all child victims and witnesses, which marks a real breakthrough in the
approach towards child victims and witnesses.
Anecdotally, the project has contributed to the reduction of recidivism among children in
conflict with the law, however again, the evaluation was unable to assess this due to the RS
and FBiH statistics no longer containing data on recidivism. While it may be the case that
recidivism has fallen, it would be difficult to directly attribute this as being a result of the
project, particularly in view of the COVID-19 context, which meant that children were under
curfew for large parts of the last year, not attending school, and thus potentially had less
opportunity for committing offences.
Results were achieved in the number of minor offence reports against children issued by
police, with the project over-achieving its goal of a 15 per cent reduction and achieving a 35
per cent reduction (639 total: 584 boys; 55 girls) in 2020 alone. This could in part be due to
the school-based secondary prevention programme (discussed in more detail below), which
identifies both children at risk of offending and children at risk of harm and has been
successfully rolled out with the support of the project in the entire RS and to four out of ten
cantons in BiH. In 2020 alone, the programme reached more than 7,000 children at risk and
provided early intervention and support services. It could also be in part due to the increased
use of alternative measures and diversion. However, as mentioned above, the extent to
which the project contributed to the reduction in minor offence reports against children and
the extent to which the COVID-19 prevention measures contributed cannot be assessed.
EQ3.2: How well do the project’s results contribute to achievement of the project’s
objectives?
Finding 3.2: The project generated important, relevant and effective results that
contributed to the achievement of its overall objective, namely that children in justice
processes are dealt with in compliance with international standards on justice for
children and that decisions are taken in their best interests. However, these
objectives have not yet been fully realized and there is a need for greater budgetary
allocation for justice for children, leadership by relevant governmental authorities and
the potential introduction of stronger accountability mechanisms to respond to the
gaps in implementation of the relevant laws.
With regard to output A1 (gaps in laws, by-laws and policies identified and recommendations
for reforms made) the target for the project was to undertake an analysis of the Family Laws
in RS, FBiH and BD. According to the latest available data, an analysis has been initiated
with the RS MoJ, but not with the FBiH or BD MoJs. However, throughout the lifespan of the
project, results were achieved in terms of strengthening the normative framework and
bringing legislation in line with international standards, particularly with regard to the Laws on
Juvenile Justice. For example, the Laws on Protection and Treatment of Children and
Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings, adopted in RS in 2010, Brcko District (BD) in 2011 and
FBiH in 2014 (entering into force within one year after their adoption) established a solid
legal framework in the area of justice for children. Subsequently, all rulebooks accompanying
the Laws were developed and adopted. The Laws have introduced key international
standards such as diversion from formal proceedings, criminal responsibility set above 14
years of age, restorative justice principles (mediation), special protection measures such as
42
specialized victim and witness support, limitation of the number of hearings (to a maximum
of two), and audio video recording of child interviews. As part of the project, the
implementation of the Law in RS was assessed and analysed, and gaps and challenges
were identified in consultations with relevant stakeholders. The amendments to the Law
came into force in 2020. Harmonization of the relevant legislation across BiH, including the
Laws on Protection, legislation on free legal aid and the family laws, is still outstanding,
affecting the equal treatment of children across BiH.
Under output 2 – (budgeting of laws, by-laws and policies for justice for children and social
welfare systems are established and advocacy for financing by governmental institutions has
taken place) the project aimed to have budgets for two laws/policies related to justice, one in
each entity. According to UNICEF’s M&E project framework to date, no laws or policies have
been successfully integrated into the entity budgets, although this does not accurately reflect
the reality. In general, the laws cannot be adopted by the parliaments without first being
assessed and budgeted by the Ministries of Finance. To assess budgeting of policies and
laws, UNICEF developed two budget briefs that showed the complexity of financing of child
protection services. It is planned that the budgeting will go in line with the development of
J4C strategies, although this has not happened yet despite extensive advocacy at the
ministerial level. However, all the services that are introduced by the Law on Protection are
financed from local budgets, with certain gaps that are already identified in this Evaluation
Report (e.g. lack of funds for capacity-building, insufficient presence of expert associates
etc.). UNICEF is also currently supporting the development of Social Service Workforce
Action Plans and J4C strategies at entity and district level to address this. With Centres for
Social Welfare recognized as the weak link in the support programmes due to over-stretched
capacities, the project supported the development of budget briefs and action plans for
strengthening the social service workforce in child protection for each of the entities and BD,
however these have yet to be costed, or finalized and adopted. The draft action plans
promote stronger multisectoral cooperation, referral pathways, licensing and capacity-
building.
More specifically, a steering committee for strengthening the social service workforce in child
protection was established in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in 2019, representing the two entities and
BD and the BiH Ministry of Civil Affairs, with the objective of guiding implementation of the
UNICEF regional priorities outlined in Call to Action: Strengthening the social work and social
service workforce in Europe and Central Asia as an investment in our childrens future. As one of the
first steps in this framework, an assessment of the social service workforce in child protection in BiH
was finalized. The scope of the assessment was countrywide, with an assessment report presenting the
findings for the Federation of BiH, Republika Sprska and the Brčko District. The assessment relied on
both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods as well as primary and secondary data
sources and included the online survey. This resulted in a comprehensive final report consisting of
findings and recommendations.
Following the report, over 340 professionals from all of BiH participated in the action
planning process, led by line ministries, resulting in a three-year action plan to strengthen
the social service workforce in each of the entities. In cooperation with the international
agency “Maestral”, training on “Costing of Social and Child Protection Services” was
organized, for key stakeholders from line ministries, academia and associations of social
workers and aligned workforces.
43
Line ministries from both entities and BD express strong commitment to continue
strengthening the social service workforce in a systematic manner, to which the assessment
and development of action plans have contributed. Currently key governmental stakeholders
use action plans to align strategies and activities with budgeting opportunities for the social
service workforce in child protection. Line ministries in both entities started the work of
establishing a system of professional supervision, as a way to prevent professional burnout.
Also, activities are underway to support a system for licensing or accreditation of social work
that would further strengthen sustainability of professional development and support to the
social service workforce in BiH.
In collaboration with the Una-Sana Canton (USC) Association of Social Workers, the project
identified the need to further strengthen the capacities of centres for social welfare, aiming to
enhance social work practitioners’ professional skills and competence, improve the quality of
practice, and ensure continued professional development. Development of the supervision
programme in USC was defined as a priority in 2020 but, although the cantonal ministry
recognized the need, there was a lack of funding for implementation.
During the initial implementation of the programme, 12 professionals working in centres for
social welfare benefited from group supervision. In 2021, the development of the supervision
programme in USC continues as does the education of professionals through trainings that
will address key areas, such as foster care, guardianship and case management.
The project also supported the development of two cantonal assessments. The assessments
of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social and child protection aimed to understand
how this affected current beneficiaries of social protection – the most vulnerable population
in the country – and the needs of potential new beneficiaries. In close collaboration with
Employment Bureaux the primary assessment related to the situation of people who have
lost their jobs, as well as the impact on the social service workforce, social protection
institutions and overall social protection budgets. The assessments were conducted in close
cooperation with the Cantonal Ministries of Social Policy and Cantonal Associations of Social
Workers in Tuzla and Central Bosnia Canton. In total 25 municipalities (13 in Tuzla and 12 in
Central Bosnia Canton), 21 centres for social work and 4 municipal social services, as well
as other social service providers, were assessed. A total of 4,085 social protection
beneficiaries were interviewed, 368 professionals from social protection institutions, 47
managers of local social protection institutions, and 763 persons who lost their jobs during
pandemics.
Findings of the assessments were presented to a wider group of stakeholders at cantonal
levels (held in Tuzla and Jajce in September 2020), including Cantonal Assemblies, and they
are being used for the purpose of social protection strategic planning at cantonal levels
(including through the new Development Strategy planning). The findings were combined
with those of similar assessments conducted in three other cantons (Sarajevo, Zenica-Doboj
and Herzegovina-Neretva) and presented in a Policy Brief, which serves as a policy
advocacy tool. The most important outcome of these assessments is the positioning of the
shock-responsive social protection concept in Bosnia and Herzegovina, paving the way to
further programming in this area.
The project exceeded the expectations foreseen in its design and implementation of
capacity-building programmes (output A3) with 4,688 justice for children professionals
trained by April 2020, against a target of 4,000. A total of 13 training programmes were
developed by the same date, against a target of 11. The capacity-building programmes are
44
seen as one of the most successful initiatives of the J4C project, and in particular the joint,
multi-stakeholder trainings were assessed by FGD participants as “excellent”. The training
programmes were developed in cooperation with the respective ministries and implemented
in coordination with them; however additional resources are required to continue the
trainings. For example, in RS, beyond the regular trainings for judges and prosecutors,
mandatory legally prescribed certification training has not been provided for the past three
years. While this is in part due to the COVID-19 restrictions, the importance of the need for
regular capacity-building must not be allowed to slip going forward. There was a general
consensus among recipients of the training that the capacity-building was so successful
because it involved all stakeholders and provided an important and unique opportunity for all
stakeholders to listen to each other and understand the different roles. It also helped to
embed the “best interests of the child” principle into the work of professionals.
Training programmes also covered a pilot rehabilitation programme in the Una-Sana Canton,
involving training of professionals from the children’s detention home in Orasje, connecting
them with the social sector and volunteers, and creating a support network for children. The
pilot programme successfully supported two children, and was the first of its kind in BiH, but
the pandemic affected its continuation, and the relevant ministries did not show much
interest or engagement in its extension. While no formal assessment has been undertaken
as to the impact of the capacity development programmes, the evaluation team was
informed by recipients that it is visible in their everyday work.
From the survey conducted as part of this evaluation, almost all of the respondents thought
that the capacity-building programmes should be available at all locations in BiH but even
though 62 per cent of respondents thought it was likely that the capacity-building
programmes would continue in the future, from the comments provided clearly the prevalent
opinion was that only training programmes for judges and prosecutors were sustainable in
the longer term. With the high turnover rate and the legal requirement for certification to be
able to work with children, concerns were raised during interviews over the insufficient
number of certified social workers and police. Similarly, the majority of the survey
respondents thought that the number of specialized and trained professionals was the main
challenge in achieving an effective response to children in contact with law and children at
risk; while many professionals have been trained and certified, there is a constant turnover
of staff meaning that there is a constant requirement to train new staff.
Under output 4, the project has been supporting the introduction and increasing availability
of correctional recommendations. To this end, it aimed to increase, from 2 to 16, the number
of project locations with availability and accessibility of 4 key community-based diversionary
measures (regular school attendance, personal apology, damage compensation,
volunteering in a humanitarian organization). As of April 2020, this had been achieved in 12
project locations. The results regarding the introduction of diversion and alternative
measures have varied from court to court and among prosecutor’s offices, depending on
capacities but also willingness to engage. Due to extensive capacity-building, including by
providing training and certifying mediators from centres for social welfare, the important role
of expert associates in courts and prosecutor’s offices, the preparation of guidelines for their
implementation, and the work of Justice for Children Municipal Working Groups, by the end
of 2019, 4 out of 6 diversion measures prescribed by Law were available in 62 per cent of
BiH municipalities (FBiH 32 per cent; RS 100 per cent; BD 100 per cent).
45
The discrepancy between the entities could be explained in part by the fact that the Law
came into force earlier in RS, and major efforts were invested in its implementation, including
through the commitment and coordination of different ministries and sectors. The evaluation
team were informed that diversion measures were now available in 68 per cent of
municipalities and 65 per cent of prosecutors have used them at least once. Out of all
measures involving children in conflict with the law, the application of diversion measures
has significantly increased over the past 10 years, from 26 per cent in 2009 to 44 per cent in
2019. The total number of children in closed facilities on average has been less than 50 over
the past five years.
There are still challenges with the implementation of diversion and alternative measures
across BiH. As there is a lack of counselling institutions a process of identifying suitable
humanitarian organizations is still taking place and some social welfare institutions have no
trained mediators. In addition, some prosecutors are reluctant to use the alternative
measures, as their implementation “involves more work”, according to some FGD
participants, and cases cannot be closed until the measure is fully implemented. The survey
conducted as part of this evaluation found that the majority of the respondents were familiar
with personal apology (82 per cent), regular school attendance (84 per cent), attending
counselling (72 per cent), volunteering (68 per cent), medical institution treatment (56 per
cent), while only 49 per cent of respondents were aware of damage compensation. Only 34
per cent of the respondents thought the measures were sufficiently utilized. The most widely
used diversion measure is the police warning, which has been successfully used to facilitate
the work of the court and avoid the child going to court, but there are differences in its use
between municipalities, often based on whether the police in question had the knowledge of
how and when to use it.
There are also key knowledge and capacity gaps among judges and prosecutors on how
and when to use alternative and diversion measures, although it has to be kept in mind that
this was an entirely new approach in BiH and it takes time to change mindsets. Knowledge
among the online survey respondents regarding correctional measures also varied, with 87
per cent being aware of intensified supervision, and 80 per cent of warnings and referrals,
but only 42 per cent aware of special obligations. Only 37 per cent of respondents felt that
correctional measures are sufficiently used.
With regard to enhanced availability of data on child protection for administrative and
statistical purposes under output A5, the project aimed to publish four reports by the BiH
Ombudsman assessing institutions where children are detained. As of April 2020, three
reports had been published. The BiH Ombudsman expressed satisfaction with the
implementation of recommendations from the first report but called for the greater use of
alternatives to pre-trial detention. The second indicator under this output relates to recording
gender disaggregated data on child witnesses in the electronic Case Management System
(CMS) held by the HJPC. As detailed above, the project successfully advocated for the
mandatory disaggregation of all data in the CMS. Further, the project is supporting the
Working Group to enhance the CMS and to further align it with the requirements of the Law.
The project supported Municipal and Basic Courts to be better equipped to conduct child-
friendly proceedings through the expansion of child-friend interview rooms. As part of the
project, the standards for equipping and using child-friendly rooms were developed by a
multisectoral working group, and adopted by the HJPC in late 2020. As of April 2020, 28 out
of 50 child-friendly interview rooms had been equipped, which is an impressive achievement.
46
The evaluation team were also informed that UNICEF is currently preparing to equip the
additional 22 rooms, which is necessary to ensure critical sustainability. In addition, a
number of courts where child-friendly rooms should also be introduced have been identified
pending allocation of resources. No actor has been assigned or taken on the responsibility
for monitoring the impact of the introduction of the rooms.
The project has successfully strengthened child protection in emergency preparedness and
response (output A7) through the development of Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs)/Guidelines with a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities. To this end, SOPs
were developed for Centres for Social Work (CSW) in FBiH for the Protection of Refugee
and Migrant Children and Guidelines for CSW in FBiH on Child Protection Referral Pathways
for Children on the Move. With the number of crimes by refugee and migrant children
reportedly increasing, there is a possibility that the aim of equal access to justice for all
children is at risk of being undermined without a greater focus on J4C principles and
priorities for refugee and migrant children.
Under outcome B, the project was focused on the demand side of programming, within the
scope of four outputs. Output B1 aimed to increase the availability of expert associates for
children in conflict with the law and child victims/witnesses. This was measured through an
impact assessment of work on witness support providers as well as increasing the number of
expert associates working in justice institutions – namely courts and prosecutors’ offices.
Having exceeded its initial target to increase the number from 16 to 20, in April 2020, the
number had increased to 23. The evaluation team were informed that this has now been
extended to a total of 24 expert associates who have become fully funded, permanent
employees, rather than project-based staff. The evaluation team were informed that there is
a need for at least one expert associate in each court and prosecutor’s office, and in larger
regions two associates may be needed. However, the financial means to achieve this are not
available.
There was a perception among some stakeholders that there was a gap in the knowledge of
expert associates regarding how to concretely approach the work in justice institutions
because it was a completely new area. The expert associates felt that the lawyers who
provided their capacity-building approached it more from the point of view of what the expert
associates could not do, rather than what they could and should be doing. Even though the
expert associates were de jure recognized and provided for by the Law, the judicial system,
de facto did not recognize their role in it, so there was a need for the expert associates to
position themselves and define their role, both in the courts and in the prosecutor’s offices,
which varies.
“Through the project, the role of expert associates has now been recognized in the judicial
system.” Expert Associate FGD
The expert associates confirmed that judges and prosecutors are now approaching them for
advice, in particular on how to approach the child. Their role has a major impact on
promoting child-friendly procedures towards child offenders, victims and witnesses, and will
support the sustainability of practices. However, they also pointed out that the level of
capacity-building currently provided, including by the judicial and prosecutorial training
centres, is not sufficient and that the trainings are not sufficiently specialist. Further, the
trainings are too short and there is no continuous training to address this lack of knowledge.
Some expert associates feel that the judges and prosecutors only attend the training to “tick
the box” and to receive their certification. The expert associates commented on the
47
importance of the project in bringing them together to share experiences and commented
that the connections forged through the project still continue to this day.
“I benefited personally but also the whole system benefited and mostly children benefited
from the project.” Expert Associate FGD
3.3.1 Secondary prevention programmes
One of the biggest results secured by the project have been in relation to children at risk
benefiting from secondary prevention programmes in selected locations. The project aimed
to introduce the secondary prevention programme into 120 schools, but by April 2020 had
significantly exceeded this number by introducing it to 328 primary schools and 99
secondary schools. Since then, the programme has been fully institutionalized in all primary
and secondary schools in RS. It has been implemented in Sarajevo and Tuzla Cantons in
the FBiH and is currently being rolled out in two additional cantons – Una-Sana and Canton
10. While there is interest in the programme from other cantons, there are currently no
financial capacities to support this. The programme was considered in BD but there was a
lack of interest, and it was not introduced. According to the available data received from
UNICEF, for the 2020/2021 school year, the programmes targeted more than 110,000
children in RS, and the Sarajevo and Tuzla Cantons, more than 4,700 children have been
identified as at risk, and more than 1,500 individual plans were developed and are being
implemented for children at risk.
For the 2020/2021 school year, the school-based secondary prevention programme in
Sarajevo Canton targeted 37,536 children enrolled in 57 primary schools, with 815 children
(291 girls, 524 boys) identified as being at risk32. For 270 children (100 girls, 170 boys) at
risk individual plans were developed and are being implemented, while children with lower
risk were involved in group workshops aimed at building their skills in behavioural and
emotional control and social skills building.
In Tuzla Canton, a new assessment of children at risk at the beginning of the school year
has not been conducted due to COVID-19 measures. The school-based secondary
prevention programme continued to work with the focus on previously identified children at
risk (2019/2020 school year) in 55 primary schools. A total of 5,300 schoolchildren in the 10
to 14 age group have been targeted by the programme in 55 primary schools. A total of 590
children benefitted from individual work, and some 777 children have been involved in
educational workshops aimed at building their skills in behavioural, emotional control and
social skills building.
The school-based secondary programme in RS developed in collaboration with the RS
Pedagogical Institute and the RS Association of Psychologists, and the referral mechanism
to support children at risk has been implemented in 286 schools (187 elementary and 99
secondary schools). The programme reached some 110,000 children and identified 3,125
(1,082 girls, 2043 boys) children at risk, predominantly in urban areas. Direct support has

48
been provided to 2,090 children identified at risk through development and implementation of
755 individual plans and with individual or group work focused on peer and other forms of
violence, emotional literacy, and assertive communication.
While there is reasonable awareness of the secondary prevention programme among
professionals – 75 per cent of respondents to the survey were familiar with the programme –
25 per cent of respondents were either unfamiliar or somewhat familiar, indicating that
greater awareness efforts are still required. However, the school-based prevention
programmes were recognized by survey respondents as one of the greatest achievements
of the J4C programme, behind specialized capacity-building programmes, and the
introduction of relevant laws and policies.
Linked to the secondary protection programme was the development of family group
conferencing in RS and in Tuzla Canton. This efficient and easy-to-use tool brings together
families and other key individuals in the community with service providers to develop a care
package for the individual child identified at risk through the secondary prevention
programme. The approach was first piloted in 2018–2019, and the results showed that it was
a cost-effective, easy, efficient and applicable tool, which was well accepted by children,
teachers and professionals. The tool was further rolled out in RS during 2019–2020 and it is
suggested that it may be further rolled out in Una-Sana Canton, alongside the roll-out of the
secondary prevention programme. According to data provided by UNICEF, this type of
support has been made available to more than 44,000 children. Despite the COVID-19
restrictions introduced by ministries of education, 54 children and 74 parents were directly
supported in 2020.
The Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, and West Herzegovina Canton implemented the
secondary prevention programmes outside schools, relying on the development of municipal
action plans, multisectoral cooperation models and cooperation with experienced NGOs that
have already been working with children at risk through day centres such as Altruist from
Mostar and La Vie in Livno. Running of the day centre in Livno has been taken over by the
Centre for Social Welfare ensuring longer-term sustainability. From autumn 2020, the
school-based secondary prevention programme has also been rolled out in Canton 10.
Phase II of the J4C project already initiated the introduction and development of the
secondary prevention programmes, which were initially foreseen to be introduced through
the Municipal Working Groups. During Phase III the programme developed as three distinct
models covering wider geographical areas, RS, Sarajevo Canton and Tuzla Canton, in
addition to the continued efforts at the municipal working group level in Herzegovina-Neretva
and West Herzegovina Cantons. UNICEF provided support for the development of the
models but they developed independently one from another, utilizing different tools for
identification of at-risk children, including distinct sets of indicators, and different models of
providing support services for the children identified. The authorities relied on rigorous
processes for the development of indicators, involving relevant experts and academia.
While it was outside the scope of the ToR to assess all aspects of each of the models
individually, they all emphasized multisectoral coordination, successfully utilized external
referral services and contributed to the empowerment of children. All three models
strengthened the links between school professionals and Centres for Social Welfare and
Centres for Protection of Mental Health, but also with the police and the judiciary when
required. During key informant interviews the professionals reported that there are still
challenges with information sharing between different professionals and outstanding
49
questions on how the communication between different sectors can be improved while
ensuring respect for data protection and child rights.
The challenges in implementation of prevention programmes recognized by the stakeholders
interviewed, included the fact that the social services are often over-burdened and
sometimes have no time or resources to react to cases of children identified as at risk in a
timely way, reaffirming the need for strengthening the social protection system, as correctly
recognized by the project. Although the number of expert associates in schools increased
(more than doubled in RS in the last 10 years), the expert services in schools often have
insufficient resources and many schools do not have psychologists. In addition, many
professionals called for stronger links with parents of children at risk and greater awareness-
raising with both children and parents. Some stakeholders who were consulted also felt that
a higher level of local community involvement would further strengthen the prevention
results.
The secondary prevention programme has brought the issue of children at risk to the
awareness of the authorities and made school professionals, including expert services,
teachers and school management, aware that the role of schools is more than just
education. Professional staff have been supported to develop a more holistic approach to
recognizing and assisting children at risk, including by successfully developing referral
mechanisms and utilizing external services. Without multisectoral coordination, the
programmes would not have succeeded in identifying and supporting children at risk or
improving an understanding of the different roles of all those involved.
Although somewhat different in RS, Sarajevo Canton and Tuzla Canton, the development of
evidence-based risk indicators, and plans for individual support for children at risk,
developed in consultations with university professors and relevant experts, were praised as
“revolutionary” and highly successful in all three geographic areas, by KIIs, participants in
FGDs and in the online survey. The success of the secondary prevention programme is
evidenced by the successful roll-out of the system in RS and in an initial four cantons in BiH,
although further roll-out would benefit from peer-to-peer exchanges and adjustment of the
models based on best practices in the different models. The impact of the programme was
described by one KII as follows:
“The number of child offenders is much smaller but the number of at risk children is
higher so we are highly successful in keeping children out of the justice sector and
helping them earlier because of the project.” KII
The extent to which the secondary prevention programmes contributed to the reduction in
minor offence reports involving children cannot be assessed in this evaluation but the
reduction could in part be due to the successful identification of both children at risk of
offending and children at risk of harm; the provision of early intervention; and support
services in so many locations.
In terms of sustainability, the secondary prevention programme in schools has been fully
integrated into the system in RS, through standardization and validation for all primary and
secondary schools. The Standards for the Work of School Professionals Team
(pedagogues, psychologists and social workers) have been developed and issued by the RS
Pedagogical Institute, and include activities related to secondary prevention as part of school
professionals’ job descriptions. In addition, these standards have been incorporated in the
amendments made to legislation on primary and secondary education in RS in 2021. The
50
prevention programme in primary schools in the Sarajevo Canton has become a part of the
law on education and the Ministry of Education has taken over responsibility for the
supervision and mentorship of the programme. The Sarajevo Canton Action Plan for
Prevention of Offending and Protection of Children in Contact with the Law (2020–2022)
adopted by the cantonal authorities, prescribes the implementation of secondary prevention
in all elementary schools and establishment of a monitoring team composed of relevant
ministries and cantonal institutions. In Tuzla Canton, the programme has been approved by
the Ministry of Education, the necessary tools have been prepared, and the roll-out of the
programme is ongoing.
In January 2021, the FBiH governmental institutions recommended introducing the
secondary prevention programme into all cantons in FBiH as part of the FBiH strategy on
prevention of violence and violent extremism as the model includes indicators for
identification which are very similar to the violent extremism indicators.
There were concerns among stakeholders that once the project comes to an end, there will
be a lack of supervision and quality control over the process. Of those responding to the
survey, 84 per cent considered the programme effective, however, only 53 per cent of
respondents thought the programmes likely to continue in the future. Continued efforts are
required to fully embed the existing programmes into the system, to ensure their financial
sustainability and ensure the further roll-out of the most successful model(s).
However, there seem to be significant differences between the school-based prevention
models used, as these relied on different referral mechanisms, municipal action plans, but
also different methodologies, including family group conferencing, case conferences,
individual case support plans and adopted different approaches to the roll-out of prevention
programmes in secondary schools. During key informant interviews, the evaluators were told
that the authorities and experts in each of the areas were not aware of the details of how the
other models are being implemented. There is great scope for scaling up the Secondary
Prevention Programme based on lessons learned and best practices gathered during J4C
Phase III. As full implementation of some of the programmes is relatively recent, there is a
need for lessons learned and peer-to-peer exchanges between professionals who are
working on different programmes to be able to learn from each other and further improve the
programmes. There is also scope for scaling up the successful models of secondary
prevention programmes and the relevant authorities will need support to decide on the most
appropriate model and plan its introduction into secondary schools. Children in secondary
schools have reached the age at which they can be considered criminal minors, so it is
crucial that they have access to the support and services they require to avoid coming into
contact with the justice system. As many as 92 per cent of the survey respondents thought
these programmes should be rolled out in all locations.
With regard to output B3 (improved availability of and access to legal aid for children and
their families) the project’s goal was to establish an online advice and referral system. While
this goal has not been met, other results have been achieved, which are not measurable
through the project’s logframe. The project supported the strengthening of the Network of
Free Legal Aid (FLA) providers, which currently includes all seven cantons in FBiH where
FLA is available, BD Offices, RS Centre for FLA and another five NGOs. This represents all
relevant organizations working on FLA in the entire territory of BiH. As with many other
legislative areas, the Laws on FLA are yet to be harmonized. The project is supporting the
establishment of a Working Group on Free Legal Aid, which will analyse the legal
51
framework, with a view to making recommendations for legislative strengthening at the level
of BiH. Members of the FLA Network will be included in the working group, with the aim of
ensuring that the entire plethora of rights for children can be harmonized and the quality of
service provision ensured.
The FLA Network is engaged in continuous capacity-building for different sectors, as well as
developing referral mechanisms, for example, among schools, police, NGOs, lawyers,
courts, CSWs among others. They also plan to introduce awareness-raising on the right to
free legal aid and how to access it, in schools. The Network has developed a coordinated
action plan, which includes media campaigns, awareness-raising, capacity-building,
harmonization of legislative and policy frameworks, and legal clinics for the future education
of law students. The Network still needs to develop a strong analytical data collection tool,
with which to monitor and analyse progress. They also need to finalize the development of a
harmonized website, which already includes details of all the members in the Network, how
to contact them and information about their services. Awareness of the right to free legal aid
remains low at only 55 per cent of respondents to the online survey, with an expectation that
this level would be even lower among the general public.
The focus of the J4C project and juvenile justice reform processes was on children in contact
with the law in criminal proceedings with less focus on rights violations in civil proceedings.
Many stakeholders interviewed emphasized the need for greater attention to the position of
children in civil proceedings, in particular during divorce proceedings. The Office of the BiH
Ombudsman reported that the biggest number of complaints they receive concerning
violation of child rights refers to children in divorce proceedings.
The final output supported by the project related to increased knowledge and awareness of
children and youth on how to access the justice system. Based on the desk research,
document review and stakeholder consultations, the evaluation team found little evidence of
progress in this area. The development of a comprehensive, interactive online Know Your
Rights App for children and youth is yet to be completed so the project did not reach its
targeted 40,000 children and youth having information on where and how to access the
justice system. It is envisaged that this will be finalized by November 2021 and the end of
the no-cost extension project implementation period.
3.4 Project Impact
EQ4.1: What are the effects of the project on its environment – the positive and negative
changes produced by the project (directly or indirectly, intended or unintended)?
Finding 4.1: It is indisputable that the project has had a large impact in improving the
position of children within the justice system and fundamentally changed the
approach to children in the system. It has brought the issue of children at risk and
children in contact with the law to the awareness of the authorities; it has
strengthened the legislative and policy framework for children; it has improved their
access to justice; it has created strong multisectoral coordination; and it has
embedded the “best interests of the child” principle into the system.
“Children who were previously invisible in the system are now visible.” Participant KII
This is perhaps the biggest impact that the 10 years of project interventions have achieved.
The project raised awareness among the authorities of the rights of children in contact with
52
the law and improved the position of children within the justice (and social protection)
system(s). The project has fundamentally changed the approach towards children, which is
now much more child-friendly and aligned with the best interests of the child principle. For
example, children can now be identified earlier through the secondary prevention
programme; bespoke care packages can be tailored to the individual child in line with their
individual needs; they can receive diversion measures without proceeding immediately to the
court; they can be interviewed in child-friendly rooms and by professionals trained in how to
approach children; and if they do receive a custodial sentence, they now serve their time in a
juvenile detention facility rather than in an adult prison.
One of the biggest impacts that the project has had indirectly, and which was unintended,
regards the level of multisectoral coordination that has been achieved. Consistently, in all
KIIs and FGDs, as well as among the respondents to the online survey, stakeholders raised
this issue as one of the most important results of the project, and which has had a huge
impact on the approach to children in the justice system.
“The biggest success is linking people together through multisectoral coordination
mechanisms – everyone now knows each other personally.” KII
The project successfully brought together wide-ranging institutions from courts and
prosecutors’ offices, to CSW, CMH, FLA providers, schools, police, and relevant NGOs and
CSOs. For some of the institutions, for example the Centres for Protection of Mental Health,
the training provided and subsequent coordination meetings served as a first exposure to the
J4C area.
“Ten years ago, there were no institutions dealing with children and now there are many.” KII
The establishment of such a high level of cooperation among wide-ranging stakeholders and
the introduction of new stakeholders into the system – e.g. CSW, NGOs etc. who previously
were not part of the juvenile justice issue – was critical in ensuring that children in justice
processes are dealt with in compliance with international standards on justice for children
and that decisions are taken in their best interests. The project greatly increased awareness
of the importance of coordination in this respect.
“Cooperation between CSW, CMH, courts, police, prosecutors etc. would for sure only exist
on paper without the support of the project.” KII
Through its secondary prevention programme, the project had impact in making school
professionals, including expert services, teachers and school management, aware that the
role of schools is more than just education, and supported them to develop a more holistic
approach to recognizing and assisting children at risk, including by successfully developing
referral mechanisms and utilizing external services. The project successfully supported the
implementation of a completely new system of diversion and alternative measures which,
while still requiring further support to fully embed them into the system, have already started
to have an impact.
“We can already see that there are fewer repeat offenders because of these measures ... In
2018 we had a meeting in Neum, where we discussed results and the conclusion was that
recidivism had decreased.” Participant FGD
With the support of the project, the capacity-building programmes created the pre-conditions
for professionals to be active in juvenile justice. And while there are still some gaps in fully
53
harmonizing laws, the legislative and policy framework has been considerably strengthened
through the assistance of the project to analyse the existing legislation and identify gaps.
Assessing the causal links between the project and the impact can perhaps best be
summarized by one FGD participant:
“Some things would have developed without the project, but the changes would have been
more modest and they would not have influenced the system, there would not be the level of
multisectoral coordination, and it would not be as effective.” Participant FGD
3.5 Project Sustainability
EQ5.1: What is the probability of the benefits of the project continuing in the long term?
Finding 5.1: The project results achieved sustainability in terms of promoting greater
local ownership and a change in attitudes towards children in contact with the law
and children at risk. The results of the project that have been integrated into the
legislative framework or official procedures are likely to continue in the long term and
there is great scope for harmonizing the approaches by promoting learning and
exchanges of good practices and scaling them up across BiH. Future sustainability
will require additional efforts to integrate J4C into ongoing reform efforts and funding
opportunities, including the EU reform agenda.
The greatest benefit of this project over the last ten years was assessed to be the
fundamental shift in the approach to children when in contact with law, and the changed
perceptions among stakeholders. These include greater visibility of children and emphasis
on child rights and the best interests of the child, all of which are likely to be sustainable.
The stakeholders interviewed have assessed that the J4C project activities that have been
integrated into the legislative framework, official procedures or school programmes, are likely
to continue. According to the survey, the laws, expert associates in courts and prosecutor’s
offices, specific training for judges, prosecutors and police on working with children, and
capacity-building on implementation of the Law were assessed as most likely to continue in
the future. Fewer respondents were confident that the secondary prevention programmes in
schools and free legal aid would continue without additional support and investments, while
the adoption of municipal action plans and rehabilitation programmes were mostly assessed
as somewhat likely to continue in the future.
The major constraint to sustainability is the availability of resources, adequate budgeting,
and the lack of high-level political backing, to ensure that children’s access to justice remains
a key priority in the future. Other issues that might affect sustainability of the benefits of the
project included the potential absence of quality education programmes while facing high
turnover of staff, the withdrawal of supervision and the quality control that is currently being
provided by UNICEF once the project ends, and the lack of accountability mechanisms.
Sustainability of results is supported by the introduction of a greater number of expert
associates in courts and prosecutor’s offices, and the overall increase in the number of
specialized staff, including as victim and witness support providers, within the police,
prosecutor’s offices and those courts that are financed by local budgets. Sustainability will be
further reinforced if the number of expert associates is increased to cover even more courts
and prosecutor’s offices.
54
The project facilitated the development and dissemination of a large number of documents
and standards, many of which have been adopted by the relevant institutions and integrated
into the system, thus promoting sustainability. Some of the relevant documents include the
Standards for Equipping Child-Friendly Rooms, adopted by HJPC; guidelines and rulebooks
on secondary prevention for identification and response to children at risk (RS, Sarajevo
Canton, Tuzla Canton); guidelines for the implementation of specific diversion measures,
including mediation, regular school attendance and humanitarian work; HJPC
recommendations on the work of expert associates in the judiciary among others. The
overview of available mechanisms for implementation of diversion and alternative measures
in FBiH is due to be finalized before the end of the project, as is the compendium of legal
texts for the future education of law students on child rights in justice processes.
The establishment of municipal working groups, action plans, referral mechanisms and the
focus of capacity-strengthening and education programmes on multisectoral coordination,
including by involving different sectors as educators, led to greater awareness of different
roles and promoted multisectoral coordination. Awareness of the need for multisectoral
coordination and of the different roles of sectors will support sustainability of the
coordination, but not all the municipalities or Cantons have been included in project work.
In terms of capacity-building programmes, the obligatory mandatory education for judges,
prosecutors and police to be certified for working with children will likely continue through the
Centres for Education of Judges and Prosecutors and Police Academies. Education for other
sectors relied more on external funding and might be less sustainable, especially for the
social sector.
The secondary prevention programme in schools has been fully integrated into the system in
RS. It has become a part of the law on education in the Sarajevo Canton and the
programme has been approved by the Ministry of Education in Tuzla Canton. However,
continued efforts are required to fully embed the existing programmes into the system, and
to ensure their financial sustainability.
While diversion and alternative measures are now fully incorporated into the Law, their
implementation across BiH varies, with some measures only starting to be implemented.
Their full implementation depends on whether the right conditions are in place (the
institutions have adequate resources and the relevant professionals have adequate
knowledge) but also on the commitment of individuals. Finding a way to recognize the effort
of deciding on diversion and alternative measures would promote sustainability.
The Free Legal Aid Network is somewhat likely to continue its activities of promoting the
harmonization of legal aid for children, but its activities will be more certain and of greater
impact with continued support by donors. While some of the legal aid centres providing free
aid to vulnerable children are funded by governmental authorities, there are still locations
where it is provided only by the non-governmental sector, relying on donor funding.
The legal aid clinics through which law students can be trained in both theoretical and
practical aspects of child protection and child rights under the supervision of lawyers from a
legal aid institution promote ownership and sustainability by raising the awareness of future
legal practitioners of child rights. Preparation of the compendium of relevant texts to be used
by law faculties in the future supports continuation of the programme beyond the availability
of the donor funding.
55
Ownership
Finding 5.2: The project activities and results were focused on building the system
and the strong sense of ownership of the project was in part promoted by the Project
Coordination Board. However, there is scope to further strengthen the ownership of
local, cantonal, district and entity processes.
Most of the governmental stakeholders interviewed expressed a strong sense of ownership
over the implementation of the Law, but the important role UNICEF played in the overall
justice for children reform also meant that it was often perceived as the lead owner of the
process and thus there is still scope for strengthening governmental institutions’ ownership.
When asked about the future priorities many respondents connected UNICEF with the
governing institutions as the owners of the processes, and used the expressions such as
“the next priority for UNICEF and the institution would be...”.
The widespread understanding and awareness of the importance of J4C measures and the
respect for child rights authorities is one of the major benefits of this project and, in many
places, there is a critical mass of stakeholders willing and able to promote justice for children
processes. However, all stakeholders are still counting on UNICEF to provide further
support, including technical support, advocacy, but also financial support for parts of the
programme.
The Project Coordination Board, which was recognized as unique for BiH in this field and as
a good practice in promoting coordination and harmonization, had a major role in promoting
ownership by governmental institutions. But the Board members still sometimes struggled
with a full understanding of their role and the follow-up expected after Board meetings.
Many stakeholders felt that there would be rollbacks in project results if there is no UNICEF
engagement from 2022 and that additional dialogue is needed with local authorities at all
levels to further strengthen ownership.
Scalability
Finding 5.3: There is good scope for scaling up the Secondary Prevention Programme
based on lessons learned and best practices gathered during Justice for Every Child
Phase III. Similarly, there is great scope for scaling up the good practices from one
region to another to promote the use of diversion and alternative measures, as well as
the use of expert associates.
As per the schema on scalability included in the Inception Report and provided in annex 7,
the evaluation team also assessed the potential of project activities for further expansion and
scaling-up.
As mentioned elsewhere in this report, the project successfully adjusted its proposed
activities to the contextual reality in different jurisdictions and geographic areas of BiH, which
resulted in slightly different models being developed and implemented across the country.
The secondary prevention programmes can provide the most visible example. Three
different models for the secondary prevention programmes in schools were developed in RS,
Sarajevo Canton and Tuzla Canton, and the models developed to react to identified cases of
children at risk were even more numerous. As the full implementation of some of the
programmes is relatively recent, there is a need for lessons learned and peer-to-peer
exchanges between professionals who are working on different programmes to be able to
56
learn from each other and further improve the programmes. There is great scope to scale up
the successful models of secondary prevention programmes and the relevant authorities will
need support to decide on the most appropriate model. In RS all elementary and secondary
schools use the secondary prevention model while the FBiH strategy on prevention of
violence and violent extremism includes the recommendation to expand the secondary
prevention to all the schools, but is as yet unclear which model would be used.
Although the diversion and alternative measures are almost identically foreseen by the Laws
in the different jurisdictions in BiH, implementation on the ground varied greatly, with
different diversion and alternative measures implemented to different extents in
municipalities. It was also necessary to overcome resistance by some institutions. As an
example, the correctional recommendation of volunteering was successfully implemented in
Bihac almost immediately after the Law came into force in FBiH because there was a strong
NGO “Zene sa Une” that helped facilitate the implementation while some municipalities
consider that conditions are still not suitable to introduce the measure; the use of police
warning is very much used in one municipality but almost non-existent in another; and the
use of personal apology and compensation depends on the availability and skills of
mediators. There is clearly great scope for scaling up the good practices from one region to
another to promote the use of diversion and alternative measures.
The introduction and training of psychologists as expert associates, into the courts and
prosecutor’s offices was recognized as a major benefit for children in contact with the law.
The evaluation team was told that there are currently 24 expert associates across the
country but that this support would be more effective if the associates could cover all district
and cantonal courts and prosecutor’s offices. Although the associates who are newly hired,
have no access to the detailed education programme organized for the first trainees, they
can rely on their trained colleagues for support and peer-to-peer knowledge exchange. The
evaluation team finds that there is also good scope for scaling up the usage of expert
associates.
3.6 Coherence
EQ6.1: To what extent is UNICEF coordinating with development partners and other UN
agencies to avoid overlaps, leverage contributions and catalyze joint work?
NB: The time allocated to data collection did not allow the evaluation team opportunity to
conduct KIIs with either the European Union or any of the other UN Agencies. The findings
below have been drawn based on the analysis of KIIs with UNICEF, the project’s donors and
other relevant organizations, as well as from responses to the online survey, and the desk
research and document review processes.
Finding 6.1: UNICEF has made positive steps in terms of leveraging contributions and
catalyzing joint work with the EU and the two organizations are key allies with regard
to policy dialogue and advocacy efforts.
The evaluation sought to analyse the level of coherence UNICEF has achieved with
development partners and other UN Agencies. In BiH, in terms of development partners, the
EU remains the main stakeholder, in particular in its role with the judicial reform process, but
also in terms of policy formulation and direct assistance and support to governmental
institutions through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA), and to CSOs.
57
UNICEF and the EU developed an Engagement Plan, where agreement was made on joint
key advocacy messages and the two organizations also cooperate in terms of policy
dialogue. UNICEF is also engaged as an office for IPA funding. In practical terms, UNICEF
sought out opportunities to collaborate with the EU, based on their respective comparative
advantages. For example, UNICEF’s standards were incorporated into the EU’s
infrastructure project to renovate the child detention facility in Orasje and UNICEF provided
capacity-building support to the facility’s staff. Cooperation was also successful in terms of
building four new courts, which have child-friendly rooms in accordance with the standards
developed.
“The synergies (between UNICEF and the EU) are good, and we speak with one voice.” KII
However, the evaluation finds that going forward, UNICEF should work even more closely
with the EU and its priorities, especially with regard to the National Justice Reform Strategy.
For example, the huge training needs should be fully institutionalized. The ministries have
limited capacity, and political backstopping, particularly at the higher levels, is missing.
Through creating a closer partnership with the EU, UNICEF can lobby and advocate
together with the EU to push these issues onto the political agenda.
Finding 6.2: There is potential for coordination with other UN agencies, in order to
maximize resource potential and strengthen complementarities.
With respect to other UN Agencies, UNDP is the main potential partner, and the two
agencies have a partnership as and when needed. Although UNDP is no longer actively
involved in justice sector reform in BiH, there are other areas where the two agencies could
explore collaboration. UNICEF’s J4C project built on the successes of UNDP’s Victim and
Witness Support Programme, in particular with regard to multisectoral coordination
mechanisms and the provision of free legal aid. However, since then, there has been little
opportunity for coordination between the two agencies on J4C programmatic work, largely
because UNDP phased out of supporting the justice sector. The J4C project’s donors in
particular pointed out the need for greater coordination between UNDP and UNICEF. One
opportunity that is currently being explored relates to UNDP’s local budgeting initiative, and
the possibility of integrating some of UNICEF’s strategic planning processes into the local
budgeting processes (see also above under 3.5 - Sustainability). While this is a long-term
and challenging task, the opportunity should be actively pursued by both agencies, not just
to leverage synergies and enhance coordination, but also as a valuable contribution towards
furthering the sustainability of the J4C project results.
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework previously provided opportunities
for coordination and technical support among the agencies and has been replaced by the
United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF). The new
UNSCDF and UNICEF’s Country Programme Document, will include a joint outcome on
Governance & Rule of Law, providing greater opportunity for coordination and synergies
between agencies.
3.7 Cross-cutting Issues
EQ7.1: To what extent does the project adopt a human rights-based approach and integrate
gender and other social-inclusion considerations relevant to boys and girls?
58
Finding 7.1: The project successfully adopted a human rights-based approach in its
design and implementation, working on both the supply and demand sides of
development programming. However, while the project does include some gender
disaggregated data, gender and social inclusion are not the primary focus of the
project.
The project was designed from the outset from a HRBA perspective, and addressed the
institutional development and capacity-building of duty bearers through outcome A,
combined with awareness-raising of rights holders under outcome B. The HRBA crucially
works with both service providers, in terms of strengthening their capacities to deliver
transparent, accountable, equitable and quality services, and with rights-holders to raise
awareness of their rights and develop their capacities to demand them. The evaluation team
finds that the project was successful in both its design and its implementation in adopting the
HRBA.
There is less evidence as to how the project integrated gender and other social-inclusion
considerations relevant to boys and girls either into the project design or into its
implementation. While the project did include families’ and children’s perspectives to some
extent in the project and empowered them through raising awareness of their rights, the
evaluation team find that the project could have gone further in this regard. The project was
successful in advocating for the inclusion of gender disaggregated data in the CMS
implemented by the HJPC, and some gender disaggregated data was included in its
indicators. As one of the project donors commented “gender is not the strongest part of the
project”.
The extensive capacity-building aspect of the project involved the relevant expertise on child
rights, also including the Ombudsman for Children as an educator, and used the Guidelines
on Best Interests of the Child, produced with the support of UNICEF. While child
consultations were integrated in the development of some activities (development of
indicators to identify children at risk in RS as an example), they were not necessarily
included in all activities and child-friendly information materials, although some were planned
as part of the project, but are not yet available. Options to use alternatives to detention for
children are still to be fully explored.
EQ7.2: To what extent was the Project able to adapt to the COVID-19 context and adjust its
activities accordingly?
Finding 7.2: UNICEF was able to respond swiftly to the COVID-19 context through
amending certain project activities and adjusting its implementation approach. All
partners were satisfied with the speed and manner with which UNICEF reacted to
adapt the programmes to the pandemic and address the newly emerging priority
children’s needs. However, while recognizing the challenges, greater use of online
delivery of training and other project activities could have been made.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reached BiH in early March 2020, UNICEF,
in collaboration with the competent ministries and NGOs, identified the following priorities in
terms of social and child protection, as detailed in the UNICEF BiH COVID-19 response
plan:
• Support BD, entity, including relevant cantonal and municipal institutions to conduct
rapid assessments of the situation of the social protection beneficiaries and, based
on that, propose immediate response measures and social protection programmes;
59
• Ensure continuity of child protection services;
• Mitigate risks of all forms of violence and abuse of children; and
• Address mental health and psychosocial support and stigma prevention.
As a result, activities under output A7 were amended and additional indicators were
identified relating to: the number of children both directly indirectly affected by COVID-19
benefiting from quality child protection support and standards; the number of children directly
and/or indirectly affected by COVID-19 benefiting from mental health and psychosocial
support; and the number of cantonal assessments completed and social protection
programmes developed.
Funds were immediately freed up from both of the project’s donors in order to procure
personal protective equipment (PPE) and IT equipment to continue implementing the
project’s activities. Una-Sana Canton was prioritized for PPE because of the number of
refugees and migrants. A needs assessment was conducted, and the project was
continuously working with its partners to provide the requisite support.
“UNICEF was able to keep children at the centre of the government’s response to COVID-
19.” KII
A positive side-effect of the COVID-19 context was that multisectoral coordination improved
even further, as different sectors realized their need to work with their colleagues. Another
positive outcome was that there was a stronger will among governmental institution partners
to cooperate with NGOs in their COVID-19 response efforts.
While UNICEF’s response was timely and appropriately addressed the needs of
stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the project, especially for
the secondary prevention programme, and it was difficult to achieve the same level of
outreach. The pandemic certainly had an impact in slowing down the implementation of
activities and the secondary prevention programme had fewer opportunities once children
switched to online school. Similarly, expert associates felt that there were fewer coordination
meetings because of the COVID-19 situation and that the judiciary did not take into
consideration child rights sufficiently. However, a knock-on effect of this was to indicate the
need that support should also be extended to families, as to some extent COVID-19 opened
the door to where the secondary prevention programme should focus next.
60
4. Conclusions
The evaluation findings show that UNICEF has successfully implemented three phases of
the Justice for Every Child project in BiH over a ten-year period, achieving meaningful and
quantifiable results. They have built and maintained close working relationships with its key
stakeholders, which has the effect of building trust through continually demonstrating that
UNICEF is a reliable and active partner. While it has positioned itself as an integrator,
coordination without UNICEF remains a key challenge and the overall fragmentation of the
operating environment represents a sizeable constraint.
Relevance
[Conclusion 1] UNICEF positioned itself as the lead actor addressing access to justice for
children issues in BiH. The J4C project was relevant both to UNICEF’s own strategic
priorities, but more importantly, to those of BiH and its entities and district, and those of its
donors and development partners. The project design was evidence-based and informed by
extensive stakeholder consultations, although undertaking a gender and social inclusion
analysis and the additional capturing of the voices of children could have further
strengthened the design and implementation. The practice of stakeholder consultation
seems well embedded and provides a solid foundation of good practice among actors.
UNICEF’s role in advocating for the voices of children to be incorporated, and where
appropriate providing or facilitating access to capacity-building should be strengthened.
[Findings 1.1 and 1.2]
Efficiency
[Conclusion 2] The J4C project provided good value for money, with results being achieved
beyond the sum of the component parts. Cost efficiencies were achieved through a lean
staffing structure and utilizing to the greatest extent local or in-house expertise. Strong
partnerships were created with relevant stakeholders and the use of NGOs/CSOs to support
project implementation was not only cost-effective but also had the knock-on effect of
strengthening the relationship between governmental institutions and civil society. Good
examples are the referral mechanism utilized in RS as part of the school-based secondary
prevention programme or the implementation of the community-based diversionary
measures. The project had an M&E framework that was very much tied to the programmatic
M&E structures and the project’s indicators were not sufficient to fully capture the project’s
results. The indicators were purely quantitative, failing to capture fully the project’s progress
and results. A greater use of qualitative indicators that measure perceptions and behaviour
at the outcome level would probably better capture project progress and results, as well as
contributions towards the outcomes and impact. [Findings 2.1 and 2.2]
Effectiveness
[Conclusion 3] The project has achieved tangible and measurable results contributing
towards ensuring that children in justice processes are dealt with in compliance with
international standards on justice for children and that decisions are taken in their best
interests. However, the project was hampered to some extent by the complexities of the
context within which it was operating and the fragmentation of the system across state,
61
entity, district and cantonal lines. This meant that UNICEF had to localize and tailor each of
its interventions at the local level, in order to achieve measurable results. The fragmentation
of the system has also meant that children throughout BiH do not have access to the same
level of support services. It is the evaluation team’s assessment that without this level of
localization, with tailor-made, contextualized initiatives, the project would not have
progressed as well as it did, and results would not have been as successful. UNICEF was
able to achieve the results it did through tailoring each intervention to the specific context, be
it BiH level, entity, district, cantonal or municipal. But the fragmentation of the system and
the level of contextualization that was required means there is not yet a fully harmonized
approach and that some of the interventions and results were also uneven. Given the
realities of the context within which the project is being implemented, it seems expedient for
UNICEF to continue to strongly advocate for a harmonized approach but, where this is not
possible, to tailor interventions to the realities on the ground. [Findings 3.1 and 3.2]
Impact
[Conclusion 4] The project has had broad-ranging impact in improving the position of
children within the justice system in BiH. Through integration of the best interests of the child
principle, the project has contributed towards completely changing the approach towards
children in the justice system. This has been integrated into the normative framework
through legislative and policy reforms, as well as into service provision from a wide range of
stakeholders including courts and prosecutors’ offices, CSWs, CMHs, schools, free legal aid
providers and NGOs/CSOs. While it is certain that some activities and results would have
been achieved without UNICEF’s support, it is equally certain that results would not have
been achieved to the extent that they have, nor as quickly. [Finding 4.1]
Sustainability
[Conclusion 5] The project has had key successes with regard to ensuring sustainability of
results after the end of the project. In particular, aspects which have been included in the
legislative and policy frameworks, official procedures of school programmes, and are
budgeted for, are likely to continue because these aspects are now be embedded in practice
and they are resourced. [Findings 5.1 and 5.3]
[Conclusion 6] The biggest constraints to sustainability are the availability of funding and the
absence of sufficient political backstopping at the highest levels, to ensure that children’s
access to justice remains a key priority in the future. There are concerns among
stakeholders that once the project comes to an end, there will be a lack of supervision and
quality control over the process, as well as a lack of accountability, which may lead to
previous results regressing. [Finding 5.1]
[Conclusion 7] UNICEF was recognized as the lead coordinator in terms of access to justice
for children in BiH and among all the stakeholders had a niche role as integrator. While one
of the biggest impacts the project has had is in terms of developing multi-stakeholder
coordination among all relevant actors, this will remain a critical challenge going forward,
particularly in the foreseeable vacuum at the project’s end, which might be addressed by
exploring the opportunities for the continued functioning and transformation of the Project
Implementation Board into a J4C, or broader, coordination body. This could provide an
effective avenue for advocacy and coordination and provide the drive for greater
sustainability of results. [Finding 5.2]
62
[Conclusion 8] There is a strong sense of ownership among stakeholders with regard to the
project’s interventions, but UNICEF also played an important role in the overall reform of
justice for children in BiH and was often perceived as primary owner of the process. In this
sense, there is still scope for strengthening ownership. [Findings 5.1 and 5.2]
Coherence
[Conclusion 9] The key stakeholder in BiH in terms of development remains the European
Union. UNICEF established a strong working partnership with the EU, including a
coordinated engagement strategy and synergies across specific interventions. UNICEF
should continue to promote its partnership with the EU to move forward on certain
interventions and to coordinate further on policy dialogue and advocacy issues. [Finding 6.1]
[Conclusion 10] During the third phase of the project implementation, there was little scope
for strengthening collaboration with other UN agencies, including UNDP. However, this
collaboration should continuously be explored in future to promote joint objectives more
efficiently and to maximize resource potential and strengthen complementarities with other
UN agencies. [Finding 6.2]
Cross-cutting issues
Human rights-based approach and gender equality and social inclusion
[Conclusion 11] By adopting a human rights-based approach in the project’s design and
implementation, it was possible to address issues on both sides of the development
equation, namely on both the supply (service provision) and demand (rights-holders) sides.
This provided an opportunity to strengthen the normative framework and capacities of
relevant institutions to implement the Law and provide quality services, to better informed
and aware children. A stronger gender and social inclusion analysis and focus would have
allowed for a stronger response to gender equality and social inclusion issues, and
additional efforts in capturing the voice of children could have improved results. [Findings 1.2
and 7.1]
COVID-19 response
[Conclusion 12] UNICEF’s swift response and timely and appropriate adaptation of project
activities provided for its successful transition at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. By
keeping children in the centre of BiH’s response to COVID-19, it was possible to adjust the
project and continue with implementation of its activities. Despite this, COVID-19 has
impacted on project activities and caused certain delays. Additional technical support to
project partners and beneficiaries potentially could have allowed the transition of a greater
number of capacity-building programmes and awareness-raising activities to an online
format, including by utilizing social media and modern technologies such as podcasts, online
forums and chatrooms. [Finding 7.2]
5. Lessons Learned
Lesson Learned 1: UNICEF’s name carried weight and it is recognized countrywide for its
technical expertise, its coordination role, and the major contribution it has made in the reform
63
processes of the justice system for children. Lessons learned show that care should always
be taken to ensure this does not impact on ownership of the processes and achievements by
governmental institutions, particularly with regard to budgeting and coordination. [Findings
5.1 and 5.2]
Lesson Learned 2: In an institutionally and legislatively fragmented context such as BiH, it
is crucial to tailor each intervention to the specific local context to achieve results and
promote the sense of ownership even though consistent harmonization of law, policies and
practices may not be achieved. However, peer-to-peer exchanges, multi-stakeholder
education programmes and coordination meetings can further promote harmonization.
[Findings 2.2, 4.1, 5.1 and 5.2]
Lesson Learned 3: The success of a wide-ranging and encompassing reform process
requires a strong Project Coordination Board with high-level membership and country-wide
representation to promote coordination, including between different sectors, and
harmonization of efforts towards justice for children across BiH. It is therefore important for
the Board members to have a full understanding of their role and of the follow-up expected,
including in planning and budgeting, to promote the results. [Finding 5.2]
Lesson Learned 4: Without multisectoral coordination the project would not have
succeeded in several important areas: achieving a high level of support for children
encountering the justice system in different ways, as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders;
introducing a holistic approach to ensuring their rights and identifying and supporting
children at risk; and promoting a better understanding of the roles of different sectors in
supporting children. [Finding 4.1]
Lesson Learned 5: The success of interventions that require involvement and coordination
of different stakeholders, such as the implementation of diversion and alternative measures
or secondary prevention programmes, depends on sufficient capacities and involvement of
all relevant stakeholders. The project correctly recognized the need for social service
strengthening for effective results in justice for children. [Findings 3.1, 4.1 and 5.3]
Lesson Learned 6: Effective implementation of the project, particularly for some diversion
and alternative measures, required bridging the gap between governmental representatives
and civil society organizations and creating the space for their effective cooperation.
[Findings 2.2, 3.1 and 5.3]
Lesson Learned 7: It takes time to change mindsets when new policies and practices are
introduced, as seen from the differences in the adoption of diversion measures foreseen by
the Law by police and prosecutor’s offices. Changing mindsets requires multiple approaches
including continuous education programmes, coordination and peer-to-peer exchanges, and
accountability tools, as well as high-level ownership, instruction, promotion and lobbying by
relevant stakeholders, and public campaigning. [Findings 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 5.1]
Lesson Learned 8: Elementary schools were shown to be highly successful in running
secondary prevention programmes, including through identifying and responding to children
at risk. With the exception of some secondary schools, the programmes were
enthusiastically accepted. Successful secondary prevention programmes can lead to
improved multisectoral cooperation, awareness-raising about the needs of children at risk
and the development of referral mechanisms. [Finding 5.3]
64
Lesson Learned 9: The introduction of mandatory training and certification for professionals
working with children led to great progress in awareness-raising for child rights but this
requires sustainable access to continuous training and education programmes to make sure
that there is a sufficient number of certified professionals to cover the turnover of staff.
[Findings 3.2 and 5.1]

6. Recommendations
Recommendations for UNICEF have been developed on the basis of the key findings of the
report. However, because the project is ending in November 2021, after 10 years of project
implementation, the recommendations for action are more broad-based, looking at
UNICEF’s potential role going forward. Thus, the recommendations are forward-looking and
strategic, and are not necessarily linked to specific interventions. The recommendations
have been prioritized according to high, medium or low priority.
Recommendation 1: UNICEF’s role in improving access to justice for children in BiH should
be redefined to shift from being responsible for project implementation together with local
partners to a monitoring, oversight, technical support and advocacy role.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, high priority, based on conclusions 1, 6 and 7.
UNICEF’s new Country Programme Document 2021–2025, sets out its vision over the next
five years, including a continuation of support to strengthen access to justice for children in
BiH. In order not to lose the gains made during the 10 years of J4C project implementation,
UNICEF should continue to have a role, but this should shift from being the main
implementer to having more of a coordination role, bringing people together, sharing lessons
learned, providing technical advice, and lobbying and advocating for key issues affecting
children’s access to justice. The Exit Strategy for the project already envisages UNICEF
moving into more of a monitoring and oversight role, continuing to provide technical support
with key advocacy and policy dialogue messages and priorities. UNICEF should negotiate
and advocate with BiH, entity, district, cantonal and municipal representatives to improve
awareness of the systems and models that are available, and which should be utilized. It is
important that UNICEF’s advocacy, monitoring, oversight and technical support efforts
should strive to ensure that the models, mechanisms and tools developed through the
project be rolled out and embedded into the system to avoid stagnation, or worse, regression
in the project results. In particular, this applies to the secondary prevention programme,
further roll-out of alternative and diversion measures, victim and witness protection
measures, and accessibility of quality, free legal aid. Exploration of opportunities for the
potential continuation of the Project Coordination Board, re-defined as the J4C coordination
body, could provide an effective avenue for advocacy and coordination and help ensure
greater sustainability of results.
Recommendation 2: Coordination with the EU and other UN agencies should be capitalized
on going forward, especially after the end of the project, to ensure both reinforcement of the
results achieved to date and continued improvements in access to justice for children in BiH.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, high priority, based on conclusions 7, 9 and 10.
Within its role as integrator and with its monitoring, oversight and technical support activities,
UNICEF should leverage to the maximum its partnership with the EU to push forward on key
legislative and policy changes as well as to advocate for including relevant activities in EU
IPA funds. There are unique opportunities to engage in policy dialogue and advocacy with
relevant stakeholders in BiH to leverage commitment and resources for continued reform of
the child protection/justice for children systems, and to ensure better harmonization of the
policies and approaches leading to more equitable access to justice. Policy dialogue and
advocacy should also aim to enhance sustainability of programmes, services and
66
interventions put in place during the Justice for Every Child project phases I to III. UNICEF
should continue to advocate to elevate justice for children/children's access to justice as a
rule of law priority and ensure that it becomes an integral component of BiH's reform agenda
for EU accession. In June 2021, after the project evaluation phase, the EU Parliament noted
in its Commission Report on BiH “progress in the field of child protection, including the
implementation of Laws on Protection and Treatment of Children and Juveniles in Criminal
Proceedings and the establishment of a system of foster care; recalls the need for an action
plan on child protection and further measures to ensure the implementation of children’s’
right to health, education, protection, justice and equal opportunities through inclusive
education and prevention of violence against children.” This should be leveraged by UNICEF
going forward.
With regards to other UN agencies, UNICEF should continue to explore opportunities with
UNDP for including children’s access to justice in the local planning and budgeting
processes. Greater sustainability for J4C would be provided by its incorporation in regular
planning and budgeting. This could include for example: J4C municipal action plans;
strengthened social services to be able respond to the needs of children in conflict with the
law, child victims and witnesses and children at risk, as identified through the secondary
prevention programmes; grants to civil society organizations supporting the implementation
of correctional recommendations or responding to children at risk; and organizations that
provide free legal aid for children, when these are financed from local budgets.
Recommendation 3: UNICEF should continue to advocate for adequate budgets to support
key project results. J4C activities and the strengthening of social and child protection
services should be included in the EU Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance to ensure
that project results are not jeopardized and remain sustainable.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, high priority, based on conclusions 3, 4, 5, and 6.
UNICEF should continue to advocate for the models of service provision developed through
the project to be planned and budgeted for at all levels to ensure their sustainability. In
particular, UNICEF should continue to advocate for full institutional ownership, and support
adoption of the entity and district J4C strategies, and entity and district level action plans on
social service strengthening, which provide key actions, responsible parties, timelines and
financial support required. The focus should be maintained to ensure that the project’s
achievements of the project endure.
Recommendation 4: UNICEF should prioritize any available funds and fundraising to further
embed project results in the system, contributing to greater ownership and sustainability.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, medium priority, based on conclusions 2, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 11.
If any funds become available, UNICEF should consider continuing to support certain project
activities to ensure full institutional ownership and sustainability of initiatives. Areas to
consider include, in no order of prioritization:
• Promote peer-to-peer exchanges and specialized capacity-building for project
stakeholders;
• Include BiH court judges and prosecutors in capacity-building;
• Support further expansion and more effective implementation of diversion and
alternative measures by continued awareness-raising, capacity strengthening and
67
oversight. Consider introducing a performance quota system for judges and
prosecutors pronouncing diversion and alternative measures.
• Advocate for the establishment and equipping of child-friendly rooms in line with the
developed standards and monitor their use.
• Learn from the lessons gained in trying to introduce the secondary prevention
programme into secondary schools, and redefine the model, so it can be re-tested.
Children in secondary schools have reached the age at which they can be
considered criminal minors, so it is crucial that they have access to the support and
services they require to avoid coming into contact with the justice system.
• Continue advocating for, and supporting the establishment of, viable alternatives to
pre-trial detention of children.
• Use data and monitoring systems continually for accountability and transparency and
to inform further directions of support.
• Advocate for the implementation of relevant juvenile justice legislation to be inclusive
of refugee and migrant children.
Recommendation 5: UNICEF should consider addressing the challenges for children
in civil and administrative proceedings.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, low priority, based on Finding 3.2.
The focus of the J4C project and juvenile justice reform processes was on children in contact
with the law in criminal proceedings. UNICEF should consider broadening its focus and
providing support to the relevant authorities to ensure that the children in civil and
administrative proceedings can also benefit from child-sensitive procedures, utilizing, as
appropriate, the lessons learned, models and tools developed as part of the J4C
programme.
Recommendation 6: Bearing in mind the objectives of the UNICEF Gender Action
Plan, it is recommended to undertake a gender analysis at the beginning of the
planning process for future projects and ensure monitoring of the implementation and
results also from the gender perspective. This will help to identify the specific needs
of girls and boys, women and men, as well as differences in access to information,
resources and circumstances, and will assist in planning of activities based on
findings.
Recommendation targeted at UNICEF, medium priority, based on conclusions 1, 3, 4, 5 and
11.
Priority recommendation addressed to the relevant authorities in BiH.
The models of service provision developed through the project, including specialized staff in
police and prosecutor’s offices and courts, the establishment and use of child-friendly rooms,
models of implementation of diversion and alternative measures, free legal aid availability for
children, secondary prevention models, and ongoing capacity-building should be urgently
addressed and provided with budgets to ensure their sustainability. Relevant local authorities
should take responsibility to organize peer-to-peer exchanges, multi-stakeholder education
programmes and coordination meetings, to further promote harmonization of project results.
Priority recommendation addressed to the donors
In order to further consolidate the results of the project and to strengthen their sustainability,
the donors should consider allocating any available funds to the priority areas detailed
68
above. In addition, the donors should support UNICEF in its advocacy and policy dialogue
efforts with the EU and with the relevant institutions, to fully finance and embed project
activities and results in the system.33

beyond the current phase.

Q1: Which sector do you represent?

Q3: Where do you work?
Q4: How familiar are you with the following (please select all that apply)
Please provide any comments you might have
This institution was involved in the third phase of the capacity-building process. We have
participated in the training and we concretely provide free legal aid because the law that regulates
our work provides that children/minors have the right to free legal aid solely by their status as a
child in civil, criminal and minor offence proceedings.
The term "expert associate" here is not in line with the Law on Protection and Treatment of
Children and Juveniles in Criminal Proceedings.
I believe the Prosecutor's Office and the judicial system are the weakest links. Čapljina [city in
Herzegovina-Neretva Canton] is in the project from the start and the Prosecutor's Office never
117
came to a meeting despite a number of requests to come to at least one meeting.
Continuous education on international standards in child protection and the best interests of the
child are definitely topics to further develop.
Q5: Are you familiar with the use of school-based secondary prevention programmes to
identify and support children at risk, implemented in certain municipalities?
Q6: Do you think these programmes are effective?
Please provide any comments you might have
The implementation of the secondary prevention programme I have been working on during past
two years ensured professional assistance and a plan of support for children at risk. Also, the
linkages between the different parts of the system were very evident in the secondary prevention
programme. Multisectoral cooperation between schools, Centres for Social Welfare, Centres for
Mental Health, police, family counselling.
Preventative activities and educational lectures in schools by representatives of the Ministry of
118
Interior of Republika Srpska and supported by UNICEF BiH.
The secondary prevention programme is excellent but for the programme to be effective there
should be conditions for its implementation and application. Many municipalities lack social
services, many centres for social welfare, schools have no psychologists or pedagogues, or fully
staffed expert support services. This makes prevention work difficult and exhausting for the existing
staff and significantly reduces the quality of work with children at risk.
I think everything is at a standstill, especially since the start of the pandemic during which nothing
objective can be achieved.
I believe these programmes slowly show some results, especially if we take into consideration that
the education during COVID-19 is mostly online and recognizing children at risk in these
circumstances is a great achievement.
I believe that the training of teachers is really short, insufficiently clear and not detailed enough. I
also believe that the Ministries do not supervise the education programmes.
I believe these are effective but from my personal and professional experience in the school
environment I think it is necessary to strengthen the expert support services in school by engaging
professionals who could provide a holistic and continuous support to children identified through the
programme.
In the current epidemiological situation, it is difficult to realize these programmes.
They are absolutely effective. It is important for the programmes to be consistently applied and to
have training for teachers of high quality because the functioning of the referral mechanism
depends on them.
Q7: Are you familiar with the rehabilitation programmes providing support to children and
their families to address underlying causes of offending?
Q8: Do you think these programmes are effective?
119
Q9: How likely do you think it is that the following will continue in the future (even after the
end of UNICEF's programme)?
Please provide any comments you might have
Some of the mentioned activities have been incorporated into laws, bylaws, curricula and school
programs.
It is somewhat likely that this will be implemented in practice because, unfortunately, there will be
no hiring or engagement of experts to work with minors, while the obligations from the law will
remain. The additional reason is that no one, for example UNICEF, will require reports about what
has been done.
120
I am of the opinion that without support by UNICEF none of the segments of this programme will be
sustainable.
An important condition is the possibility of obtaining continued financial support.
All activities that became legally prescribed (mandatory education/certification of all those working
with minors) will certainly continue but there is a need for continued support in innovation
processes of these programmes, continued support for capacity-building, printing of supporting
materials, publications and other. Everything that is on the so-called voluntary basis (protocols,
municipal decisions and similar) will most likely be implemented to a lesser degree which will vary
from municipality to municipality.
Domestic institutions should work more on strengthening capacities, aiming to achieve longer-term
and continuous implementation of the mentioned programmes, including capacity-building,
rehabilitation, and free legal aid. Primarily by ensuring the availability of expert staff and securing
the financial means for effective implementation and continued activities.
The activities I marked as "somewhat likely" I believe that it is crucial for those responsible for the
implementation to be able to ensure continuity. For example, the police officers have a great
turnover rate in positions and it is a question of how many of those trained would be able to do
these activities in the future. The implementation of the programmes will be very much in question
unless adequate means are secured in the budgets (it would be desirable to have budgetary lines
named as the activities that are implemented).
It depends on the stability of systematization through which the staff will be able to maintain the
positions they have been educated to perform, and will be able to advance their career in these
positions. Some programmes (legal aid, rehabilitation) that fully depend on donor support are either
not part of the budgets or the level of their financing from the entity/cantonal/local budgets remains
questionable.
For the future activities, I believe it is likely that those activities that have been prescribed by laws
and bylaws will be implemented, especially by judges and prosecutors, because there is a need
and the situation is likely to get more complicated in the future so it will be without doubt necessary
to have additional training programmes, specialized education etc. Expert associates like
psychologists in courts and prosecutor's offices are required by law now so it is likely to expect that
they will continue to do their jobs and support judges and prosecutors. I am not sure local
communities will continue the activities supported by UNICEF without UNICEF's direct support and
implementation of projects, judging by earlier experiences and the information available.
The secondary prevention programme relies on building capacities of expert support services in
schools in order to run in a quality manner. In my practice I have recognized children at risk and I
provide support but I am not sure this support is sufficient, there is not enough continuity because
of being over-burdened by other tasks required by my job.
In our local community it is not likely that the local plan will continue to be developed and
implemented because most of those who participated in the work of the working group are no
longer in the same positions.
International organizations and NGOs have made a very important contribution to the work with
children and minors, including initiatives, material support, premises etc. For this reason, I think the
project needs to continue to animate the governmental institutions.
The referral mechanism showed many advantages and I believe its application should extend and
it should be used by other systems.
It depends on the readiness and capacities of competent bodies for such programmes.
I believe all stakeholders are aware of the need to have a continuous and all-encompassing
121
approach and that the activities need to continue to ensure the best interests of the child and
because the knowledge and cooperation led to easier work and achievement of goals.
Q10: Do you think these should be rolled out/available in all locations?
Please provide any comments you might have
All cases related to family law.
The question should not refer to all mentioned areas at the same time because some are
prescribed by the law and some are not.
I think all the activities should be implemented in the entire country.
The best functioning are municipal action plans, school action plans and free legal aid.
Continuous education is required in this field. The intervention should focus on understanding this
field, including minors as perpetrators of offences, but especially in the area of protecting child
victims of crimes and other offences.
Under the condition that the authorities accept the higher share of responsibility/financing of these
programmes.
There is a continuous need for people to receive additional education and specialization in all parts
of the country, not just in bigger centres because child rights are getting violated everywhere.
Q11: Are you familiar with the use of correctional measures other than detention in juvenile
cases (select all that apply)?
122
Q12: Do you believe these are sufficiently utilized?
It depends (please specify)
First should be correctional measures; and only if there are no results with these, the last option
should be jail.
In certain situations, these are useful but it depends on the minor in conflict with the law, they
depend on support from the family, and support for fast adaptation of the child, and change in the
way the child lives and change of socially unacceptable behaviours.
The prosecutors most often decide on court reprimand as the measure because it is the easiest to
implement. Additionally, local communities have insufficient resources, so for example most of the
communities have no counselling service for youth or courses for further education prescribed by
123
special obligations.
This is the weak link in the system.
Depends on family circumstances and understanding by the parents.
These are being issued but their implementation is questionable. It cannot be a rule to have the
NGO sector directly responsible through the implementation of some of these measures. The
implementation of measures and the creation of conditions for their implementation must be the
responsibility of the institutions, that is of the official governmental sector. Counselling centres and
other obligations in terms of working obligations and other measures must be provided by the state
sector to be adequately implemented. The non-governmental sector can only have a supporting
role and not be the lead sector in the realization of special obligations.
Depends on the efficiency of the system of supervision over the implementation of the measures,
but as a rule, I believe that correctional measures are effective.
Individualized approach that takes into account the entire context is important.
Q13: Are you familiar with the use of correctional recommendations (select all that apply)?
Q14: Do you believe these are sufficiently utilized?
124
It depends (please specify)
I believe that only if there is a multisectoral connection, these measures can be successful.
Prosecutors avoid deciding on recommendation because it involves more work, and the case can
be considered closed only once the Centre for Social Welfare confirms that the recommendation
has been implemented. The other problem is the lack of resources, for example for counselling, in
local communities.
I believe the scope for their implementation in practice is much higher.
I am familiar with all the recommendations, but these are insufficiently used. It is necessary to
focus on this segment because this can change the perception of juvenile perpetrators, and the
situation for minors themselves.
Some of them are not considered effective.
125
Q15: Could you select the areas with the biggest achievements in enhancing justice for
children (please rank from the biggest achievement to the lowest, with 1 being the area with
the biggest achievements):
Q16: In your view, what are the main challenges to achieving an effective response to
children in contact with justice and children at risk (please rank in the order of importance
with 1 being the area with the biggest challenges):
126
Q17: If you selected "other" in Q16, please specify below
There are no institutions for minors, like correctional homes for young offenders and there are no
specialized institutions for treatment of minors.
Insufficient awareness of parents about the prevention programmes and about preventing contact
of minors with potential risks that can cause minors to behave outside the norms.
Insufficient services and accommodation capacities for children.
Lack of will and motivation by professionals in judicial institutions.
Lack of will.
The absence of sensitivity to working with children, ignorance by individuals, being influenced by
interests other than the best interests of the child and insufficient knowledge of international
standards.
Late interventions from the system, case processing in courts and at prosecutor's offices lasts
years.
Q18: In your view, are all relevant BiH/entity/cantonal/municipal and other stakeholders
involved in the justice for children programme implementation?
If no, please specify
The programme at the level of the state, greater support of competent ministries of education,
labour, social policy, health, municipalities.
Representatives of media, NGOs with useful campaigns and suggestions.
I think that those from the higher level of the authority do not get involved sufficiently into the
solutions of the problems, and it is within their mandate.
State level is not involved at all.
All the institutions at the state level, ministries of education, labour, social policy, health,
municipality.
Competent Centres for Social Welfare should be included more.
127
I think the local community, that is, municipality, should be included more and the Ministry of
Education. Also, based on my experience I believe Centres for Social Welfare are the weakest link
so I believe they should be more involved in the work with these categories.
Perhaps to consider greater involvement of local communities.
BiH institutional bodies.

Q22: On a scale of 1 to 5, how helpful has the training been – with 1 being the most
helpful?34
Qualitative responses
2 (2 only because during the last year we could not meet in person and that is the best for
understanding and exchanging constructive proposals).
All programmes were good, and all deserve the best grade 1.
5 – conference was the most useful because of insight into work of colleagues from other
countries.
1 Child psychology; 2 Forensic interview and questioning minors; 3 International standards in child
protection and best interests of the child; 4 sexual abuse of children in digital environment etc. In
my view, all the education programmes are relevant and very helpful to professionals and
especially to parents in raising minor children.
The education programme for working with children and minors in criminal proceedings was very
useful, grade 5. The training "Strengthening overall systemic approach to protection of the best
interests of the child in contact with the law” I would assess with the grade 3.
Education programmes were very good and useful. 1
3 – limited number of training with practitioners directly involved in the implementation of the law on
protection and procedure with children and minors in criminal proceedings. Exchange of good
practices and experience.
34 Due to the school grading system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where 5 is the best grade, the
evaluation team believe that some responses to this question might not be accurate.
136
Q23: If the training was not helpful, could you explain why not:
Qualitative responses
Education programme "Strengthening overall systemic approach to protecting best interests of the
child in contact with law” did not fulfil my expectation because there was a lot of repetition in topics
and the selection of trainers was not the best.
Mostly the same educators and the same topics
Q24: Do you expect to receive more training in the next year?
Q25: What areas would you like to receive additional training on in the future?
Qualitative responses
Working on prevention and strengthening the awareness of children and working with cases of
juvenile delinquency and violence prevention through practical examples and experiences from
practice.
Working with primary school age children at risk.
Education of teachers, expert associates and all professionals about prevention of risk factors.
Sub-specialized programmes of working with specific groups of children.
Prevention of violence against children, raising awareness of youth with safety risks, continuous
education of professionals.

Inter-sectoral cooperation (centres for social work, schools, police, courts, support to families;
prevention work).
The use of alternative measures, recommendations for future decision-making in justice for
children field.
Identification, procedures and working with children at risk.
Prevention and the programme of reintegration of minors into society.
The role of teachers in secondary prevention programmes.
Access to justice for children, protection of rights and interests of children and youth in different
legal fields and proceedings.
The use of police warning, adequate interviews with minors (victim, offender, witness), application
of relevant legal framework for juvenile criminal law.
Education programmes at the state level, and the adoption of laws at the state level because in
criminal cases from the competence of the Court of BiH the minors are processes in line with the
provisions of the “old"/valid laws which makes the treatment of minors much less favorable,
depending on the crime committed.
All topics covered were very useful. I expect these to continue and in time to add similar topics.
Consistent application of the law and actions in accordance with the law, raising awareness on
prevention, practical application of recommendations and correctional measures.
Protection of psychological and physical health of children, with the special focus on representing
children before competent institutions, especially courts.
Online environment, mental health, topics related to parenting, violence in social networks...
Timely identification of children with behavioural problems and work to prevent juvenile
delinquency.
Reacting on social networks. Identification and evidence collection.
Assessment of minors, treatment – work with minors
Best interests of the child standard; Observation and diagnostics of minors in criminal proceedings;
Children in digital environment.
Multisectoral cooperation between relevant ministries/institutions in supporting children at risk.
Working with children in civil proceedings, children in hostile divorces.
Coordination meetings of prosecutors for children, implementation of the Law on Protection and
Procedures for Children and Youth in Criminal Proceedings.
I believe it would be ideal if expert support staff receive education programmes and additional
specialized training in order to have the necessary knowledge for the establishment of the National
Preventative Mechanism so that the institution, as an independent institution, can monitor and
control the work of all institutions accommodating minors in conflict with law.
Development characteristics by age to adjust the measures implemented.
Emotional stability, safety of children in online environment, younger adolescents growing under
the COVID-19 conditions...
Early detection.
Continued education on implementation of the Law, perpetrators of offences, victims of crimes,
138
police warning etc.
Cooperation in multisectoral teams, exchange of information, roles; working with gifted children;
professional orientation of children.
Treatment and work with children at risk by guardianship institution.
Working with child victims of crimes.
Access to justice for children, multisectoral cooperation in protection of rights and interest of
children and youth and similar topics.
Implementation of the Law on Protection and Procedures for Children and Youth in Criminal
Proceedings; Human trafficking with a special focus on child victims of crime, sexual crimes against
children, Interviewing child victims of crimes – challenges and practices.
Protection of children from abuse in digital environment, exchanges of practices and practical
examples of procedures under the criminal Law.

Annex 7: Schema for Scaling Up
A schema was used to analyse the Evaluation Matrix from a perspective of scaling. It is
summarized here. At its simplest, scaling up means that you can do X again, either in a
different place or with different people. A survey of literature found multiple nuances to this
however.35
To increase we want to scale up investments in conserving forests and wetlands
To replicate we want to scale up best practice by replicating at least one best practice example

effective models increased in order to reach a larger number of beneficiaries
To spread ideas often innovations – through diffusion so that they become widely accepted
Questions to consider are:
What is being scaled up? To whom (area(s)/population(s)/institutions)?
What is meant by scale-up in this circumstance? What are the criteria for sustainability and equity?
What is the intended impact of scale-up? Is the project proven to be successful?
How and by whom? Is the project aligned with country policies, goals and
What is the envisaged timescale? systems?
In particular the evaluation will seek to identify information relevant to several components
for successful scale-up (as articulated by USAID36).

Equity: does scale-up include the concept of reaching
