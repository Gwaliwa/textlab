Executive Summary
Background
The protracted and ongoing economic, social and political crisis in Venezuela has provoked the greatest exodus in
the history of the Latin American and Caribbean region. By 2022, more than six million Venezuelans had fled their
country. The national asylum system of Ecuador, a signatory of the main international treaties and conventions
relating to migration and refugees, was overwhelmed. By December 2021 it was estimated there were 508,000
refugees and migrants in Ecuador. As the Venezuelan influx increased and the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed the
nation, the Government of Ecuador (GoE) progressively tightened entry requirements,
While before the onset of the Venezuela Migration Crisis (VMC) Venezuelans could enter Ecuador with a valid ID
card and obtain a tourist visa for 180 days, they are now required to obtain in advance a humanitarian visa from
an Ecuadorian consulate. Swift policy changes have had a devastating effect on the Venezuelan population, outside
and inside Ecuador, leading to an upsurge in unauthorised border crossings and concomitant vulnerability to
abuse, sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Accurate enumeration is impossible due to the extent of
unauthorised border crossings into and out of Ecuador.
Humanitarian Response
At regional level, the Grupo Interagencial sobre Flujos Migratorios Mixtos (Interagency Group on Mixed Migratory
Flows, GIFMM) was established to coordinate the humanitarian response to the Venezuelan migration outflow
(rather than classic cluster coordination mechanisms). UNICEF Ecuador played a critical coordination role in the
Grupo de Trabajo para Refugiadas y Migrantes (GTRM), Ecuador’s national coordination platform. In February
2019, UNICEF triggered its Level 2 Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure. This was raised to Level 3 in April
2020 as COVID-19 took hold.
UNICEF has focused on minimising such consequences for displaced Venezuelan children as food insecurity,
vulnerability to human trafficking, exposure to violence on the road, poverty and exclusion from education. In
partnership with other UN agencies, GoE and sub-national actors in a decentralised governance system, UNICEF
has sought to:
 Ensure continuity of health care for migrant families
 Support water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), including by provision of hygiene kits and handwashing
points
 support remote learning made necessary by the pandemic
 promote school entry for migrant and refugee children, mitigate high drop-out levels and challenge
xenophobia
 provide child protection, psychosocial support and mental health as well as access to social and justice
services
 roll out innovative and collaborative cash transfer programmes for migrant families
 generate evidence for better policy- and decision-making
 provide local level support to most affected geographical areas through capacity building.
UNICEF´s VMC response, both in Ecuador and in other countries studied, has been consistently under-funded, with
grave consequences in particular sectors.
Evaluation purpose, objective, intended audience and methodology
This country case study is one in a series of five which reviews the diverse ways that UNICEF through its
development and humanitarian interventions has responded to the VMC since February 2019. The evaluation is
intended to shed light on good practices and lessons learned from the experience of how UNICEF country offices
have responded to an unexpected and protracted crisis and how the UNICEF Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office and UNICEF HQ can better support the Ecuador Country Office (ECO) and other COs in current and future
responses to mass population movements in the region. It further seeks to analyse the extent to which changes in
social norms, including those related to gender and xenophobia, are envisioned and strategies are in place and are
1
measurable. The primary users of this evaluation are UNICEF staff – in Country Offices (COs) in which country case
studies were carried out, in the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) and in New York
Headquarters (HQ) – as well as IPs, government counterparts and affected populations.
The evaluation uses criteria of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development / Development
Assistance Committee adapted to humanitarian interventions in line with guidelines of the Active Learning
Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action. These are appropriateness, effectiveness,
efficiency, coherence and coordination, coverage and connectedness.
The evaluation focused on three main cities/regions, analysing UNICEF´s urban and rural interventions in locations
for migrants, refugees and host populations, particularly assessing responses to permanent or in-transit
populations as well as host communities. Semi-structured interviews were carried out (on-site and remotely) with
key in-country informants (both at national and field level) based on the stakeholder analysis in the Inception
Report and adapted during the data collection phase in Ecuador. There were sex- and age-disaggregated group
discussions with Venezuelan migrants on the move, with focus on families with children involved in UNICEF-funded
programmes.
This evaluation report was submitted to UNICEF in June 2022 and went through a validation process which included
a workshop in Quito in August 2022.
Findings
Appropriateness
Overall, UNICEF’s response was appropriate considering the magnitude of VMC. UNICEF ECO, despite obstacles,
developed and adapted several response strategies and implementations modalities to the different contexts and
populations entering Ecuador, including adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic and adaptations to include more
integration measures to respond to migrants and host communities. However, staffing and short-term contracts
within UNICEF and with implementing partners (Ips) have limited capacity to appropriately respond to the needs
of migrant and host communities.
As will be explored further in the Regional Synthesis report, in Ecuador, as in all five Country Case Studies, the
evaluation notes a lack of a fully operationalised, overarching regional strategy to address what was a regional
emergency. In its absence the Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal has been the main tool for
harmonising implementation approaches between COs addressing the VMC.
While the VMC was an unexpected humanitarian situation before 2016, ECO’s lack of emergency capacity and
tools affected the response from the outset. This was corrected over time, and ECO became a champion in
preparedness and contingency planning. The response to the VMC has been always articulated as short-term. This
continues to impact UNICEF’s capacity to transition to the medium to long term.
In collaboration with partners, UNICEF has gathered information about the migrant population yet learning about
their needs remains a challenge in terms of incorporating feedback into programming. UNICEF and partners are
providing migrants with useful information and putting in place feedback mechanisms through IPs. However, the
operationalization of accountability to the affected population (AAP) and closing the feedback loop remains a
weakness. UNICEF is implementing actions and efforts to address information gaps around gender-based violence
(GBV), prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) and human trafficking but these need to be
strengthened.
Effectiveness
The VMC response has been severely underfunded throughout sectors. A lack of strong regional and global
advocacy impacted funding and informants raised doubts about the R4V as a strong advocacy platform. Despite
funding challenges, ECO has developed strong capacity-building, training and technical support, particularly in
WASH, Health, CP, education and social inclusion.
There have been inconsistencies in monitoring and reporting and setting indicators and targets to measure results.
Less than 40 per cent of indicators have met the targets each year of the response during 2019-2020. In 2020,
COVID-19 caused many planned activities to be either cancelled or changed. At the same time some sectors, such
as CP and WASH, were able to increase their outreach. There have been achievements to protect the human rights
of children on the move. However, progress on mainstreaming migration and enhancing life opportunities for
migrant children and their families has been limited.
2
ECO has been able to coordinate effectively with other partners such as government, UN agencies and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to improve the response given to migrants and host communities.
Coordination was done mainly in data collection, cash-based interventions (CBI), en route responses and capacity
building with government.
Coverage
UNICEF outreach and coverage is limited by the ability to properly identify those in need (given data gaps) and the
saturation of national services. However, a lot is being done by UNICEF to bridge the gaps left by strained services
and support national and local services; and UNICEF was able to respond to the needs of the vulnerable groups
such as unaccompanied and separated children (UASC), victims of GBV, pregnant and lactating women, and
migrants in transit. In general UNICEF has been able to leverage partnerships with line ministries, IPs and local
governments to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable. The joint CBI with UNHCR and WFP allowed to
extend coverage to vulnerable migrants. ECO´s previous experience working with line ministries and civil society
actors facilitated dialogue to influence high-level decisions in a challenging political environment, notably in
supporting the development and implementation of the Special Procedure for Children and Adolescents and their
Families in Contexts of Human Mobility.
Coherence and coordination
UNICEF is seen as a main VMC actor in Ecuador by sister UN agencies, NGOs, civil society organization (CSOs) and
government counterparts. UNICEF was able to strongly coordinate with local and national actors to implement
innovative structures such as Integral Support Space (Espacio de Apoyo Integral, EAI) and flexible mechanisms such
as with CBI. ECO has been able to leverage partnerships to build joint communications campaigns to combat
xenophobia and discrimination. Despite these effective coordination efforts, overall inter-agency coordination is
not seen as coherent. There has been duplication of coordination mechanisms between the GTRM and the cluster
system. A changing national context and high impact of COVID-19 made it difficult to align with national priorities.
There has been lack of structured coordination mechanisms between UNICEF staff across the regions. Improved
coordination is needed to raise the profile of UNICEF to support advocacy challenges, to coordinate donor support
and to share good practices and challenges.
Efficiency
UNICEF has pursued efficiency by expanding previous relationships with government institutions and IPs to avoid
overlap. UNICEF is seen as being flexible in funding and programme extensions, making IP work with migrant
children and their families more efficient. However, UNICEF, like other response agencies, has not been able to
find efficient solutions to monitor irregular entries. While UNICEF worked in collaboration with organisations to
bridge the information gap, mainly at border crossings, information management and monitoring of population
remains a major gap mainly due to irregular cross-border movements.
Connectedness
UNICEF has implemented several activities linking the emergency response to longer-term development goals.
UNICEF worked towards reinforcing national structures and capacities for government and civil society,
strengthening legal protection and enhance coverage for UASC, and advocating for the inclusion of local
organisations to empower and build capacity. However, the short-term nature of the response, the nature of
funding and short-term contractual arrangements affects sustainability of the actions carried out. A lack of a clear
regional strategy has limited adoption of a whole-of-migration approach.
Social inclusion, gender and disability
UNICEF has been working to innovate in social inclusion, particularly being a pilot country for the UN`s Common
Cash Statement (UNCCS) initiative1 and implementing CBI in coordination with other UN agencies. Although gender
equality, GBV and PSEA are core aspects of the response, ECO does not have a gender specialist to support the
response. ECO was able to bridge this gap by regularly requesting support from the LACRO GBV specialist, resulting
in GBV awareness and prevention training for frontline workers, including civil servants. However, UNICEF should
monitor the state of activities related to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) risk prevention in the EAIs,
health facilities, the offices of IPs and schools. The capacity of IPs to identify SGBV cases and refer them needs to
be enhanced. Disabilities are accounted for in all monitoring processes by UNICEF and partners, but the evaluation
1 Launched in 2018 by UNICEF, OCHA, UNHCR and WFP, UNCCS has fostered collaboration on cash and voucher assistance.

has identified weaknesses in the overall response, such as defining clearer differentiation of disabilities, and
adapting spaces, such as the EAIs, to persons with disabilities.
Good practices and lessons learned
Some relevant lessons can be extracted from UNICEF ECO’s response the VMC
 EAI: The EAI in Tulcán has shown how inter-agency coordination exercise has enabled responses to shifting
priorities and created a space for different agencies to work together. As UNICEF further rolls out the EAI
model monitoring will be of prime importance.
 Staff dedication: Informants, as noted, overwhelmingly praise staff’s availability, transparency, and
openness. UNICEF has been able to leverage its existing presence and relationships linked to regular
programming to build programmes and activities for the VMC.
 ECO experience piloting UNCCS has shown the possibility of working together to extend cash-based transfers
and respond to the needs of vulnerable populations. A more detailed analysis can be found in the CBI
evaluation and assessment.2
 On social inclusion: ECA has shown how CBI, if sufficiently funded, can respond to housing, employment,
education, health and food needs and can be empowering.
 The Special Procedure has been a duplicable model of technical support and coordination with government
institutions.
Recommendations
Strategic Recommendation 1 (Global Level and LACRO): Need to establish a LACRO regional strategy for migrant
children and adapt the Children on the Move framework to the region.
Strategic Recommendation 2 (UNICEF Ecuador): Further invest in evidence generation and analysis by i)
mapping key gaps in terms of territorial coverage and performance measurement; ii) understanding what
evidence decision makers need and when; iii) defining how, when and who does the analysis, and iv) outlining
how analysis is then used and shared for both operational and advocacy purposes.
Strategic Recommendation 3 (UNICEF Ecuador): Incorporate migration across sectors in the new 2023-2026 CPD.
Strategic Recommendation 4 (UNICEF Ecuador, LACRO and HQ): Invest in internal capacity-building, learning
exercises as well as HR/staff resourcing and staff-care activities
Strategic Recommendation 5: Further invest in vulnerability assessment to ensure gender equality and disabilities
are mainstreamed through all sectors.

1. Background and context of Ecuador’s country response to the Venezuelan Migration Crisis (VMC)
1.1 Context
The Republic of Ecuador is an upper-middle-income country that experienced substantial economic and social
progress between 2003 and 2013. The positive economic environment resulted in an average annual growth of
4.3 per cent in gross domestic product (GDP) and an increase in public social investment that has reduced poverty
and inequality. Between 2007 and 2017, income poverty fell from 36.7 per cent to 21.5%. Social investment rose
from 4.2 per cent of GDP in 2006 to 9.4 per cent in 2016.3
Despite progress, there are several challenges that the Government of Ecuador (Go) has had to face. According to
UN 2018 Report, Ecuador had substantive numbers of children suffering from chronic malnutrition and increasingly
also from obesity. A lack of access to safe water and sanitation is one of the barriers to eradicating child
malnutrition. Additionally, the education system faces major challenges in combating educational exclusion.4
Coverage of child development services for children under three years of age stood at 20.1 per cent in 2018.5 In
early education (three and four years of age), the enrolment rate reached only around 23 per cent in 2016.6 Among
the main barriers to exercising the universal right to education are the lack of culturally relevant education services
and the shortage of teachers trained in innovative teaching methods. In 2017, more than 900 cases of sexual abuse
in schools came to light.7 There are several explanatory factors behind violence in the family environment and at
school. There is a failure to recognise children and adolescents as enjoying rights, a lack of specialisation and
coverage of services that raise awareness of and address violence, the dismantling of the system of comprehensive
protection of the rights of children and adolescents and a lack of funding for bodies mandated to prevent and
address violence. Still, lack of more current research on the national level makes it difficult to know how the
situation evolved in the period 2018-2021. The socioeconomic situation has deteriorated since mid-2014, when oil
prices began to fall. The economy began to slump in 2015 and contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2016.8 Due to fiscal
pressures, the coverage of Ecuador's main conditional cash transfer programme was also reduced,9 to 582,000
beneficiaries in 2014-2015.10 Working conditions significantly worsened. Unemployment, underemployment, and
informality rates increased to levels not seen in ten years. Between 2013 and 2018, approximately 66,000 jobs
were lost.11
Ecuador is prone to floods, droughts, volcanic eruption, landslides and earthquakes. The GoE integrated disaster
risk reduction strategies that contain specific plans to manage the impacts of displacement caused by disasters in
its 2017 Organic Law on Human Mobility.12 However, the increase of migrants, refugees and displaced people in
the last few years, has stretched the capacities of the government to face the dramatic influx of Venezuelans.
The Venezuelan Migration Crisis (VMC)
Ecuador is a signatory of the main international treaties and conventions relating to migration and refugees.
Ecuador acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention in 1955 and ratified its 1967 Protocol. It also signed the
Cartagena Declaration on Refugees in 1984, which defined refugees as:
Persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by
generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other
circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order. 13
This definition was incorporated into Ecuador’s national legal framework and was included in both the 2008
Constitution (CRE) and the 2017 Organic Law on Human Mobility. The 2008 CRE recognised for the first time at a
constitutional level the rights of asylum and refuge, according to the law and international human rights

instruments.14 Under the Organic Law on Human Mobility, individuals with refugee or stateless status received an
Ecuadorian national ID and temporary resident status, granting them the right to work and study, and the option
to renew their temporary residency or request permanent residency after two years.15
Before 2018, Venezuelans could enter Ecuador with just a valid ID card and obtain a tourist visa for 180 days.16
Once in the country, they could apply for a Unión de Naciones Suramericanas (UNASUR) visa, which granted them
the right to stay and work up to two years.
In June 2018, the GoE declared that birth certificates for children and adolescents were no longer valid travel
documents. In August 2018 Ecuador declared a state of emergency in response to an overwhelming flux of
Venezuelans. To enter the country any person had to show a valid passport, instead of just an ID. The lack of
functioning state institutions in Venezuela made this requirement incredibly difficult to be met. In January 2019,
following an episode of violence in Ibarra, the GoE decreed only people with a legalised certificate confirming lack
of a criminal record could enter Ecuador. This was followed in July 2019 by Presidential Decree 826 h requiring all
Venezuelans to pre-obtain a Humanitarian Visa before crossing into Ecuador.17 As a result of advocacy these
measures were revoked due to incompatibility with the constitution and the Organic Human Mobility Law.
However, the Presidential Decree that entered into force on 26 August 2019, does not include exceptions for
children and their families.18 Applying for a Humanitarian Visa is complicated and takes time. Many Venezuelans
do not have a valid passport and cannot initiate the visa procedures. The process is also very expensive, costing at
leasts US$250.19 On 13 August 2020, the GoE announced that Venezuelans residing in Ecuador who had not
regularised their situations may be subject to a fine of US$800.20 A new President, Guillermo Lasso, assumed office
in May 2021 and in September 2021 announced a plan to regularise the status and integrate some 450,000
Venezuelans.21
These swift changes of policies have had a devastating effect on the Venezuelan population, outside and inside
Ecuador, leading to an upsurge in unauthorized border crossings and concomitant vulnerability to abuse, sexual
exploitation and human trafficking. The scale of unauthorised border crossings is nearly impossible to monitor.
Thus it is difficult for humanitarian responders to know the real situation. Venezuelans already in Ecuador who
had not managed to regularise their situation faced another conundrum: unable to work until they secured a
longer-term visa, but unable to obtain a visa until they earned enough money to pay for one, Venezuelans were
often forced to work illegally.22 The lack of reliable data on unauthorised entries hindered the full understanding
of migrants’ situation and vulnerabilities. This affected particularly children and adolescents. In 2021, based on
estimations, the Regional Migration Response Plan (RMRP) – a mechanism first developed in 2018 as a strategic
regional response plan and advocacy tool – reported approximately 150,000 Venezuelan children and adolescents
in Ecuador in need of some form of assistance.23 Since the public health emergency declaration due to COVID-19
in March 2020, Ecuador land borders with Colombia and Peru were closed. Still, it has estimated that 500 – 1,000
people entered the country through irregular border crossings daily.24 In December 2021, the Puente Internacional
de Rumichaca was reopened, at the border with Colombia, through the Centros Binacionales de Atención a la
Frontera (CEBAF). To enter Ecuador, any person is required to show proof of vaccination and a negative PCR test.
Additionally, visa requirements for Venezuelans still stand in 2022.
The protracted and ongoing economic, social and political crisis in Venezuela has provoked the greatest exodus in
the history of the Latin American and Caribbean region (LAC). In February 2019, the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported 2,000 average daily entries into Ecuador, with peaks of 5,000 per

day.25 In March 2019, 221.000 Venezuelans refugees and migrants were living in Ecuador.26 Ecuador’s asylum
system, originally designed to manage about 5,000 claims per year, was not equipped to manage a rapid spike in
asylum applications.27 The pandemic and the borders closure did not stop the flow of migrants. The December
2021 Response for Venezuela (R4V) Situation Report stated there were 508,000 refugees and migrants in
Ecuador.28 By 2022, more than six million Venezuelans had fled their country by 2022.29
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted Ecuador. During 2020, there were 14,034 COVID-19 related deaths
reported.30 According to the University of Cuenca, there were 114,130 deaths in Ecuador in 2020, against the
expected 71,000. Men over the age of 30 were the most affected group.31 In 2021, 104.670 deaths were reported,
with no significant differences in any age/gender groups.32 The capacity of intensive care units was overwhelmed
as 333,906 COVID-19 cases were reported.33
Those municipalities with the most severe community transmission rates are where are found the highest number
of Venezuelans, mostly living in densely populated communities. A UNICEF survey in 2021 found that while most
Venezuelans were aware of the need for COVID-19 prevention measures34, the need to provide for their families
was forcing them into public spaces, increasing risks of exposure.
As a result of the pandemic Ecuadoran schools were closed in March 2020, after the GoE declared a sanitary
emergency35 and remained closed intermittently for most of 2021.36 By December 2021, only 25 per cent of
students (approximately one million) had been able to resume full in-person learning.37 On-line learning is often
not a possibility for many migrant and refugee children, lacking connectivity and access to the necessary
technology.38 Tackling the educational inclusion for the migrant population was prioritised by UNICEF Ecuador. The
agency´s activities were adjusted its activities to promote a safe return to school, generate evidence on the return
to school, mitigate the effects on learning deficiencies, support teachers with technological and reduce the new
barriers to access education.
1.2 Object of the evaluation and country case studies
UNICEF’s response to the VMC, both at country and regional levels, constitutes the object of the evaluation.
Through a regional lens and five country case studies in Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago,
the overall evaluation will review the diverse ways that UNICEF through its development and humanitarian
interventions has responded to the VMC, given the specific opportunities and constraints of national contexts. The
five country case studies shed light on good practices and lessons learned from the experience of how UNICEF
country offices (COs) have responded to what has become a protracted humanitarian crisis and how the UNICEF
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office (LACRO) and HQ can better support COs in their response efforts.
Overview of UNICEF’s response to the VMC in Ecuador
In May 2018, UNICEF Ecuador started responding to the VMC, prioritising populations on the move at border
crossings in Rumichaca, San Miguel and Huaquillas, and Venezuelans settling in the main cities of Ecuador – Quito,
Manta, Ibarra, Guayaquil and Cuenca.

Three informants interviewed by the evaluator described how the ECO (UNICEF Ecuador Country Office) raised the
alarm early on, concerned about saturation of over-burdened social services, national and sub-national
competencies and capacities, risks related to unaccompanied minors and family separation and administrative and
legal gaps. However, it seems a regional coordinated response was difficult to set up. Several key informants (KIs)
suggested that political sensitivities may have caused this delay. UNICEF Ecuador’s Country Programme Document
(CPD) approved in September 2018 mentioned that “migration dynamics”39 was one of the reasons for regional
prioritisation.40 In 2019 UNICEF declared a Level-2 (L2) Emergency Response – a procedure to mobilise additional
support to enable a CO to respond to a crisis– in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
In May 2022, LACRO shared a draft regional strategy with the evaluator. The draft version, dated September 2018,
establishes a regional strategy around three pillars: comprehensive child protection (CP), humanitarian action,
development and social policy. However, no final version was shared. The evaluator understands that UNICEF
began drafting a new regional strategy in May 2022.
In 2018, the UN Secretary-General directed UN agencies not to set up classic cluster coordination mechanisms for
the VMC. The Grupo Interagencial sobre Flujos Migratorios Mixtos (the Interagency Group on Mixed Migratory
Flows, GIFMM)41 was established, with coordination provided by UNHCR and the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) in the newly created GIFMM-R4V coordination platform. Ecuador CO has played a critical
coordination role in the Grupo de Trabajo para Refugiadas y Migrantes (GTRM)42, Ecuador’s national R4V platform.
The ECO co-leads, together with its IP, COOPI43 – the national CP sub-group of the GTRM.44
The northern borders with Colombia, Rumichaca (in Carchi Province) and San Miguel (Sucumbíos Province),
together with the southern border with Peru, Huaquillas (El Oro Province), were the geographical areas where
UNICEF focused its humanitarian response. The most crowded border has been, and remains, Rumichaca. During
August 2019, 85,952 people were registered to have entered the country by land,45 triggered by new visa
requirements about to come into force. Since then there has been an increase in irregular border crossings, making
people more vulnerable to human trafficking.
39 Country Programme Document, UNICEF, 2018. https://sites.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/2018-PL13-Ecuador_CPD-ODS-EN.pdf
40 The CPD mentions a fluctuating population of migrants, refugees and displaced people on the northern border, without specifically indicating the
Venezuelan population as a key concern.
41 Originally the GIFMM was within the Emergency Humanitarian Platform structure and then changed to the R4V platform.

UNICEF strategy focused on minimising such consequences for children of displacement as food insecurity,
vulnerability to human trafficking, exposure to violence on the road and poverty. Technical assistance was
provided to the GoE. These included direct interventions in:
 Health: support to continuity of health care for children and women
 Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): provision of critical hygiene kits and handwashing points including
in schools
 Education: support to remote learning, school reopening and dropout prevention
 Child Protection: psychosocial support and mental health services as well as access to social and justice
services
 Social Policy: cash transfer programmes for migrant families, evidence generation for better policy- and
decision-making, and local level support to some of the most affected geographical areas through capacity-
building, provision of necessary equipment, and risk communication and community engagement
initiatives
 Gender-Based Violence (GBV): capacity building, training, comprehensive messaging, attention points
such as the EAIs, psychosocial support).
In terms of expected results and coverage, these are outlined and explored in detail by sector in the findings section
on Effectiveness below (see section 7.2). Targets, indicators and short-intermediate results are further presented
in the Theory of Change (ToC) in Annex 1.
Since 2018, UNICEF Ecuador has worked with 12 IPs. These have included:
 Agencia Adventista de Desarrollo y Recursos Asistenciales (ADRA),46 (covering WASH and nutrition
activities)
 COOPI (protection and WASH in border crossing points and en route)
 RET47 and Plan International48 (education)
 Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS)49 and Daniëlle Children´s Fund (DCF)50 (CP and social policy, health
and social inclusion activities)
 Desarrollo y Autogestión (DyA)51 (nutritional screening, advocacy and communication activities)
 World Vision52
 Nación de Paz53
 Fundación Lunita Lunera54 (FULULU) (teaching-learning processes)
 LAB XXI55
 Fundación Idea Dignidad56
 Arteducarte57
UNICEF has worked closely with other UN agencies, local governments and GoE ministries, especially the Ministerio
de Educación (MinEduc) and the Ministerio de Salud Pública. In the health and education sectors UNICEF support
has been primarily logistical.

Funds mobilisation
UNICEF requested US$43,425,049 for Ecuador through the regional Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal
over the period 2019 to 2021.58 The requirements started with US$11,705,250 in 2019 (of which $US7,658,065
was covered) and increased to US$15,238,000 in 2020 of which only US$5,016,352 was covered (including
humanitarian and other funds, as well as a 15 per cent carry over). For 2021, the HAC included both UNICEF’s
response to the COVID-19 crisis as well as the response to support people affected from violence and
displacement. In 2021, US$16,481,799 was requested for Ecuador.59 Up until March 2021 only nine per cent of the
total requested funds had been covered, reaching around 32 per cent by the end of the year. A summary of sector
requirements, funds available and funding gaps for 2019, 2020, and Jan-March 2021 is provided below.60

As presented in Figure 2, the sectors with the most persistent funding gaps have been advocacy/communication
and nutrition. CP, including GBV and Prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) together with social
inclusion were the best funded sectors between 2019 and 2020. It is worth mentioning that the ECO has flexibility
to redistribute sectoral funds according to the identified priorities.61 In terms of requirements there was a major
increase in the now renamed Social Protection sector in 2021 (going from around US$2 appealed for in 2019 and
2020, to more than US$6 million sought in 2021). There was a similar rise in requested health funding in response
to COVID-19 needs.
5858 Humanitarian Action for Children 2019 is related to the “children and populations affected by the migration flows from the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela”, 2020 HAC (August revision) and 2021 HAC it includes “children on the move from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and people affected by
COVID-19”.
59 According to the LACRO emergency section the distribution of the funds requested by the HAC 2021 appeal in Ecuador were intended to cover: US%10.1
million for the migration component, $US6 million for COVID and US$300,000 for the violence component.

2. Purpose, objectives and scope of Ecuador CO case study
2.1 Purpose
The purpose of the overall evaluation is both summative and formative. On the one hand, it accounts for the results
achieved between January 2019 and December 2021, to draw lessons learned, and to support enhanced
accountability. On the other, it is formative as it presents recommendations that will guide future strategic and
programmatic priorities in the region and in Ecuador, including the new Regional Office Management Plan and
relevant CO Programme Documents. The Venezuela Outflow evaluation reviews the appropriateness,
effectiveness, coherence, coordination, efficiency and connectedness of the delivery response actions and
strategies implemented by the ECO. The primary intended users of the case study are UNICEF COs, LACRO and HQ.
Specifically, at the level of ECO the evaluation findings and recommendations will feed into the development of
the new Country Programme Document that is being developed in 2022. Secondary intended users are IPs, UNICEF
GoE partners and UN agencies. Finally, this study aims to guide ECO and LACRO on pathways to improve their
response in order to better serve migrants, refugees and host communities impacted by the VMC.
For the purposes of this evaluation, it has been important to focus on:
 Ecuador’s efforts to ensure access to services, enhanced protection of children and access to GBV
prevention and referral, which includes capacity building and reinforcement of local structures.
11
 UNICEF has avoided duplicating existing systems; hence it will be valuable to assess the challenges
addressed, in terms of capacity building, linking emergency and development actions and integrating them
in long-term planning processes.
 The ultimate incorporation of migration flows and the application of The Global Programme Framework
on Children on the Move, the challenges and opportunities experienced and the extent to which they have
been factored into UNICEF COs as a new paradigm for the long term.
 Exploration of upstream and downstream advocacy and capacity building, route-based approach, key
transit areas and border crossings services and protection, services and assistance in urban settlements,
indigenous communities and social cohesion/tensions with local host communities.
The evaluation has had a gender and equity focus component, exploring how and to what degree UNICEF has been
implementing the gender and equity lens and considered gender dynamics, such as socio-economic status, ethnic
groups, and other relevant variables in its design, planning and implementation.
2.2 Objectives
As per the evaluation Terms of Reference (ToR), the primary objective of this case study is to evaluate the extent
to which UNICEF has provided an adequate, effective and timely response to the crises generated by the outflow
of migrants from Venezuela to Ecuador since February 2019, and to understand what the enabling and constraining
factors and lessons learned have been. It additionally looks into UNICEF actions to create opportunities to establish
localised solutions, as well as more long-term solutions to the integration of migrants through institutions and
systems of duty bearers. The results of the case study will provide some insight and recommendations for the
ECO´s new CPD.
It will also seek to analyse the extent to which changes in social norms, including those related to gender and
xenophobia, are envisioned and strategies are in place and are measurable.
The evaluation has sought to identify good practices, innovative approaches and lessons learned and to develop,
in a participatory manner, forward-looking recommendations to strengthen UNICEF’s results, with a special focus
on reaching the most vulnerable groups. The evaluation provides evidence on whether UNICEF’s Regional
Response to the VMC has been, and continues to be, appropriate, effective, efficient, coherent, coordinated and
connected.
2.3 Scope
Timeframe: This evaluation covers UNICEF’s response to the Venezuela outflow crises in Ecuador, from the time
the Level 2 Corporate Emergency Activation Procedure (CEAP)62 was triggered in February 2019 to its deactivation
in June 2020, as well as the overlapping period with the Global L3 CEAP, activated in April 2020, following the
COVID-19 outbreak. As most field missions have been carried out during the last quarter of 2021, it was agreed
with LACRO to extend the timeframe beyond the deactivation of the L2 VMC Emergency until December 2021.
Criteria scope: The evaluation covers the evaluation criteria of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, Development Assistance Committee OECD-DAC63 adapted to humanitarian interventions in line
with guidelines of the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action
(ALNAP)64, namely: appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence & coordination, coverage and
connectedness.
Geographical scope: The case study focused on three main cities/regions: Manta (Manabí), Tulcán (Carchi), Quito
(Pichincha). The evaluation will cover UNICEF urban and rural interventions in those locations for migrants,
refugees and host populations, particularly assessing responses to permanent or in-transit populations as well as
host communities.
COVID-19: the evaluation will include an assessment of UNICEF’s COVID-19 adaptations to the migration crisis
response.

3. Evaluation criteria and questions
Evaluation criteria are aligned with the OECD/DAC criteria and incorporate two cross-cutting approaches: a human
rights approach (HR) and a gender perspective. The evaluation assesses the extent to which the human rights,
gender equality, equity and intercultural approach for girls, boys and adolescents was incorporated into the
implementation of the to the VMC. In terms of quality standards, the evaluation refers to UNICEF’s 2020 Core
Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action65 as well policy guidance for children on the move.
The evaluation questions (EQs) have been validated by a reference group66 and arranged in an evaluation matrix
(see Annex 2). The evaluation team67 maintains the same questions for all case studies to ensure harmonisation of
the enquiry process.
4. Methodology of the Ecuador country case study
The methodology applied for this study is that approved in the inception report (IR) for all the evaluation process.
The evaluation has defined an analytical framework with all applicable standards of reference to the case of
children on the move, which is the core of the response to be evaluated. The analytical framework has been
constructed combining the OECDDAC criteria with such human rights instruments as:
65 https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/core-commitments-children
66 The reference group was formed by UNICEF RO and composed of programmatic and operational UNICEF staff at regional and country level.
67 The Ecuador country visit was composed of only one evaluator; however the regional analysis is composed of an evaluation team of four team members.
13
 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child68
 Minimum Standards for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action69
 The Guidelines for Integrating Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action70
 The Global Compact on Migration71;
 The Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking
 Minimum Standards of the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE)72
 UNHCR Policy Framework for the Protection of Children73
 The Global Programme Framework on Children on the Move74
 UNICEF’s Six-Point Agenda for Children on the Move75
 UNICEF Core Commitments for Children (CCCs).76
The evaluation is utilisation focused and participatory, with a focus on learning. The evaluation is also forward-
looking with a view to shedding light on the results achieved so far and the possible strategic and programmatic
priorities in the region towards durable solutions for the beneficiaries and communities.
In the absence of a formulated log frame or ToC for the VMC response in Ecuador, the evaluator has attempted to
construct a ToC (see Annex 1), as to shape a theoretical framework which spans both humanitarian and
development dimensions, as approved in the IR.
The methodology consists of mixing various methods as presented below. In particular, the country case study is
based on extensive document and literature review, semi-structured interviews with key informants (KIs) at
national and local level, and field visits to consult representatives of both migrant and host communities.
4.1 Document review
During the data collection phase, the evaluator conducted an extensive review of country- and regional-level
document on the coverage and quality of humanitarian assistance relevant for each country case study. This review
of key qualitative and quantitative material, including metrics applicable to UNICEF’s response and strategy for
responding to the needs of migrant populations and host communities, has informed understanding how UNICEF
has leveraged its mandate to strengthen the rights of migrant and refugee children, to improve access to services
and to seek solutions for refugees and migrants. This in-depth analysis allowed the evaluator to create a framework
to measure progress on collective (regional or cross-border) and individual (country-level) efforts and capture
lessons learned and good practices.
The desk review included the information provided by LACRO and ECO, available in shared folders, sometimes
internal and non-public documents, monitoring data, operational contracts and reports of IPs, contextual data of
the RRMP, R4V platform, academia, GoE and other sources (see Annex 3 for an overview of documents and
secondary data sources consulted).
4.2 Context analysis and timeline
During the data collection phase, the evaluator conducted individual country-level context analyses as part of each
country case study, to identify and analyse the different contextual factors, including the political and pandemic
response, under which each country operation has been working. This includes the identification of challenges and
adaptations, such as qualitative or quantitative description and analysis of the local economic, political,
institutional and socio-cultural context, to understand how local factors might affect outcomes across the
countries where UNICEF implements its activities.

4.3. Country visit
From 14 to 26 of November 2021, the evaluator visited sites where UNICEF implements activities and support local
institutions, in Manta, Tulcán and Quito. At the sub-national level, the ToR specified that the evaluation should
select sites purposefully to learn about a route-based approach, which examines how UNICEF has responded at
transit and border points as well at destination areas. Initially the evaluator had planned to visit Quito, Tulcán and
Huaquillas to ensure a route-based approach. After consultation with ECO and desk review, and given that the
field office (FO) in Huaquillas was being closed, it was decided that a field visit to Manta would be more appropriate
(see agenda in Annex 4). Indeed, the visit to the Manta FO allowed the evaluator to observe different activities,
meet with partners and government officials, while seeing different context of UNICEF, IP and government work
(transit versus permanent population).
4.4 Semi-structured key informant interviews
Fifty-four semi-structured interviews (28 with females and 26 with males) were carried out (on-site and remotely)
with key in-country informants (both at national and field level) based on the stakeholder analysis in the IR and
adapted during the data collection phase in Ecuador. Interviews were undertaken with ECA and LACRA staff, IPs,
government counterparts, multilateral agencies, bilateral donors and civil society organisations (CSOs) (see Annex
5 for list of interviewees). Furthermore, group discussions were held with FO staff in each of the areas visited to
get their overview and identify challenges, gaps and lessons learned. Group discussions in the field were also
carried out with parents and representatives of both migrant and host communities (see below). A generic
interview guide guided the Ecuador case study and can be found in Annex 6. Interview guides were kept as simple
and as brief as possible without compromising quality, giving the highest levels of sensitivity and respect for
beneficiaries and communities, and staff.
An interview guide, based on the revised EQs was used in the Ecuador Case Study and can be found in Annex 6.
Interview protocols were kept as simple and as brief as possible without compromising quality, giving the highest
levels of sensitivity and respect for beneficiaries and communities, and staff, including an AGD approach. In order
to capture gender perspectives, 6 focus group and informal discussions (14 female and five men) with
representatives of both migrant and host communities, including both women and men migrants and refugees,
and adolescent girls and boys on the move, were carried out in all field locations visited.
4.5 Engagement with families of children on the move and host communities
The evaluator conducted sex- and age-disaggregated group discussions with Venezuelan migrants on the move.
Specifically, families with children involved in UNICEF -funded programmes and activities at sub-national level were
considered for selection in group discussions. The evaluator requested UNICEF’s support in setting up focus group
discussions (FGDs). There was a variety of KIs, both in age, gender, as well as diversity of activities they participate
in. These included informants from the Espacio de Apoyo Integral (EAIs)77 in Tulcán and Manta. Rolled out by ECO
in 2019, EAIs provide a physical space offering legal counselling, socioemotional support, recreational activities
and orientation.78 Following the age, gender and diversity (AGD) approach, there was a wide range of informants.
A total of 9 FGDs were held with beneficiaries from host and migrant communities, including a balance of both
men and women, as well as children and adolescents in a range of settings along the migration route. All public
health recommendations, such as masking and social distancing, were respected.
4.6 Data analysis
Qualitative evidence from the interviews was analysed according to emergent categories of analysis, e.g., similar
themes or issues raised by multiple respondents, and through an initial qualitative analysis. The data analysis was
used to support comparisons within and between FOs and across sectors on variables that can be accurately
quantified. This data includes the number and types of beneficiaries, financial data and the relationship between
targets set and targets achieved across UNICEF interventions and sectors. Quantitative methods were used to
compare responses between groups on EQs and gauge the extent to which different respondents may agree or
diverge. Triangulation was used to ensure that evidence generation is robust by mitigating the bias generated by
77 EAIs are similar to the Blue Dot model, established by UNHCR to provide a safe space for families and children on the move in Europe. The framework
was adapted by ECO to respond to the needs of the Venezuelan population and host communities. These include integration activities as well as direct
assistance.

any single information source alone and that a reasonable level of convergence across different types of evidence
at different points in time is achieved to fully demonstrate findings and draw reasoned conclusions.
Data collected was triangulated in a number of ways:
 Source triangulation: comparing information from different sources, e.g., perspectives of different
stakeholder groups defined through the stakeholder analysis.
 Method triangulation: comparing information collected by different methods, e.g., interviews, document
reviews, observation and groups discussions.
 Geographic triangulation: comparing information collected from different FO to ensure that emerging
findings can be generalised and are not confined to a particular area context.
4.7 Feedback loops and validation process of the case study
This report was submitted to LACRO and ECO and went through a validation process:
1. LACRO and ECO staff provided written feedback to this report addressing inaccuracies, possible gaps in
information or misinterpretations.
2. Validation workshop: the evaluation organised with ECO and LACRO staff a workshop on xx August 2022
to briefly discuss findings and conclusions and to address any remaining gap in information. The main
objective of this workshop was to refine and validate recommendations, examine their feasibility to
encourage learning and to explore how to enhance ownership of the evaluation results.
5. Limitations of the case study
Limitation Action to minimise
Lack of a referenced ToC. The ET has outlined a ToC that was presented in the
approved IR. The ToC was the basis for the evaluation
framework and assumptions for the country case study.
Lack of data Quantitative data was difficult to receive as most of it is
saved in UNICEF’s SharePoint. Data collection was
finalised in February 2022 at which time financial data for
the whole of 2021 was not yet available.
Lack of a formulated strategic plan for the VMC in Ecuador The response is articulated as part of R4V platform and in

framework to assess progress to outcomes.
Evaluation fatigue: the ECO is going through various Care has been exercised not to overload the UNICEF team

Turnover of staff. Indirect information from other KIs has been collected to
complement the gap.
The evaluator also reached out to several people who are
no longer with the ECO but were key staff during the
response.
Government counterparts were not interviewed. The evaluator was unable to speak to government
officials at national level. Data was triangulated through
desk review and secondary studies.
The team requested a survey be shared with government
officials.79 Information from other sources was gathered.
79 As part of the data collection methods a short survey was distributed. However, given a low response rate at country level the survey data have not been
used for the country-level analysis. They will be used, however, in the cross-country analysis and synthesis.
16
6. Ethical and gender considerations
The evaluator applied the necessary ethical standards throughout the case study, as included in the IR. The Case
Study was designed according to, and its implementation relied on, the standards set forth in the Ethical Guidelines
for Evaluation80 prepared by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) and the UNICEF Procedure on Ethical
Standards and Research, Evaluation and Data Collection and Analysis.81
The evaluator strove to assure all participants were informed and their participation was voluntary. Privacy,
confidentiality, and wellbeing during this process was ensured through informed consent forms (see annex 7).
Regarding ethical approaches to managing evaluation participant data (applying to the content of interviews and
focus group discussions (FGDs), this case study ensured the following:
 Respect for dignity and diversity: respecting the differences in culture, local customs, religious beliefs,
gender, disability, age and ethnicity and the potential implications of these when carrying out our research.
We took steps to minimise any risk of disruption to the respondents, provided ample notice and respected
their privacy.
 Rights: We ensured that participants were treated as ‘autonomous agents’ and were given the time and
information to decide whether or not they wished to participate, and not pressurised into participating.
The participants were selected as per the defined sampling methodology.
 Redress: Participants were provided sufficient information to seek redress and how to register a
complaint.
 Confidentiality: We respected the respondent's right to provide information in confidence and made them
aware of the scope and limits of confidentiality. Names and any other sensitive information were
anonymised.
 Data security: Data has been stored systematically and securely and in line with DARA’s data protection
policy, which has been updated to be fully compliant with the 2018 GDPR standards. Data will be stored
in a way that makes it available and clearly accessible to the evaluator only. Data will be retained for the
period of the evaluation, and then destroyed.
 The IR and supporting data collection tools were submitted for an external Institutional Review Board
(IRB) review, which is required according to UNICEF ethics procedure when data collection happens with
vulnerable groups, e.g. children. Final IRB approval can be found in Annex 8.
 The case study and overall evaluation frameworks, as well as all data collection tools were built on
UNICEF procedures for Ethical Research Involving Children (ERIC).82
 The team followed best practice and UNEG guidance. The team carried out the work with special
attention to conflict sensitive and ethical considerations in all cases and with particular sensitivity to
human rights and gender equality principles. Consultants strictly adhered to the Ethical Guidelines for
Evaluation in the United Nations system, respecting the core principles of independence, impartiality,
credibility and utility. The ET confirms it does not have any conflict of interest. The ongoing interaction
with UNICEF throughout the evaluation process, validation of results and feedback on the reports ensured
accountability and transparency.
 The team used a gender-sensitive approach by integrating gender considerations into the entire
evaluation process. When selecting data sources, gender sensitivity was applied with due consideration of
the local context and in consultation with the implementing organisations with prime knowledge about
local conditions.

7. Findings
Findings are structured according to the evaluation criteria. Under each criterion the ET responds to related
overarching and specific questions. Each sub-section ends with synthesising related strengths and challenges.
7.1 Appropriateness
This section presents the key findings related to the appropriateness of UNICEF’s response to the VMC. Each of
the five EQs related to appropriateness are discussed in turn. Key findings are presented in a summary box
followed by the supporting analysis. 83
EQ1. To what extent did UNICEF’s Regional Office develop and adapt an integrated intervention logic (i.e.,
Theory of change/strategy for the regional response) that was appropriate and relevant to the changing
dynamics of the outflow and the needs of COs?
 The ET has seen several drafts of a comprehensive a strategy document which was first drafted in 2018,
but never finalised.
 The HAC is used as a strategy and provides for an intervention logic, which has its limitations.
 LACRO contributed to strengthening technical capacity mainly in Communication for Development (C4D),
WASH, education, gender and M&E.
 Three years after initiation of the response, LACRO’s CP section engaged with an independent organisation
to develop a regional strategic framework on children on the move.
No evidence of an overarching regional ToC84 to support COs, including ECO, to frame the emergency response
was provided to the ET, beyond the HAC appeals documents. Several informants commented on the lack of a clear
UNICEF regional strategy.85 According to several KIs, this directly impacted ECO´s ability to quickly respond and
adapt its response to the VMC according to the changing dynamics. Three interviewees mentioned ECO raised the
alarm early on, particularly regarding saturation of over-burdened social services, national and sub-national
competencies and capacities, risks related to unaccompanied minors and family separation as well as
administrative and legal gaps. However, it seems a regional coordinated response was difficult to set up.86 In the
absence of a ToC of reference for the UNICEF response, and on the basis of evidence collected from the initial desk
review of relevant documents (results frameworks, implementation plan, action plans, situational reports, etc.),
the evaluator reconstructed the implicit theory of change, integrating the current results frameworks of the
interventions and relevant gaps. The ToC was approved in the IR and can be used by ECO to build one of their own.
According to KIs with UNICEF team members in Ecuador, the main contribution of LACRO to the regional response
has been the technical support in the humanitarian response, resource mobilisation, and some coordination
between UNICEF COs affected by the VMC. Additionally, LACRO’s role was to fundraise at regional level through
Canada, ECHO, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO, ex DFID) and distribute funds to
each CO for national level programmes. KIs and document review show that LACRO and CO did not develop an
integrated intervention logic or ToC to address the VMC. The country level and regional response was guided by
the HAC, RMRP, and UNICEF’s Six-point Agenda for Children on the Move. Funding analysis, document review and
several KIs show that LACRO was unable to mobilise resources via the R4V platform in order to secure an adequate
flow of financial resources to allow ECO to respond effectively to the scale and complexity of the VMC. LACRO was
able to mobilise funds effectively through bilateral donor funding, rather than through the platform.
In this, UNICEF LACRO’s coordination and contribution to the response at national level is seen to have been
relevant, but also lacking in some key areas:
● The regional response led by IOM and UNHCR as well as UNICEF ‘response to the VMC has been severely
underfunded. ECO staff overwhelmingly stated that funding for the UNICEF response in Ecuador has not
83 All country case studies focused on national and sub-national data collection. This question should be nuanced to reflect there has not been regional data
collection, therefore triangulation with regional analysis has not been done. This EQ will be further analysed in the synthesis report.
84 UNICEF guidance does not require a ToC to be developed for a humanitarian response.
85 In May 2022, LACRO shared a draft regional strategy with the evaluation team. The draft version, dated September 2018, establishes a regional strategy
around three pillars: comprehensive child protection, humanitarian action, development and social policy. However, no final version was shared. It is our
understanding that as of (May 2022 UNICEF was drafting a new regional strategy.
86 Several KIs stated that political sensitivities may have caused this delay. The team was provided with a draft UNICEF Regional Response Strategy from
September 2018. It is unclear, as of April 2022, if and when this document was approved. It is important however to note that this country case study has
focused on national and sub-national data collection. As stated above, the regional triangulation will be done in the synthesis report.
18
corresponded with needs and requirements. Although LACRO supported ECO with resource mobilisation, Kiss
stated they did not feel that LACRO was advocating enough at HQ and global level for recognition and higher
funding, specifically when compared to the extent and impact of the VMC at regional, national and sub-
national level. As detailed below in EQ 14, this is mainly due to the complexity of the R4V coordination
platform and competing mandates and interests. This will be further analysed and reflected in the synthesis
report.
● In terms of coordination between countries, ECO respondents note that LACRO did facilitate some cross-
border conversations between LACRO and ECO. However, there was a lack of coordination between ECO and
the Venezuela CO. Several KI stated this would have been a fundamental step to ensure the ECO response
was adapted to the flows and needs of migrants.
● LACRO is seen to have provided technical support to various sections of the ECO response. Sectors that have
had specific technical support include C4D,87 WASH, education, gender, and M&E.88 However, the COVID-19
pandemic and restriction measures broke the flow of technical support and visits from LACRO colleagues
early in 2020 and as of December 2021 had not resumed at an adequate level.89 More sustained technical
support from LACRO would be appreciated. Several sectors did state they had received technical support
(guidance, procedures, training and/or informal discussions) but that it was sector-related and dependent on
individual affinities.
● KIIs with Ecuador team members and partners identified an overall weakness in advocacy and investment in
an early warning system that would be triggered from Venezuela, where the population movements
originate, and relayed to localities and countries along the migration route, allowing them time to prepare to
receive large population movements. Furthermore, due to the political sensitivities of the VMC, some KIs
stated that the alert was given by ECO but that LACRO was unwilling to react. Although the response started
before the declaration of the L2, several KIs stated that delay in declaring an emergency slowed down several
processes that could have facilitated a more efficient, fluid and coordinated response. While the migration
flow in Ecuador dates to at least 2017, and the Declaration of Migratory Emergency was issued on August 9
2018,90 LACRO’s L2 emergency activation took place only in February 2019. One could argue that this was
relatively late. This activation follows the declaration in April 2018 from the UN Secretary-General for IOM
and UNHCR to lead and coordinate the regional response to the situation of refugees and migrants from
Venezuela and establishment of the GIFMM or R4V Platform. The reasons for this delayed response will be
considered in more detail in the Regional Level interviews and report.
● Finally, KIs from UNICEF recognised the absence of an integrated information sharing system. As a regional
crisis, it has been recognised by all organisations and actors that enhancing information sharing between
countries would improve preparedness in the different countries.
EQ2. To what extent did UNICEF Ecuador develop and adapt response theories of change, strategies,
objectives and implementation modalities that were appropriate and relevant to the changing needs of
migrant children/families, opportunities, capacities and circumstances in border, transit and urban/rural
settlements, including adaptations to the COVID19 outbreak.
 Overall, UNICEF Ecuador has developed and adapted a number of response strategies, objectives and
implementation modalities, which have been appropriate and relevant to the changing needs of migrant
children and their families along the migration route. These included adaptations to the COVID-19
outbreak.
87 A majority of advocacy and communications campaigns are drafted at regional level and adapted at national level to translate well to the national and
sub-national context-related issues.
88 Technical notes, meetings and lessons learned were shared between countries, supported by LACRO. There were also specific technical visits from
LACRO staff to ECO to ensure exchange and ownership.
89 It should be noted that regional specialists need to be invited by a CO to go on mission and support it.

 Migration was mentioned in the current CPD and “migration dynamics”91 was stated as one of the
reasons for regional prioritisations. The new CPD offers an opportunity to further institutionalise
migration as part of UNICEF Ecuador’s strategy for the years to come.
 UNICEF adapted its programming and activities when COVID-19 hit, distributing hygiene kits, information
on sanitary measures and additionally provided psycho-social support.
 UNICEF adapted to the changing profiles of migrants, shifting to include more integration measures to
respond to migrants and host communities.
 In a number of cases however, the appropriateness of and relevance of UNICEF strategies, objectives and
implementation modalities could be reviewed and revised, in light of the scale and complexity of the
VMC.
According to the 2019 HAC, Ecuador was one of the countries that had to adjust its plan to include migration flows
in 2019. UNICEF`s modus operandi was adapted in order to include:
 a humanitarian aspect to cover protection for migrant children and their families, to ensure access to CP
services, education, holistic health and nutrition support and WASH services
 CP and advocacy to ensure that migrants and refugee children including their families are at the core of
the actions taken by national stakeholders, civil society and humanitarian organisations
 resilient development and social policy to promote inclusion and integration.
It is clear through the document review and interviews, that UNICEF Ecuador adapted its response to the changing
dynamics. As detailed below, ECO adapted its strategy to the changing needs of families, unaccompanied minors
and populations in transit and with desire to reside in Ecuador (vocación de permanencia). Specifically, ECO
focused its work on strengthening national and sub-national processes for regularisation. ECO also worked closely
with its IPs to improve and increase processes and structures to accompany and respond to the needs of
unaccompanied minors. Additionally, ECO adapted its response to the changing national dynamics.
When the Venezuelan migration influx began, the humanitarian communities’ main areas of attention were at the
northern and southern borders: Rumichaca, San Miguel and Huaquillas. UNICEF was one of the first agencies to
implement activities in Rumichaca and San Miguel and open dialogue with local authorities, while raising the alarm
at national level. During the first six months of 2019, in Rumichaca and San Miguel, activities were focused on cash-
based interventions (CBI), WASH, CP, nutrition, health and non-food Items (NFIs), awareness and information
campaigns, protection and advocacy for education to migrants who were, for the vast majority, transiting through
Ecuador to reach Peru, Chile or elsewhere.
UNICEF’s work focused on three pillars:
i) humanitarian assistance to those in transit
ii) comprehensive protection of children and adolescents,
iii) inclusion in the host country. 92
Following the COVID-19 outbreak, UNICEF had to adapt its response to the changing needs. Particularly, ECO
focused on delivering personal hygiene and protective equipment supplies in collaboration with WFP. Cash-Based
Interventions (CBI) was maintained and interviews were conducted over the phone. UNICEF focused on psycho-
emotional support through virtual workshops to children and adolescents while also working with school staff to
ensure appropriate measures were being implemented in online classes. Social protection activities were
maintained through IPs. Additionally, UNICEF was able to leverage its longstanding relationship with MinEduc93 to
support teachers and caregivers with distance learning methodologies and socio-emotional assistance. More than
500 tablets and 4,335 sim cards with call and connectivity plans were donated so that teachers and student
advisors could provide academic and emotional support to students and their families.
In August 2020, GTRM published a Joint Needs Assessment94 indicating that 72 per cent of households in human
mobility had problems related to right to housing such as difficulty in paying rent or risk of eviction. In 2021, UNICEF

started implementing a new CBI strategy to support Venezuelan families, in close coordination with UNHCR and
WFP. Unlike the earlier once-off cash the new strategy provides support to households for nine months, in addition
to a once-off support for each child attending school. The new modality has a stronger emphasis on education and
protection. An evaluation of the CBI programme, completed in the last quarter of 2020, showed it increased school
attendance (all age groups) and access to health services for under-fives, among other positive effects.95
Lastly, a notable adaptation is the EAI in Tulcán. Since 2018, UNICEF had a strong presence in Rumichaca, delivering
essential humanitarian assistance to those in transit. However, after the introduction of the 2019 “Humanitarian”
visa, there has been an increase of populations arriving through irregular entry points (trochas).96 As population
entries have significantly decreased, due to this visa and the COVID-19 pandemic, KIs from UN agencies, IP and
affected populations indicate that the need for an ongoing presence in Rumichaca is no longer justified. Due to
the current restrictive context and the pandemic, several informants mentioned Rumichaca is no longer a strategic
point of presence. However, if and when the context changes (political or health), UNICEF and its IP should be
ready to revise their presence in the northern border. As is, UNICEF’s and its IP’s added value are seen to be both
in Tulcán and in the migration route from the northern border towards Quito. UNICEF considers it key to have a
safe space where populations (both migrants and host communities) can find assistance, guidance and support.
Yet with the COVID-19 outbreak the Tulcán EAI was shut down for several months during which time UNICEF, its
IP and other agencies switched to online activities. When the centre reopened in 2022, UNICEF in collaboration
with the Ecuadorian Red Cross, was able to implement the appropriate health and safety measures, and offer
vaccination stations. Building on the positive experience of the EAI,97 UNICEF has opened an EAI in Manta. The
team visited the EAI in Manta and Tulcán, cities with different migration profiles (vocation of permanence and in-
transit, respectively). In Manta, partner organisations and IP are more focused on integration with legal assistance,
capacity-building, socio-economic strengthening. Both EAI work closely with the local Gobierno Autónomo
Descentralizado (GAD)98 to build ownership and ensure durability.
EAI entrance in Tulcán/@Julia Durand
Following IOM and UNHCR data on migration profiles, UNICEF has adapted the concept of the EAI to tailor it to the
needs of the population in Manta. This EAI is very recent and will need to be evaluated to ensure that the EAI
concept can be adapted to different contexts. UNICEF has also began building/ renovating a space in the city of
Esmeraldas to open an EAI by the end of 2022.99
95 Evaluation reports | UNICEF Evaluation in UNICEF
96 UNICEF Country Office Annual Report, 2019
97 Several KIs, from UNICEF, IPs and UN agencies involved with the EAI in Tulcán, reported challenges in setting it up. However, all stated it is an innovation
compared to other spaces, as there is strong coordination and collaboration between several IPs, UN agencies and government officials. Also, the centre is
where the GTRM meets weekly, reported as another added value.
98 GADs exist at region, province, canton and parish levels across Ecuador. They enjoy political, administrative, and financial autonomy, and are governed by
the principles of solidarity, subsidiarity, equity, interterritorial, integration, and citizen participation.

EQ3: To what extent were UNICEF’s plans, actions and key decisions informed by the active participation
and voice of affected populations? Were different types of beneficiaries consulted and included in the
response?
 UNICEF has participated in three joint assessments which allowed the agency to tailor its activities and
programming to the changing needs and profiles of populations.
 While standard feedback mechanisms were set up UNICEF could and should go further to include voices of
affected populations.
 Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) and Communicating with Communities (CWC) are part of all
Project Cooperation Agreement (PCAs) with IPs.
UNICEF has participated in three joint needs assessments100 through the national R4V platform, the GTRM. This
has allowed it to tailor activities and programming to the changing needs and profiles of populations. U-Report –
a messaging tool to empower and connect young people around the world to engage with and speak out on issues
that matter to them101 – also allowed gathering of feedback from adolescents.
In 2019, in coordination with the Education sector, activities were held in host communities and schools to reach
teachers, students and communities with messages on the importance of inclusion and intercultural dialogue with
the aim to prevent xenophobia. Focus groups were held at border points as an AAP mechanism. This involved
asking 936 people to participate in the evaluation of activities and to give recommendations to strengthen and
adjust UNICEF’s programmes.102 The ET has been unable to ascertain these adjustments had been made following
this consultative process. However, several KIs stated that the launch of the anti-xenophobia campaign was based
on Venezuelan migrants, particularly children. Following FGDs with children from host communities and migrant
populations, UNICEF gathered that the messaging was more harmful than helpful. Targeting a specific nationality
made them more visible and more prone to bullying. Students from host communities also mentioned that there
were other nationalities to consider. Following this feedback, UNICEF adapted its messaging and developed a
broader communication strategy to implement the Seamos Amigos campaign, which involved several activities
aiming at promoting rights, empathy, solidarity and conflict resolution.103
Despite the positive investments in consulting and communicating
with affected populations, AAP and the implementation of appropriate
feedback mechanisms remain a challenge. First, while AAP and
Communicating with Communities (CWC) are part of all IP PCAs, for
most partners their operationalisation remains challenging. KIs have
stated that changing contexts, high turnover, short-lived programmes
and reporting burdens have impeded full implementation of AAP and
CWC mechanisms. While the standard active and reactive
mechanisms104 are put into place to ensure minimum standards are
followed (e.g. suggestion boxes, phone interviews, hotlines, focus
groups, community visits/consultations), AAP, C4D and active
participation remain activities led and implemented by the
communications team in UNICEF. KIs stated that AAP is not
mainstreamed through programmes and activities, rather something
that is implemented through the communications team and which is s
not systematically incorporated. Although needs assessments,
standard feedback mechanisms and PCA’s with AAP components are
set up, the final step to accountability mechanisms is weak. As the
START Network states, accountability mechanisms aim to take
account, give account and be held to account:
100 Joint Needs Assessment are channelled through the R4V platform. There have been 2 in 2020 and one in May 2021.

Affected people should have the opportunity to assess what agencies are doing and how they are providing
assistance, to provide feedback that is meaningfully considered and incorporated, and to sanction abuses
and poorly delivered assistance, wherever possible. This means that people should also be informed about
how agencies have responded to their feedback.105
EQ4: Did the design of interventions take into account specific barriers linked to gender and societal
expectations, challenges faced by minorities (for example indigenous migrants), vulnerable groups (for
example unaccompanied children or children with disabilities, women and pregnant women, etc.)?
 UNICEF has been advocating for vulnerable groups, such as unaccompanied children and pregnant
women, through safe spaces, capacity building and technical support to government institutions.
 Although ECO does not have a gender specialist, it has been integrating gender equality, GBV prevention
and psychosocial support into its programming in different sectors.
During the first phase of the response, until the introduction of the 2019 visa requirements, UNICEF created safe
overnight spaces, child-friendly spaces, and breastfeeding spaces in Rumichaca to respond to the population
entering Ecuador. In both EAIs which the evaluator visited, in Tulcán and Manta, there is a focus on addressing
specific gender challenges faced by migrants and host communities, through psychosocial support, skills-building
workshops for women, workshops on the prevention of GBV and promotion of positive masculinity. This is done
through capacity building of local institutions, information campaigns on the risks faced by both populations,
training targeting vulnerable groups, and psychosocial support. Other vulnerabilities are also addressed in the EAIs,
where there are safe spaces for psychological support, legal assistance, accompanied activities for unaccompanied
minors and spaces for pregnant and lactating women.
Although ECO does not have a gender specialist, LACRO and ECO worked closely to implement capacity building
and technical support related to gender equality. Prevention of GBV and PSEA are core aspects of the response.
UNICEF has been active in raising the profile of those issues, ensuring visibility in all assessments and information
tools, providing training and monitoring progress. UNICEF has provided capacity building workshops in Ecuador for
local governments officials and IPs on CP and violence prevention, including sexual and gender-based violence
(SGBV).106 Another example of activities that aim to address GBV is the project implemented through FULULU
which ran from August 2020 to February 2021. The activities aimed at generating teaching-learning processes on
non-violent masculinity, sexual diversity through capacity-building, GBV prevention, awareness-raising exercises
with adolescent and adult males, teachers and MinEduc personnel. However, without a focal point, ECO has limited
capacity to appropriately address the differential gender needs of migrants or host communities. FGDs showed
that a priority for migrants was to have more information on SGBV prevention, safe routes and available services.
ECO is seen to be addressing these concerns, with limited resources. In April 2022, Canada agreed to support
UNICEF to improve protection services for Venezuelan adolescents, particularly girls, in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Brazil and Guyana.107
Additionally, ECO has been implementing alternative gender responsive care modalities for migrant children in a
housing structure in Quito operated by DCF, with the support of the Ministerio de Inclusión Económica y Social
(MIES). The project will help to enhance psycho-emotional support services and provide guidance for the
development of life plans for adolescents (autonomy and empowerment), including life-skills capacities for
adolescent girls. 108
UNICEF has been a key stakeholder in raising awareness around unaccompanied minors (children and
adolescents). Since the beginning of the VMC, unaccompanied minors have been of growing concern. UNICEF has
been able to implement alternative care structures, such as the shelter house in Quito managed by DCF. The house
helps teenagers in the process of family reunification, providing safe space for overnight stays, psycho-emotional
care and recreational activities. The alternative care structure uses a methodology developed by UNICEF with
feedback from the IP. It provides accompaniment and support for developing life skills, life plans leading to greater

autonomy. As an informant mentioned, this methodology and subsequent structures in Tulcán and Quito led to
the creation of a formalised technical norm for the MIES’ temporary spaces of care (casas de abrigo). Additionally,
UNICEF is supporting institutions working on children and adolescents’ protection, both for migrant and host
communities, to strengthen Ecuador’s protection system. This work includes technical support, capacity building,
and training to government institutions, such as the MIES, the La Junta Cantonal de Protección de Derechos de la
Niñez y Adolescencia109 and several GADs (Tulcán, Manta, Lago Agrio, among others).
In 2019, following an episode of femicide, there was an increase of xenophobia and acts of discrimination against
the migrant population. ECO shifted its campaigns to address these issues, with a strong focus on inclusion and
integration, including activities with both migrant and host communities.
However, some vulnerabilities, such as those faced by people with disabilities, while addressed in programme
documents, are not fully considered in the implementation of activities. The evaluator particularly noted this
during a visit to the EAI in Tulcán where access is obtained by a two-story staircase.
Indigenous migrants do not seem to be a target population for the VMC in Ecuador. Other vulnerable groups were
not considered for this country case study, either due to limited data, limited data collected by the evaluator or
no specific mention of these groups in programme and reporting documents.
EQ5: How appropriate were UNICEF’s internal arrangements at RO and CO levels for the
management/staffing/leadership/capacity development/technical support (including human resources,
tools, protocols, fundraising and managerial capacity/surge capacity, etc.) to address the context, scale and
complexity of the Venezuelan outflow?
 ECO is understaffed and overstretched; notably, ECO does not have a gender focal point.
 ECO closed its Huaquillas office in 2021, which has been stated as a limiting factor to an appropriate
response.
Most informants reported that UNICEF staff is both understaffed and overstretched. As noted, ECO does not have
a gender specialist. Many KIs mentioned overall fatigue due to the length of the emergency, no clear regional
strategy, changing national contexts and the COVID-19 crisis. This response also closely follows UNICEF’s 2016
earthquake response, which had already strained UNICEF staff.110 A key finding of the COVID-19 Real Time
Assessment (RTA)111 stated burnout as an issue to be addressed by adopting “additional measures to address CO
staff burnout and support LAC staff to cope with a persistent crisis.” One KI stated that ECO did implement mental
health care through a staff-dedicated psychologist, free memberships of wellbeing apps, internal discussions and
forums. However, the ET was not able to assess to what extent these tools were used by staff members.
Due to the changing political contexts in both Ecuador and Peru, documents and several KIs mentioned that UNICEF
closed its FO at the southern border of Huaquillas. This decision was made due to the political context which
resulted in Peru, like Ecuador, restricting its entry requirements to migrants at the border. Additionally, in January
2021 Peru deployed military forces to the Peruvian border,112 which heightened tensions for migrants trying to
leave Ecuador to enter Peru. UNICEF shifted its focus to provide humanitarian assistance to people in transit to
other cities as well as strengthening its integration strategy.113 KIs from different UNICEF, IPs and UN agencies
stated that while this may have been justified at the time due to funding constraints the decision caused a major
gap in addressing the needs of migrants in the region. The absence affects direct assistance (in WASH, protection
and education) as well as advocacy at local level.
In Tulcán, a key field office for the VMC, UNICEF has two National United Nations Volunteer (NUNVs): a CP officer
and a driver. Although migrant needs and profiles are changing, the Tulcán FO remains an important attention
point not only in the city of Tulcán but also along the route between Tulcán and Ibarra. Although KIs

110 The earthquake response relied on surge capacity including experts in emergency response, compared to the VMC response where UNICEF decided against
having two parallel teams.

overwhelmingly praised UNICEF staff for their dedication and involvement, several noted that expecting one
person to tend to all the needs in the region is a major gap in UNICEF’s ability to respond.
Informants agree that the lack of experience in humanitarian response required a process of institutional learning.
External missions and consultancies were mobilised at the initial phases with this aim. In 2018 and in June 2019
consultants were hired to identify and address bottlenecks around the roll-out of the GoE’s Procedimiento de
atención para niñas, niños, adolescentes y sus familias en contextos de movilidad humana en Ecuador.114 This
aimed at following up the methodology of the interview process -a key step in the implementation of the
procedure, identifying gaps and opportunities to improve the process. The analysis and recommendations from
this consultancy were shared with the Ministry of the Interior – now known as the Ministerio de Gobierno (MoG)
and MIES.115
Several KIIs stated that leadership at both national and local levels has not been consistent throughout the
response,116 thus directly impacting the ability to advocate for the VMC to local and national government officials,
donor, and the international community. However, UNICEF staff overwhelmingly stated significant leadership and
support (both at human and professional levels) were one of the key reasons ECO was able to respond as it has
throughout the VMC. Through KIIs and observations the evaluator found the ECO and FOs to be overstretched
while facing severe constraints such as the humanitarian visa and the pandemic.
7.2 Effectiveness
The evaluation of the effectiveness of UNICEF’s response is guided by the following overarching question: To what
extent did UNICEF’s response to the VMC achieve, or can be expected to achieve, its objectives and results,
including any differential results across groups, (including by gender/age/ethnicity) across border, transit, urban
and other settlements? Similar to the previous section on Appropriateness, specific EQs about effectiveness will
be discussed in turn. This section will systematically review results achieved by each sector of the response.
EQ6. To what extent did UNICEF’s response to the VMC achieve, or can be expected to achieve, its objectives
and results, including differential results across groups (including by gender/age/ethnicity) across border,
transit, urban and other settlements?
EQ7: How effective has UNICEF been in responding to the influx of Venezuelan migrant with regards to:
a) Supporting UNICEF- bolstered access to their rights and protection: child and social protection, education,
prevention of gender-based violence, early childhood development, health, nutrition and WASH services for
migrant, refugee and host community children
b) Supporting and promoting inclusion and integration by ensuring access to national social services and
humanitarian/social cash transfers; the regularisation of children’s and families’ legal status; strengthened
social policies and national/local integration capacities.
c) Generating a sense of empowerment for migrant children, adolescents and families in terms of having
access to information and opportunities.
 Less than 40 per cent of the indicators have met the targets each year (2019 and 2020). In 2020, COVID-19
caused many planned activities to be either cancelled or changed. At the same time some sectors, such as
CP and WASH, were able to increase their outreach.
 Unclear targeting definition shows that in some cases either target populations have been
underestimated or the results from programme implementation have been over estimated. There seems
to be an indistinct relationship between available resources and reported results.
 There have been important funding gaps across sectors. Nutrition and advocacy were particularly under-
funded while CP has had the lowest percentage funding gap.

 Inconsistencies in monitoring and reporting information with indicators’ definition were found. The ET
was informed that ECO showed LACRO and UNICEF HQ some disconformity with some standard
indicators.
 There are some comparability issues form year to year, as indicators were not defined to be annually
collected.
 Even though results are not always disaggregated per type of beneficiary (VMC/ COVID 19), there are
some activities undertaken by the ECO where targets show good levels of reach including psychosocial
support, CP and education. CBI relieves stress for families and helped to empower female household
heads. A project run by Arteducarte117 to promote integration and challenge xenophobia and in-school
violence received positive comments from beneficiaries as did specific WASH interventions.
 ECO is an example of coordination with other agencies to improve the response, in particular during and
after COVID-19
 Strong capacity-building, training and technical support to bridge gaps (for health workers and / MinEduc
teachers.
 Insufficient facilities for Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC) and coverage of alternative
routes, ineffective nutrition response as per the targets stablished.
This Country Case Study will address EQs 6 and 7 as a continuum as they complement each other. Achievement
of results is usually gauged based on the level of achievement of the intended objectives through the progress of
the indicators that measure the different activities. This poses a challenge for this country case study as most of
the comparable information available comes from the regional Situational Reports, which only have a small
section with country information, and the Humanitarian Performance Monitoring (HPM)118 indicators, available
only for 2019. This limits the level of analysis. Additionally, the HPM indicators alone do not always demonstrate
the full result chain intended by the country operation. The ToC elaborated by the ET (see annex 1) provides a
frame for the overall response in Ecuador and assumes that achievement of results (through outputs) will
eventually lead to the intended outcomes, provided that the enabling factors as outlined in the ToC are ensured.
Furthermore, starting from the HAC revision119 in August 2020 and including the 2021 HAC the appeals both
included humanitarian needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic120 as well as those from the VMC.121
ECO has monitored its response to the VMC using between 12 to 15 HAC indicators to track sectoral response
yearly as presented in the SitReps (see Annex 9) (compared to the 40+ indicators included in the 2019 HPM).122 As
presented in Figure 5 below, in 2019 only 28 per cent of these indicators had met the established targets. In 2020,
this number reached almost 60 per cent. By March 2021 none of the indicators were close to reach their targets.123
Targets as per Ecuador CPD, at outcome level, are defined using governmental sources of information and
117 http://arteducarte.com/
118 The objective of the HPM is to support UNICEF CO management in a) assessing performance through improving predictable, effective and timely
humanitarian action of UNICEF and it partners, b) strengthening links between government frameworks, and UNICEF humanitarian and regular
programmes, and c) to reinforce accountability. The HPM is designed to feed into the Situation Report (SitRep) which is aligned to the CCCs and is the
minimum monitoring and reporting requirement for UNICEF COs in on-going humanitarian situations. HPM is self-reported. See: Humanitarian
Performance Monitoring Toolkit and Guide:

0Doc%2001June2011.pdf
119 As per the revised HAC 2020, in August 2020, UNICEF continued working at the border and transit paths but also scaled up its response to address needs
in urban settings. It kept CP at the centre of its humanitarian and COVID-19 action. Due to COVID-19, some UNICEF activities were temporarily suspended,
cancelled, or modified. To respond to the COVID-19 context, activities have been adapted, by introducing alternative modalities of service delivery, and
ensuring compliance with prevention measures and protection of frontline workers and beneficiaries
120 As presented in Latin America and the Caribbean COVID-19 Response Progress Report No. 3 “specific COVID-19 issues related to the response to the
Venezuela migration crisis are addressed in the country/sub-regional chapters of the R4V”. See https://www.unicef.org/media/83596/file/LACRO-COVID-19-
SitRep-22-July-2020.pdf
121 HAC2021 redefines the three priority strategic objectives as: (1) the most vulnerable Venezuelan migrant and refugee children and their families and host
communities; 2) the most vulnerable non-migrant children and families affected by COVID-19, and (3) children affected by violence and displacement. See:
https://www.unicef.org/media/98396/file/2021-HAC-Children-on-the-move-from-Venezuela-May-Update.pdf
122 In the HAC (and its related HPM) of 2019 the articulation of the response encompasses a formulation of sector results (nutrition, health, WASH, CP,
education, social inclusion and C4D) with a number of related indicators, with targets for both host population and for migrants. The use of different
indicators and different way of arranging indicators in successive years makes it difficult to compare from year to year and to assess progress over time for
the evaluation period. (See summary table of HPM indicators in Annex 9).
123 Information provided by LACRO until December 2021 showed that only one indicator was close to reaching the target (with a little above 70 per cent
coverage)
26
statistics. In 2019, UNICEF defined the targeted population for migrant and host communities based on data
provided by the RMRP (IOM-UNHRC), official data from the Ministry of Interior (Venezuelan people that entered
Ecuador), other secondary data sources124, and the three needs assessment undertaken by ECO in 2019-2021. In
its response UNICEF prioritised population on the move at border crossings in Rumichaca, San Miguel and
Huaquillas, and Venezuelan population settling in the main cities of Ecuador (Quito, Manta, Ibarra, Guayaquil,
Cuenca). With COVID-19 pandemic, needs changed and so did the targets.125 However, there is no detailed
information on the process for adjusting targets, or how other aspects such as resources, funding and planning
are included in the target setting process. Moreover, taking into account Ecuador 2019 and 2020 implementation
results, there is no strict correlation between funding needs met and the target completion (see figure below),
supporting the finding of a poor or unclear process for target setting.
Thus, from the data provided, the level of achievement of the indicators only partially informs the actual
achievement of results, which are implicit in the response as the overarching aim for each sector of intervention.
The evaluation will expand the ToA validation in the conclusions section.

If we compare the proportion of indicators that met their targets, as presented in the Situational Reports, with
the median coverage of the indicators registered each year, we can see that only in 2020 did the median surpass
100 per cent.
Figure 5. Proportion of implementation indicators met and unmet vs. Median coverage per year in Ecuador
UNICEF’s response is articulated with the formulation of sector results (CP, nutrition, health, WASH, education,
social inclusion, C4D and advocacy) with a number of related indicators, with population targets. In terms of
achievement of indicator targets by sector, Figure 6 shows that from 2019 to 2020 the only indicator included in
the Communications/Advocacy sector reached its objectives. Sixty per cent of the WASH indicators met their
targets as did 50 per cent of the indicators considered for CP. Health and Social inclusion reached their targets.
On the other side of the spectrum, none of the nutrition indicators reached their targets in the period 2019-

The use of different indicators and different ways of arranging indicators in successive years makes it difficult to
assess progress over time for the evaluation period. Also, disaggregated information is limited, so gender/ age
targets or type of population disaggregation is sometimes only presented in action plans, rendering in-depth
analysis only partially possible. We will consider some qualitative elements to assess effectiveness for each sector,
based on the initial formulation of intended results of 2019, also selecting the indicators that have some
permanence over time.
Health and nutrition
The output-level result formulated in the HAC 2019 is as follows:
Sector results formulated as in HAC 2019
Health: Boys and girls, adolescents and women on the move and in host communities equitably
access essential health services with sustained coverage of high-impact preventive and curative
interventions
Nutrition: Health systems strengthened to identify and address nutrition issues and monitor
nutrition trends
In 2019, the provision of baby kits for vulnerable children under the age of 3 surpassed by almost 70 per cent the
targeted population. This support reached Rumichaca and San Miguel through ADRA.127 On the other hand, there
are no achievements registered in 2020 due to COVID-19, when baby kits support was intended to reach Ecuador’s
northern border (Imbabura, Carchi, Esmeraldas, and Sucumbíos) and Manabí. Neither are there achievements
regarding UNICEF provision of technical assistance to the Ministry of Health nor with regard to CBI to help families
with children needing specialised medical assistance.128
In 2020, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic caused most HAC activities to be cancelled and therefore no
beneficiaries were registered in 2020 indicators. In 2021, the expected number of beneficiaries for the VMC was
defined, between two and to 40 per cent of the targeted population.129 A slow normalisation of activities in 2021
made it possible to register some improvements during the first quarter of the year, in particular using its regular
development programme to reach migrant and refugee population.
It is curious, however, to see that some accomplishments are described in the country section of the Situation
126 Note that at this stage only those indicators where targets have been fully met are being considered. The extent to which each indicator is close, or not,
to meet its targets will be analysed separately at a sectoral level in the following sections.

report, but no achievement is included in the regional comparative table with indicators (see 2020 indicators on
the table below). For example, the indicator on “Children and women accessing primary health care in UNICEF-
supported facilities” even when the activity is marked as cancelled in 2020, more information should be included
to better understand these achievements. In 2021, the target population increased exponentially due to the
change in scope. A clear improvement from the previous year was registered, with almost 24 per cent of the target
being covered from January to March.

The ET has had access to the 2019 HPM indicators for Ecuador and therefore was able to see the level of
performance in specific activities in relation to the response (these indicators were not included in the SitRep
2019, but results are showcased as part of the response to the migration crisis in the country descriptive section
of the report). These include the donation of medical supplies (zinc and oral rehydration salts), provision of
capacity training to health workers and certification of two new health facilities as mother and baby friendly, and
finally the distribution of a standardised Health Card, that included health history and vaccination, delivered to 81
per cent of the targeted population (migrant children and pregnant women).

The needs assessments presented in Ecuador’s country action plans with disaggregated target population data
(women, children, host and migrants) also determine HAC information on population. Targets were established in
light of the RRMP and the ECO capacity. However, this disaggregation has not been consistent with reporting
achievements. There are also questions on their variability over time.
In general, UNICEF’s response to the Venezuelan crisis in the nutrition sector in Ecuador from 2019 to 2021 can
be portrayed as ineffective. None of the targets were met and the 2020 activities after the pandemic were either
cancelled or delayed. As happened with the health sector there is only one indicator with information for two
years (2020 – 2021). Although activities had to be cancelled in 2020, and no achievements were recorded in 2020,
there are reports indicating that between February and March the UNICEF IP HIAS, conducted nutritional
screening, reaching over 250 under-fives and providing nutritional supplementation to 150 children. DyA screened
children for malnutrition, anaemia and provided immunisations and nutritional supplements. DyA reached 276
children in the host community in Guayaquil as well as 15 migrant children.
Over 2021 the screenings for anaemia and acute malnutrition implemented by DyA reached 847 under-fives. Two
hundred children were diagnosed with anaemia and received treatment, and five children were diagnosed with
acute malnutrition and were referred to health services. These five children, however, are not registered in the
table of results for the correspondent indicator.130
The nutrition sector is one of the sectors that received less funding over the years 2019 and 2021. It is relevant to
point out that no funds were registered (including carry-over) in 2020 and 2021 (until March).
Partners until 2020 were mainly the MoH, HIAS or ADRA but since 2021 one of the most important ones has been
DyA.

Excluding cross-sectoral sectoral funding, in 2019 the sector with the highest funding requirements was WASH. In
absolute terms requirements have been constant over the years. However, it has been an underfunded sector
receiving only 28 per cent of funding solicited in 2019 13 per cent in 2020 and 19 per cent in 2021 (Q1). In 2020,
notwithstanding the decrease in funds, both considered indicators surpassed the targeted population.132
As pointed out above in the discussions on health and nutrition, WASH indicators also change over time, and
progress towards results becomes challenging to assess. The table below presents all WASH indicators considered
in the response. Highlighted in grey bring so out how one indicator changes over time. Some aspects of the
response might not be considered throughout the years.
Most of the indicators considered over the period 2019-2021 reflect achievement of results, although there seems
to be some discrepancies regarding the populations reached. For example, in the Sit Rep 2021 the number of
reported beneficiaries of hygiene kits and showers and toilets in Huaquillas is 9,000 people, followed by the CBI
in partnership with WFP which reached 6,713 people.

Here we can also find indicators that do not capture the progress towards results. For instance, reaching more
than 114,000 people with daily access to safe water only captures the population that has potential access to
water systems (installed capacity) and not daily access, given that UNICEF provided support for maintenance of
WASH services in 2019.133 On the other hand, there seems to be an overestimation of the target population for
some indicators due to the acute drop in number of migrants following the humanitarian visa requirement at
border points. However, this could also be explained by a problem with the needs assessment or because of delays
in implementation, as the visa was established in August that year.
In any case the positive results on the WASH response seem to be linked to strong partnerships with national and
local governments134, UN agencies and private partners. Also, UNICEF’s role as focal point for COVID and people
on the move responses has mainstreamed coordination and extended its response plan. It is important to point
out some key response projects that have had a long-term effect. These include the wastewater treatment unit
installed in Rumichaca and drilling of a borehole at the migration point in Huaquillas in 2019. In 2020, in
collaboration with MinEduc, UNICEF conducted assessments to prioritise the improvement of toilet facilities,
handwashing stations and hygiene conditions of schools in which significant numbers of Venezuelans were
enrolled. This facilitated safe return to schools after the pandemic, as did a class in WASH in schools which was
offered online to teachers.
From May 2020 onwards and given the COVID-19 restrictions an important part of the response to the VMC was
provided through an agreement between UNICEF and WFP. Under it, UNICEF provided top-up support to buy
hygiene supplies to augment the WFP voucher given to Venezuelan families to buy food. Additionally, UNICEF and
WFP jointly strengthened the national social protection system for vulnerable national, migrant and refugee
families.135
Initially the IPs expected to provide WASH interventions were RET, Plan International and ADRA. Initially, no
specific partner was identified for cash voucher activities

The funds received for education in 2019 surpassed requirements mainly through the category “other type of
resources”. In subsequent funding periods most of the resources came from carry-over, moving from a 0 per cent
funding gap in 2019 to a more than 94 per cent gap in 2020 and 95 per cent in 2021 (until March).
The key indicators used to monitor the response in the education sector are:

From the three education indicators in the SitReps, one of them can be tracked for the full period covered by the
evaluation. Access to individual learning materials and early childhood development are included in one of the
three years within the timeframe of this evaluation.
Only the indicator on formal or non-formal education in 2020 achieved its target. Other indicators presented a
high percentage of achievement throughout the years of interest. In 2019 access to formal education seemed
more effective than non-formal education. UNICEF plugged gaps and assessed needs. This helped proper
implementation of such interventions as;
 the Education Cannot Wait (ECW)136 project implemented in six municipalities: Quito, Guayaquil,
Esmeraldas; Ibarra; Manta; and Santo Domingo.137
 technical assistance to increase the educational system’s capacity to include Venezuelan children and
adolescents
 assistance with inclusion and xenophobia prevention programmes implemented by MinEduc and
Arteducarte. Of the 94,534 child beneficiaries almost 50 per cent saw a positive change of attitudes, and
91 per cent indicated willingness to further participate in the programme.
In 2020 UNICEF effectively coordinated the development of a comprehensive approach to promote inclusive
education, through interventions such as:
136 https://www.educationcannotwait.org/our-investments/where-we-work/ecuador
137 ECW is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises.
33
 The identification and insertion of out-of-school children
 Provision of materials and methodologies
 Development of safe school environments
 Promotion of national policies to remove barriers to the right to education
 Responding to the pandemic with in-kind support and school supply kits and also via a YouTube-available
distance education programme Aprender la Tele that reached approximately 35.6 per cent of migrant
children.
As presented in the SitRep, in 2021 programme outreach to the almost 50 per cent of migrants outside of the
education system continued to be paramount. Initiatives such as the ECW are expected to reach double the
population from the previous year 2020, around 20,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries. However, given the pandemic
the response was mostly focused on the safe return to schools. Close collaboration with MinEduc enabled, inter
alia:
 high levels of adaptability by providing technological tools and connectivity (mobile phones and sim cards)
to teachers
 providing psychosocial support for teachers and 300 Departamentos de Consejería Estudiantil (DECEs) –s
Student Counselling Departments – (DECE)
 development of radio and TV content for learning outcomes.

As indicated above, ECA has received constant funding support for CP. Reported activities can be assessed through
time for at least two indicators of those considered in the SitReps. This can be seen in the table below. Twenty-
five per cent of the indicators surpassed the target and 25 per cent more were close to doing so, particularly during
2019.

In 2019, tougher immigration policies and visa requirements made migrants increasingly consider irregular routes.
Undocumented children have been hampered from being able to regularise their status, access basic social
services or have their special protection needs addressed.
Children and caregivers accessing mental health and psychosocial support showed positive results, even during
the first quarter of 2021, when almost half of the targeted population was reached.139 Families received support
in eight cities, including Tulcán and Manta.
As described in 2020 HAC, UNICEF assisted with the establishment of a national protocol for unaccompanied and
separated children. However, even though UNICEF provided recreational activities with child-friendly spaces and
psycho-emotional support to separated, unaccompanied or at-risk children in 2020, no information was gathered
for the indicator on UASC until 2021. Both the target and achieved population seem rather low compared to
138 Note that this indicator included the word “caregivers” in 2021 HAC indicator and the wording for 2019 HAC was “# of girls and boys provided with

previous years when 3,016 UASC were identified and referred to specialised protection services.140 Other reports
mention that from 2019 to 2020 more than 450 UASC accessed protection support by the authorities.141 These
activities are coordinated with MIES and other partners such as COOPI an IP charged with implementation of
around 25 per cent of the ECO CP budget.142 They provide legal support in Carchi, Manabí, Guayas, El Oro and
Sucumbíos.
In addition to the range of its IPs listed above ECA partners with UN Agencies, GoE, local institution as well as the
Ecuadorean Red Cross, the Red Eclesial Latinoamericana y Caribeña de Migración, (Red Clamor143) and the
Fundación Alas de Colibrí ,144 to name but a few.
In 2021 an interagency GBV response training was organised (UN Women, UNFPA, UNICEF, and the Human Rights
Secretary) reaching 141 officials from comprehensive protection services, care centres, and shelters for GBV
survivors in Esmeraldas and Manabi provinces. However, no children, adolescent, and women were registered to
having received GBV response services in the first quarter of 2021 even though risk mitigation interventions and
prevention are included activities.
Training sessions and safe family spaces are not prioritised in alternative routes which adolescents and UASC
unable to meet restrictive immigration requirements are forced to resort to.
Other indicators included in HPM and Action plans for 2019 are presented below to complement UNICEF response
to the VMC, it is worth mentioning that even though it was stablished having 5 family support hubs in 2019 was
appropriate there is still only one official hub in 2021, so no changes in achievements are observed, furthermore
given the COVID 19 restrictions remote support is being prioritised.

In 2019, social protection services for settlement purposes (Venezuelans with the intention to reside in Ecuador)
represented almost 60 per cent (2,135 families) of the total population reached. The SP intervention provided
unconditional cash transfer, which is given only once, to enable target families to meet rental costs and buy
domestic appliances and basic items. It proved to be more effective than interventions for families on the move,
as they reached around 70 per cent of the targeted population (3,000 targeted families). 2020 activities include
CBI and information factsheets on access to social services as well as advocacy and technical assistance to key line
ministries. Key partners for the intervention include HIAS, WFP, and UNHCR and distribution is intended to reach
Tulcán, Lago Agrio, Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca. In 2021, there was a change in the CBI strategy with a stronger
emphasis on education and protection. The initiative moved from once-off payment to offering nine-month
support to households on top of a once-off support for each child in the household attending school. Ian 2020,
CBI improved migrants ‘living conditions, access to free health services and fostered school enrolment.146 The
programme follows a gender inclusive and equality approach where 85 per cent of the CBI is delivered to mostly
women heads of households (the selection criteria prioritise single mothers, as well as pregnant, lactating mothers
and UASC). This has resulted in empowering women to develop income generating activities, a better place to live
or enhanced household protection. Results are not disaggregated to see the families that received the
intervention only once. Up until March 2021 less than 19 per cent of the targeted families had been reached with
CBI. The results presented are not sector specific either and therefore no clear effectiveness conclusions are
drawn.
There’s a conflictive figure in terms of CBI received: the HAC 2021 mentions that 25,000 families were reached in
Ecuador for conditional WASH cash-based interventions, when the total number of families from 2019 to 2020
reached 10,353. The UNICEF Human Mobility Response 2018-2020 report stresses that the implementation of
both education-related interventions and WASH support was key in terms of social inclusion achievements.
However, the disaggregated data mentions that 2,094 families received transit CBI and 3,091 families received
settlement CBI. Again these numbers don’t match the previous ones in terms of achievements.
In 2020 an evaluation of the unconditional CBI took place in Ecuador.147 The key results in terms of effectiveness

can be divided by type of beneficiaries:
a. For in-transit beneficiaries these interventions were a stress reliever, meaning that parents were able to
ensure transportation, temporary housing and other basic needs while adjusting migration/destination
plans.
b. For the beneficiaries in the settling group the intervention allowed for a better housing option, meeting
of basic needs and indirect betterment of access to health and education services.

Communication for Development (C4D)
Sector results formulated as in HAC 2019
Children and their families are consulted for the elaboration & monitoring of the project and
have access to life saving information and protective practices on access and use of services.
Adolescent migrants are engaged as peer educators. In order to reduce discrimination and
xenophobia, the host community is made aware of the rights and needs of the migrant
population
This sector went from having 91 per cent of funds covered in 2019 (from carry-over), to having just ten per cent
requirements (that had quadrupled) covered in 2020, to no funds at all in 2021 (up to March). In terms of
monitoring indicators three out of four indicators can be assessed overt least two years of implementation, as can
be seen in the table below.

Results gathered throughout the years are positive as most targets have been met or have nearly been. In a couple
of cases targets are relatively low compared to results. This can indicate that targets were underestimated or
results too general, so that beneficiaries are double counted. Such is the case of the indicator “No. of people
reached with messages on life-saving skills and protective practices or information on uptake of services”, where
results in 2020 are eight times higher than estimated target population. In 2019, UNICEF disseminated key
messages on protective practices to prevent the migrant population from falling into trafficking networks, and
also conducted xenophobia prevention interventions in host communities at schools. However, results are not
explained in detail in the SitReps, even though funds for this activity represented more than 82 per cent of the
total sector requirement for the 2019 appeal. This is not adequate from an accountability perspective.150
According to the VMC HPM 2019 data, the achievement for this indicator “# of people in host communities
participating in community activities on prevention of xenophobia, promotion of inter-cultural dialogue or
inclusion in crisis affected areas” doubled the targeted population. The 2020 Seamos Amigos campaign to
promote empathy and non-violence151was aimed at children and their families who are already included in the
formal education system. Other campaigns supported education activity or GBV prevention. The main partners in
2020 included Vicariato Apostólico de Esmeraldas (VAE), Plan Internacional, RETs, Grupo DADA (social media
provider) and MC Comunicaciones (PR provider) in addition to private Special Service Agreements (SSAs).
In terms of AAP, focus groups were held at border points from 2019. Nine hundred and thirty-six people were
asked to participate in the evaluation of activities and to give recommendations to strengthen and adjust UNICEF’s
programmes. In 2021 direct sectoral feedback mechanisms are included and in 2020 the U-Report on The Move
gave adolescent and young refugees and migrants information about their rights and available services, as well as
scope to influence decision-making. Through private messages via Facebook, and WhatsApp, and via YouTube
videos, this virtual system, in addition to offering information, generates surveys to learn about the issues of
concern to this population.
In 2021, the UNICEF C4D strategy fostered social engagement through community leaders and through the
creation of culturally appropriate communication materials. UNICEF Ecuador also supported the MoH in the
planning stages of a national plan to promote COVID-19 vaccination.
150 The Migration Action plan for 2019 (see Action_Plan_Migration_Outcome_Ecuador_2019_ENERO_2019) points out these interventions that should be

EQ8: To what extent did UNICEF’s situation monitoring, monitoring of the quality of the service, real-time
monitoring, accountability mechanisms at the migrant/host community/ and government service levels,
lead to improved effectiveness of the response at CO/RO levels
 ECO was able, throughout the response, to collect information from the field and improve its
programming
 Two main external factors have challenged monitoring activities for ECO: border closure, increase of
entries through irregular border points COVID-19
 UNICEF presence and leadership in some sectors in the GTRM, at both national and sub-national level,
allows the organisation to position itself strongly in order to collect data.
 Information and data management is mainstreamed in all PCA and reporting targets are clearly stated
with all IPs.
 UNICEF participated in three joint needs assessments and a national household survey which allowed ECO
to adapt their strategies.
ECO was able to collect data from the field using different mechanisms. UNICEF had been introducing the KOBO
toolbox since the 2016 earthquake and continued using it for the migration response for monitoring and a deeper
qualitative capture of the information. The tool is comprehensive and can be used online and offline. However, it
is no longer in use since the implementation of GoE restrictions on entries in August 2019. In addition to KOBO,
UNICEF implemented nutrition screenings, situation monitoring at Rumichaca and Lago Agrio and telephone
surveys. UNICEF also leveraged its partnerships with HIAS and COOPI to collect data in the EAIs (Tulcán and Manta),
during household visits for the CBI (Tulcán) and on the route between Tulcán and Ibarra. This has allowed UNICEF
to adapt its strategies, namely in communicating around GBV prevention, including a strong focus on xenophobia
across sectors, and strengthening its psychosocial support.
As one KI stated, ECO has been a champion office in terms of preparedness and contingency planning. Documents
show staff was able to assess the situation both at local and national level to address the changing needs of
migrants and host communities. Data is collected to assess the needs, establish risk scenarios, elaborate a response
strategy with coordination mechanisms and a budget allocated. ECO was able to assess the local and national
needs through these plans and to develop different scenarios in order to respond more efficiently.
UNICEF has also been successful in implementing the U-Report on the Move platform, aimed at making the voices
of adolescents and young refugees and migrants heard. Although an interesting initiative, that also promotes
cross-national coordination, it seems the coverage is limited. In the last quarter of 2020 1,921 adolescent and
young refugees and migrants had registered.152 This could also be explained by COVID-19, which caused both
organisations and individuals to shift their priorities.
Social media has been key for developing these connections, support networks, and sharing essential
information from how to access regularisation, employment, and health services, to the cultural nuances
of specific destinations. María Corina from Venezuela153
Due to COVID-19 lockdown, UNICEF and IPs were unable to directly reach families on the move and host

aged children and their families.154 Additionally, UNICEF, through its IPs, collects data through education and WASH
activities.
Finally, inter-agency coordination for joint information gathering and data collection has been done through two
main components: joint needs assessments and the World Bank national household survey on living conditions of
Venezuelan migrant families and host communities. The result of this survey was documented in 2020 in the Retos
y Oportunidades de la Migración Venezolana155). This World Bank document enabled UNICEF to raise awareness
on the plight of migrant, refugee and host community children and adolescents. The report charts:
 the evolution of migration over the years in Ecuador
 the scale of migration and its socioeconomic, health, education, social protection and gender impacts
 the integration and discrimination aspects of migration.
The report gives an overview of these aspects while also providing policy recommendations. Of particular interest
to this case study is the table with recommendations organised by pillars and sectors, showing the prioritisation
and timeline for each recommendation.

EQ9: To what extent have internal (within UNICEF, between countries and sectors) and external
coordination mechanisms been effective in enhancing the quality of the overall response and advocacy on
behalf of VNZ migrant children and their families?
 Having two parallel coordination mechanisms going at the same time – the GIFMM for the migration
response and the OCHA Cluster system for COVID-19 has been very challenging for all agencies to sustain.
 Several examples of good external coordination mechanisms to collect data and manage information
sharing.
KIs from various organisations indicated that the GTRM coordination mechanism was an additional burden for
most agencies already familiar and comfortable with the OCHA-led humanitarian cluster system. While UNICEF
and other agencies were starting to get used to the GTRM coordination mechanism, COVID hit. This led to the
cluster system being activated, and therefore a duplication of coordination. After several months, a “back-to-
back” strategy157 emerged, in which meetings of the GTRM were followed by Cluster sectors’ meetings. Focal
points for transversal working groups were designated to ensure more efficient, relevant and less energy-
consuming coordination mechanisms. Despite the practicality of this solution, many KIs see this as doubling of the
time and effort to coordinate internally and externally. This separation has also led to some frustration whereby
migration matters cannot be discussed in the cluster meetings. As one KI stated, this does not allow for a fluid,
coherent and long-term approach to durable solutions.
At regional level, the coordination is channelled through the R4V platform led by UNHCR/IOM. ECO is co-leading
the WEN, health and nutrition, education and CP sectors of the Regional Platform. At national level, coordination
was challenging, as UN agencies had regular programming coordination mechanisms through the cluster
structures. UNICEF FO in Tulcán is also an active member of several sectors of the local GTRM and the EAI hosts
all of its meetings. UNICEF is seen as a strong actor of the response, which has given them the clout to advocate
on behalf of Venezuelan migrant children and their families at both local and national level.
As stated above, there have been a number of successes in terms of the coordination of UNICEF and other
agencies, such as UNHCR, IO and the World Bank. There have been three joint needs assessments done through
the GTRM, a World Bank household survey financially supported by UNICEF, among other UN Agencies (UNHCR,
IOM, UNFPA, UNDP, WFP), joint communication campaigns, joint information collection and information sharing
for the protection sector, and, notably, a joint CBI bringing together UNICEF, UNHCR and WFP.
A final element on external coordination is that significant responsibilities and added tasks for coordination are
currently given to relatively junior staff, among them United Nations Volunteers (UNVs). As stated by a KI, UNV
do not have the authority to sign off on strategic decisions, having to refer decision-making to Quito, therefore
delaying processes at local level. UNVs are in a strategic position. While their professionalism was praised by many
in and outside UNICEF, their ability to respond to the changing needs is limited. This is something that UNICEF
needs to take into account as it considers how to strengthen its external coordination role within the existing and
dual humanitarian GTRM and OCHA platforms.
EQ10: To what extent did the activation of the UNICEF Level 2 emergency procedure in 2019 in Ecuador, and
later L3 designation of COVID-19 emergency, allow for more effective scale-up of UNICEF’s support (from all
levels) and response to address the critical needs and provide increased protection and services to
Venezuelan migrant children and their families? To what extent did the L2 designation
facilitate/change/simplify procedures at CO/RO/HQ levels?
 The L2 facilitated some aspects of the response but did not allow to significantly increase funding.
The L2 declaration allowed ECO to swiftly respond, particularly in the north in Tulcán and Lago Agrio. It facilitated
ECO in three main aspects: i) staff hiring and reduced time to contract personnel, ii) swift approval on PCAs with
IPs, and iii) procurement (health, WASH and education materials). ECO declined surge capacity. Several KIs stated
UNICEF did not want to have two parallel teams, as was the case during the 2016 earthquake response. However,
LACRO and ECO deployed consultants and short-term experts to accompany in-sector and migration expertise,

resource mobilisation and monitoring of the VMC (third-party monitoring to monitor the CBI strategy and joint
collaborations). As previously stated, the L2 did not ensure an increase in funding, neither regionally nor nationally
(see EQ 6 and 7 for funding gaps).
The field teams were built through short -term contractual arrangements (short term consultants or Temporary
Appointments) for most FO and communications staff. Evidence shows these arrangements are becoming a
constraint to ensure continuity of the presence (Tulcán, Huaquillas FO closure) or adequate institutional leverage
with government entities and the GTRM platform. This has been a HQ and LACRO directive which has directly
impacted ECO.
Regarding the L3 activation, UNICEF was able to scale up its interventions to respond to the health crisis. As seen
previously, UNICEF adapted its interventions to incorporate virtual assistance, support government officials and
CSOs with distance training, do household visits through IPs, and support virtual learning. Many IPs noted that
UNICEF was flexible in all administrative requirements to fast-track disbursement and technical support when
needed.
In 2020/2021, BPRM provided $US$1.8 million to integrate the COVID-19 response with the Venezuelan migration
crisis, as well as an additional $US$120,370 for WASH. This was used to deliver CBI to Venezuelan families to
provide them with essential WASH supplies.158 Additionally, ECO focused its interventions to maintain educational
continuity through support to education radio programmes to reach migrant children and adolescents, and host
communities. Finally, during COVID UNICEF was able to deliver cash transfers for migrant and refugee families to
cover basic needs and installation.
7.3 Coverage
The evaluation of the coverage of UNICEF’s response is guided by the following overarching question: To
what extent were the most vulnerable Venezuelan refugee/migrant girls and boys and their families
reached with needed protection, assistance and empowerment? This section will address the different
specific EQs under this overarching question.
EQ11: What were the internal and external factors that enabled or constrained UNICEF’s ability to provide
the most vulnerable Venezuelan migrants and refugee children, their families and host communities with
protection and assistance according to their needs?
 UNICEF’s previous experience working with line ministries facilitated dialogue and enhanced their
possibility to influence high-level decisions, notably in supporting the development and implementation
of the Procedure for Children and Adolescents and their Families in Contexts of Human Mobility
 Dedicated staff who were able to quickly adapt and respond to the needs of the most vulnerable through
psychosocial support, en route assistance and alternative care solutions.
 Short term contractual arrangements, both for internal staff and PCA, were a constraint to ensure
continuity of UNICEF’s presence.
 Challenging political context which also led to heightened xenophobia.
As stated in the Colombia case study, “coverage is primarily affected by the ability to identify those in need, their
location, profile and vulnerabilities, and the capacity of the agency to address these with practical measures that
correspond with their rights and protection needs. Overall, it implies that the response, and its programmes, are
designed to correspond with the scale of needs identified. This represents a major gap in the response. While
UNICEF can list many different vulnerabilities, there are limited specific strategies in place to ensure the most
vulnerable are reached with needed protection, assistance, and empowerment.” For the Ecuador case study, the
main vulnerabilities identified are those faced by UASC, pregnant and lactating women, and victims of GBV.
Internally there are several factors that have enabled and constrained UNICEF’s ability to provide protection and
assistance to the most vulnerable. Due to its regular programme and earthquake response in 2016, UNICEF has
managed to build strong relationship with several line ministries such as (MinEduc, MoH, MIES and MoG. This has
allowed for quicker response and implementation of several activities and openness to dialogue from government
officials in the VMC response. However, due to the humanitarian visa, there is a significant gap in information and

data management. Irregular entries and the difficult context to collect real time data constrain UNICEF to provide
to the most vulnerable.
ECO felt particularly strained given the VMC response closely followed the 2016 earthquake response. Several KIs
at both national and regional levels stated ECO was early to sound the alarm and request the VMC be incorporated
in early regional strategic documents, yet LACRO was slow to react.
The great bulk of IP and government informants stated that UNICEF staff has enabled UNICEF and its partners to
provide protection and assistance to the most vulnerable migrants and refuges. However, due to staff capacity
(only two NUNV in Tulcán, one of whom is the driver), reach and presence is limited in this space. Informants
stated that UNICEF’s advocacy work with GADs and presence in the EAI is highly appreciated and relevant. All KIIs,
including those from affected populations noted UNICEF staff’s dedication to this space and their focus on
attending to the needs of those in most need. The team would also like to acknowledge the NUNV’s dedication to
furthering UNICEF’s presence in the humanitarian corridor between Tulcán and Ibarra and focusing on pressing
needs (particularly education and unattended adolescents). Although regular entries have decreased since the
August 2019 decree (see context section), overall entries have continued and there has also been an increase in
pendular movements. However, overwhelmingly UNICEF staff have stated there is high level of fatigue among the
team.
Limited funding and short-term agreements have been another factor. As mentioned, the response in Ecuador is
under-funded. ECO has managed to reallocate funds from regular programming to respond to pressing needs. ECO
also implements, with its partners such as Nación de Paz, Lunita Lunera, Danielle’s Children Fund, RET and LAB XXI,
innovative methodologies in education, protection, social inclusion. KI mentioned that although it is very
encouraging that ECO is open to implementing new practices, these take more time to be approved and
implemented.
Externally there are several factors that have enabled and constrained UNICEF’s ability to provide protection and
assistance to the most vulnerable:
Political context: Ecuador has been seen as an example in terms of inclusion and access to services due to its 2017
Organic Law on Human Mobility. It makes central and local governments jointly responsible for the inclusion and
integration of people finding themselves in situations of human mobility, requiring them to mainstream the human
mobility approach in the planning of public policies, plans, programmes, projects and services... The regulatory
framework establishes a strong link between migration and development. Migration is mainstreamed in the
National Development Plan 2017-. Notwithstanding this apparently conducive climate, the implementation of the
humanitarian visa greatly affected assistance and protection to vulnerable migrants and refugees. Changes of
power, at both national and sub-national levels during the years of the VMC have slowed down several processes
as well as impacting the ability of UNICEF and other response agencies to collect data on migrants entering the
country. As stated in the January to April 2021 SitRep, “people on the move including unaccompanied and
separated children, continue migrating through irregular border crossings facing risks such as human trafficking,
violence including GBV, child recruitment, among others”.159
Linked to the point above, UNICEF, among other UN agencies, was crucial in assisting the Ecuadorian government
to develop and implement its Procedure for Children and Adolescents and their Families in Contexts of Human
Mobility in July 2019. This legal document was a turning point to ensure the protection of UASC, following a
sentence issued by the Ecuadorian constitutional court. This sentencing followed a protection action filed by three
brothers who had been refused entry to the country in the CEBAF in San Miguel de Sucumbíos. UNICEF has
continued to support with technical expertise the government to ensure the protocol is implemented and
updated.160
Following a femicide of an Ecuadorian woman by a Venezuelan man in January 2019,161 acts of discrimination and
xenophobia against Venezuelan nationals were on the rise. The international community and GoE had to shift
campaigns, messaging and activities to have a greater focus on integration and work with host communities.
Initially this was a constraint to implementation activities, but following feedback from host communities and
vulnerable populations, UNICEF was able to adapt operations.

44
COVID-19impacted the response that had already been late in being implemented. Notably difficult was
monitoring the flow of people entering and leaving Ecuador as UNICEF and IP staff were also in lockdown, absent
from the field. In 2020, several activities had to be halted or adapted. Several activities, such as capacity-building,
discrimination campaigns, psycho-social support, shifted to online platforms. However, internet coverage gaps in
Ecuador are high. According to UNICEF’s call for action,162 internet coverage is a mere 11 per cent in poor
households versus 43 per cent in non-poor households.
EQ12: What factors have affected donors’ perceptions and willingness to fund UNICEF’s programmes and
appeals in line with assessed needs/targets?
 The evaluator was not able to speak to donors, therefore the response is limited.
 Funding remains a challenge, as the VMC is severely underfunded.
The evaluator has not gathered enough information to respond to the question of donor perceptions fully and
objectively. However, overall, it seems the R4V platform is not serving its purpose of joint advocacy. Several KI
sand the funding analysis (see Effectiveness section) show that VMC is severely underfunded everywhere. Some
donors, such as Canada, have extended funding for two more years, showing a willingness to support and invest
in the response of ECO.
Generally, funding remains a challenge to implement and maintain activities overtime. For example, this has been
stated by several KIs as a challenge for wider and extended coverage of the CBI programme. Additionally, given
that the initial cohort of Venezuelans was mainly in transit in Ecuador, this may affect donor willingness to invest
in the country.
7.4 Coherence and coordination
The evaluation of the coherence and coordination of UNICEF’s response is guided by the following
overarching question: What are the main factors that have led to internal and external coherence and
coordination of UNICEF’s response or lack thereof? This section will address the different specific EQs
under this overarching question.
EQ13: What factors led to or detracted from UNICEF’s ability to balance its response to local needs and
national priorities?
 A changing national context and high impact of COVID-19 made it difficult to align with national priorities.
 FOs in different areas led to UNICEF’s capacity to respond to local needs coherently
 However, due data collection gaps UNICEF is unable to fully respond to the local needs, as UN agencies do
not have a clear picture of the situation at field level.
UNICEF has struggled to shift gears from regular programming to emergency response ECO was not prepared for.
In addition, the pandemic severely hit Ecuador and UNICEF’s response to the Venezuelan migration outflow.
Responding to local needs has also been complicated by the changing national context. One of the key lessons
learned from UNICEF’s response to the 2016 earthquake was to invest in personnel with knowledge of emergency
response. Document review and KIs show that staff did not have emergency or migration training.
As in Colombia, a key factor behind UNICEF’s ability to balance its response to local needs and national priorities
has been the process of establishment of FOs in areas most affected by the VMC. This has allowed ECA to have
direct engagement with local civil society and GADs and to be more aware of the gaps and bottlenecks that impede
local realisation of national level policies, which, as noted, are generally favourable to the rights and inclusion of
Venezuelan migrant children and their families.
Data collection challenges, particularly the increase in the frequency of irregular border crossings have further
impeded comprehensive responses to local needs. UNICEF FO in Tulcán for example has stated that the EAI is a
first step to balance its response to local needs. However, since irregular entries are rising, UNICEF has had to shift
its response. In coordination with COOPI, they are responding to the needs of migrants in transit from Tulcán to
Ibarra.

call-to-action-indigenous-communities-and-right-education-in-times-of-covid19
45
EQ14: What is UNICEF’s added value in the Venezuela Outflow response?
 Close collaboration with government officials, allowing advocacy for migrant children and their families at
national and local level.
 Partnerships with local organisations that have facilitated the search or innovative solutions.
Overwhelmingly KIs reported that UNICEF’s added value is its capacity to closely work with government officials at
both national and regional levels. Work with the GAD in Tulcán, and more recently in Manta, shows the advocacy
work done by UNICEF leads to concrete results. In Tulcán, the municipality, concerned by influx into the city,
requested the international community should deliver aid outside of the city and relocate to the Panamericana
international highway.163 UNICEF was able to advocate for the opening of the EAI, with the GAD’s support. FOs,
particularly in Tulcán, have few resources, limiting advocacy and activities in other sectors such as education. The
ability to work closely with governments allows UNICEF to potentially sustain activities and strengthen national
capacities. This should be monitored for example in the case of the EAI in Tulcán where the GAD is set to take over
the EAI.
ECO has partnered with national, sub-national and local organisations to implement alternative care structures for
unaccompanied children and adolescents. Partnerships with LAB XXI in Tulcán and with DCF in Quito may be small
scale but show s ECO thinks outside the box and is trying to bring in local capacity and innovative solutions to
respond to a long-term crisis.
EQ15: To what extent were meaningful partnerships and/or coordination mechanisms established with
other key actors (e.g., government at national and local levels, civil society, NGOs, academia, private sector,
other UN agencies etc.), to assist, include and empower the most vulnerable Venezuelan children and their
families?
 Meaningful partnership with government institutions notably led to develop the Procedure for Assisting
Unaccompanied or Separated Children and Adolescents and their Families in Human Mobility
 ECO has been a champion at partnering with UN agencies such as UNHCR and WFP on CBI.
 ECO has been able to leverage partnerships to build joint communications campaigns to combat
xenophobia and discrimination,
UNICEF works closely with line ministries and GADS. ECA promoted, together with UNHCR and IOM, the
development and implementation of the Procedure for Assisting Unaccompanied or Separated Children and
Adolescents and their Families in Human Mobility. It was signed by the Ministry of the Interior (now the Ministry
of Government), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility, and the Ministry of Economic and Social
Inclusion, on 5 November 2018. The Procedure was streamlined at sub-national level and capacity-building was
delivered to administer procedures. UNICEF, in addition, joined legal action which protected three Venezuelan
children and adolescents, denied entry to Ecuador.164
UNICEF, through its IP ADRA, collaborates closely with the Ministry of Public Health to monitor the nutritional
status of children from six to 59 months and deliver nutritional supplements. UNICEF has also worked closely with
MinEduc on activities for educational inclusion, prevention of xenophobia and violence in schools through the
Seamos Amigos campaign to promote empathy and non-violence165 as well as, through a play-focused
methodology used by Nación de Paz called Pazita se va de Ruta. These activities have sought to include and work
with migrant populations and host communities to enhance social cohesion and prevent discrimination and
xenophobia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECO supported teachers and caregivers with distance learning
methodologies and socio-emotional assistance. Additionally, as already noted, tablets and sim cards allowed
families and students to seek academic and emotional support.
UNICEF has been able to leverage local organisations in different regions. In Tulcán, UNICEF leveraged its strong
relationship with the IP HIAS to collect information from households. Several IPs have incorporated prevention of
violence, GBV, PSEA and gender components in their field presence. Manta’s EAI focuses on integration and

46
inclusion activities which empower host communities and vulnerable Venezuelan children and their families. When
the evaluator visited, UNICEF had organized several vocational trainings, amongst them was a workshop for
adolescent girls with an aesthetician. Workshops are oriented towards capacity-building and training on
professional capacities. The EAI in Tulcán managed to unite several key organisations, CSO and NGOs to respond
to the pressing needs of migrants, refugees and host communities.
An example of empowering activities is the Recicentro intiative, a recycling programme launched in January 2022
in the North with the Tulcán municipality, UNHCR, IOM and Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. KIs involved in
the initiative all mentioned the pride felt when informal recyclers were provided with uniforms, thus giving
legitimacy to their livelihoods. 166
A further good practice is that Ecuador has been one of seven pilot countries in the UN`s Common Cash Statement
(UNCCS) initiative. Launched in 2018 by UNICEF, OCHA, UNHCR and WFP, it has fostered collaboration on cash and
voucher assistance.167 In Ecuador this has allowed for meaningful and coherent coordination on CBI, a long-term
solution to needs, particularly on housing, education and food.
Q16: How coherent were coordination mechanisms at the CO and Regional level?
 Coordination was not seen as coherent due to a duplication of coordination mechanisms between the
GTRM and cluster system (OCHA-led coordination)
 There is good coordination with IPs, especially at local level, where UNICEF has worked with local
institutions to bolster innovative solutions.
At regional level, coordination is channelled through the R4V platform led by UNHCR and IOM. ECO is co-leading
the El Grupo de Trabajo de WAN (WASH, Alojamiento, NFI1 y Transporte Humanitario) – GT WANWEN168 and the
Health & Nutrition, Education and Child Protection sectors of the Regional Platform. LACRO has facilitated technical
support C4D, WASH, gender, education and M&E. Coordination between LACRO and ECO was also fruitful in terms
of proposal preparations. UNICEF FO in Tulcán is also an active member of several sectors of the local GTRM and
the EAI hosts all of its meetings. At national level as noted above, coordination has been challenging as UN agencies
had at times overlapping cluster coordination mechanisms. Having back-to-back cluster and R4V meetings has
shown coordination challenges can be overcome. UN agencies and IPs have been working together to present
information jointly, as done by the CP sub-group.169 ECO and LACRO coordination will be further developed in the
synthesis report.
Informants have raised concerns about the limited staff capacity and advocacy at higher level. Informants
mentioned that UNICEF’s absence in Huaquillas has been challenging to ensure mid- and long-term activities. KIs
clearly stated that UNICEF’s close collaboration and coordination with government institutions is a major added
value, allowing UNICEF to push for the recognition of children’s and adolescents’ rights (see EQ 15 for more
details).
Coordination mechanisms between UNICEF and IP are coherent with the context, capacities and needs of migrants
and refugees. These have allowed for flexible implementation of activities and funding. IP informants have all seen
UNICEF’s technical, human and operational capacities as an added value to an effective and fluid coordination
process.
Several KIs stated that coordination with UN agencies has sometimes proven to be a challenge. Competing
mandates and funding, different strategic focuses, tension between personalities and differentiated geographic
presence have been stated as being the source of some tension. However, UNICEF has managed to continue to
advocate at national and sub-national level for the rights of children.
The great majority of KIs at national and local levels stated that even though LACRO was present in several
instances, the lack of a formal regional strategy impacted cross-national communication. Documents and
interviews show that some sectors were able to exchange best practices, such as WASH and C4D, but others were
not able to build a structured exchange. The evaluator found several cases of good practices that could and should

be discussed at regional level, such as CBI experience with EAIs. Staff in different sectors stated that is very difficult,
almost impossible, to have a route-based approach if there is no regional dialogue. As noted, exchange between
ECO and the Venezuela CO has been limited. In terms of information management, provisional programming and
setting up interventions, ECO staff indicated stated that not having specific information on vulnerabilities from the
moment migrants leave Venezuela has had a negative impact on ECO adaptation to changing needs.
7.5 Efficiency
To what extent has UNICEF delivered results with efficiency and timeliness? The evaluation of the efficiency of
UNICEF’s response is guided by the following overarching question: To what extent has UNICEF delivered results
with efficiency and timeliness? This section will address the different specific EQs under this overarching question.
EQ17: Were UNICEF strategies and programmatic interventions designed taking into account the activities,
capacities and efficiencies of other UN agencies, local governments, central governments, civil society
organisations, NGOs, private sector?
EQ18: When did coordination with national Governments, UN agencies and other major respondents avoid
overlaps and bridge gaps? If any, what are the reasons for the gaps and what is needed to close them?
 UNICEF was able to leverage its presence in Ecuador, and previous relationships with government
institutions and IPs, to avoid overlap. UNICEF is seen as being flexible in funding and programme
extensions, making IP work with migrant children and their families more efficient.
 At national level, UNICEF has worked on capacity building and technical support to ministries to respond
to major gaps, taking into account the capacities and efficiencies of local and central governments.
 UNICEF worked in collaboration with organisations to bridge the information gap, mainly at border
crossings. However, information management and monitoring of population remains a major gap mainly
due to irregular cross-border movements.
As mentioned above, UNICEF established agreements and coordination with local governments and civil society
organisations, involving them in the working groups early on. UNICEF also engaged CSOs and NGOs as IPs, such as
ADRA, LAB XXI, World Vision, FULULU, DyA, Fundación Idea Dignidad and Nación de Paz.
However, the team found no evidence of any NGO/local partner mapping which would have ensured broader
coverage and avoided duplication.170 Several KIs mentioned some difficulties working with one IP whose PCA was
not renewed. Other KIs note that UNICEF has done a good job at mobilising local actors. In Tulcán, UNICEF
successfully developed PCA with HIAS and LAB XXI with whom they are implementing household visits, adolescent
participatory mechanisms, and other activities. In Quito, UNICEF partnered with DCF to implement alternative care
mechanisms. DCF has been operational in Ecuador for several years and is familiar with the political and
administrative context.
All IP informants mentioned UNICEF’s openness to share materials, build local capacity and share knowledge and
best practices. However, the team noted these remain informal and sector-specific exercises. Several informants
reported that UNICEF and IPs would benefit from increasing and upstreaming feedback from local actors and
migrant and host communities. A majority of IP informants also mentioned UNICEF’s flexibility regarding funding
structures and programme extensions. However, as noted previously, lack of a strong regional and global advocacy
impacted funding.171 Several KIs stated the R4V platform was not seen as a strong advocacy platform.
UNICEF has managed to build strong relationship with several line ministries (particularly MinEduc, MoH, MIES
and MoG). The most notable result of this has been to enable UNICEF to advocate for children, adolescents and
their families though the Procedure for Assisting Unaccompanied or Separated Children and Adolescents and their
Families in Human Mobility, launched in November 2018. This joint effort between ECA, Ecuador, UNHCR and IOM
ensured the development and adoption of a comprehensive protection. UNICEF focused on designing and
implementing a plan to strengthen interviewing teams and other government and private entities carrying out the
special procedure. This aimed to build capacity and ownership at national and local level, while avoiding both
overlap and re-victimisation of interviewees. This was aligned with Ecuador’s priorities in September 2018, which
170 This was also stated by two KIs as a pressing need.
171 Advocacy for the Venezuelan crisis is an issue that came up in several interviews, at regional, national and sub-national level. This is not only an issue
pertaining to UNICEF but more globally to the humanitarian system, where the Venezuelan crisis is not at the forefront of regional and global discussions.
48
focused on establishing alternative procedures to care for children and adolescents who do not have the required
documentation, without violating their rights to human mobility. However, when the government established the
humanitarian visa, which did not include exceptions for children and adolescents, this halted progress on the
procedure. UNICEF has continued advocacy efforts to ensure regularisation is maintained for migrants who have
entered the country prior to 2019 and who fulfill the requirements.172
Figure 8. Added value of the Protection Protocol
UNICEF has also been a strong advocate for the right to access services173 such as health and education. At the
local level, UNICEF Ecuador expanded a programme of cooperation with the Nación de Paz Foundation to reach
students and teachers with messages for prevention of xenophobia and violence, through the play focused Pazita
se va de Ruta methodology.
UNICEF has included capacity-building and training exercises in Minimum Standards for Child Protection in
Humanitarian Action.174 In addition, through COOPI, UNICEF is working with the boards at the cantonal level to
refer cases and services for unaccompanied adolescents who are at risk.
A major gap is information management and monitoring of population. Although there is information from the
GTRM or UNICEF, there is a need for better and more detailed information from official sources. Since 2019 this
has been extremely difficult as the vast majority of migrants have entered Ecuador without authorisation. To
manage this gap, UNICEF collaborates with IOM for its DTM, participates in Joint Needs Assessments through the
R4V platform, and in the northern border, through COOPI UNICEF has started implementing activities along the
humanitarian route to collect data while delivering assistance. Another good practice in Ecuador, that should be
replicated, has been the study led by the World Bank and financed by UNICEF, among other UN Agencies (UNHCR,
IOM, UNFPA, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and WFP), on the challenges and opportunities of
Venezuelan migration ton Ecuador.175 This report defined the evolution of migration in Ecuador, r needs and
profiles, and set recommendations to bridge gaps identified.
At local level, work has been carried out in coordination and collaboration with the GAD. The team visited the EAI
in both Manta and Tulcán, cities with different migration profiles in which UNICEF has been able to adapt its
programming.176 UNICEF has signed cooperation agreements with the GADs, detailing the responsibility of local
governments to provide continuity to the proposed projects.
7.6 Connectedness
The evaluation of the connectedness of UNICEF’s response is guided by the following overarching question: To
what extent is UNICEF Colombia’s response to the Venezuelan Outflow linked to other key institutional planning
and policy processes? The two EQs are answered together because they are related.
172 The initial process was further strengthened to support government officials with technical assistance to respond to the needs of migrants, particularly
during COVID-19.
174 https://reliefweb.int/report/world/minimum-standards-child-protection-humanitarian-action-2019-edition-enar
175 Retos y Oportunidades de la migración venezolana en Ecuador, Grupo Mundial, 2020
176 In Tulcán activities are more geared towards direct assistance, with health, legal, psycho-social support, as well as some activities focusing on inclusion.
Manta, due to the profile of populations, is more focused on capacity-building, legal assistance, access to services.
49
Q19: How is the new country programme of UNICEF Ecuador adjusted to the new context and needs of the
Venezuela migrant and refugee populations effectively being addressed by linking the emergency response
to longer-term development goals in each country? What are the difficulties, including opportunity costs, if
any, encountered internally and externally (i.e., UNICEF internal structure and processes, donor
requirements)?
Q20: To what extent has UNICEF adopted a whole-of-migration cycle approach which provides longer-term
solutions for migrants, refugees and returnees including preparedness for new influxes, support to access
social services in host countries as well as when returning and reintegrating in their home countries (the
nexus)?
UNICEF Ecuador is currently drafting the new CPD, an opportunity to mainstream migration and advocate
strongly for migrant children and their families, as well as host communities. UNICEF has been a strong
advocate of including local organisations to empower and build capacity to ensure sustainability.
As stated in the Final Project Report for Canada,
having humanitarian assistance combined with sustained integration processes is critical for vulnerable
adolescents to develop life plans with a clear notion of what prevention of gender-based violence implies
and to become multiplier agents in their communities. The training of more than 1,000 civil servants, the
dissemination of preventive information, and the development of coordination and accompaniment
mechanisms for girls and boys on the move have greatly enhanced the project's results to guarantee the
human rights of children on the move.
Migration was mentioned in the current CPD and “migration dynamics”177 was stated as one of the reasons for
regional prioritisations.178 To new CPD presents an opportunity to mainstream migration through its objectives
and strategies. Several KI stated that migration should and will be an integral component in the new CPD.
The response to the Venezuela’s migrant outflow has demonstrated the need for ECO capacity to deal with
emergencies, and the need for experienced staff and management capacity, as well as strong advocacy from local
and national levels. As noted, ECO has implemented several activities linking the emergency response to longer-
term development goals – including UNCCS promotion, EAIs in Manta and Tulcán and capacity-building in various
ministries. UNICEF is also working closely with GADs to build ownership and local capacity. UNICEF has been a
strong advocate of including local organisations to sustainably empower and build their capacity. The short-term
nature of the response and the funding associated is likely to affect sustainability of the actions carried out. A
phase-out or hand over strategy with longer support will be necessary.
UNICEF established programmatic interventions in the framework of the R4V platform and GoE strategies. The
response has always been, and largely continues to be, treated as an emergency situation by all involved, including
the GoE and the R4V platform. This has affected any medium to long term strategic approach by UNICEF and all
agencies and affected the mobilisation of resources as a short-term requirement.
In reference to EQ20, the ET Found little to no information regarding returnees. In general, ECO was able to
provide longer-term solutions for migrants, particularly looking at settlement and transition. ECO’s FOs have
adapted interventions to the type of migration present. For example, Tulcán focused its interventions mainly on
preparing for new influxes, transit populations. However, with the migrant population transitioning to settlement,
the FO has adapted its interventions in the EAI to an integration logic with psychosocial support, working with
host communities and building capacity. In Manta on the other hand, UNICEF ECO and FO was able to adapt the
EAI structure to focus almost exclusively on integration. This is to be replicated in Esmeraldas where an EAI is due
to open by the end of 2022.
The evaluator noted an action described in the Final Project Report for Canada. MIES has developed a protocol179
that contemplates identification actions and specialised interviews with street teams in transit areas or areas
where adolescent girls and LGBTIQ+ adolescents live. Implementing work on the street is a novel strategy that is
177 Country Programme Document, UNICEF, 2018
178 The CPD mentions “a fluctuating population of migrants, refugees and displaced people on the northern border” without mentioning specifically
Venezuelan population as a key concern.
179 The protocol refers to the protocols and guidelines for the identification and protection of unaccompanied or separated adolescent girls and LGBTIQ+
adolescents on the move.
50
currently being reviewed and accompanied with technical support by the UNICEF Ecuador protection team”180
This is a good example of adapting to the needs of populations. As stated in the final Canada project report, “half
of the girls and adolescents in the context of human mobility surveyed by Plan International in 2021 in Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru, identify the streets as unsafe places." In Ecuador, the political will towards the migrant
population has diminished in recent years, making it urgent and necessary to strengthen the mechanisms for
identifying unaccompanied or separated adolescent girls and LGBTIQ+ adolescents on the move in transit places
and destination communities. This could be a promising initiative to be monitored in the future.
UNICEF has chosen the approach of reinforcing local capacities as the core of the response. Potentially this offers
a starting point for a medium-term support, as the challenges will remain. Improving CP and education or health
systems will benefit host communities as well as migrants. UNICEF has substantially focused its efforts on
improving structures and capacities. As stated in the mobility law, access to services is a right to all people,
regardless of nationality. However, both the VMC and COVID-19 have put a strain on national and sub-national
structures and service-providers. UNICEF has supported at both levels to improve access to health, WASH,
education and social protection, while also working towards reducing discrimination and xenophobia. Related to
the Special Procedure, UNICEF initiated a series of capacity-building sessions with partners, migration officials and
government partners at all three border points of Rumichaca, San Miguel and Huaquillas. These addressed the
technical gaps slowing down the special procedure for children and separated or unaccompanied adolescents.
UNICEF was able to build local and national capacity through joint standard operating procedures used to
coordinate the management and referral of cases between all key actors.
ECO addresses immediate needs while also working towards long-term ones. Activities, such as WASH in schools,
capacity-building, distribution of tablets and health materials, allow Ecuador to be better prepared and improve
its response to the VMC and to migration as a whole. However, these are sometimes limited due to staff capacity,
funding, political willingness and changing context. The ET was not made aware of an integrated
emergency/development strategy or planning process.
As mentioned above, a lack of cross-border coordination and a clear regional strategy, has limited the adoption of
a whole-of-migration approach. Several IP and UNICEF KIs mentioned the short-term nature of arrangements
makes it difficult to implement a long-term strategy. Often activities have short-term and limited reach and effects.
7.7 Cross-cutting: gender, equity and accountability
The evaluation examines some cross-cutting dimensions of UNICEF’s response and is guided by the following
question: To what extent has UNICEF’s response to the Venezuelan Outflow taken a gender, equity, conflict
sensitive and accountability approach at all levels?
EQ21: To what extent has UNICEF Ecuador addressed cross-cutting issues, especially:
• Accountability to affected populations (AAP)
• Gender, disability and social inclusion
• Prior, new, and emerging gender inequities and protection issues for women and children (e.g., child
marriage/premature unions)
• Gender based violence (GBV)
 AAP is mainstreamed throughout all agreements with IPs. However, challenges remain and are notorious
in areas where irregular migrants gather, where lack of beneficiary engagement, poor information, and
absence of standards affect the AAP framework.
 ECO has been working to innovate in social inclusion, particularly being a pilot country for the UNCCS and
implementing CBI in coordination with other UN agencies.
 Ecuador does not have a gender specialist. However, ECO has focused much if its interventions on
addressing key gender gaps and inequalities such as GBV, access to education, women’s empowerment
through capacity building and training and working with women-led households.

 Disabilities are accounted for in all monitoring processes by UNICEF and partners, but the evaluation has
identified weaknesses in the overall response, such as defining clearer differentiation of disabilities, and
adapting spaces, such as the EAIs, to persons with disabilities.
This report has covered cross-cutting issues throughout the various EQs.
AAP
We have seen that AAP is mainstreamed throughout all agreements with IPs. ECO has been proactive in developing
materials and capacity-building to ensure AAP is implemented. However, challenges remain in areas where
irregular migrants gather, where there is lack of beneficiary engagement and poor information. EAIs, route
assistance and household visits provide good contexts to implement AAP if clear information is provided,
participation promoted, and feedback mechanisms are strengthened and diversified. Often AAP is confined to life-
saving messages (such as protection messages). Among initiatives to be highlighted are U-Report on the Move,
education FGDs, household visits with IPs (mainly in Tulcán and Manta), and workshops with teachers and
MinEduc staff. Another good practice has been communication team adaptation to feedback received from
adolescents in schools. There was early response to the rise in xenophobia, targeting students and teachers.
UNICEF responded to consultancy advice on messaging. Noting how messaging was perversely making migrant
students stand out, rather than helping with their integration, UNICEF worked with MinEduc on the Seamos
Amigos campaign.
There is little to no evidence that the feedback loop is closed throughout activities implemented. Specifically,
actions or responses seem to rarely be communicated to populations. AAP is limited to the communications
sector. Several KIs stated AAP should be mainstreamed across all sectors and be embedded in strategic
documents.
Social inclusion
A good practice has been piloting UNCCS and, as described above, pragmatically shifting to longer-term household
support with a stronger emphasis on education, protection and gender equality. A major challenge is finding
funding to meet the increasing needs amongst migrant and refugee vulnerable families. This should be a focus
area for UNICEF and the international community.
The R4V Gender-Based Violence Working Group has pointed out that GBV cases are underreported due to the
irregular situation of migrant women and girls, and the fears associated with reporting. There has been lack of
data disaggregated by sex, age, place of origin or immigration status. Although gender equality, GBV and PSEA are
core aspects of the response, ECO does not have a gender specialist. ECO was able to bridge this gap by regularly
requesting support from the LACRO GBV specialist, resulting in GBV awareness and prevention training for
frontline workers, including civil servants. Two GBV learning tools were designed and rolled out. As shown
throughout the report, Ecuador is working towards building an adapted response to respond to the needs of
migrants and host communities in terms of gender equality, GBV and PSEA. ECO is working to bridge the gender
gaps through its interventions, focusing on empowerment activities, capacity-building, communication on
masculinities, among others. UNICEF should monitor the state of activities related to SGBV risk prevention in the
EAIs, health facilities, the offices of IPs and schools. The capacity of IPs to identify SGBV cases and refer them
needs to be enhanced.
Disabilities are accounted for in all monitoring processes by UNICEF and partners, but the evaluation has identified
weaknesses in the overall response. An additional challenge for UNICEF and partners is to define a clearer
differentiation of disabilities. Mental health disabilities are not properly singled out and addressed. UNICEF has
invested in psycho-social support with several partners. While disability is cross cutting in programmatic
documents there are gaps in practice.
8. Good practices
Some relevant lessons can be extracted from UNICEF ECO’s response the VMC
 EAI: The EAI in Tulcán has shown how inter-agency coordination exercise has enabled responses to shifting
priorities and created a space for different agencies to work together. As UNICEF further rolls out the EAI
model monitoring will be of prime importance.
 Staff dedication: Informants, as noted, overwhelmingly praise staff’s availability, transparency, and
openness. UNICEF has been able to leverage its existing presence and relationships linked to regular
52
programming to build programmes and activities for the VMC.
 ECO experience piloting UNCCS has shown the possibility of working together to extend cash-based transfers
and respond to the needs of vulnerable populations. A more detailed analysis can be found in the CBI
evaluation and assessment.181
 On social inclusion: ECA has shown how CBI, if sufficiently funded, can respond to housing, employment,
education, health and food needs and can be empowering.
 The Special Procedure described above has been a duplicable model of technical support and coordination
with government institutions.
9. Conclusions
The evaluation has responded to the EQs based on the evidence obtained in the field, from informants and
affected population and from the documents and data available. We propose a number of conclusions.
Appropriateness
Overall UNICEF ECO developed and adapted several response strategies, objectives and implementations
modalities to the different contexts and populations entering Ecuador. The UNICEF team also managed to work
with challenging government restrictions. However, staffing capacity and short-term contracts within UNICEF and
with IPs have limited capacity to appropriately respond to the needs of migrant and host communities.
While the VMC was an unexpected humanitarian situation before 2016, ECO’s lack of emergency capacity and
tools affected the response from the outset. This was corrected over time, and ECO became a champion in
preparedness and contingency planning. The response to the VMC has been always articulated as short-term. This
continues to impact UNICEF’s capacity to transition to the medium to long term. Additionally, there seems to have
been limited cross-border information sharing.
In collaboration with other partners, UNICEF has gathered information about the migrant population yet learning
about their needs remains a challenge in terms of closing the feedback loop and incorporating feedback into
programming. UNICEF is implementing actions and efforts to address information gaps around GBV, PSEA and
human trafficking but these need to be strengthened. While UNICEF and partners are providing migrants with
useful information and putting in place feedback mechanisms through IPs, AAP remains a weakness. It is not
simply a question of providing complaint meetings or convening meeting to solicit beneficiary feedback.
Communities are rarely consulted upstream when strategies and activities are being elaborated. Nonetheless,
UNICEF and partners have progressed, and the promotion of adolescents’ participation and other community-
based mechanisms offers a platform for AAP. It is important to enhance what has been poor cross-border dialogue
and data sharing.
Effectiveness
As noted, funding has been a challenge at national and regional level. However, ECO has developed strong
capacity-building, training and technical support to bridge gaps, particularly in WASH, Health, CP, education and
social inclusion. C4D is a sector that has been severely impacted by a shortfall in funding.
Two main external factors – border closures and the pandemic – have challenged ECO monitoring. IP informants
admire UNICEF’s flexibility regarding funding structures and programme extensions. However, lack of strong
regional and global advocacy impacted funding and informants raised doubts about the R4V as a strong advocacy
platform.
ECO has been able to coordinate effectively with other UN agencies, NGO, INGO, CSO and government
counterparts to improve the response given to migrants and horst communities. Coordination was done mainly
in data collection, CBI, en route responses, and capacity building with government.
Coverage
UNICEF outreach and coverage is limited by the ability to properly identify those in need and the saturation of
national services. However, a lot is being done by UNICEF to bridge the gaps left by strained services and support
national and local services. In general UNICEF has been able to leverage partnerships with line ministries, IPs and
local governments to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable.

UNICEF presence and leadership in some sectors in the GTRM, at both national and sub-national level, allows the
organisation to position itself to collect data. UNICEF is working towards reinforcing national structures and
capacities for GoE and civil society. UNICEF is working to strengthen legal protection and enhance coverage for
UASC. Short term contractual arrangements have constrained continuity of UNICEF presence. A notable example
of optimal coverage was the joint CBI done in coordination with WFP and UNHCR.
Coherence and coordination
UNICEF is seen as a main VMC actor in Ecuador by sister UN agencies, NGOs CSOs and government counterparts.
ECO was able to strongly coordinate with local and national actors to implement innovative structures such as
EAIs and flexible mechanisms such as with CBI. As reported earlier, ECO has partnered with sister UN agencies and
the World Bank on a national household survey of Venezuelan and host families. ECO has been able to leverage
partnerships to build joint communications campaigns to combat xenophobia and discrimination. Despite these
effective coordination efforts, overall inter-agency coordination is not seen as coherent. There has been
duplication of coordination mechanisms between the GTRM and the cluster system.
As noted, there has been lack of structured coordination mechanisms between UNICEF staff across the regions.
Improved coordination is needed to raise the profile of UNICEF to support advocacy challenges, to coordinate
donor support and to share good practices and challenges.
Efficiency
As analysed above, UNICEF has improved efficiency by expanding previous relationships with government
institutions and IPs to avoid overlap. UNICEF is seen as being flexible in funding and programme extensions, making
IP work with migrant children and their families more efficient. However, UNICEF, like other response agencies,
has not been able to find efficient solutions to monitor irregular entries.
Connectedness
UNICEF has put reinforcing local capacities at the core of the response. This offers a starting point for a medium-
term support, as the challenges will remain. Better performing child protection, education or health systems will
benefit host communities as well as migrants. CO has contributed to a number of initiatives that help create a
receptive environment for migrant children, such as, notably, the special procedure described above and creation
of centres for UASC. However, since the 2019 visa requirement and border closure, there has been more
difficulties to reach UASC. There are few centres and little data to show the impact of this intervention.
Social inclusion, gender and disability
UNICEF has been working to innovate in social inclusion, particularly being a pilot country for the UNCCS and
implementing CBI in coordination with other UN agencies. Although gender equality, GBV and PSEA are core
aspects of the response, ECO does not have a gender specialist to support the response. ECO was able to bridge
this gap by regularly requesting support from the LACRO GBV specialist, resulting in GBV awareness and prevention
training for frontline workers, including civil servants. However, UNICEF should monitor the state of activities
related to sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) risk prevention in the EAIs, health facilities, the offices of IPs
and schools. The capacity of IPs to identify SGBV cases and refer them needs to be enhanced. Disabilities are
accounted for in all monitoring processes by UNICEF and partners, but the evaluation has identified weaknesses
in the overall response, such as defining clearer differentiation of disabilities, and adapting spaces, such as the
EAIs, to persons with disabilities.
10. Recommendations
Strategic Recommendation 1 (Global Level and LACRO): Need to establish a LACRO regional strategy for migrant
children and adapt the Children on the Move framework to the region.
Operational Recommendations:
● Ensure that UNICEF humanitarian standards, expectations for advocacy and approaches to regional migration
are clearly articulated. They should inform staff and partner training/orientation and development of an
operational culture with a clear understanding of humanitarian and emergency response modalities.
● Establish a permanent coordination platform at LACRO level, with different triggers for activation, to
understand and respond to emergency migration challenges. It should include the Venezuela CO.
54
Strategic Recommendation 2 (UNICEF Ecuador): Further invest in evidence generation and analysis by i)
mapping key gaps in terms of territorial coverage and performance measurement; ii) understanding what
evidence decision makers need and when; iii) defining how, when and who does the analysis, and iv) outlining
how analysis is then used and shared for both operational and advocacy purposes.
Operational Recommendations:
● ECO should develop an advocacy plan to ensure that data and evidence generated from the field on gaps in
coverage and non-enjoyment of rights is translated into specific and verifiable advocacy actions with
authorities. This should be accompanied by sharing of best practices and lessons learned to ensure a better
route-based approach to the migration crisis. Insofar as possible, these meetings should include all sectors
to enhance cross-sectoral dialogue and programming. At national level, UNICEF should push for further
coordination in the GTRM to avoid duplication of actions in information generation and management.
● UNICEF at national and local level needs to invest in data collection and continue with the systematisation of
information on services provided in the field, especially in EAIs. Data collected at field level should inform
interventions to ensure quality responses. It is essential to develop with MIESS more efficient registration
and monitoring systems for case management and identification of girls and boys, especially UASC. ECO
should monitor the education system, particularly the extent to which migrant children are enrolled in
schools and their educational achievements.
● Building on the success of UNCCS, ECO should explore further collaborative procurements. ECO should
organise a workshop with all UNICEF COs and LACRO to share lessons learned from the UNCCS pilot and
explore funding opportunities with LACRO.
● UNICEF Ecuador has a good track record of implementing activities and programmes based on national
priorities and needs of the population. However, ECO needs to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of
activities in different contexts. The ET proposes a rapid assessment of Manta’s EAI to see how the EAI concept
is being translated in different contexts (transit and permanent, as well as different vulnerable groups such
as children and GBV survivors). There is also need for specific analysis (such as Real-Time Assessments) of
activities aimed at legal assistance to ensure appropriate measures are taken to address pressing needs,
particularly of regularisation of status of migrants.
● Map out existing IP and other actors in the territory to explore potential collaborations. Additionally, the
team would recommend preparing a brief note on past and current IP to better understand the needs of
UNICEF in the different regions and how to address bottlenecks.
Strategic Recommendation 3 (UNICEF Ecuador): Incorporate migration across sectors in the new 2023-2026
CPD.
Operational Recommendations:
● Include addressing migration challenges in the new CPD with objectives and areas of convergence with
development components. Migration should be transversal to all sectors and response strategies should
include an internal mechanism to monitor progress.
● Establish a clear national strategy to address short-term humanitarian gaps identified for those entering
Ecuador with the intention of transiting to other countries or those seeking to regularise permanent
residence in Ecuador.
● ECO needs to review coverage to avoid unnecessary overlap with other VMC responders in order to enhance
UNICEF´s standing as a provider of added value.
● Design a transition from humanitarian response to medium term development and handover of UNICEF
interventions to government or civil society actors. This requires strengthening relationships with local
partners and training and capacity building; and ensuring documentation/ handovers are made. Given limited
funds and challenging contexts, a strong relationship with local actors seems the best option.
Strategic Recommendation 4 (UNICEF Ecuador, LACRO and HQ): Invest in internal capacity-building, learning
exercises as well as HR/staff resourcing and staff-care activities
Operational Recommendations:
● UNICEF at national, regional and HQ levels should further invest in cross-sectoral and regional exercises to
55
enhance learning and work towards a route-based approach. This requires structured and accompanied
cross-national dialogue and sharing of experience.
● ECO responded to the earthquake and VMC back-to-back. The team recommends continuing investing in
wellbeing activities and capacity building exercises. ECO seems to be implementing interesting activities and
options for staff (free memberships to wellbeing apps, psychologic support). ECO should ensure staff is aware
of all options made available.
● At all levels UNICEF should review its staff capacity and resources, both in terms of humanitarian response
capacity and delegation of decision-making authority. Staff, and particularly UNVs, need to be better
informed about migration dynamics, child-related international human rights instruments and international
best practice in responding to migration flows.
Strategic Recommendation 5: Further invest in vulnerability assessment to ensure gender equality and
disabilities are mainstreamed through all sectors.
Operational Recommendations:
● LACRO and UNICEF ECO needs to have an integrated and adequately funded gender strategy, particularly
addressing issues around GBV, sexual diversity and gender identity.
● Gender issues should not be left to consultants to address. ECO should be funded to support a full-time
gender specialist.
● Although UNICEF and IPs are required in all monitoring process to consider disability issues, the needs of
persons with disabilities remain largely unknown or unaddressed. UNICEF supported facilities need to have
disabled access. IPs should be supported to develop checklists of what needs to be done to meet the needs
of people with disabilities.
