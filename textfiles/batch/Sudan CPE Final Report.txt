Executive Summary
a. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commissioned an evaluation of its Sudan Country
Programme for the period 2018-20231 to provide accountability to national counterparts and
development partners, and draw lessons and recommendations for programme improvement. The
evaluation was commissioned by UNICEF’s Regional Office for Middle East & North Africa (MENARO)
in line with UNICEF’s policy that each country programme is evaluated every second cycle. The
evaluation was carried out between August and October 2022. This report brings together the findings,
conclusions and recommendations from the various processes of the evaluation.
b. The overall purpose of the evaluation was to provide an impartial and independent assessment
of the results achieved, lessons learned and the main gaps and challenges in implementation of the
country programme as articulated in the Country Programme Document (CPD). The CPD is premised
on five main pillars of programming: i) Child survival and development: health and nutrition (H&N), and
Water sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); ii) Education and learning; iii) Child protection; iv) Policy,
evidence and social protection; v) Programme effectiveness.
c. Based on six evaluation criteria, namely: coherence, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness,
sustainability and cross-cutting issues of gender and human rights, the evaluation used mixed methods
involving key informant interviews, desk review of key documents and visits and meetings with
communities or users of the services provided through UNICEF’s support. The key informants included
officials from the implementing partner institutions, development partners, UNICEF staff and other
development agencies selected through purposive sampling. In total, the evaluation team (ET)
conducted 113 key informant interviews and visited six communities in two states where eight group
interviews were conducted with community members and beneficiaries of UNICEF-assisted activities.
d. The main audience of the evaluation are UNICEF Sudan Country Office (CO), the MENARO,
implementing partners, donors and the UN country team. A major limitation of the evaluation has been
the team’s inability to gather data on a number of CPD outputs which targeted various institutions of
the federal and state governments on policies, institutional framework and capacity development. This
was due to sensitivities and restrictions following the coup d’état in 2021.
Findings of the evaluation
Coherence
e. UNICEF’s country programme demonstrated a strong convergence with the national priorities
through its focus on addressing critical gaps in the areas of health and nutrition, WASH, education, child
protection and social protection. Similarly, UNICEF programme covering multiple sectors across
development and emergency response demonstrated a high degree of alignment with UN and UNICEF
aims and global strategies. Across all clusters/sectors, UNICEF programme’s strong alignment with the
priorities of the Government of Sudan (GoS) and its good working relationship with relevant Ministries
and partners in the basic services sector, particularly during the existence of the transitional government,
enabled it to provide leadership and co-leadership in sector/cluster coordination in nutrition, education,
WASH and child protection. For humanitarian programmes, based on the multi-year interagency
humanitarian response strategy and annual humanitarian response plans under the aegis of the
Humanitarian Coordinator, developed in agreement with the GoS, UNICEF has been a key provider of
services in emergency health, nutrition, WASH, education in emergencies and child protection, applying
a humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach and a conflict-sensitive programming. While in the
past (pre-coup) most of the programme delivery was done through the GoS apparatus, it has now
shifted to working largely through civil society organization (CSO) partnerships and direct cash

extended twice and now runs up to the end of 2023.
vi
modalities to frontline workers. UNICEF has thus prioritized programming at state and local levels
emphasizing resilience at community and locality level, which became even more pertinent after the
2021 coup..
Relevance
f. UNICEF programming in different sectors has been strongly determined by child-centred
vulnerability analysis for which it relied on systematic data and studies. Following favourable political
environment in the country during 2019-2021, UNICEF assisted the government in institutional capacity
building and policy development in core areas of child rights, protection and welfare, including
revamping the social protection programme targeting the most-vulnerable. Development of a
nationwide vulnerability map, combined with its extensive field presence keeps UNICEF connected to
ground reality, and being able to build local partnerships and undertake necessary actions that address
the most urgent needs give UNICEF the capacity to undertake at-scale programming targeting the
vulnerable. UNICEF demonstrated agility and flexibility in responding to major changes in context and
various emergencies, including the COVID during 2020-2022 and floods, drought and conflict which
recur periodically in the country. UNICEF’s increasing focus on resilience at community and locality level
is all the more relevant in the current context as it is likely that donor funding may decline and most
funding may be of humanitarian nature in foreseeable future. UNICEF’s programming has on the whole
been relevant, though integration of gender in programme remains limited with little attention given
to the inclusion of boys and men in gender dialogue. A significant gap in UNICEF’s programme has
been a lack of strong focus on youth and adolescents during this country programme period.
g. UNICEF’s comparative advantage lies in: (a) its ability to engage with the government and
influence policies, and (b) deliver basic services at-scale and contribute to changes in norms and
behaviours in partnership with multiple actors. UNICEF has leveraged strategic partnerships with several
UN and related international agencies over the years to ensure synergy and complementarity in
programmes and advocacy with government. The current political context however renders much of
the progress made with regard to vulnerability-focused government policies and programmes
redundant, at least in the foreseeable future. While UNICEF is able to ensure continuity of some of the
basic services through working with NGOs, civil society and local officials, a number of urgent child
protection issues are likely to remain unaddressed without active engagement of the Government.
Efficiency
h. Partnership with government, UN agencies and NGOs has been a key strategy in programme
implementation as this enabled leveraging government’s unique role in delivery of basic services
through policies and direct action across the country. UNICEF’s investment in strengthening institutional
capacity of the GoS at both federal and state levels as well as policy advocacy and data-driven
programmes in various sectors enabled the GoS to prioritize some of the key programmes and to
significantly expand its outreach capacity to deliver at scale. UNICEF’s extensive footprint has enabled
it to rapidly respond to emerging urgent needs, ensuring timely delivery and facilitating outreach, being
able to access some of the hard-to-reach areas and pockets of high vulnerability.
i. All these strategies have helped UNICEF reach a large number of vulnerable children with
responses in different sectors. UNICEF has consistently been reaching out to the largest proportion of
children targeted/reached by all agencies reporting to the Clusters in several areas. For example, at least
a quarter to half the population in need of basic drinking water and sanitation were being reached by
UNICEF during various years.
j. Thanks to its pre-existing partnership with over 40 national and international NGOs, UNICEF
was able to diversify its implementation modalities following the late-2021 coup when it became clear
that engagement with the new authorities was to be restricted. UNICEF has used the most appropriate
implementation modality depending on the operating context including some continued work with
state level line ministries where appropriate and acceptable to donor partners, NGO partnership and
vii
direct cash to frontline workers and vulnerable women and families. However, the workflow process
involving partnership with NGOs remains cumbersome and delivery costs higher than delivering
through government which raises questions over the viability and sustainability of this modus operandi
if the current impasse vis-à-vis engagement with government continues.
Effectiveness
k. UNICEF’s multi-sectoral programme has continued to deliver outcomes for vulnerable children,
achieving the intended objectives to a large degree, despite setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the coup. UNICEF supported the capacity needs of a number of government institutions that played
a crucial role in delivery of targeted outputs only to see those results nearly disappear following the
coup. Despite these, the scale of the results achieved are noteworthy, for instance, UNICEF:
• Provided 53 (2020) to 96 per cent (2018) of total nationwide Severe Acute Malnutrition
(SAM) treatment to 6-59 months old children; UNICEF and its partners screened on an
average 3.5 mn (2020) to 4.5 mn (2019) and 5.8 mn (2021) children for malnutrition
• Measles vaccination for under-1 and Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses
(IMCI) access provided for under-5: 27-37 per cent of children targeted by the entire
sector covered by UNICEF and its partners
• At least 25 to 53 per cent of people in need of basic drinking water and sanitation were
being reached by UNICEF during various years.
l. In Outcome area 1 – Health and nutrition, the evaluation findings show mixed results. The
outputs related to policy development and capacity building at national and subnational showed signs
of realising the intended objectives. At the locality levels, efforts towards revitalization of health centres
have proven to be effective, and the community mobilization dimension of the programme has been
strengthened during this period. Strong emphasis laid on integrating social behaviour and practice
changes regarding public health issues, including responding to COVID-19, through local health
structures is indeed creating good level of awareness among communities. On the other hand, despite
substantial progress made in several areas of basic health and nutrition, the situation has deteriorated
in two key areas at the national level, notably measles vaccination coverage and live-births attended by
skilled personnel. Government absence and low budgetary resources in these areas are mainly
responsible for this. UNICEF has been filling the void left by government’s absence by increasing
geographic footprint based on vulnerability mapping and working with communities. This has
prevented a collapse of the health system and further deterioration of the basic health and nutrition
services.
m. The evaluation found that UNICEF had a unique contribution in building national capacity on
sanitation and that UNICEF’s interventions on providing access to water, especially to crisis-affected
populations, have been effective in reducing mortality rates. Water interventions are also being
increasingly used by UNICEF and NGO partners as entry point in conflict-affected communities, which
is a good example of how UNICEF can include activities that contribute towards local peace building
and social cohesion. However, sanitation interventions and the key objective of open defecation-free
(ODF) programme nationally are showing mixed results due to lack of leadership from the government
and low government investment in the sector. Quality control of the WASH structures and their
monitoring have generally been weak, besides sanitation facilities often having inadequate access to
water sources, reflecting a predominantly supply-driven approach in implementation.
n. In education, UNICEF contributed towards enhancing the governance capacity of the Ministry
of Education (MoE) at federal and state levels, innovatively supported learning opportunities for out-of-
school-children (OOSC) and children who are hard to reach, supported girls’ education and contributed
towards improved quality of education and an enabling learning environment. Specifically, UNICEF’s
ability to reach children in states and areas affected by conflict or forced displacement, hosting a high
number of refugees and displaced persons, as well as areas that have a high number of nomads, and to
viii
provide them with basic education was a significant achievement. However, due to the external
challenges - especially the COVID-19 pandemic, the limited investments in education reflected in the
very low government budget allocations, and the low government technical, operational and capacity -
it will be difficult for UNICEF to reach some of the key indicators in its CPD. Quality control of school
construction/rehabilitation has also been a persistent issue.
o. UNICEF made major contributions to strengthening the national child protection system,
through strong partnership with the government and institutional capacity development of the social
work force and Family and Child Protection Units (FCPU). UNICEF was the driver and key partner for
government in adopting child friendly legislation, including on the criminalization of female genital
mutilation (FGM) and prevention of use and recruitment of children by national forces and armed
groups, and in developing Action Plan and road maps for female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).
UNICEF’s interventions were certainly the right choices to lay the foundation for a robust child
protection system and for providing the basis for government and civil society to build on when
addressing child protection violations. Most of the work on child protection system remains heavily
reliant on UNICEF technical and financial support, with inconsistent or very small government budget
allocations.
p. UNICEF has begun to engage on triple nexus through its programming in social protection. The
cash transfer programme currently being implemented by UNICEF and its partners is showing good
initial results even with a small cash transfer linked to mother and child health. All of its sectoral work
has potential to directly contribute to resilience and nexus provided the interventions are of sustainable
quality and rooted in strengthened capacity at community and locality levels, and combined with
conflict-sensitive programming. While progress has been made by UNICEF to operationalize
peacebuilding notably through the support from Peacebuilding Fund (PBF), further work is needed to
translate peacebuilding into programmatic approaches and results across sectors to provide greater
clarify for all UNICEF staff.
q. Throughout the CPD period, communication-for-development (C4D) has been given a
prominent thrust during implementation in order to facilitate behaviour and practice changes at
community level. UNICEF is now trying to address a key weakness in its sectorally-configured
programming with each sector developing its plans and programmes independently which perpetuates
a scattered approach in programming. The setting up of a dedicated team to provide support on social
and behaviour change (SBC) has been an important initial step, which aims to further facilitate sectoral
and programme integration. This will also be enhanced by better integrated of information
management and outcome monitoring capacity within the CO which the latter is currently undertaking.
Sustainability
r. Sustainability of outputs and outcomes is largely affected by the continuing political uncertainly
in the country. While UNICEF and partners continue to mobilize communities, CSOs and local authorities
to sustain core outputs on basic services, a number of urgent issues are likely to remain unaddressed
without active engagement of the GoS. For instance, the continued engagement of the social service
workforce crucial for child protection, commitment towards government support to health workers, and
the government’s leadership to ensure public financing for children, will determine how most of the
outcomes sustain in the long run.
s. UNICEF’s efforts towards enhancing the quality of its delivery in some of the core areas and
towards building resilience of communities, despite the limitations of not being able to fully engage
with the government, is likely to have a positive contribution to sustainability. Quality of interventions
(WASH, schools) and mechanisms for their maintenance is however a crucial issue UNICEF needs to
address.

Conclusions
C1. UNICEF Sudan’s capacity for at-scale programme delivery is one of its strengths, and this
enabled it to provide multisectoral services at state and locality level where stakeholders see very little
direct investment by the GoS in provision of basic services. The scale of UNICEF’s delivery sometimes
overshadows that of the GoS.
C2. The CPD was closely aligned with government policies, UN system-wide strategies and UNICEF
internal policies and strategies. UNICEF has been able to work in close collaboration with the GoS, while
playing an active role in sectoral coordination and in the development or updating of major sector
policies and frameworks, till the coup d’état in 2021. Following the coup, a change in overall
programming approach was needed, with UNICEF demonstrating the capacity to quickly and effectively
focus on active engagement at locality level. UNICEF has been able to apply a humanitarian-
development-peace nexus approach and a conflict-sensitive programming, emphasizing resilience at
community and locality level, which becomes even more pertinent after the 2021 coup.
C3. UNICEF’s strong focus on vulnerability and multi-sectoral programming capacity leveraging
multiple partnerships make UNICEF’s programming remain relevant in the current context of political
uncertainty and economic hardships faced by people. Given the urgency of key child rights issues,
UNICEF’s role in advocacy with government and other international institutions assumes high criticality
at this juncture.
C4. While the UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) continues to play
a leading role in peacebuilding, UNICEF’s programmatic relevance remains anchored in addressing
vulnerability through providing basic services in a way that strengthens community resilience and social
cohesion through addressing underlying drivers of social exclusion and conflicts, and this may, in turn,
contribute to peacebuilding.
C5. Mainstreaming of gender and promotion of gender equality have been prioritized in plans, but
specific attention to inclusion of boys and men in the gender dialogue (e.g., on gender-based violence
(GBV), FGM and child marriage, girls education, management of menstrual hygiene, adolescents health
and nutrition, youth empowerment) as well as the inclusion of standard indicators related to gender
action plan (GAP), together with the additional financial and human resources allocated to gender
responsiveness and integration remain significant gaps.
C6. As engagement with the current government remains partially suspended at federal and state
levels, it is unclear if any of the outputs from the programme will be continued into the future. In this
scenario, continued engagement with the government at state and locality levels which UNICEF
continues to pursue remains crucial for effective delivery of basic services in health, nutrition, education,
WASH, child protection, and social protection, along with engagement with NGOs, for efficient and
effective delivery of services in foreseeable future.
C7. UNICEF’s scale and geographical spread of programme delivery has been one of the largest in
the spheres of nutrition, education and WASH, in particular, for which it has built multiple partnerships
with government agencies, NGOs, civil society and UN agencies. This scale and spread of operation,
however, does lead to a scattered approach spreading resources thinly across large geographical areas.
There is space to create stronger integration between programme interventions.
C8. In a number of critical areas of UNICEF’s core programme, the outcomes at national level have
shown a negative trend. Further, in the prevailing context, child protection issues are assuming urgency,
especially with regard to child rights violation in conflict and civil unrest situations. There is the need for
UNICEF to redefine its role and approach in this context.
C9. UNICEF’s enhanced emphasis on integration of various sectors, thrust on social and behaviour
change and geographical concentration of programmes in partnership with other providers is timely
and necessary to promote resilience, along with its emphasis on social protection in line with a nexus
approach. Engagement on peacebuilding needs to be underpinned by the premise that UNICEF
x
programme is primarily geared to address unmet basic needs in vulnerable communities, through
strengthening community resilience in a conflict-sensitive manner that fosters social cohesion.
C10. Comprehensive social protection programmes assume critical significance at this juncture due
to the economic hardships people face. Despite the absence of an internationally accepted government,
UNICEF continued to advance Sudan’s social protection sector reform agenda, focusing on the launch
and roll out of the Mother-to-Child Cash transfer Plus (MCCT+) Programme. This is one of the key
flagship programmes that were proposed in the draft National Social Protection Strategy. Programmes
like MCCT+ can be effective vehicles for delivering health and nutrition outcomes if these are integrated
with other sectors as well as through an area-based convergence with other development actors
targeting women and children.
C11. Prolonged disengagement with the government at federal level may affect sustainability of
some of the programme outputs and outcomes, though this can be countered to some extent with
increased thrust on resilience and social cohesion, as well as quality of service delivery, working through
NGOs, localities and communities, as UNICEF intends to do.
C12. While there is good monitoring of activities, UNICEF’s internal information management
capacity has not supported good monitoring of results/outcomes, and might in turn affect the quality
of delivery and the sustainability of interventions.
C13. Quality and maintenance of constructions being pre-requisites to sustainability of
interventions at the community and locality level continue to receive attention through the
establishment of UNICEF construction unit in Khartoum and six field offices.
Recommendations
t. The recommendations are made in the current context in the country which limits active
engagement with the federal and state governments. The evaluation team (ET) assumes that should any
dramatic positive shift occur in the sphere of governance, UNICEF is well aware of the priorities and
focus vis-à-vis reengagement with the government. Secondly, the ET assumes that the current political
context is likely to continue and this is likely to lead to reduction in funding. As development partner
funding decreases and humanitarian funding becomes the major resourcing option, a number of
development partners may switch part of their funds to direct-funding of NGOs, as opposed to funding
through UN agencies. This will call for choices to be made in terms of scale and focus of the programme.
R1. Focus and depth: In line with its internal discussions currently underway, UNICEF needs to
develop clear focus (both geographical and programmatic interventions) so as to ensure depth and
quality in programmes. This should include:
i) further increased internal integration of different sectors;
ii) establishing/redefining partnerships with other agencies (NGOs/UN) to mobilize a
minimum package of basic needs services that addresses interlinked vulnerabilities in
selected target areas;
iii) narrowing down target areas of interventions and/or a tighter focus within
programmes, while keeping the current focus on vulnerable children;
iv) moving away from construction while focusing on quality of service
providers/strengthening capacities of service providers rather than be the service
provider.
R2. Address deterioration in outcomes in critical areas of programming. In the new CPD, clearly
articulate how UNICEF will deepen and expand partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders to
continue to prioritize programming where the key national level outcomes are showing a declining or
stagnating trend (namely measles vaccination coverage, live-births attended by skilled personnel,
xi
malnutrition among children, FGM practices). It may be that UNICEF defines its intended outcomes at
two levels:
i) focus on particular geographical areas where it will demonstrate definite positive changes in
trend over a period of time;
ii) support government/other agencies in the rest of the country, where resources allow.
R3. Sustainability of interventions. More attention should be given to sustainability of results of
interventions in the longer-term by:
i) Ensuring quality control and maintenance of all infrastructure work where UNICEF decides that
their involvement is critical (as elaborated above, the recommendation is that UNICEF should
move away from engaging in construction as much as possible); for infrastructures like WASH
and school constructions/rehabilitation, UNICEF needs to produce an inventory of facilities it
has supported and ensure periodic monitoring of these through the local authorities;
ii) In interventions for which results depend upon community capacity and their mobilization (e.g.,
WASH structures, school infrastructure), ensuring that adequate amount of time is given for
community mobilization process and post-implementation (delivery) follow up to monitor how
communities and local authorities are developing capacity, utilizing and maintaining the
services;
iii) When implemented through NGOs (short-term grants), making provision for continuing
monitoring and follow up after an activity is implemented. In this regard, UNICEF may
encourage implementing partners and communities to set up a ‘pooled fund’ that is available
for providing small maintenance/monitoring support; ideally, this will require all partners
involved in a particular area to coordinate such an initiative.
R4. Programming for peacebuilding and focus on resilience: As part of the new CPD, UNICEF
needs to further clarify the scope of its programming on peacebuilding and ensure that all its staff have
a common understanding. In this regard, it may be worth reinforcing the premise that UNICEF
programme addresses unmet basic needs in vulnerable communities through strengthening community
resilience in a conflict-sensitive manner and foster social cohesion; programming is not driven by
peacebuilding, but contributes to it. Specific actions may include:
i) A clear definition of parameters (result indicators) to measure resilience and social cohesion;
ii) An assessment of UNICEF Sudan’s specific expertise in peacebuilding – some field offices
already have good experience in this regard;
iii) Strengthen life and livelihood skills as well as citizenship education of children and
adolescents.
R5. Social protection: While continuing to implement the MCCT+ programme, UNICEF needs to
ensure that this is integrated with other sectors (especially nutrition and WASH) as well as through an
area-based integration (R1 above) with other development actors targeting women and children. An
impact study of the pilot cash transfer programme in the two states where this is being implemented
will provide data and evidence which will be crucial for any expansion of the current programme or of
any other social protection programme.
R6. Advocacy regarding child protection. Given that implementation of crucial laws and policies
geared to the protection of children remain in limbo, UNICEF needs to continue its evidence-based
advocacy with the GoS focusing on prevention of child protection violations, particularly violence
against children, through increased human, financial and infrastructure resources for social service
workforce. In parallel, UNICEF needs to continue working with service providers (e.g., government, NGOs
and CSOs) to strengthen and scale up child protection systems, and partner with UNITAMS and key
stakeholders from civil society and UN agencies to prevent violence against children.
xii
R7. Partnerships with civil society: Partnerships with NGOs and CSOs should be further increased
and diversified as engagement with the government remains substantially suspended, and this may
help enhance quality of delivery due the former’s closer engagement with communities. UNICEF needs
to i) examine if there is room for further improvement in the workflow process involving NGOs to
increase efficiency of delivery. Confrontation with UNICEF Headquarters or other Regional / Country
Offices could be beneficial; ii) duly assess the existing capacities of the NGOs to further build on these.
R8. Gender equality. More specific attention to the inclusion of boys and men in the gender
dialogue (e.g., on GBV, FGM, child marriage, girls’ education, management of menstrual hygiene,
adolescents’ health and nutrition, youth empowerment) as well as the development of gender-friendly
indicators would be needed, together with the additional financial and human resources allocated to
gender-responsiveness and integration.

1. Introducing the evaluation
1.1 Purpose of the evaluation
1. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commissioned an evaluation of its Sudan Country
Programme for the period 2018-20232 to provide accountability to national counterparts and
development partners, and draw lessons and suggestions for programme improvement. The evaluation
was commissioned by UNICEF’s Regional Office for Middle East & North Africa (MENARO) in line with
UNICEF’s policy that each country programme is evaluated every second cycle. The evaluation was
carried out between August and October 2022. This report brings together the findings, conclusions,
and recommendations from the various processes of the evaluation.
2. The overall purpose of the evaluation was to provide an impartial and independent
assessment of the results achieved, lessons learned and the main gaps and challenges in
implementation of the country programme as articulated in the Country Programme Document (CPD)
approved by the Executive Board of UNICEF3 and related programme strategy.4 An important element
for the evaluation to assess is UNICEF’s approach to nexus programming linking its development work
with humanitarian response in view of UNICEF’ frequent involvement in providing emergency response.
The overarching reference point for the country programme is the CPD which is premised on five main
pillars of programming:5
i) Child survival and development: health and nutrition (H&N), and Water sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH)
ii) Education and learning
iii) Child protection
iv) Policy, evidence and social protection
v) Programme effectiveness
1.2 Intended users, scope and objective of the evaluation
3. The main audience of the evaluation are the UNICEF Sudan Country Office (CO), the MENARO,
the government, implementing partners, donors and the UN country team. The scope of the country
evaluation included all geographical areas in the country where UNICEF operates and covered the
period from 2018 through to 2022.
4. The specific objectives6 of the evaluation were to:
• Assess key UNICEF contributions to the results at the outcome level, including cross-cutting
strategies, based on existing evidence and analysis, and identify key challenges and lessons
learned
• Identify the opportunities and potential strategic shifts for the next country programme
vis-a-vis UNICEF’s comparative advantage and potential ways to integrate the nexus
approach more systematically
• Based on the evolving situation in Sudan and the potential strategic shifts identified, assess
where UNICEF is with regard to its strategic positioning, the current implementation
modalities and decentralized operations.
2 Initially the country programme document was drafted for the period 2018-2021, but this duration has been
extended twice and now runs up to the end of 2022.

5. The broad objectives described above were sought to be addressed through the lens of six
evaluation criteria, namely: coherence, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and
cross-cutting issues of gender and human rights (See Terms of Reference, Annex 1). The Terms of
Reference (ToR) listed 16 evaluation questions (EQ) under the six criteria. However, during the inception
phase, a review of the EQs to examine overlaps and evaluability led to 20 revised EQs which were agreed
with the UNICEF steering Committee for the evaluation (See Evaluation Matrix, Annex 2).
1.3 Framework and methodology
6. The CPD and the revised programme strategy notes7 provided clear articulation of country
programme goals, outcomes and outputs, with the latter showing theories of change (TOC) on each
outcome (see Annex 3). The use of the TOCs was made to identify the mechanisms of change, as well
as the assumptions, risks and the context that supported or hindered the results. This was supplemented
with empirical evidence obtained from a sample of interventions/projects/activities. UNICEF
interventions broadly fell under four broad types of actions/inputs and data collection focussed on
identifying key outputs and outcomes on each of these:
i) capacity building of governments at federal and state levels
ii) policy dialogue, advocacy and policy development
iii) interventions towards delivery of services, and
iv) strengthening the ecosystem at community level.
7. During the inception phase, the evaluation team (ET) developed an evaluation matrix mapping
the EQs and corresponding judgment criteria, as well as indicative methods and sources of data to
enable the ET to address the EQs systematically. To help gather evidence from the programme
interventions, the ET developed a series of judgement criteria for all the 20 evaluation questions. The
judgment criteria were based on various outputs and outcomes outlined in the CPD and these were
used to develop appropriate methods for data collection and analysis and collated into an evaluation
matrix which is presented as Annex 2 of this report. The ET used mixed methods, with primary and
secondary data gathered from: (a) purposively selected documents; (b) key informants identified
through stakeholder analysis at the inception stage; site visits to a representative sample of projects
and activities supported / through the country programme; and (c) discussions with a cross-section of
communities where UNICEF has been operational. For key informant interviews (KIIs), a non-probability
sampling (purposive and snowball) was used for data collection. Secondary data available in various
reports related to outputs and outcomes of the CPD were extracted from annual progress reports,
project evaluation reports, monitoring reports in UNICEF’s documents repository. The list of key
documents studied is attached as Annex 4.
1.3.1 Key informant interviews and focus group discussions
8. The ET undertook a total of 113 key informant interviews across different stakeholder groups
and visited six communities in two states (Kassala and South Darfur) where it was able to conduct eight
(8) focus group discussions (FGDs) with various community groups comprising community child
protection committees, parent-teacher associations (PTA), water committees and mothers attending
nutrition centres. A breakdown of the interviews and FGDs is provided in the following Table (Table 1).
A full list is annexed as Annex 5.

1.3.2 Data mapping, triangulation and analysis
9. Throughout the evaluation, data collected from both KIIs and documents were recorded
systematically for evidence assessment based on the judgment criteria against each EQ defined in the
evaluation matrix. A set of keywords based on the judgment criteria was used to classify each piece of
evidence by each team member. This method enabled the ET to trace the pattern in the data and then
cluster these around emerging themes and sub-themes through regular team meetings. The clustering
of data around themes and sub-themes in this manner enabled synthesizing the evidences into findings.
Rigorous data triangulation was done mainly through comparing information gathered through
multiple sources and methods. Where discrepancies occurred that could not be resolved with additional
data gathering, the ET did not use such data for drawing findings or conclusions. The evaluation utilized
three types of triangulation:
• Methods triangulation - both qualitative and quantitative data (interviews, observations,
documents) was used to elucidate complementary aspects of the same subject;
• Data source triangulation – involved examining the consistency of different data sources
(UNICEF internal and external key informants) within the same methods;
• Theory triangulation - which involved using multiple theories to interpret and examine the
data obtained (process tracing).
10. All data from the desk review and individual interview notes were systematically assessed for
their convergence or otherwise to examine their: (i) representativeness – do the data/information
represent the whole or a sizeable picture? (ii) relevance – to the questions in the evaluation matrix; and
(iii) attributability – if the data convey a ‘state’, is it attributable to the intervention/cause being
described? The outliers were not rejected outright and, where relevant, additional data was gathered
for validation. In weighing evidence, the ET imputed higher value to evidence emerging from key
informant interviews and community visits/discussions, and, as far as possible, evidence from
documents were used to supplement primary data for triangulation purposes. Validated data from any
available independent evaluation reports were weighted higher than self-reported progress reports.
11. The analytical methods included assessing contribution of UNICEF in the four areas8 (paragraph
6 above). Interviews/FGDs with a substantial number (over 50 per cent of the total) of external
stakeholders enabled assessing UNICEF contributions against plausible alternative theories. Equity and
gender issues were used to interrogate programme design and implementation, and wherever available,
gender-disaggregated data were examined to see how the rights and needs of beneficiaries were
reflected in the programme design and addressed during implementation.

interventions towards delivery of services, and strengthening the ecosystem at community level.

1.3.3 Evaluation ethics and data protection
12. Protecting personal data is essential in any evaluation so as to respect dignity and ensure
security of all stakeholders involved. The ET ensured full confidentiality of data provided, accessed and
produced during the course of this work, unless information was obtained from sources that are in the
public domain. Any personal data collected has been minimal and anonymized in the report. For
stakeholder interviews (individual interviewees), although their names and title (function/role in an
organization) were collected by the ET for analysis of any trend with regard to information/data
collected, their names or any details are not presented in the report in any way that information
presented can be traced back to an individual interviewee or organization, unless authorized by the
latter in writing, or cited from published documents. The evaluations team followed the UN Evaluation
Group (UNEG, 2020) ethical guidelines throughout the evaluation process. In specific terms, the ET
adhered to the following ethical principles:
i. Principle 1: Informed consent – the ET informed participants the purpose of data
collection and how information and data obtained was to be, processed, shared,
disposed of, prior to obtaining consent.
ii. Principle 2: Avoiding harm – the ET ensured that the basic human rights of individuals
and groups with whom they interacted, as well as their health and safety (risks related
to COVID-19, for example) were protected.
iii. Principle 3: Treatment of participants – during its engagements with the communities,
the ET was mindful of differences in culture, local customs, religious beliefs and
practices, and potential implications of these differences when planning, carrying out
and reporting on the evaluation.
iv. Principle 4: Voluntary participation - participation in the evaluation was voluntary and
free from external pressure - all participants had a right to withdraw from the evaluation
and withdraw any data concerning them at any point without fear of penalty.
v. Principle 5: Ensuring confidentiality – the ET has ensured people’s right to provide
information in confidence, and will ensure that information cannot be traced to its
source, if the latter is an individual. No audio or video recording were used during
interviews.
vi. Principle 6: independence and impartiality of the evaluators - while a participatory
process underpinned the consultant’s engagement with UNICEF staff and other
stakeholders, impartiality and independence were strictly upheld.
1.3.4 Quality assurance
13. Quality assurance was ensured at all stages of the evaluation in terms of data collection and
triangulation, compilation of the preliminary findings and drafting of the report. The TL provided much
of the Quality Assurance (QA) role, with the draft report reviewed by Lattanzio’s QA Adviser.
1.4 Limitations
14. A number of CPD outputs targeted various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of
the federal and state governments on policies, national strategies and action plans, legislation,
institutional framework and capacity development. However, since the coup of October 2021, due to
sensitivities and restrictions from development partners, most collaboration and engagement with
Government at federal and state levels had to be suspended. This limited the ET’s ability to gather data
from some of the key MDAs with which UNICEF has had engagements in the past, particularly at federal
level.9
9 e.g.: No government partner could be interviewed at federal level from the MoE or the NCCW.

1.5. Structure of the report
15. The report is structured into four chapters. Chapter 1 covers the purpose, scope, methodology
and objectives of the evaluation. Chapter 2 covers a brief context analysis and overview of UNICEF
programme, while Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the outcomes and the ET’s assessment against the
evaluation criteria and evaluation questions. The last chapter synthesizes the findings into conclusions
and draws recommendations of the evaluation.

2. The country context and UNICEF programme
2.1 Key elements of the country context
16. Economic deterioration, the COVID-19 pandemic, protracted conflict, and recurrent
floods and droughts have exacerbated the situation of the vulnerable children. From being
recognised as a lower middle-income country in 2019, Sudan regressed back to being in the lower
income category by 2020 due to economic crisis and the global pandemic. In 2019, Sudan ranked 170th
(out of 189) with a human development index (HDI) value of 0.510; however, the inequality-adjusted
HDI amounted to only 0.333,10 which reflects the vast income inequality of the population. Nearly 51
percent of Sudan’s population are aged below 18 mainly due to high population growth at 2.4 per cent
annually.11 The economy is contracting since 2011, with GDP declining from US$ 55.0 billion in 2011 to
US$ 21.3 billion by 2020. COVID-19 preventative measures such as travel restrictions and curfews further
impacted the economy, particularly affecting the urban poor in daily wage-earning employment in the
informal sector. Sudan is experiencing high income poverty in 2022 with an estimated 9.8 million people
– 22 per cent of the population having crisis or worse levels of food insecurity, with 13.6 per cent of
children under five experiencing global acute malnutrition. Due to high and escalating inflation, poverty
significantly increased. The abject poverty rate rose from 9 per cent in 2014 to 38 per cent in 2018, 61
per cent in 2019 and 78 per cent in 2020.12 Child poverty rates have always been higher than that of the
population as a whole in all states - child abject poverty increased from 12 per cent to 46 per cent and
85 per cent in 2014, 2018, and 2020 respectively.13
17. Collapse of the transition process caused a serious setback to the path of development.
The signing of the Juba Peace Agreement in 2019 brought an end to decades of active conflict in parts
of the country following which a series of social and economic reforms ushered in a transformational
change. These reforms initiated by the new government after the ouster of the previous regime
prompted the international community to lift decades-old embargoes, end sanctions and grant Sudan
access to international development funding. The transition process raised high hopes of putting the
country back on a development path after decades of misrule, oppression and multiple conflicts under
the previous regime. This was however short-lived – the coup on 25 October 2021 threatened the
political and economic progress made and created a breakdown of national governance systems.
Protests and civil disobedience efforts by civilians against the coup d’état have been met with violent
responses from military and police and have resulted in numerous casualties, including children.14 The
international donor community put a pause on official development assistance following the collapse
of the transitional government.
18. Low investment in health and poor health infrastructure seriously affects health of the
population. The World Bank data shows that expenditure on health as percentage of GDP has been
steadily declining since 2015 – from a peak of 7.3 per cent, the figure declined to between 4.3 and 4.6
percent during 2018 and 2019 respectively.15 Health services are provided by approximately 6,000 health
facilities from third level hospitals to health units. Many of the facilities are not functional (36 per cent),
or do not offer the basic package of primary health care (24 per cent), which seriously affects the health

of a large portion of the Sudanese population.16 Neonatal mortality rates (28 per 1,000 live births)
accounted for nearly 70 per cent of infant mortality rates (42 per 1,000 live births) and 50 per cent of
under-five deaths (60 per 1,000 live births).17 At least 650,000 children are suffering from severe acute
malnutrition.18 The maternal mortality estimates of 295 per 100,000 live births5 are symptomatic of the
lack of investment in maternal health and nutrition.19
19. The country has witnessed high malnutrition rates among children. Stunting at 36.4 per
cent among under-five children has been stagnant over the past five years and Global Acute
Malnutrition (GAM) rates at 13.6 per cent are below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) public
health emergency threshold.20 According to the 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), Sudan is
experiencing high income poverty with an all-time high 9.8 million people or 22 per cent of the country’s
population acute or crisis-level food insecurity, and with 13.6 per cent of children under five
experiencing GAM.21 It is estimated that 14.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in Sudan
in 2022, 7.8 millions of whom are children. Sudan has over three million internally displaced persons
(IDPs) and is hosting 1.1 million refugees, one of the largest numbers in Africa. These figures are
expected to increase as crises continue in neighbouring countries, especially South Sudan and Ethiopia.
20. Sudan is far from meeting the SDG6.2 target of universal access to safely managed
sanitation.22 Sudan population’s access to domestic basic water supply as per MICS 2014 was 68.0
percent. Access to basic sanitation facilities was 32.9 percent, leaving about 67 percent of Sudan
population without access to sanitation. Only 28.2 per cent of Sudan population has access to both
domestic basic water supply and sanitation facilities.23 Since then there has been some progress with
regard to access to basic drinking water (at 74 per cent), while sanitation coverage remains at 32 per
cent. Over twelve million people still practice open defecation, posing grave public health risks.24
21. Extremely small government budget allocation on education (in 2017 the GoS spent 1.2
per cent of GDP on education; about 11.2 per cent of public expenditure25) keeps the education
infrastructure and quality poor. The scale of unmet needs in education in Sudan is staggering. One
UNICEF press release26 indicates that approximately 6.9 million girls and boys, one in three school-aged
children, do not go to school in Sudan, and a further 12 million have their school years heavily
interrupted by a lack of sufficient teachers, infrastructure, and an enabling learning environment. Often
the running and maintenance of school costs, books and education material are required to be
mobilized by the PTAs through parental direct contributions to schools. These placed a heavy burden
on families.27 The consequence of low investment means that in a context of poverty and economic
hardship, a high number of children are deprived of education because their parents cannot pay school
fees and other contributions. Poor funding of the education system resulting in poor learning

environment and quality of education (curricula and teachers’ qualifications) and education facilities;
parents’ out-of-pocket expenses; social norms; long distances to schools and the social structure of the
population with a high percentage of rural population, nomads and internally displaced persons and
refugees leads to a high number (over 3.5 million) of children being out of school (OOSC).
22. Sudan is among the five countries with the highest prevalence of Female Genital
Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), with 87 per cent of women aged 15-49 years, and 31 per cent of girls
below fourteen years of age having been subjected to this harmful practice. Sudan also ranks high when
it comes to child marriage (34 per cent of girls are married before the age of 18 years, and 12 per cent
of girls are married before the age of 15 years) and lack of birth registration.28
23. Children in conflict-affected areas in Sudan continue to be affected by grave violations
in an unstable political environment and worsening humanitarian situation. The United Nations
verified 520 grave violations against 445 children during the reporting period of January 2020 to
December 2021 committed by the Government security forces as well as armed groups, including killing
(120) and maiming (236), followed by sexual violence and rape; attacks on 21 schools and 11 hospitals
(32 in total) and 10 incidents of denial of humanitarian access.29 The UN report also verified an increase
in cases of recruitment and use of children by armed groups, all in Darfur states. Eighty-six percent of
these recruitments occurred within the four months following the signature of the Juba Peace
Agreement in October 2020.
2.2 UNICEF Sudan country programme
24. The CPD and related programme strategy notes (PSN) provide details of the aims and key
objectives of the country programme (CP) which was initially planned for the period 2018-2021, then
extended to 2023. With an overall initial budget of US$ 241 million,30 the CP aims to contribute to eight
(8) of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and contributes to UNDAF 2018-2022, through the
focus areas related to social services, governance, rule of law and institutional capacity development
and community stabilization. The country programme is expected to utilize US$596.7 million during the
five-year period beginning January 2018 to December 2022 (see Table 4, section 3.3), including
expenditure on emergency operations. The CP is clustered along the following intertwined programme
components:
• Outcome 1: Health and Nutrition
• Outcome 2: Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
• Outcome 3: Education and learning;
• Outcome 4: Child protection;
• Outcome 5: Policy, evidence and social protection
• Outcome 6: Programme Effectiveness.
25. The programme components and related outcomes and outputs are presented below (Box 1),
while the following paragraphs present some remarks on the four sectoral components.
Box 1: CPD Outcomes and outputs, UNICEF Sudan

26. On Outcome 1 - Health and Nutrition, UNICEF’s programme targeted both development of
plans and capacities of government institutions at the federal, state and locality levels to ensure that
the health facilities and service providers at decentralized levels including at community levels had the
capacity to deliver immunization, integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI), basic obstetric
care, new-born care, and nutrition interventions. Annual Reports for the years from 2018 show that
across various states, health system strengthening interventions included providing 85 percent of the
states’ a functional cold chain, solar electrification of 84 PHC facilities,31 and District Health Information
Management System in 18 states equipped with monitoring and data management system.32 UNICEF
provided health centres with essential equipment and strengthened the capacities of midwives. On
nutrition, a new initiative focused on mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) measurement for families
to enhance the ongoing community-level early detection and referral of malnourished children; mothers
of children with SAM received orientation sessions and training in the nutrition centres on using MUAC
tape for screening and how to identify malnourished children, refer them to the OTP centres and
monitor their treatment progress at home.33 UNICEF led the Risk Communication and Community
Exchange (RCCE) initiative of the UN following the COVID-19 which focused on vaccine refusal and
hesitancy, besides enabling the GoS in drafting a national vaccine deployment and RCCE plan.
27. As regards Outcome 2, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), seeking to build capacity of
the MOH34 and Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources (MoIWR) and local authorities and service
providers on sanitation, UNICEF has used a two-pronged approach to address the WASH needs: (a)
elimination of open defecation and scaling up access to basic sanitation by supporting the
implementation of the National Roadmap for the elimination of open defecation; and (b) sustaining and
increasing access to basic water in water-scarce areas. Using community-led-total-sanitation (CLTS)
approach involving multiple partnerships with state, locality, communities and NGOs, UNICEF and
service providers have undertaken sustained advocacy to promote open-defecation-free (ODF) status.
The pace of CLTS accelerated exponentially since the high-level launch in 2019 of the national roadmaps
to make Sudan open-defecation-free. From just around 40 ODF-certified communities per year through
2017, there was a significant increase to 243 and 454 ODF-certified communities in 2018 and 2019
respectively35 which further picked up pace during 2020 - 2022. UNICEF supported the Government of
Sudan (GoS) by building capacities in the use and operationalization of the web-based WASH
Information Management System (IMS), collaborating on the costed roadmap with prioritized
interventions for Sudan’s realization of SDG 6.1, 6.2 and 6.5 targets for reaching everyone with access
to basic water and basic sanitation by 2030.
28. On Outcome 3 – Education and learning - UNICEF focused on improving the quality of
education through support to the development of school curricula and teachers’ training; and providing
access to education for out-of-school-children (OOSC) with a focus on nomadic children, internally

Education (MoE), alternative education where formal education was not available, and launched the
Learning Passport, an e-learning platform36 which aims at allowing children to continue education

throughout the closure of schools, and contributed towards an enabling learning environment through
construction and rehabilitation of schools, classrooms and latrines and alternative learning programme
(ALP) centres.
29. UNICEF also supported the GoS in developing national Education Management Information
System (EMIS) and community-driven parent-teacher associations (PTAs), and contributed towards
improving the quality of education through support to the development of school curricula and teachers
training.
30. The Child Protection (CPr) programme (Outcome 4) aims at strengthening the child
protection system through contributing to legislative reform, policies and strategies; institutional
building of key MDAs, including the National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) and the Ministry of
Welfare and Social Security (MWSS) and strengthening capacities to deliver quality emergency and
long-term specialized child-protection services by social workers, law enforcement and the justice
system. The child protection programme also aimed at setting up Community Based Child Protection
Networks (CBCPN) and supported behaviour change through addressing social norms, focusing
particularly on FGM.
31. The Annual Management Plans (AMPs) offer the CO an opportunity to review its priorities
based on half-yearly or annual review of the programme. While the AMP priorities over the period (Table
2) show consistency in their emphasis on nutrition and health, education (particularly OOSC), and child
protection/safeguarding, evidence generation feature in 2018 and 2021 AMPs, and peacebuilding
appear to have been introduced as priority in the 2020 and 2021 AMP to contribute to UNITAMS core
mandate.

32. As regards the utilization of funds, the following Table (Table 3) shows the actual utilization of
funds under the six programme areas during 2018-2022.37 As can be seen, over 42 per cent of the
budget38 is utilized for health and nutrition which has consistently been the largest component, followed
by WASH, Education and child protection in that order.
37 The figures for 2022 are likely estimated utilization by the end of the year.
38 This Table presents only the funds utilization on programme sectors, and does not include the management and
other costs. Hence the total utilization in this Table adds up to US$547.8 million only, while the overall utilization
including management and overheads is US$596.7 million.

3. Findings of the evaluation
3.1 Coherence
3.1.1 Alignment with national and UN system-wide strategies, plans and priorities
33. The country programme was developed and implemented (until the coup d’état in 2021)
in close collaboration with the GoS to ensure alignment with the priorities defined in Sudan’s
National Strategic Development Plan 2017-2020. It was designed to contribute to all five outcomes of
the UNDAF 2018-2022, particularly the social services outcome, as well as the Multi-Year Humanitarian
Strategy 2017-2019 and the Integrated Strategic Framework for the Darfur.39 All of the basic services
outcomes (H&N, education and learning, WASH, Child protection, social protection) which contribute
to several SDG outcomes were framed and implemented in line with relevant national policies,40 some
of which UNICEF helped develop. While direct engagement with the GoS remains suspended post-coup,
UNICEF continues to deliver its programme in accordance with the integrated UN country team’s
common approach41 which is pivoted on lifesaving humanitarian assistance and life sustaining
interventions throughout Sudan, and programmatic efforts on critical priorities in three areas that span
the humanitarian-development-peace nexus: i) basic services,42 community stabilization and resilience;
ii) protection of civilians, rule of law and human rights; and iii) democratic transition, peace building and
conflict prevention.
34. UNICEF’s health and nutrition outcome (outcome 1) were predicated on an integrated
approach to providing access to basic healthcare, nutrition services and WASH,43 in line with

government policies. Working mainly with the Federal and State Ministry of Health (FMoH/SMoH) and
WHO, the key policies of the GoS that provided the reference point for UNICEF’s programme were: the
national nutrition policy,44 Health Sector Strategic Plan, National Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal and
Child Health Strategy (2016-2020), National Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan for Immunization (2021 -
2025), National Health Sector Recovery and Reform Policy 2021-2024 being the important ones.45
35. The WASH outcome (outcome 2) and related outputs are aligned with the Sudan SDG6
Plan 2019-2030, the GoS’ WASH sector strategic plan and several other related polices and
frameworks which UNICEF was involved in developing or updating.46 Before the coup, close
collaboration was held with the FMoH/SMoH, the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources (MoIWR),
the State Water Corporation SWC (Water and Environmental Sanitation, WES), the MoE, as well as
international and national NGOs and the private sector. Since the coup, active engagement with the
government on policies and their implementation has stopped; technical collaboration at locality level
for delivery of WASH activities at community level, however, continues.
36. The UNICEF education and learning programme (outcome 3) supported the
implementation of sector priorities in the 2018-2022 Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) of
the GoS. The UNICEF Education and learning programme is implemented in partnership with the MoE
and other organizations active in primary and to a limited degree also pre-primary education, and
providing alternative education where formal education is not available. UNICEF supported the MoE to
developed the Girls’ Education Sub-Sector Strategy and to review the Teacher Training Strategy. Sudan
was successfully awarded three main Global Partnership for Education (GPE) grants including the
Programme Implementation Grant and the Accelerated Funding Grants following the approval of the
ESSP 2018/19-2022/23 by the Education Partner’s Group. UNICEF played a lead role through advocacy
and consultation leading to consensus on the financing priorities.47
37. On child protection (outcome 4), working with the NCCW, UNICEF helped revise the
Federal Child Act 2010 to bring it in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).
On key aspects of child protection and other related protection issues (FGM/C), use and recruitment of
children by armed forces and groups, UNICEF worked closely with relevant government departments
and, to a lesser extent, with the integrated mission, UNITAMS, which has the primary mandate on
protection of civilians.
38. The evidence and social protection component (outcome 5) focused on enabling the
government in generating and using data and evidence for development of policy and plans for
adequate public financing of social protection system that ensures multi-sectoral response to acute and
chronic vulnerability facing Sudan’s children and their families. Sudan has had a basic social protection
system comprising the Zakat fund providing a range of benefits to 1.9 million households, besides social
insurance which covers full range of pensions and work injury limited to the formal sector. A national

45 Additionally, UNICEF’s technical support enabled review and updating of several guidelines and policies,
including the national nutrition policy, CMAM operational manuals, national breast-milk substitute (BMS) code,
infant and young child feeding (IYCF) guidelines geared towards women in emergency settings, National New-born
Road Map and Essential Service Package and malaria strategic plan. (UNICEF Sudan, Results Assessment Module

health insurance fund exists with very limited coverage.48 KIIs and UNICEF documents show that
significant progress on partnership, dialogue on social legislative and protection policy developments
were made during the CPD period, working with several other organizations including the Ministry of
Labour, World Bank, UNDP, African Development Bank, International Labour Organization (ILO) who
were part of the Social Protection Working Group. Like in other programmes, engagement with
government however remains suspended, with little clarity about the current government’s priorities
and likely emphasis on social protection.
39. Across all sectors, UNICEF programme’s strong alignment with the GoS priorities and its
good working relationship with relevant GoS Ministries and partners in the basic services sector,
particularly during the existence of the transitional government, enabled it to provide leadership
and co-leadership in sector/cluster49 coordination in nutrition, education, WASH and child
protection. For humanitarian programmes, based on the multi-year interagency humanitarian response
strategy50 and annual humanitarian response plans under the aegis of the Humanitarian Coordinator,
developed in agreement with the GoS, UNICEF has been a key provider. Throughout the CPD, up until
the coup, most of the delivery of humanitarian response has been through the governments at state
and locality levels. In the subsequent period, UNICEF diversified its implementation modalities by
switching from implementation largely through government line ministries to more emphasis on CSO
partnerships and direct cash modalities to frontline workers. This was done by prioritizing programming
at state and locality levels with emphasis on resilience-oriented programmes, while suspending some
of the upstream policy work. KIIs with UNICEF staff suggest that while in the past (pre-coup) over 70
per cent of delivery was done through the GoS apparatus and the rest through NGOs, it has reduced
substantially after the coup. UNICEF now engages with the government through a third-party modality
of cash payment, re-orientating the latter’s role towards monitoring and quality assurance, rather than
direct implementation.51
3.1.2 Alignment with UNICEF strategies
40. The outcomes and partnership approach outlined in the CPD correspond to the UNICEF
Strategic Plan 2018-2021 and the aims outlined in the strategy. At sectoral level, the CPD was
planned to align with UNICEF’s five core goals of its strategic plan,52 namely child survival, education,
child protection, safe and clean environment, and equitable chance in life. At the level of individual
sectors, the sectoral plans reflect priorities and approaches outlined in UNICEF’s global strategies in
respective areas.53 The Protection programme is closely aligned with UNICEF 2008 Global Child
Protection Strategy, along the strategy’s five principal sections,54 following the main approaches for
building a protective environment. UNICEF also makes efforts to integrate humanitarian action and
gender equality. However, gender integration still lacks emphasis on gender-discriminatory roles and

practices, mainstreaming gender in programme design and delivery as well as engaging more with men
and boys, and the need to change social norms to address the root causes of gender-based
discrimination.
41. In line with its Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action (CCC), UNICEF has
been one of the largest humanitarian response agencies in the country, with nearly half of its annual
expenditure (Table 4, Section 3.3) going into humanitarian response during every single year from 2018.
In line with the CCCs which emphasize linking humanitarian response with development, UNICEF has
increasingly been emphasizing programming for resilience at community and locality level through
conflict-sensitive and humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach. In the early part of this CPD
period, the programmes were mostly humanitarian which, following the revolution in late-2018, shifted
to development-oriented programmes that gave space for longer-term programming integrating
resilience at community level in line with UNICEF’s global emphasis on contributing to the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. With the October 2021 coup, as the pendulum swung back to
humanitarian operations and most of the development funding dried up, the nexus approach to build
resilience becomes highly pertinent. The newly launched joint programme with WFP on resilience and
social cohesion is a good beginning. To be implemented in Darfur over a four-year period, it combines
provision of basic services and capacity building at locality and community levels with peacebuilding,
disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.
Key finding
UNICEF programme covering multiple sectors across development and emergency response
demonstrated a high degree of alignment with Government, UN and UNICEF goals and strategies.
Conclusion on coherence
The CPD was closely aligned with government policies, UN system-wide strategies and UNICEF internal
policies and strategies. UNICEF has been able to work in close collaboration with the Government of
Sudan, while playing an active role in sectoral coordination and in the development or updating of
major sector policies and frameworks, till the coup in 2021. Following the coup, a change in overall
programming approach was needed, with UNICEF demonstrating the capacity to focus on active
engagement at locality level quickly and effectively. UNICEF has been able to apply a humanitarian-
development-peace nexus approach and a conflict-sensitive programming, emphasizing resilience at
community and locality level, which becomes even more pertinent after the 2021 coup.
3.2 Relevance
3.2.1 Addressing the most-urgent needs and responding to major changes
42. UNICEF’s programme strategy notes55 and accompanying sectoral strategy documents show
evidence of systematic identification of needs and a prioritization process reflected in Annual
Wok Plans (AWP). The Juba Peace Agreement was followed by a substantial rise in development
funding (as well as humanitarian funding in 2019 for a number of emergencies) which led to UNICEF
scaling up its partnership in order to deliver quality services for vulnerable children. As meeting basic
needs continued to be a priority area for most development partners, UNICEF was able to leverage its
programming capacity at scale. After the establishment of the new transitional government, UNICEF
stepped up its support to the GoS and partners to enhance institutional capacity for delivery of social
protection and social assistance to vulnerable children and families in Sudan. Results of the UNICEF-
supported Simple, Spatial Survey Method (S3M) were endorsed and disseminated by the GoS in July
2019 that helped to determine geographical areas with the highest needs, while enabling better
targeting and programme expansion based on a prioritization approach.
55 UNICEF Sudan, Consolidated Programme Strategy Notes (Internal), 2019

43. Following favourable political environment in the country during 2019-2021, UNICEF thus
assisted the government in prioritizing areas with highest needs including revamping its social
protection programme targeting the most-vulnerable. UNICEF supported the government to review
its flagship cash transfer programme56 so as to improve the accuracy of targeting by introducing a
harmonized approach to determining programme eligibility based on proxy means testing, as well as
the establishment of an integrated beneficiary database.57 The progress made by the Government was
welcomed by all development partners, and institutions like the World Bank, European Union (EU) and
other UN agencies also began engaging with the GoS on social protection for the vulnerable. As part
of this, the capacity building of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and the Poverty Unit of the Ministry
of Social Security and Welfare were supported by UNICEF to enable them to perform child poverty
analysis and child-focused vulnerability analysis for SDG1 monitoring.
44. UNICEF programming in different sectors has been strongly determined by vulnerability
analysis for which it relied on systematic data and studies conducted from time to time. A major
initiative has been to develop a nationwide vulnerability map which identifies the hotspots of child
vulnerability based on multiple criteria and hazard vulnerability through the S3M II carried out in all 18
states of Sudan.58 This, combined with its presence in 12 of the 18 states (through 6 field offices and 6
sub-offices) keeps UNICEF connected on the ground, being able to build local partnerships and
undertake necessary actions that address the most urgent needs. Based on this mapping, UNICEF has
identified 122 priority localities in the country which are multi-dimensionally vulnerable (92), flood and
drought-prone (26) and conflict-prone (4). KIIs with staff showed that there was a good understanding
and uptake of this map in the field offices (FOs) as well as among the NGO partners interviewed. Within
the vulnerability analysis discussed above, the nutrition and WASH programmes have developed further
granular analysis of needs using locality and district level data which when overlaid on the vulnerability
map help identify specific communities within localities for targeting. UNICEF’s programming has thus
been mostly relevant. However, without the active engagement of the GoS some important child
protection issues are likely to remain unaddressed (see effectiveness section).
45. UNICEF’s WASH response sought to bring about transformative and gender-responsive
change through influencing policies, strategies and programmes, particularly prioritizing
cholera/acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) hotspots, water scarce hot spots and areas with high
malnutrition prevalence.59 The strong correlation between poverty rate and open defecation justified
the selection of the targeted states for WASH interventions. This was later confirmed by the vulnerability
map developed by UNICEF during the current programme. While the vast majority of the interviewees
agreed with the selection of targeted states, a minority believes that there are areas within the excluded
states that suffer from similar or worse development conditions than the areas covered by the
programme. So, while the map enables UNICEF to focus on the most-vulnerable communities, there are
pockets of vulnerability outside of these areas/localities where needs might remain unaddressed; and
reaching out to communities in these pockets maybe costly. This is a conundrum UNICEF faces all the
time, for example, in targeting remote and hard-to-reach or inaccessible areas for Extended Programme
of Immunization (EPI) coverage. How UNICEF balances its geographical focus with the scattered unmet
needs in the country will depend on how it links its development arm with the humanitarian arm
internally, and with other partners externally.
46. A strong emphasis on data and evidence-driven policies and programmes in various
sectors backed by support on capacity building to implement these enabled the GoS to prioritize
56 Introduced in 2012 to mitigate the impact of economic and subsidy reforms undertaken following the secession
of South Sudan, the programme, administered by the Commission on Social Safety and Poverty Reduction (CSSPR)
under the Ministry of Labour and Social Development (MOLSD), expanded rapidly in the last several years, reaching
approximately 500,000 households or 7 per cent of all households across Sudan.

some of the key programmes, for example: developing a database for GoS cash transfer/social
protection programme; national baseline assessment of WASH situation in schools; national situation
on OOSC; data from a study of hafirs used in national planning; district level health information system,
among others. While there is no definitive information on the fate of these significant achievements in
the current period, KIIs at state levels suggest that these are being run down for lack of adequate
support from the government or UNICEF and other agencies.
47. UNICEF demonstrated flexibility to respond to major changes in context and various
emergencies, including the COVID-19 during 2020-2022. UNICEF’s emergency preparedness and
response strategy which is part of its humanitarian strategy enables it to provide life-saving services to
population in acute need, including the internally displaced and refugees. This includes leveraging its
cluster lead roles and multiple partnerships with GoS, local authorities, local and international NGOs,
besides other UN agencies. Following the revolution at the end of 2018 as opportunities for significant
scaling up of development interventions in partnership with the transition government emerged from
2019, UNICEF engaged with it on all areas of basic service provision. The CPD period was marked by
UNICEF’s involvement in several major emergencies facing the country. At the beginning of the CPD
period, UNICEF responded at scale to the needs of South Sudanese refugees (2017-2018); the year 2019
witnessed several disasters including outbreaks of cholera which affected children, boys and girls; and
2020-2021 saw the COVID crisis and its aftermath, as well as the Tigray crisis that brought thousands of
children and families as refugees inside Sudan. All of these demanded multi-sectoral emergency
response. Besides meeting urgent humanitarian needs, UNICEF was either leading or involved in a
number of advocacy campaigns on behalf of children as well.
48. The emergence of UNITAMS as an integrated mission with mandate on facilitating the
transition process opened up space for the peacebuilding process to start, though there is a
varied understanding of how programmatic interventions can contribute to peacebuilding.
Several UN agencies including UNICEF began to integrate peacebuilding in their programmes. KIIs with
both internal and external stakeholders showed a varied understanding and interpretation of what this
means for a humanitarian or development agency. Peacebuilding is a loaded term with various
connotations involving service provisions, negotiations, dialogue, arbitration, adjudication,
reconciliation, peacekeeping and governance. All agreed that UNICEF programming cannot be driving
peacebuilding but, while UNITAMS continues to drive
‘UNICEF’s programme cannot be an
peacebuilding, through its programming UNICEF can seek
incentive for peacebuilding, but may

- An external key informant current political context, with clashes over access to land,
water and other resources and reoccurring armed conflict
in the Darfur, Blue Nile State and Kordofan. UNICEF’s emerging focus on resilience at community and
locality level is highly relevant in the current context as while the current impasse with regard to any
development scenario in the country continues, it is likely that donor funding is going to decline, and
most funding may, in foreseeable future, be of humanitarian nature. It is highly likely that Sudan will
remain in a protracted humanitarian scenario, with chronic and acute needs of a vast numbers of people
needing to be addressed.60 Similarly, UNICEF’s targeted cash transfer programmes (MCCT+) linked to
vulnerability-reduction outcomes would become increasingly relevant and their need urgent.
49. With 19 per cent of the population being between 15-24 years of age (UN 2018), and
young people being a driving force in striving for change, a significant gap in UNICEF’s
programme has been a lack of strong focus on youth and adolescents. This is acknowledged in
internal discussions (Mid-Term Review, for example) and KIIs. There is no clear strategy regarding this,
60 As the context section shows, already close to a quarter (22 per cent) of the country’s population are facing acute
food insecurity.
17
though attempt has been made to include them in some of the community groups (for instance, girls’
clubs, community child protection network) and sporadic training and other events, besides their
participation in alternative learning programme (ALP). According to WHO, Sudan has about 20 per cent
of its population who are in the 10-19 years age group,61 and this offers a significantly large target
group for UNICEF’s programme through SBC, health campaigns, social cohesion and community
mobilization. In the past one year the CO has been attempting to develop the office’s capacity in this
regard.
3.2.2 Integration of cross-cutting issues
50. Integration of gender issues has been prioritized in plans, but with limited resources. The
CPD laid strong emphasis on gender equality and gender-sensitive policies, drawing lessons from the
previous CPD cycle. The mid-term review (MTR) and programme strategy notes (2019) highlighted the
need for building staff capacities and promoting staff learning on gender responsiveness and
integration so as to be able to consistently apply a gender lens in programming. “The lack of dedicated
capacity as required under the Gender Action plan negatively impacts meeting Core Commitments to
Children and strategic priorities under the Gender Action Plan GBV Risk Mitigation”, noted the
programme strategy notes.62 KIIs with a number of UNICEF staff confirmed that the situation has not
changed much from the time these observations were made in 2019. Apart from one staff member in
the CO who is expected to give one-fifth of her time on gender issues, there is no other resource the
CO or FOs can draw on. Interviews with staff indicated that the understanding of gender issues and
gender equality has remained largely limited to activities or strategies that focus on girls (e.g., girls’
education, FGM prevention, girls’ clubs, child marriage, WASH in schools, SGBV/GBV, PSEA), and
gender-disaggregated data, but less attention is paid to the inclusion of boys and men in the gender
dialogue, e.g., on GBV, FGM and child marriage. Furthermore, a coherent analysis of the CP through a
gender lens and the development of gender-friendly indicators to align the CP fully with the gender
action plan (GAP) is still outstanding.
51. UNICEF Sudan’s CO management is committed towards the implementation of UNICEF’s
corporate ‘Protection against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse’ (PSEA) obligations63 and has demonstrated
this commitment by training Implementing Partners (IPs) on PSEA in 202164 and by developing a PSEA
Action Plan. All NGO partners are assessed for their PSEA-compliant policies within the organizations.
UNICEF has also ‘nominated’ and trained PSEA advocates in all 12 UNICEF field/sub-offices, most of
them being part of the child protection unit, and developed an internal reporting mechanism, according
to UNICEF CO and FO key informants. The PSEA Advisor worked closely with the education team,
especially in developing a Code of Conduct for teachers, which was piloted in West Kordofan.
Challenges remain in reaching contractors and government with PSEA training and assuring their full
understanding and commitment to UNICEF PSEA standards, in establishing reporting channels, ensuring
that communities have knowledge about these channels, and ensuring that reporting channels are
accessible, trusted and functioning
52. In line with UNICEF guidelines,65 another important thrust has been in integrating
conflict-sensitivity in programme planning and implementation. KIIs with UNICEF staff in FOs
indicate that while there is broad
“We deliver services and capacitate local authorities while an
understanding of the need for conflict-
undercurrent of conflict may be brewing. Then conflict flares

terms. There are capacity issues in some of the FOs which often mean that conflict-sensitivity integration
has been weak in programmes which is now being strengthened. All FOs were trained in tools for
conflict-sensitive programming; KIIs indicate that Darfur FOs are well versed in this through their years
of involvement in this conflict-affected region.
3.2.3 Comparative advantages and leveraging the UN system
53. UNICEF’s long history of working with the government over several decades and its
substantial footprint on the ground through FOs gives it a distinct advantage which is reflected
in: (a) its ability to engage with the government and influence policies, and (b) deliver basic
services at-scale in partnership with multiple actors. UNICEF has extensive partnership with
government at federal (at least, till the 2021 coup) and state levels. All these make UNICEF a preferred
partner for many donor agencies. UNICEF has been the main provider of the cold chain network for EPI
in the country, sole agent for all vaccines delivered to Sudan and major partner for Polio and vit A
supplementation campaign which reached over 8.5 million children in 2021. It is the sole provider for
treatment of (non-complicated) Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) through health centres run by the
Government and NGOs. The number of Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes (OTP) sites increased from
1,478 in 2019 to 1,614 in 2020,66 and 1,838 centres across Sudan in 2022.67 This represents about 36 per
cent of existing health centres in the country. Data from Annual Reports show that over 2.8 million
people were provided access to drinking water between 2018 and 2021, and over a million people
gained access to basic sanitation, besides over 450 schools and health facilities being provided with
water facilities. Similarly in education and learning, it is the largest provider of education materials and
school constructions/repairs. For example, in Kassala, UNICEF is the primary and largest supporter of
education in the state, supporting 100 schools, while the second largest agency supports only 24
schools.68 In South Darfur UNICEF works across the state while other partners like ZOA, World Vision
International, World Food Programme (WFP), Save the Children work in a limited number of localities;
UNICEF has built or rehabilitated a large number of schools and runs Alternative Learning Programme
(ALP) centres on a similar scale. There is a good brand recognition of UNICEF at community level as
well.
54. UNICEF’s ability to undertake evidence-based advocacy on major policy issues building
on its work on the ground is another distinctive strength which enables it to work at both policy
and delivery ends. Together with WHO, UNICEF successfully advocated for the government to
contribute to fill the funding gap for vaccinations – a 2016 Agreement with the GoS laid down that the
latter will cover at least 45 per cent of the cost of vaccinations by 2019.69 In the following year, despite
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the GoS filled a funding gap of $5.6 million for the nationwide
polio vaccination and mass long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN) distribution campaigns. KIIs with
UNICEF staff however confirmed that since 2021 as the GoS contribution has stopped due to economic
crisis and political turmoil in the country, UNICEF has been bearing the full cost of the vaccines and
maintaining the pipeline for the ready-to-use-therapeutic-food (RUTF) used in treatment of severe
acute malnutrition (non-complicated). The Sanitation Road Map developed and issued by the MoH with
UNICEF support represents a high level of political commitment (it was declared by the Prime Minister
in a launch event attended by nine ministers). Also, UNICEF’s consistent advocacy over the past several
years, in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and WHO, led to the adoption
of Article 141 of the amendment to the Criminal Act which criminalizes FGM/C in Sudan, and a roadmap
for its implementation was also developed. The sustained advocacy at federal and state levels led to
adoption of an ODF roadmap. These are some of the examples of UNICEF’s successful advocacy linking

its work on the ground with national policies. The willingness to provide practical support in delivery of
services as well as back its advocacy work with well-researched data were key contributory factors in its
advocacy successes.
55. UNICEF has leveraged strategic partnerships with several UN and related international
agencies over the years to ensure synergy and complementarity in programmes and advocacy
with government. Besides strategic partnership with WHO on health and nutrition, UNICEF has a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with WFP on nutrition in Sudan which covers all areas of
complementary nutrition programming. There is also broader coordination on nutrition among UN
agencies through UN Nutrition Sudan, a network of the SUN Movement, which is chaired by UNICEF.
Both UNICEF and WFP have now (2022) launched a new joint programme to strengthen resilience and
social cohesion in Darfur. Funded (US$ 100 million over four years) by the German Federal Ministry for
Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) through the KfW German Development Bank, the
programme aims to provide durable solutions to nearly 300,000 people affected by multiple shocks
related to conflict, climate change, natural disasters, and economic downturns. A strategic partnership
with UN Population Fund (UNFPA) on FGM/C and PSEA is another key alliance that helped in advocacy
as well in operationalizing actions on the ground to scale up and accelerate efforts to reduce FGM/C
prevalence in Sudan through the Saleema Initiative. UNICEF also contributed to other UN joint
programmes, including rule of law project with UNDP, protection of children on the move with UNHCR
and UNFPA, scaling up birth registration and GBV interventions.70 The UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO Sudan Free
of FGM Initiative Phase 2, funded by the UK Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office and Canada,
as well as the joint programme UNFPA-UNICEF against FGM have been implemented. UNICEF plays a
key role in various interagency processes through the integrated mission: for instance, it currently co-
leads the Integrated Programme Management Team (IPMT) which seeks to harmonize programming
by all UN agencies. As coordinating agency, UNICEF supported Sudan’s successful applications to two
GPE main grants and multiplier funding; UNICEF served as the communication link between GPE
partners, i.e., the government, GPE Secretariat, World Bank, and education coordination group which
included donors, UN agencies and civil society organizations. Partnership with multiple agencies
including the World Bank, European Union and Economic Policy Research Institute (EPRI) on social
protection policies and programmes made significant progress prior to the October 2021 coup.
Key findings
UNICEF programming in different sectors has been strongly determined by vulnerability analysis for
which it relied on systematic data and studies from time to time. Development of a nationwide
vulnerability map, combined with its extensive field presence give UNICEF the capacity to undertake at-
scale programming targeted at the vulnerable.
In its work with the government, following favourable political environment in the country during 2019-
2021, UNICEF assisted the government on revamping the social protection programme targeting the
most vulnerable.
The current political context renders much of the progress made with regard to vulnerability-focused
government policies and programmes redundant, at least in the foreseeable future. While UNICEF can
ensure continuity of some of the basic services through working with NGOs, civil society and local
officials, a number of issues are likely to remain unaddressed without the active engagement of the GoS
(see Effectiveness section).
UNICEF demonstrated flexibility in responding to major changes in context and various emergencies,
including the COVID during 2020-2021.

UNICEF programming has laid emphasis on cross-cutting issues of gender and conflict-sensitivity,
though little attention to the inclusion of boys and men has been given. The limited resources devoted
to the integration of gender is also an important negative element.
UNICEF’s comparative advantage lies in: (a) its ability to engage with the government and influence
policies building on its work on the ground, and (b) deliver basic services at-scale in partnership with
multiple actors.
The integrated mission opened space for engagement on peacebuilding process to start. Field staff
need greater clarity on precise role of UNICEF in peacebuilding.
UNICEF has leveraged strategic partnerships with several UN agencies over the years to ensure synergy
and complementarity in programmes and advocacy with government.
Conclusions on relevance
1. UNICEF’s strong focus on vulnerability and multi-sectoral programming capacity leveraging multiple
partnerships make UNICEF’s programming remain relevant in the current context of political uncertainty
and economic hardships faced by people. Given the urgency of key child rights issues, UNICEF’s role in
advocacy with government and other international institutions assumes high criticality at this juncture.
2. While UNITAMS continues to play a leading role in peacebuilding, UNICEF’s programmatic relevance
remains anchored in addressing vulnerability through providing basic services in a way that strengthens
community resilience and social cohesion through addressing underlying drivers of social exclusion and
conflicts, and this may – in turn - contribute to peacebuilding.
3. Mainstreaming of gender and promotion of gender equality have been prioritized in plans, but
specific attention to inclusion of boys and men in the gender dialogue (e.g., on GBV, FMG and child
marriage girls education, management of menstrual hygiene, adolescents health and nutrition, youth
empowerment) as well as the inclusion of standard indicators related to gender action plan (GAP)
together with the additional financial and human resources allocated to gender responsiveness and
integration would be beneficial.
3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Use of resources and workflow process
56. UNICEF’s extensive footprint through its six FOs and six sub-offices covering the hotspots
of chronic vulnerability, conflict and displacement enables it to rapidly respond to emerging
urgent needs. While this evaluation did not critically examine the rationale for locating the offices
where they are, these locations have a significant presence of other humanitarian organizations
including several UN agencies. More substantially, it is clear that extensive field presence has enabled
timely delivery and facilitated outreach. Operating from these bases has enabled UNICEF to access some
of the hard-to-reach areas and pockets of high vulnerability.
57. The precipitous collapse of the transition government and concomitant changes in
programming strategy brought challenges which UNICEF, like all other agencies, has been navigating
through. Due to this changed context and the restrictions regarding working with the GoS, UNICEF had
to change its mode of delivery, seeking new partnerships and strengthening existing partnerships with
CSOs. Thanks to its pre-existing partnership with several national and international NGOs which were
implementing partners in emergency response in the past, UNICEF was able to make a rapid change in
its implementation modality in late-2021 when it became clear that engagement with the new
government was going to be challenging. At the local level, facilitated by its extensive field presence,
21
UNICEF has been engaging with locality functionaries like health officials, water departments and social
workers to ensure that delivery of basic services to communities is not disrupted.
58. In terms of staffing, UNICEF has grown significantly in the past three years showing the capacity
to reflect the expanded programme delivery. As the programme funding increased after 2018, from US$
80 million to US$ 109-126 million (Table 4) during the years 2019-2021, UNICEF had to ratchet up its
staff and overall management capacity. The increased scale of programme delivery during 2020 in
response to COVID-19 pandemic besides other emergency responses created an increased demand for
operational support. This necessitated increasing the capacity of operations team at Khartoum and Field
offices level.71

59. The workflow process involving partnership with NGOs remains cumbersome and
delivery costs higher than delivering through government, which raises questions over the viability of
this modus operandi. UNICEF’s programme delivery had been largely (over 70 per cent) through
government partners before the 2021 October coup. According to UNICEF staff in CO and FOs, working
through the government agencies kept the costs of delivery low for two reasons: (a) salaries and most
of the administrative / overhead costs were covered by the government, and (b) transport for moving
supplies from warehouses to localities were usually borne by the government agencies. However, with
the government route now almost closed, most of the delivery is made through NGOs,73 with all
associated direct and indirect costs having to be provided for. Additionally, implementation through
government agencies is often faster as UNICEF already will have an Annual Work Plan (AWP) agreed in
advance which made release of funds from UNICEF faster. However, in case of NGOs, UNICEF must put
in place project documents (PD) each time a grant is awarded to them, and this takes time. According
to all NGOs and FOs interviewed during this evaluation, the PD process can take anything from 5-7
months, with emergency grants taking substantially less time. The process involves having clearance
from the government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) at both state and federal levels. Once
formal approval is received, the price quotations used in the original application often will have
71 The number of staff members grew from 259 in 2020 to 284 in 2021;71 in 2020 alone, 109 consultants were hired
beside 44 extensions requests for contracts issued in 2019.71 The 2021 Annual Management Plan (AMP) shows
evidence of a rapid assessment of staffing and skills gaps following which certain staff positions were filled in
priority programme areas. During 2022, the CO’s financial resources went up by over 50 per cent compared to the
previous year, and the total workforce stood at 425, with a third of this number comprising short-term
consultants/temporary staff. Whether or not these significant increases in workforce which included substantial ad
hoc/short-term recruitments were justified is a subject of another study - the CO is currently undertaking a
comprehensive workforce review including its staffing and field office structure. (Data taken from UNICEF Sudan,

73 As mentioned previously, all engagement with government is now only through a third-party modality of cash

22
escalated significantly, requiring another round of negotiation with UNICEF. With more than half of the
annual grant duration gone in the process, NGOs then find less than 5-7 months remaining for
implementation.74 The increasing cost and time factors involved in UNICEF’s delivery through NGOs
raises questions about long-term viability of this modus operandi. There is however another side to the
argument that NGOs often are able to deliver better quality as they work closely with communities.
60. Specifically on Child Protection, about 70 per cent of the CPr budget was dedicated to
governmental Implementing Partners (IP).75 Partnerships with INGOs and NGOs were few and only
increased slowly following the October 2021 coup. The delays in developing new partnerships with non-
governmental IPs was mainly due to the delays in the finalization of PDs and can partly be attributed to
the lack of capacities and expertise.
61. UNICEF relies on local supply for SAM treatment products, and this makes it time and
cost-effective. UNICEF Sudan CO is the main procuring agency for RUTF for SAM treatment in Sudan.
It procures the commodities either directly from a local manufacturer, Samil, or through UNICEF Supply
Division from international suppliers. Currently, Samil is responsible for the production and supply of
almost half of the quantity of RUTF consumed in the country (capacity limitations do not permit a higher
percentage). Considering the high efficiency of relying on local suppliers, UNICEF has explored another
potential domestic supplier which however has not passed the stringent quality checks and
procurement requirements so far.
3.3.2 Programme strategies
62. The country programme was operationalized through several key strategies by the CO,
namely:76 strengthen institutional capacity; policy advocacy; development of models for replication;
communication-for-development (C4D)/SBC; evidence generation and analysis; strengthen and
diversify shared value partnerships; UN working together; innovations; and private sector partnerships.
63. UNICEF’s investment in strengthening institutional capacity of the GoS at both federal
and state levels as well as policy advocacy enabled significant expansion of the GoS’ outreach
capacity to deliver at scale. This paid off well in terms of results in all areas where GoS had strong
ownership. Despite being low on resources and weak on overall governance, GoS had put in place a
fledgling welfare and basic service system providing healthcare, nutrition, education, water and
sanitation, as well as some form of social protection to a limited number of vulnerable families
throughout the country. UNICEF’s support to the Commission on Social Safety Net and Poverty
Reduction (CSSPR)77 which is in charge of implementing the government’s flagship programmes,
Shamel, the national cash transfer scheme and the National Pension and Social Insurance Fund,78 paved
the way for streamlining government’s social protection programme (social protection section).
74 In this regard, UNICEF internal document (RAM 2021) however indicates that the work process with regard to
PDs has improved and 84.4 per cent of the PDs were approved within UNICEF’s global benchmark of 45 days. The
anomaly may be arising due to the fact that while NGOs measure the time-frame from the time of first application
through to the final approval with revisions where required, UNICEF CO may be using a different point of reference
to the timeline.

77 Many governmental and non-governmental actors are involved in the Sudanese social policy scheme, most
importantly: the Zakat Fund, which is the most comprehensive source of social protection in Sudan, reaching up
to 3.7 million Sudanese families (as of 2018); and the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) which is the main
health insurance provider.
23
64. Partnership with government, UN agencies (see relevance section) and NGOs has been a
key strategy in programme implementation as this enabled leveraging government’s unique role
in delivery of basic services through policies and direct action across the country enabling timely
delivery. Partnership with NGOs remained a critical implementation modality for nutrition, sanitation
and hygiene interventions, with the involvement of the SMOH at locality level as the NGOs were able
to strengthen the community participation element of the programme. In most states, NGO partners
implemented the community-led-total-sanitation (CLTS) activities while the state Ministry of Health
conducted monitoring, verification and certification of ODF status. During emergency responses, quick
partnership with national NGOs enabled UNICEF to provide much needed sanitation and hygiene
response in a short time; for instance, with Al-Twaki in Tigray Refugee response and with Peace Lights
for Rural Development in Geneina IDP camp.79 Working through local authorities and other partners,
the UNICEF public health emergency (PHE) prevention, preparedness and response plan focuses on risk-
based programming using a three-pronged approach: a) prevention of outbreaks, b) preparedness for
potential outbreak, and c) supporting the response to control the outbreak.
65. UNICEF has started to engage with the private sector, exploring the involvement of construction
sector in supporting the GoS in the construction of schools; providing facilities and other resources to
early child education (ECE) for their employees/workers/communities where they operate; supporting
school feeding schemes; supporting supplies in WASH, for instance. However, due to the current
political and economic context, private sector engagement is yet to take off in any significant way.
66. All these strategies have helped UNICEF reach a large number of vulnerable children with
responses in different sectors. While UNICEF reports show the number of children/people it has
reached with specific interventions, to make a comparison of its reach against total needs and/or
response by all development and humanitarian agencies in the country, the ET used HRP reports and
Cluster/sector reports for the years 2018-2022 (See Annex 6). This comparison (where comparable
figures were available) shows that UNICEF has consistently been reaching out to the largest proportion
of children targeted/reached by all agencies reporting to the Clusters in several areas, namely:
• Provided 53 (2020) to 96 per cent (2018) of total nationwide SAM treatment to 6-59
months old children; UNICEF and its partners screened on an average 3.5 mn (2020) to 4.5
mn (2019) and 5.8 mn (2021) children for malnutrition
• Measles vaccination for under-1 and IMCI access provided for u-5: 27-37 per cent of
children targeted by the entire sector covered by UNICEF and its partners
• On education and learning, some 14 to 71 per cent targeted children received support on
education materials and financial assistance from UNICEF
• At least 25 to 53 per cent of people in need of basic drinking water and sanitation were
being reached by UNICEF during various years.
Key findings
UNICEF’s extensive footprint has enabled UNICEF to rapidly respond to emerging urgent needs and has
facilitated outreach.
UNICEF has managed the transition in its mode of delivery well, switching from government partners
to NGOs following the 2021 coup. However, the workflow process involving partnership with NGOs
remains cumbersome and delivery costs higher than delivering through government which raises
questions over the viability of this modus operandi if the current impasse vis-à-vis engagement with
government continues.
UNICEF’s efforts in strengthening the institutional capacity of the GoS at all levels and its partnerships
have enabled the GoS’ outreach capacity and role in delivery of basic services.

Conclusion on efficiency
As engagement with the current government remains partially suspended at federal and state levels, it
is unclear if any of the outputs from the programme will be continued into the future. In this scenario,
continued engagement with the government at state and locality levels which UNICEF continues to
pursue remains crucial for effective delivery of basic services in health, nutrition, education, WASH, child
protection, and social protection, along with engagement with NGOs, for efficient delivery of services
in foreseeable future.
3.4 Effectiveness
67. UNICEF’s multi-sectoral programme has continued to deliver outcomes for vulnerable children
as per its intended objectives, despite setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the coup. A
comparison of progress reported in annual reports and Results Assessment Modules (RAM) for different
years (Table 5) shows that the programme exceeded the targets on at least four key indicators
(highlighted in green), while in others the achievements showed either some improvement over the
baseline or slight deterioration (highlighted in grey). In general, weak leadership, low investment and
lack of capacity within the government system largely contributed to below results where they occurred.
In the following subsections, each outcome area of the country programme is discussed in detail.

3.4.1 Programme outputs and their contributions to outcomes
3.4.1.1 Outcome 1 - Health & Nutrition
68. Overall, the evaluation findings below show that results on this outcome area are mixed.
Efforts towards revitalization of health centres have proven to be effective, and the outputs on
Health and Nutrition related to policy development and capacity building at national,
subnational and locality levels showed signs of realising the intended objectives. However, the
progress made so far is challenged by the political uncertainties in the country since late 2021. A
number of Indicators of both health and nutrition further show a critical and deteriorating situation.
Despite UNICEF’s contribution to improvements in early detection and treatment, the malnutrition
situation in the country has for example stagnated (or even worsened in some years of the CPD) in the
last three decades due to a complex range of factors underpinned by high levels of food insecurity and
poverty, exacerbated by the economic crisis, inflation and high food prices, protracted conflict, internal
displacements, climatic shocks (drought and floods), harmful social norms and cultural practices. The
same has happened in two other key health areas: measles vaccination and live-births attended by
health professional. Government absence, lack of resources and weak capacity in the health system are
mainly responsible for this.
69. UNICEF was instrumental in strengthening national and state-level government capacity
and policy framework through support to the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement by bringing
together multiple agencies to work in a coordinated manner and develop the SUN Roadmap for 2021-
25 and the Nutrition for Growth commitments and develop a National Multisectoral Nutrition Plan. KIIs
with government officials confirmed the critical role played by UNICEF in partnership with FAO, UNHCR,
UNFPA, WFP and WHO in the nutrition programme which remains heavily donor-dependent.
70. UNICEF built capacity of the FMoH on planning, implementation and monitoring as well
as undertaking periodic reviews of health and nutrition programmes and in helping develop
national guidelines for continuity of lifesaving services during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to
various policies and other guidelines. The FMoH was capacitated to adopt the Simple Spatial Survey
Method (S3M II)80 for data collection in order to build robust evidence-base for policies and plans.

months, obtaining vital data on nutrition programme, for instance, from the health authorities has been
challenging, ostensibly because of lack of federal funding for the downstream health system.
71. UNICEF began revitalizing health centres through provision of essential equipment,
building up the capacities of midwives who have now come to play a crucial role in functioning of
the health centres and in promoting community awareness. This has created a stronger interface
between local health officials and communities which has been a key facilitating factor in responding
to the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative has considerably improved access to basic health care, as was
testified by patient groups and health centre staff during field visits for this evaluation. Midwives who
have been trained by UNICEF play an important role

besides regular support through UNICEF’s programme on nutrition, vaccination and strengthening of

getting the state health system prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic.82 UNICEF’s emphasis on

hand-washing) have been vital in fighting both malaria and COVID-19 in the state. In both Kassala and
South Darfur, the ET visits to health centres showed that UNICEF had integrated WASH in these centres.
The health promoters at the health centres and community health workers undertake home visits and
community awareness and hygiene education activities.
72. On nutrition, learning from an evaluation of the Community Management of Acute
Malnutrition (CMAM) in 2019, the community dimension of the programme has been
strengthened which is helping in early detection and treatment. During the field visits to the two
states, the ET interviewed a number of mothers who were trained in MUAC and are using their
knowledge in monitoring the nutrition situation with regard to their own children as well as those of
neighbours and relatives. This was reinforced by periodic visits from CHWs and health promoters in
some states, according to key informants. In Kassala and South Darfur (states visited by the ET) UNICEF
carried out, in cooperation with NGOs, training of community volunteers on child health issues. The
early detection made possible through enhanced community mobilization is already having a positive
effect - new admissions in treatment programmes, OTP and Targeted Supplementary Feeding
Programme (TSFP) indicated higher admissions in 2021 by 13 and 60 per cent respectively compared
to 2020.
73. A challenge in the continuum of care in the CMAM programme is that, of the 1,838 OTP centres,
only 1,273 facilities are supported by WFP for SFP to treat Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). The
consequence of this gap is that in centres not covered by SFP, children diagnosed with MAM either
rapidly slip into the SAM category or parents have to share the RUTF meant for a severely malnourished
with moderately malnourished siblings. UNICEF signed a LOU with WFP in 2018 seeking integration of
SAM and MAM and since then geographical convergence has increased significantly, although it is still
a work in progress.
82 UNICEF in partnership with WHO and FMOH developed the national Multi Hazard Preparedness and Response
Plan 2022 and COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan ensuring COVID vaccination nationwide with
strengthened cold chain system. Through 9 campaigns in 18 states, COVID-19 vaccines were administered to 11.7
million individuals with at least one dose (RAM Report 2022)
27
74. Malnutrition situation in the country however has not shown much improvement and has
nearly stagnated or worsened compared to what it was three decades ago.83 The SAM treatment
has not yet been fully integrated in the national health system. UNICEF’s Annual Report for 2019 noted
that the stabilization centres (for complicated SAM cases) within hospitals are regarded as ‘external’ -
run by UNICEF or NGOs – affecting quality of in-patient care.84 KIIs with UNICEF health staff indicated
that this still remains a challenge in most hospital-based stabilization centres and government
ownership is non-existent. Inadequate provision of key services like early detection and management
of wasting and structures to deliver the CMAM programme85 remain weak, with inadequate human
resources, monitoring and reporting systems. The supply of RUTF and related commodities is mostly
managed through a supply chain run by UNICEF,86 and the CMAM programme relies mainly on funding
from humanitarian donors, with little or no contribution from the government. This underinvestment
has meant that while the life-saving interventions of humanitarian agencies cover the most critical
hotspots, overall malnutrition situation in the country has not shown any improvement in the past three
decades, and has worsened - the number of children who are stunted and wasted has actually increased
since 1987.87 There are a wide range of factors contributing to malnutrition in Sudan – a combination
of poor diets, high prevalence of co-morbidities (malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory infections among
children under five years), limited access to basic health, WASH and social protection services and
suboptimal nutrition practices.
75. Despite substantial progress made in several areas of basic health, at the national level
the situation has deteriorated in two key areas, notably measles vaccination coverage and live-
births attended by skilled personnel, as the Table (Table 6) below shows. According to UNICEF, the
reduction in live-birth attendance reflects overall decline in health services in the country since 2014
due to political instability, movement restrictions and disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Besides this, on
live-births attended by skilled health personnel, the baseline set was based on a population survey
(Sudan MICS 2014) because of the unavailability of reliable programme data, while the reported figure
is an extrapolated value using data from various sources. The decline in measles vaccination coverage
is attributable to several factors, apart from the political instability during most of 2014-2021: (a) the
same EPI teams managing competing priorities including COVID-19 vaccination; (b) delayed release of
GAVI funding to the states for the first half of 2021; (c) delayed and fragmented quarterly vaccine
delivery to the states; and (d) high staff turnover among mid-level (managerial) EPI staff. In 2021 alone,
the number of children dropping out of the EPI increased by 8 per cent, and coverage of measles vaccine
dropped to a critical 67 per cent with over a thousand suspected cases and 18 deaths reported across
the country by mid-October 2021.88 The following Table shows the progress made on key indicators of
the health and nutrition outcome.

Key findings on health and nutrition
The entire nutrition sector is dependent on UNICEF support which continues to be the largest provider
in the areas of CMAM, now covering more than a third of the country’s health centres, with the
community mobilization dimension of the programme having been strengthened during the CPD
period.
With only two-thirds of the OTP centres linked to supplementary feeding programme, the efficacy of
SAM treatment is often compromised as the RUTF meant for severely malnourished is shared with other
children the family.
Working with local health officials, revitalization of health centres has been a crucial intervention in
improving access to basic healthcare, though UNICEF has so far covered a small proportion of the need.
Strong emphasis laid on integrating social behaviour and practice changes with regard to public health
issues through local health structures is creating good level of awareness among communities.
Despite substantial progress made in several areas of basic health and nutrition, at the national level
the situation has deteriorated in three key areas, notably measles vaccination coverage, live-births
attended by skilled personnel and malnutrition among children due to high co-morbidities and weak
capacity of the country’s health system.
3.4.1.2 Outcome 2 - WASH
76. Aggregate data at the national level shows that considerable progress has been made in
providing water to the population and the evaluation found that UNICEF’s interventions on providing
access to water, especially to crisis-affected populations, have been effective in reducing
mortality rates. However, sanitation interventions and the key objective of ODF programme
nationally are showing mixed results.
77. UNICEF had a unique contribution in building national capacity on sanitation which
otherwise remains neglected.90 UNICEF has generated good data and evidence-base on sanitation
and drinking water situation in the country and used these to enable the GoS to develop several plans,
policies and roadmaps, including the important National Water Supply Transformation Strategic Plan,
90 Key informants
29
2021 – 2031.91 At the same time, close to 1,500 communities92 have been certified OD-free up to the
end of 2021 and another 510 added to this category at the end of 2022, contributing to “more children
and their families (are) living in an open-defecation-free environment”. Despite this progress, the
aggregate data (Table 7 below) on the practice of open defecation nationwide showed a slight increase
during the years 2018-2021, with some decline in 2022 as per the data provided in the Results
Assessment Modules (RAM) for various years. This may be due to lack of comparable data sets; the
MICS 2014 put the percentage of the population practising open defecation at 29 per cent.93 However,
the results of the S3M II in 201894 showed the corresponding figure to be 33 per cent95 (rural: 45 per
cent, urban 11 per cent). The lack of government leadership and budget allocation for scaling up
implementation of ODF roadmaps was a key reason for limited progress.96 As for hand washing as a
main indicator for hygiene practices, as per MICS 2014, only 26 per cent had a location with water and
soap to wash their hands,97 and this may have increased slightly98 during 2020-2022 owing to SBC and
hygiene messaging campaigns linked to COVID-19.

78. The water supply and providing access to safe water part of the WASH programme has
had relatively better success compared to the sanitation interventions. A review of the achievements
reported in Annual Reports for various years show that, with the exception of water supply in health
centres, UNICEF exceeded the planned targets on all parameters like: number of people accessing a
basic sustainable drinking water source; number of schools with access to improved drinking water;
91 Other key policies and roadmaps developed in this regard were: Sudan Sustainable Development Goal Six (SDG6)
Plan (Clean Water and Sanitation), 2019 (as well as 18 state plans); The updated National Roadmap: Sanitation for
all in Sudan (making Sudan Open Defecation Free by 2022); The Strategy for Sustainable Operation and

number of people in humanitarian situations with water disinfection. As the data in Annex 6 shows,
UNICEF provided over 3 million crisis-affected people access to drinking water each year during 2020
and 2022; in addition, to another half a million to 939,000 (2022) persons in non-emergency situations
provided access to basic drinking water.
79. UNICEF’s emergency WASH interventions at scale contributed to dramatic reduction of
major cholera epidemic that affected mainly the Blue Nile and Sennar states in 2019. Data from
Annual Reports show that over 3 million people were provided access to drinking water between 2018
and 2022, and over a million people gained access to basic sanitation, besides over 450 schools and
health facilities being provided with water facilities. The year 2019 saw exceptionally high torrential rains
and floods, and multiple disease outbreaks. Significant number of cholera cases were reported in later
part of 2019 from Blue Nile and Sennar; with UNICEF support the MOH was able to contain the outbreak
to 346 cases and 11 deaths compared to a similar outbreak in 2016 in Blue Nile where more than 2,358
cases were reported, with 78 deaths from September 2016 to November 2017. With UNICEF support,
around 1.4 million cholera affected/at risk population in the most endemic areas were provided with
disinfected water at their existing water sources and reached with focused hygiene promotion
interventions.99 Report shows that engagement of community volunteers (youth groups) in the cholera
and flood response, water chlorination and C4D-focused hygiene promotion activities contributed to
controlling the outbreak with low-cost and effective interventions.100
80. Water interventions are being increasingly used by UNICEF and NGO partners as entry
point in conflict-affected communities. UNICEF (and partners) has been moving towards providing
long-term water solutions in communities; in conflict-affected communities it uses water as an entry
point ensuring that these benefitted all affected communities - boreholes, for example, are developed
along migration routes and host communities are involved in maintenance of these. As access to water
is often one of the triggers for local conflicts, using water interventions help bring different communities
together for a common purpose. One NGO partner operating in Jebel Marah, which is a rebel-controlled
area, ensures that its water-related interventions benefit IDPs, refugees, host communities and
nomadic/pastoralist population. This is a good example of how UNICEF can include activities that
contribute towards local peace building and social cohesion.
81. There have been quality and maintenance issues about the toilets provided. UNICEF
assisted construction of individual household
toilets in several states. In West Darfur, UNICEF “PTAs take responsibility for maintenance of school
constructed “several thousand toilets” over the WASH. Not all schools have been covered by WASH
past four years, according to one key informant, facility. But of those covered, one-third is able to

maintenance. About a third of the school toilets lack

to enable IDPs to return to their places of origin.
member
Data collected during field work suggest that besides lack of water in a large number of cases, the
quality of construction has been poor and hence the toilets become dysfunctional after a few months
or a year. UNICEF is unable to monitor the status of the toilets constructed. Even in schools where toilets
are provided, the situation is often the same – poor construction and lack of water, as was seen in South
Darfur in one school visited by the ET. UNICEF staff confirm that not all schools in Darfur have been
provided WASH facilities, but of those provided, only a third of the structures are in functioning
condition or are being maintained. However, there is no systematic data compiled in this regard to
monitor the situation. Reliance on a supply-driven approach to delivery usually marks most of the
implementation, with focus remaining on delivery of an activity or input, “then moving on” (KII).
Although schools, health centres and public latrines have to follow technical standards that stipulate
providing handwashing facilities attached to the toilets, not all toilets have an integrated or even nearby
hand-washing basin, the ET’s observations from field visits showed. According to several key informants
99 UNICEF Sudan, Results Assessment Module (RAM) 2019, undated
100 UNICEF Sudan, Results Assessment Module (RAM) 2019, undated
31
and sanitation committees, people need to be persuaded to see the need for sanitation as they (men)
don’t usually recognise the need for it. This requires extensive C4D. Furthermore, if targets are to be
achieved at household level, beneficiaries have to bear the cost; given the economic hardship people
are going through, sanitation is hardly a priority. Sanitation infrastructure is hard to maintain and
difficult to get buy in from highly-vulnerable communities.
Another related area is the provision of WASH in schools. The Ministry of Education, with UNICEF’s
support, conducted an assessment in all the 18 states for WASH in schools covering more than 1,100
schools. The assessment revealed huge gaps in access to basic water (45.5 per cent) and sanitation
(50.8 per cent) and wide disparities in access among states, urban and rural arears, and girls’, boys’ and
mixed schools; almost 71 per cent101 of schools did not have any handwashing facility. Facilities for
menstrual hygiene management were seriously lacking, with private washing space for girls and disposal
bins in latrines for girls in just about 13.6 and 17.1 per cent of schools respectively.102
Key findings on WASH
The pace of CLTS accelerated since the launch in 2019 of the national roadmaps to make Sudan open
defecation-free, and currently nearly 2,000 communities are certified OD-free. Available nationwide data
however reflects only a slight reduction in OD practice between 2014 and 2022.
UNICEF’s emergency WASH interventions enabled minimising loss of lives during epidemics.
Operating at scale in both development and emergency settings, UNICEF’s water interventions in
particular are increasingly being geared to foster social cohesion among conflict-affected communities
through an inclusive process of targeting and community ownership.
Quality control of the WASH structures and their monitoring have generally been weak, besides
sanitation facilities often having inadequate access to water sources, reflecting a predominantly supply-
driven approach in implementation.
3.4.1.3 Outcome 3 – Education and learning
82. In terms of overall outcome on education, national level data (Table 8) shows a small
increase in gross enrolment rate but a substantial reduction in primary education completion rate
between 2015 and 2022 because of increasing economic hardships faced by people as well as school
closures due to political unrest and COVID-19.

83. UNICEF contributed towards enhancing the governance capacity of the MoE, innovatively
supported learning opportunities for OOSC and children who are hard to reach, supported girls’
education and contributed towards improved quality of education and an enabling learning
environment. However, due to the external challenges, namely the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact
of the country’s political situation, the lack of commitment of the GoS reflected in the extremely small
government budget allocation, and the low government technical, operational and capacity, it will be
difficult for UNICEF to reach some of the key indicators, especially Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and
Primary education completion rate.
84. At the same time, UNICEF demonstrated strong ability to reach OOSC children in states
and areas affected by conflict or forced displacement, hosting a high number of refugees and
displaced persons as well as areas that have a high number of nomads and to provide them with
basic education. Despite an overall slowdown in access in 2020 and 2021 due to the closure of schools,
the majority of interviewees in Kassala and in South Darfur perceived UNICEF as a significant contributor
to decreasing the number of OOSC. UNICEF’s collaboration with the MoE including interventions to
reach OOSC with alternative learning where formal education is not available and the launch of the
Learning Passport, an e-learning platform103 in October 2021 are seen by the ET as another significant
steps to allow children to continue education throughout the frequent closures of schools.104 UNICEF’s
efforts to reach out to OOSC was the right choice, as it reached the most vulnerable children and as
there were no other actor reaching these areas/OOSC.
85. The education programme addressed gender gap in education by focusing on increasing
access for girls, through the establishment of adequate gender-responsive learning spaces (provision
of separate toilets and hand washing facilities for girls in schools), enrolment campaigns supported by
C4D and teacher training and by supporting the Girls’ Education Department of the MoE for the ‘Back
to School’ campaign.105 These are all important strategies towards closing the gender gap in education
and towards boosting gender equality in a broader way.
86. UNICEF contributed towards quality of education by supporting capacity building/in-
service teacher training106 and by setting up PTAs107 as well as by carrying out advocacy and
providing technical assistance to the MoE to revise the ALP curriculum108 and training manuals. It
cannot be assessed to what degree these strategies ultimately improved student learning outcomes. To

105 According to a KI during the field visit to South Darfur

strengthen the capacity of education sector at subnational and national levels, UNICEF coordinated the
development of the 2018/19-2020/23 ESSP; improved the policy framework through development of
the Girls’ Education Sector Strategy and coordinated the education partners’ group meetings during
which partners discussed policy reforms. UNICEF also provided technical support to the technical council
of undersecretaries to discuss and approve a costing and financing study which raised awareness of the
need for increased budgetary allocations to education.
87. Poor construction of schools and delays in construction were noted by school authorities
and UNICEF staff and development partners (DP) interviewed for this evaluation. UNICEF documents109
and interviews showed a clear acknowledgement of this problem and it has started to take remedial
actions.
88. In 2022, UNICEF, became Grant Agent for the Global Partnership of Education (GPE) COVID-19
grant, which has contributed to the safe school reopening of the public schools in Basic Education
impacting 13,663 schools and 4,9 million students. Due to the coup, programming under this output
reduced its focus on systems strengthening to a focus on community-based programming to support
learning for the most disadvantaged through expansion of alternative learning opportunities. UNICEF
collaborated with UNESCO and the World Bank, alongside the MoE, to analyse the EMIS and lay the
groundwork for improving the overall functioning of the system. Despite learning through the GPE
process, and despite UNICEF’s technical and financial support, the MoE is facing technical, operational
and capacity issues to produce on-time annual statistics through the EMIS.
Key findings on education
Gross enrolment ratio has increased marginally, but primary education completion rate has reduced
substantially between 2015 and 2021.
UNICEF has put in place important strategies towards closing the gender gap in education and also
boosting overall gender equality.
Quality control of school construction/rehabilitation has been a persistent issue which UNICEF is now
attempting to address.
Evidence-based planning and management of education service delivery were enhanced with the
development of EMIS at the federal, state and school levels.
UNICEF has prioritized integrated interventions in schools through the availability of water and the
construction of sex-segregated latrines with the aim of increasing the enrolment of girls.
3.4.1.4 Outcome 4 - Child protection
89. The Child protection programme was effective in strengthening the national child
protection system, which could be achieved because of the strong partnership with the NCCW and
efforts around institutional capacity development of the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security
(MoWSS) in strengthening the social work force, the Ministry of Interior (MoI) and Ministry of Justice
(MoJ) in providing services for children through Family and Child protection Units (FCPU). The
programme is on track to achieve the outcome indicators (Table 9) in at least two areas, while falling
behind on FGM/C and Child Marriage (CM), which may be attributed to the lack of up-to-date data110 -
all these outcome indicators were based on the MICS which took place in 2014.
109 UNICEF Sudan, Consolidated Programme Strategy Notes, April 2021
110 A MICS was planned to be held in 2021 but was, due to the October 2021 coup, postponed. A S3M II was
conducted in 2019, according to which the percentage was 28.

90. UNICEF’s efforts on legislative review, developing of SOPs, strategies and information
management systems for institutional strengthening were certainly the right choices to lay the
foundation for a robust child protection system and for providing the basis for government and
civil society to build on when addressing child protection violations.111 However, the extent of
the application of these legislations, SOPS and capacity is unclear. With regards to Article 141 on
the prohibition of the FGM, UNICEF supported the training of law enforcement personal such as Police
and Magistrate court. SoPs for case management have been adopted and are being used to provide
quality child protection services according to the minimum standards. However, since legislation and
SOPs are still new and application has been challenging since issues are closely linked to social norms
and behaviour (this is especially valid for FGM/C and child marriage) it is not clear to what extent the
training has translated into a commitment to apply the law and use SOPs in the future. The child
protection team used the favourable environment of transitional government that made legislative
reform and protection strategies possible to support the social welfare institutional reform.112 Similarly,
efforts were made to support child friendly legal reform which came to a halt following to the coup of
October 2021. Without active engagement of the GoS some important child protection issues are likely
to remain unaddressed.
91. UNICEF as co-chair with Resident Coordinator and United Nations–African Union Mission in
Darfur (UNAMID) supports the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) on grave violations
against children in situations of armed conflict with data collection and advocacy. It supported the
development of a road map to implement the 2016 Action Plan on Ending and Preventing Child
Recruitment and Use, a major step towards the protection of children against gross violations, which is
still awaiting adoption. The main bottleneck faced in implementation of the MRM is lack of willingness
111 UNICEF’s Advocacy led to the new Child Act and the adoption of Article 141 of the amendment to the Criminal
Act, criminalizing FGM/C and the development of a roadmap for its implementation as well as supporting the
development of action plans on FGM/C and Child Marriage.111 The programme also supported the development
of SOP in child protection various areas.111
112 This support generated an increase in the overall number of social service workforce from 8/100,000 child
population to 13/100,000. UNICEF Child Protection report 2021.

from parties to the conflict to facilitate access to the verification visits to military camps and recruitment
locations.
92. Through sustained advocacy, technical and financial support, the Child protection
programme supported the institutional and capacity development of the MoWSS and the MoJ
to enable them, together with the FCPU to provide holistic quality services for children, thus
strengthening another important pillar of the child protection system. Efforts at national and state level
resulted in the deinstitutionalization of children without parental care, reunification of unaccompanied
and separated children and integrated services to address psychosocial and mental health issues.
UNICEF also contributed to setting up Community Based Child Protection Networks (CBCPN), –
however, during visits to one of the states, it was stated that of the 98 child protection networks, only
25 were active.
93. As the lead of the child protection sub-cluster and a major partner in the gender-based
violence sub-cluster within the protection cluster, UNICEF played an influential role in
coordinating issues around child protection and GBV. The ET found lesser evidence on strengthening
health services to deal with child sexual abuse and consequences of other GBV issues, e.g., FGM. In
partnership with UNFPA, UNICEF scaled up and accelerated efforts related to social norm and behaviour
change to reduce FGM/C prevalence in Sudan through the Saleema Initiative. No full evaluation has
been carried out to understand if FGM/C rates have decreased in areas of the joint programme
implementation; however, anecdotal evidence and monitoring studies undertaken by UNICEF point to
a decrease in social norms related to FGM/C in programme areas.
Key findings on child protection
UNICEF made major contributions to strengthening the national child protection system which could
be achieved because of the strong partnership with the NCCW and institutional capacity development
of the MWSS, the MoJ and the FCPU.
UNICEF was the driver and key partner for government in adopting child friendly legislation, including
the Article 141 on FGM/C and in developing Action Plan and road maps for FGM/C, child marriage and
prevention of recruitment of children. Without engagement with the government at senior level, a
number of child protection issues will remain unaddressed in foreseeable future.
Routine reliable data collection regarding FGM/C, child marriage and GBV as well as other forms of
violence against children remain challenging, despite UNICEF’s effort to support the GoS in rolling out
information management systems
3.4.1.5 Outcome 5 - Policy, evidence and social protection
94. UNICEF helped the government to review its social protection programme to target the
most-vulnerable. Its social policy and inclusion programme launched in 2018 is based on evidence-
based policies that address structural causes of child multi-dimensional poverty and inequities in
Sudan.113 As discussed earlier, UNICEF has invested significantly in data-driven policies and guidelines
in all sectors. Working with several key agencies including the World Bank,114 ILO and the Economic
Policy Research Institute (EPRI) among others, UNICEF continued its support to the Ministry of Labour
113 UNICEF, Social Policy Annual Report, Khartoum, 2022
114 World Bank has been a big proponent of the social protection programme in Sudan. A new cash transfer scheme,
financed by a World Bank loan, was launched in July 2020, aiming to eventually reach 80 per cent of all households,
providing them US$9 a month. The National Health Insurance Fund was launched in 1995 intending to achieve
universal coverage, but official statistics fall far short (37.3 per cent in 2014) and the system is overburdened and
undersupplied in a country facing extensive health challenges.
36
and Social Development (MoLSD) to develop its first National Social Protection Strategy.115 Although
the strategy is not yet finalized, key informants including development partners consider it a very
important achievement.
95. Besides building GoS’ capacity, UNICEF continues to deliver multi-purpose cash transfers
aimed at: a) increasing the purchasing power of pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers; b)
raising awareness to create demand on health and nutrition services. Following the COVID-19
outbreak as Khartoum came under full lockdown for three months, the MoLSD developed a social
protection plan with support from UNICEF, WFP and UNHCR for food and hygiene needs of families in
the informal sector and launched a cash plus programme targeting pregnant women and children. More
than 500,000 families received food and hygiene assistance and 100,000 families received cash cards.116
For a cash transfer programme, the CSSPR successfully designed and mobilized €20 million for an initial
roll-out of the programme. Taking a lifecycle approach, the programme (Maternal and Child Cash
Transfers (MCCT) covered first 1,000 days of life targeting pregnant women and children under two
years of age in Kassala and Red Sea states. Through the programme, regular unconditional cash
payments are combined with social and behavioural change communication and complementary
services, successfully reaching a total of 52,000 pregnant and lactating women. UNICEF also mobilized
resources for an additional target for 30,000 pregnant and lactating women to benefit a total of 180,000
individuals during 2022. In Kassala, FGD with women beneficiaries of the programme117 who received a
cash payment of $15 per month (paid every 45 days) showed that women were spending most of the
money on nutritious food for children. By targeting all pregnant women (regardless of their economic
vulnerability), the programme has incentivized all pregnant women to come to the health centres where
they receive other relevant information about the pregnancy, infant care, hygiene and nutrition. Key
informants and interviews (women beneficiaries and NGO staff) strongly indicated the need for greater
integration of the cash transfers with services in other sectors in the area.
96. In addition to the MCCT+ which was designed to be a government-led programme, through
its public finance management (PFM) interventions, UNICEF supported the MOFEP to expand the child-
focused public expenditure review conducted in six states. Building on this review, UNICEF worked with
MoFEP to design a capacity building plan for state and locality level finance and sectoral planning
officers. Inability to continue interactions with the government after the coup caused delays and
difficulties in implementing the programme, though UNICEF has continued to work with midwives,
contracting NGOs and with governmental staff in their private capacity for implementation of the
MCCT+. The policy engagement on PFM however has stopped and one does not know how the current
government will, if at all they want to, take the previous work forward.
97. The aggregate number of children (Table 10 below) covered by social-protection has
tripled from the baseline of 500,000 in 2016 to 1,500,000 in 2019, and kept increasing in 2020
reaching 1,800,000, before it dropped down to 1,200,000 in 2021.118 The data however shows some
anomaly: high numbers reached with the low (and declining) share of public expenditure on basic
services at a time when the country’s economy has been declining over the period. KIIs indicated that
the increase in the number of children is mainly due to the prioritization of direct support to the poor
because of the declining economic conditions – this is reflected in the increase in the share of social
115 In process of development of the Strategy, about 130 staff from the MoLSD, MoE and MoH were trained on
concepts, approaches and good practices in social protection. Staff were also trained at state and locality level, for
example: in North Darfur and Gedaref, 113 staff were trained on child-focused public financing mechanisms. As
part of its institutional support to MOLSD, UNICEF placed several advisers in key functions such as strategic
planning, social protection, and coordination and partnership. UNICEF also supported a total of 30 young and mid-
career professionals who undertake a year-long assignment within various departments and units within MOLSD

welfare spending as percentage of the GDP. The impact of the economic reform after the revolution
resulted in more acute vulnerability and deprivation among Sudanese families and children and a higher
number of families were driven into poverty and food insecurity. In response to the situation, the MoLSD
prioritized an increase in the social protection coverage of families and children, reaching 409,000
families (1.2 million children) through a government-led “Thamara” programme. This explains the
discrepancy between the high achievement under the first indicator and the poor achievement under
the sectoral indicator (public expenditure for children by sectors).119

Key findings on policy, evidence and social protection
With significant investment and support from UNICEF (and other partners), several key legislations and
policies were developed on social protection and began to be implemented through the federal
government’s key agencies which were also supported with technical assistance. The fate of the
progress made on these as well as the public finance management interventions over the years is now
uncertain.
The MCCT+ cash transfer programme currently being implemented by UNICEF and its partners as pilot
is showing good initial results even with a small cash transfer linked to mother and child health in the
two states it is being implemented. MCCT+ has great potential if it is integrated with other sectors as
well as through an area-based integration with other development actors targeting women and
children.
3.4.1.6 Outcome 6 – Programme effectiveness
98. As discussed in preceding sections, several elements of UNICEF’s strategies deployed across all
sectoral programmes have been instrumental in achieving the results. Integration of C4D/SBC (see
38
below in integration of programmes section), data-driven programme strategies, partnership –
particularly partnership with government at both federal and local levels - were among the key factors.
UNICEF’s strong field presence which enables it to understand local needs better was also a contributory
factor.
99. While UNICEF has helped the government develop good data and evidence-base across
all sectors, internally UNICEF’s information management capacity has been weak, an issue the CO
is now addressing. The MTR noted that lessons from previous CPD cycle were not fully taken on board
and large programme and humanitarian response were not routinely evaluated. This evaluation found
a dearth of evaluative data (except for evaluation of the Tigray response, and another project evaluation)
to draw on. The integrated monitoring and evaluation plan accompanying the current CPD had
proposed at least six different programme or thematic evaluations,120 but none has been conducted so
far. Monitoring data is held within each section and there is no system to consolidate these so as to get
one coherent data system which UNICEF managers can use. Currently a new monitoring system
integrating data from FOs and different sections is being developed which is likely to be rolled out
during 2023.
100. A major challenge was a scattered approach to programming often missing the
interlinkages between different needs. UNICEF has been seeking internally greater integration
between sectoral programmes, and externally, greater convergence with other partners. The
scattered programming leads to spreading of resources thinly over a large geographical area. This arose
from the internal configuration of its teams, which conventionally tended to work in silos, with each
sector developing its plans and programmes independently within the overarching CPD framework, as
well as UNICEF’s intention to ensure nationwide coverage. KIIs with UNICEF staff (both CO and FO)
reveal that while the sectoral teams do bring strong technical content into programming, this has
limitations in terms of addressing the needs of a child through a rights-based approach. Drawing
lessons from the MTR and subsequent team discussion, UNICEF has started focusing internally on
greater integration among various sectoral teams (see the following section). The idea is to ensure that
there is a holistic approach to addressing the core interlinked needs of children and their families in a
geographical area, by leveraging not only different sectors within UNICEF, but also other agencies
(UN/NGOs) who may have resources and expertise in particular areas.
Key findings on programme effectiveness
UNICEF programme teams are configured sectorally, with each sector developing its plans and
programmes independently and this makes sectoral integration difficult, and perpetuates a scattered
approach in programming, a weakness UNICEF is now trying to address.
Information management, programme evaluation and systematic analysis of monitoring data have been
weak and the CO is addressing the issue.
3.4.2 Integration of programmes
101. Throughout the CPD period, communication-for-development (C4D)121 has been given a
prominent thrust during implementation in order to facilitate behaviour and practice changes at
community level. Various community platforms like mothers’ groups, girls’ clubs, community child
protection committees, ODF committees, water committees, PTAs, community health workers (CHWs)
have all been utilized to create awareness, provide training and mobilize communities through multiple
120 UNICEF, Costed evaluation plan – Sudan – UNICEF country programme of cooperation, 2018–2021, undated
121 The scope of C4D was subsequently expanded and renamed Social and Behaviour Change (SBC).
39
media. This has also required UNICEF sectoral teams to be working closely together and integrate C4D/
SBC in all sectoral responses.
102. A significant step towards enhancing programme effectiveness has been the setting up
of a dedicated team to provide support on SBC. With a sizeable team (two fixed term and 13
temporary technical staff) throughout the country, the SBC experts bolster FOs’ capacity for stronger
social analysis and interact with and mobilize communities for behavioural change. All FOs interviewed
during this evaluation confirmed the changes the integration of SBC into their programmes have made
in the past two years. According to some key informants, this however has not always been an easy
process as people are used to working within vertical structures. The health & nutrition team (H&N) has
fully integrated SBC in every programme, and in other sectors integration is still work-in-progress. While
the dedicated SBC support is enabling strengthening the community dimension of programmes on the
ground, the downside is that sectoral programme staff start defining their own role in purely technical
terms related to the specific sectors, assuming that community dimension of their work is SBC team’s
responsibility. In the longer-term, the issue of mainstreaming SBC will be vital. In this regard, the role of
the SBC team could be geared towards capacity building of sectoral staff so that the latter see the goal
of behavioural change in communities as integral to their own role; this will also to mitigate the risk of
SBC turning into a standalone programme instead of the intended cross-sectoral one.
103. Integrating social behaviour and practice changes with regard to public health issues
through local health structures is creating good level of awareness among communities. Visits to
health centres in Kassala and South Darfur as well as KIIs and UNICEF Annual Reports showed that
during this CPD period, UNICEF emphasized integrating WASH (including hygiene education for
mothers) in the health centres. Through UNICEF’s C4D tools, and subsequently the SBC teams, messages
on hand washing, use of oral rehydration solutions (ORS), use of mosquito nets, breast feeding, birth
registration, etc., have been promoted through community platforms. FGDs in the states visited by the
ET showed good awareness among mothers and community members about the importance of
changing traditional practices and behaviour in relation to health and hygiene. Health workers are
required to report on the SBC activities and progress to locality level health officials.
104. During this CPD cycle, UNICEF has given a strong push for integrated interventions in
schools, through provision of water and construction of sex-segregated toilets with the aim of
increasing enrolment of girls. According to UNICEF reports, interviews and field visits, the availability
of gender-sensitive WASH packages in schools contributed to the retention of adolescent girls.122 In the
schools visited, children’s attendance and completion of the school day significantly improved as a result
of improvements in the school’s environment and equipment, especially water facilities.123 This was
done following a nationwide baseline assessment of WASH situation in schools carried out by the MoE.
However, full integration of WASH in most of the schools has been constrained by lack of access to
water and/or maintenance of the facilities.
105. Other examples of successful programme integration include:
o UNICEF C4D and Education teams jointly led the ‘Back to School’ Communication and
Community Engagement campaigns.
o E-learning centres are used as an entry point to reach children and their families with other
services like birth registration, vaccination, awareness messages on female genital
mutilation (FGM) and hygiene issues. The project was piloted in 3 states124 and is now being
implemented in 6 states.
o UPSHIFT programme, a social enterprise model to support marginalized and out-of-
school adolescents (15–17 years of age) in the use of human-centred design methodologies

was an example of UNICEF’s integrated approach to addressing adolescent education and
child protection issues. The focus was on experiential learning and developing skills such
as creativity, communication, critical thinking and collaboration. Some 1,340 adolescents
(50 per cent girls), adolescents from vulnerable groups, including children on the move,
UASC, and out of school children, were reached through UPSHIFT.125
o UNICEF organized FGM awareness events at school, which was attended by men, women,
boys and girls (participants of FGD stated that the messages on FGM effective and were
well received).126

the key to such an integration and overcome what is currently a scattered approach to delivery of
services.
Key findings on integration of programmes
C4D/SBC has played an important role in enhancing cross-sectoral integration of programmes and
programme effectiveness through setting up a dedicated team. Deepening the integration to provide a
minimum set of basic services to people will require a coordinated approach involving all development
and humanitarian providers working with a functioning government to develop comprehensive
programmes.
3.4.3 Integration of humanitarian-development-peace nexus
107. Leveraging its interventions across both humanitarian and development spectrums,
UNICEF programme is focusing on addressing vulnerability in a conflict-sensitive manner
through provision of basic services to strengthen community resilience and social cohesion.
UNICEF’s approach to nexus places emphasis on a number of key initiatives, which include
strengthening systems, developing risk-informed and climate-sensitive programmes, engaging
community participation, planning and preparing for emergencies, fostering partnerships and
mobilising vital resources.127 UNICEF empowered WASH-related community-based organizations to be
vehicles of social cohesion and conflict resolution (within the sector and beyond), adjusting WASH
infrastructure designs to meet the needs of pastoralists and agrarian communities. Social protection
targeting both the chronically and acutely vulnerable holds significant potential to transform short-term
humanitarian interventions into development processes to achieve resilience and peace, when inter-
linked with other basic services. The joint project128 with WFP in Darfur (now in inception phase) is
premised on this. Before the collapse of the transitional government, the MoIWR was operationalizing

the humanitarian-development-peace nexus (HDPN) and putting in place systems and structures for
durable solutions, integrating the needs of IDPs into long-term planning and introducing community-
based interventions in conflict-affected communities.
108. Overall evidence from various sectoral programmes discussed above show that UNICEF has put
in place or prioritized various elements of the nexus in its programme, for example: durable solutions,
community-based nutrition and social protection programmes targeting both chronic and acute
vulnerability, strengthening community networks and local authorities. UNICEF’s current emphasis to
integrate all sectors as well as ensure an area-based approach that mobilizes multiple partnership to
deliver at scale is designed to contribute to resilience and social cohesion which links the humanitarian-
development divide. In the prevailing context, however, concerted action that integrates multi-sectoral
response to create synergy could be a challenge as overall funding is expected to decline and most
agencies forced to scale down their programme in the coming years.
109. The peacebuilding element of the nexus is a complex construct that UNICEF will need to
translate in programming terms to give clarity to its field staff. As discussed in the relevance section
previously, UNICEF programmes seek to strengthen community resilience in a conflict sensitive manner
that foster social cohesion. This may contribute to peacebuilding, but UNICEF programming cannot
drive peacebuilding, nor be driven by it.
Key findings on nexus
UNICEF has begun to engage on triple nexus including through its programming in social protection
and joint project on resilience and social cohesion with WFP which hold good potential. All of its sectoral
work also has potential to directly contribute to nexus provided these are of sustainable quality and
rooted in strengthened capacity at community and locality levels.
While progress has been made by UNICEF to operationalize peacebuilding, further work is needed to
translate peacebuilding into programmatic approaches and results across sectors to provide greater
clarify for all UNICEF staff. The starting point of UNICEF programmes is unmet basic needs in vulnerable
communities which it tries to address in a way that strengthens community resilience in a conflict sensitive
manner and foster social cohesion.
3.4.4 Innovation
110. UNICEF has introduced a number of innovative approaches in key areas of programme.
One is an innovative approach to e-learning through the “Can’t Wait to Learn” project which is designed
and implemented to reach the OOSC in remote areas where there are no education services. The
programme provided review classes for Grade 8 and 11 through TV, radio, internet or paper-based
booklets, supporting continuity of learning during the pandemic and has the potential to support
the remote delivery of instructions and teacher training programmes. Powered by Microsoft, the e-
Learning platform is available online as well as offline with intermittent or no connectivity areas where
children need it the most. To date, a total of 3,588 users have registered.
111. As part of a pilot project in water provisioning, UNICEF introduced innovative low cost solar
handpumps which are combined hybrid handpump in four states of Sudan.129 This is now being scaled
up, according to key informants. UNICEF has solarized close to 100 primary healthcare centres, provided
solar handpumps130 to communities and solarized 91 e-learning centres.
129 UNICEF Sudan, Results Assessment Module (RAM 2020) – Full Approved Report, 2020
130 UNICEF RAM 2022 Report shows that it has so far completed construction or rehabilitation/upgrading of 80 solarized
water yards, 42 solarized mini-water yards and 52 solar handpumps.
42
Conclusions on effectiveness
1. As engagement with the current government remains partially suspended at federal and state levels,
continued engagement at the locality level which UNICEF continues to pursue remains crucial for
effective delivery of basic services in health, nutrition, education, WASH, child protection, and social
protection.
2. UNICEF’s scale and geographical spread of programme delivery has been one of the largest in the
spheres of nutrition, education and WASH, in particular, for which it has built multiple partnerships with
government agencies, NGOs, civil society and UN agencies. This scale and spread of operation, however,
does lead to a scattered approach spreading resources thinly across large geographical areas. There is
space to create stronger integration between programme interventions
3. In a number of critical areas of UNICEF’s core programme, the outcomes at national level have shown
a negative trend. Further, in the prevailing context, child protection issues are assuming urgency,
especially with regard to child rights violation in conflict and civil unrest situations. There is the need for
UNICEF to redefine its role and approach in such an unpredictable context.
4. While there is good monitoring of activities, UNICEF’s internal information management capacity has
not supported good monitoring of results/outcomes, and might in turn affect the quality of delivery
and the sustainability of interventions.
5. UNICEF’s enhanced emphasis on integration of various sectors, thrust on social and behaviour change
and geographical concentration of programmes in partnership with other providers is timely and
necessary to promote resilience, along with its emphasis on social protection in line with a nexus
approach. Engagement on peacebuilding needs to be underpinned by the premise that UNICEF
programme is primarily geared to address unmet basic needs in vulnerable communities, through
strengthening community resilience in a conflict-sensitive manner that fosters social cohesion.
6. Comprehensive social protection programmes assume critical significance at this juncture due to the
economic hardships people face. Despite the absence of an internationally accepted government,
UNICEF continued to advance Sudan’s social protection sector reform agenda, focusing on the launch
and roll out of the Mother-to-Child Cash transfer Plus (MCCT+) Programme. This is one of the key
flagship programmes that were proposed in the draft National Social Protection Strategy. Programmes
like MCCT+ can be effective vehicles for delivering health and nutrition outcomes if these are integrated
with other sectors as well as through an area-based convergence with other development actors
targeting women and children.
43
3.5 Sustainability
112. Due to the current political context, much of the progress made with regard to
vulnerability-focused government policies, programmes, regulatory frameworks and guidelines
is in a state of limbo. While UNICEF is able to ensure continuity of some of the basic services through
working with NGOs and civil society, especially on life saving interventions, a number of urgent issues
are likely to remain unaddressed without the active engagement of the GoS. This may include a
continuous commitment towards the strengthening of the social service workforce, which plays an
important role in child protection, the commitment of the MoE in targeting OOSC, continued
commitment of government to support to health workers and realising public financing for children.
113. UNICEF’s move to enhancing the quality of its delivery in some of the core areas and
towards building resilience of communities is likely to have a positive contribution to
sustainability, despite the limitations of not having a government as a partner. During the
pendency of re-engagement with the GoS, UNICEF has been able to continue delivery of services and
to build capacities of communities in all its core areas of programming in partnership with NGOs,
localities and other UN agencies. On health, for example, working with midwives, community health
workers and local officials, UNICEF is able to ensure that the maternal and child healthcare continues to
deliver, including its immunization package. This however is dependent on the government continuing
to employ and incentivize these cadres – anecdotal evidences suggest this is being scaled down in some
areas. The nutrition and WASH programmes function with the involvement of NGOs, community
networks (mothers’ groups, schools, sanitation committees) and local health officials. The scale of
operation is likely to be reduced without the active involvement of the government at state level and
early indications do show that the pace of implementation has slowed down (sections on education,
child protection). Data collection and surveys by the government will also remain suspended. The future
of social protection programme of the government and draft policies remain uncertain. However, the
UNICEF-implemented social protection and other basic services programme continue with participation
of community networks and local authorities to a limited extent.
114. A critical question that emerged from the above findings on various sectoral areas that
has a bearing on sustainability is that of the quality of interventions (WASH, schools) and
mechanisms for their maintenance that UNICEF needs to address. Resilience and sustainability are
interconnected. Resilience requires communities to be able to assess, monitor and manage their own
risks, have the capacity to establish priorities and act, and have access to basic services and infrastructure
which duty-bearers are able to provide in collaboration with the communities. A key element in this link
is the institutional architecture and capacity especially at the community and locality levels,
acknowledging that governance at the federal and state levels is not going to be conducive for UNICEF’s
engagement in near future. In other words, how UNICEF capacitates communities to take ownership
and leverage external relationship (with NGOs, localities, government technical departments) to ensure
that benefits from the infrastructure continue to flow will be a critical factor in promoting social cohesion
and resilience.
115. Since 2021 UNICEF has established community-based management systems for
operation, and maintenance of WASH services by rolling out Community Management of
Operation and Maintenance (CMOM) strategy.131 After the construction work, water facilities are
handed over to communities who are trained by UNICEF in operations and maintenance. Some
communities which have active water or WASH committees run and maintain the facilities by themselves
under the supervision of the MoIWR at state level. Currently, following the change in government,
engagement with the MoIWR remains minimal and it is unclear what capacity it now has to support
communities. A common complaint the ET came across in the states during field visits was that
131 Through this, UNICEF has trained 118 Water Users Committees in 2022.
44
components like motors and solar panels (where these were provided) were easy to dismount and were
often stolen.
116. Quality of school constructions has been a long-standing issue which is now beginning
to be addressed by UNICEF. Poor construction of schools and delays in construction were noted by
school authorities and UNICEF staff and development partners interviewed for this evaluation. UNICEF
documents show a clear acknowledgement of this problem and remedial actions are beginning to be
taken as UNICEF has now put in place a construction team with engineers who are working with the
field offices to assist in monitoring of quality. The school designs and standards were developed by the
GoS years ago and are outdated. Since the 2021 October coup as UNICEF cannot provide financial
support to government, it now works increasingly with NGOs which leads to delays in implementation.
The mid-year review of progress in 2022 showed that implementation of various activities including
rehabilitation/construction of schools has slowed down considerably, as confirmed by KIIs. Further,
NGOs do not have the coverage or outreach the government had.
117. Sustainability of services provided has been affected by the absence of robust
institutional strengthening mechanisms, coupled with poor ownership of State Governments. KIIs
with UNICEF health staff and NGOs indicated that UNICEF or NGOs have covered only a small
percentage of the health centres (estimated to be over 6,000) in the country, and the conditions
prevailing in a large majority of these remain grim due to continuous underfunding and lack of adequate
infrastructure and equipment, a situation likely to be worsening in the coming years in the current
circumstances.
Key findings on sustainability
Sustainability of outputs and outcomes are and will most likely be further affected by: a) the continuing
political uncertainly in the country; b) the political will to implement policies and regulatory frameworks;
c) the political will to invest in health, education, social protection, social workforce; d) the issues around
quality and maintenance of construction (e.g., schools and latrines), and e) the low capacities of UNICEF
non-governmental partners and governmental partners at state level.
Conclusion on sustainability
1. Prolonged disengagement with the government at federal and state levels may affect sustainability
of some of the programme outputs and outcomes, though this can be countered to some extent with
increased thrust on resilience and social cohesion, as well as quality of service delivery, working through
NGOs, localities and communities, as UNICEF intends to do.
2. Quality and maintenance of constructions being pre-requisites to sustainability of interventions at
the community and locality level continue to receive attention through the establishment of UNICEF
construction unit in Khartoum and six field offices.

4. Recommendations
Recommendations
118. The recommendations are made in the current context in the country which limits active
engagement with the federal and state governments. The evaluation team (ET) assumes that should any
dramatic positive shift occur in the sphere of governance, UNICEF is well aware of the priorities and
focus vis-à-vis reengagement with the government. Secondly, the ET assumes that the current political
context is likely to continue and this is likely to lead to reduction in funding. As development partner
funding decreases and humanitarian funding becomes the major resourcing option, a number of
development partners may switch part of their funds to direct-funding of NGOs, as opposed to funding
through UN agencies. This will call for choices to be made in terms of scale and focus of the programme.
R1. Focus and depth: In line with its internal discussions currently underway, UNICEF needs to develop
clear focus (both geographical and programmatic interventions) so as to ensure depth and quality in
programmes. This should include:
i) further increased internal integration of different sectors;
ii) establishing/redefining partnerships with other agencies (NGOs/UN) to mobilize a
minimum package of basic needs services that addresses interlinked vulnerabilities in
selected target areas;
iii) narrowing down target areas of interventions and/or a tighter focus within programmes,
while keeping the current focus on vulnerable children;
iv) moving away from construction while focusing on quality of service
providers/strengthening capacities of service providers rather than be the service provider.
R2. Address deterioration in outcomes in critical areas of programming. In the new CPD, clearly
articulate how UNICEF will deepen and expand partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders to
continue to prioritize programming where the key national level outcomes are showing a declining or
stagnating trend (namely measles vaccination coverage, live-births attended by skilled personnel,
malnutrition among children, FGM practices). It may be that UNICEF defines its intended outcomes at
two levels:
i) focus on particular geographical areas where it will demonstrate definite positive changes
in trend over a period of time;
ii) support government/other agencies in the rest of the country, where resources allow.
R3. Sustainability of interventions. More attention should be given to sustainability of results of
interventions in the longer-term by:
i) Ensuring quality control and maintenance of all infrastructure work where UNICEF decides
that their involvement is critical (as elaborated above, the recommendation is that UNICEF
should move away from engaging in construction as much as possible); for infrastructures
like WASH and school constructions/rehabilitation, UNICEF needs to produce an inventory
of facilities it has supported and ensure periodic monitoring of these through the local
authorities;
ii) In interventions for which results depend upon community capacity and their mobilization
(e.g., WASH structures, school infrastructure), ensuring that adequate amount of time is
given for community mobilization process and post-implementation (delivery) follow up to
monitor how communities and local authorities are developing capacity, utilizing and
maintaining the services;
46
iii) When implemented through NGOs (short-term grants), making provision for continuing
monitoring and follow up after an activity is implemented. In this regard, UNICEF may
encourage implementing partners and communities to set up a ‘pooled fund’ that is
available for providing small maintenance/monitoring support; ideally, this will require all
partners involved in a particular area to coordinate such an initiative.
R4. Programming for peacebuilding and focus on resilience: As part of the new CPD, UNICEF needs
to further clarify the scope of its programming on peacebuilding and ensure that all its staff have a
common understanding. In this regard, it may be worth reinforcing the premise that UNICEF programme
addresses unmet basic needs in vulnerable communities through strengthening community resilience
in a conflict-sensitive manner and foster social cohesion; programming is not driven by peacebuilding,
but contributes to it. Specific actions may include:
i) A clear definition of parameters (result indicators) to measure resilience and social cohesion;
ii) An assessment of UNICEF Sudan’s specific expertise in peacebuilding – some field offices
already have good experience in this regard;
iii) Strengthen life and livelihood skills as well as citizenship education of children and
adolescents.
R5. Social protection: While continuing to implement the MCCT+ programme, UNICEF needs to ensure
that this is integrated with other sectors (especially nutrition and WASH) as well as through an area-
based integration (R1 above) with other development actors targeting women and children. An impact
study of the pilot cash transfer programme in the two states where this is being implemented will
provide data and evidence which will be crucial for any expansion of the current programme or of any
other social protection programme.
R6. Advocacy regarding child protection. Given that implementation of crucial laws and policies
geared to the protection of children remain in limbo, UNICEF needs to continue its evidence-based
advocacy with the GoS focusing on prevention of child protection violations, particularly violence
against children, through increased human, financial and infrastructure resources for social service
workforce. In parallel, UNICEF needs to continue working with service providers (e.g., government, NGOs
and CSOs) to strengthen and scale up child protection systems, and partner with UNITAMS and key
stakeholders from civil society and UN agencies to prevent violence against children.
R7. Partnerships with civil society: Partnerships with NGOs and CSOs should be further increased and
diversified as engagement with the government remains substantially suspended, and this may help
enhance quality of delivery due the former’s closer engagement with communities. UNICEF needs to i)
examine if there is room for further improvement in the workflow process involving NGOs to increase
efficiency of delivery. Confrontation with UNICEF Headquarters or other Regional / Country Offices
could be beneficial; ii) duly assess the existing capacities of the NGOs to further build on these.
R8. Gender equality. More specific attention to the inclusion of boys and men in the gender dialogue
(e.g., on GBV, FGM, child marriage, girls’ education, management of menstrual hygiene, adolescents’
health and nutrition, youth empowerment) as well as the development of gender-friendly indicators
would be needed, together with the additional financial and human resources allocated to gender-
responsiveness and integration.

5. Annexes
Annex 1 – Terms of Reference
Justification / Background
Sudan had achieved designation as a lower middle-income country in 2019, only to regress back to
lower income by 2020. Even prior to the current economic crisis and global pandemic, there were
substantial disparities in child-specific social indicators between states. Sudan ranked 170 out of 189
countries and territories in the 2020 Human Development Index. Some 46.5 per cent of the population
lives in poverty, with the rural areas being the most affected. Nearly 51 per cent of Sudan’s population
are aged below 18 mainly due to high population growth at 2.4 per cent annually. Rapid urbanization
characterizes the demographic changes, with over a third of the population now in urban areas. Rural-
urban migration is being driven in part by conflict, drought and desertification, as well as the search for
better economic opportunities and access to basic services. This situation led to an ongoing protracted
and multi-faceted needs, with significant numbers of internally displaced people and displacement-
affected communities, refugees and vulnerable residents including children requiring assistance,
combined with underdevelopment and a need to address the root causes of vulnerability.
The economy is contracting since 2011, with GDP declining from US$ 55.0 billion in 2011 to US$ 21.3
billion by 2020. COVID-19 preventative measures such as travel restrictions and curfews further
impacted the economy, particularly affecting the urban poor in daily wage-earning employment in the
informal sector. Sudan is experiencing high income poverty in 2022 with an estimated 9.8 million people
– 22 per cent of the population having crisis or worse levels of food insecurity, with 13.6 per cent of
children under five experiencing global acute malnutrition132.
Humanitarian crises, including protracted conflict and displacement, natural disasters, epidemics,
emergency-level malnutrition and food insecurity, all remain major challenges. It is estimated that 14.3
million people will need humanitarian assistance in Sudan in 2022, 7.8 million133 of whom are children.
Sudan has over three million IDPs and is hosting 1.1 million refugees, one of the largest numbers in
Africa. These figures are expected to increase as crises continue in neighboring countries, especially
South Sudan and Ethiopia.
Children in the armed conflict zones of Jebel Marra, Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains had gone a decade
without access to basic services such as education, polio and measles vaccinations, nutrition services,
water and sanitation facilities, and child protection until being recently reached by humanitarian
assistance in 2021. Children on the move remain one of the most vulnerable groups in Sudan. There is
an absence of a favorable protection environment for refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced
persons and other persons on the move. The threats to children-at-risk and vulnerable women include
discrimination, exploitation, abuse and violence.
COVID-19 has amplified existing vulnerabilities in Sudan with wide ranging impact on the physical and
mental well-being of children and families heightening risk of violence, abuse and neglect, especially of
girls and women. Prior to the pandemic over three million children were estimated to be out-of-school
– more than half of them girls. School closures tied to the pandemic disrupted the attendance of at
least 9.6 million children in 2020 alone, with additional disruptions caused by political unrest before and
after the start of the pandemic. The education system is facing several challenges including poor quality,
insufficient classroom space, lack of trained teachers and funding.

Ongoing political crisis further jeopardizes progress made towards democracy and respect for human
rights. In 2019, a power-sharing agreement between military and civilian leadership was established to
form a transitional government after long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir was ousted, with a plan for full
democratic election in 2023134. The events have posed challenges for the UN System to programming
and delivering to meet the continued needs on the ground, the nexus programming in Sudan faces
increased level of uncertainty. Since the change of government 25 October 2021, marches and other
spontaneous protests have been held by civilians, during which 76 people have been killed and over
2,200 people have been injured (as of 24 January 2022).135
UNICEF Country Programme in Sudan
UNICEF has been delivering programmes in Sudan since 1952, with a permanent office in Khartoum
since 1974. UNICEF is mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to advocate for the protection
of children's rights, to help children fulfil their basic needs and to expand their opportunities to reach
their full potential i.e., to survive and thrive. UNICEF is one of the largest UN agencies in Sudan, with
more than 400 personnel and an annual programme delivery of around US$ 130 million. The central
office in Khartoum and 12 other offices cover all 18 states of Sudan. UNICEF Sudan Country Office
implements activities in partnership with a variety of national, state, and local government and civil
society partners. Central to the implementation of UNICEF’s programme in Sudan is decentralized
delivery, working at the state, locality and community levels. UNICEF works with partners in remote
areas to reach children in inaccessible locations strengthening the systems for determining the
geographic focus for the country program towards the most deprived localities with multi-sectoral
deprivations most acutely affecting child survival and development.
In line with the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-2021, and policies and strategies of the GoS, the country
programme aimed to achieve equitable outcomes for the poorest, most-in-need and hardest-to-reach
children through addressing humanitarian needs while building the resilience of families and
communities against future shocks and linking with sustainable development interventions. The Sudan
Country Programme 2018-2022 contributes to eight of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and
jointly contributes to UNDAF 2018-2022, focus area three related to social services; focus area four
related to governance, rule of law and institutional capacity development; and focus area five related to
community stabilization.
The programme was developed jointly by the Government and UNICEF to with a view to align with the
priorities defined in the Sudan National Strategic Development Plan 2017-2020, as well as the multi-
year Humanitarian Strategy 2017-2019. Programmatic integration is a key strategy in the country
programme, and in collaboration with the government at national and sub-national levels, the
integration of multi sectoral community based interventions is planned to impact on equitable child
survival and development, education and learning outcomes ad safe protection of children. Together
with its partners, UNICEF supports enhancing national capacity, systems strengthening, developing
public policy and national legislation for the reform of sustainable basic social services for children and
women.
The overall goal of the country programme 2018-2022 is to contribute to national efforts to enable all
children and adolescents in Sudan, especially those in the most vulnerable situations, to have their rights
progressively fulfilled and to develop to their full potential in an inclusive and protective environment.
The country programme has five components: (a) child survival and development; (b) education and

learning; (c) child protection; (d) policy, evidence and social protection; and (e) programme
effectiveness.
UNICEF Sudan’s Country Programme 2018-2021 has been extended by one year to 2022136. The United
Nations Country Team (UNCT) agreed on an extension of United Nations Development Assistance
Framework for Sudan (UNDAF) and common country framework to 2023 and is currently finalizing the
process with Headquarters. If this decision goes ahead, UNICEF will request for another year extension
of its country programme to best align itself with the UN system in Sudan.
Despite the recent shifts in country context, the United Nations remains fully committed to the nexus
approach and to continue delivering on current humanitarian and development programmes with an
emphasis on resilience and peace building. UNICEF during the country programme adapted to the
changing situation by establishing a presence in Gedarif to respond to the influx of Ethiopian refugees.
Programmatic changes during the country programme were a prioritization of partnerships with private
sector, integrating peacebuilding across programme areas, and incorporating construction and
engineering staff across the country to support improved infrastructure. In the context of the current
political crisis, UNICEF is considering the implementation modalities (i.e. through (a) government, (b)
NGOs, or (c) direct delivery through contracts).
UNICEF responds to emerging humanitarian situations in accordance with the Core Commitments for
the Children in Humanitarian Action. The pandemic affected the capacity of government actors due to
constraints on in-person work. Although government partners reopened, the pandemic continues to
strain resources and disrupt typical workflows. The ongoing political crisis has affected government
services due to uncertainty around leadership, staffing disruptions, and internal feuds over the political
process. This has had an adverse impact on capacity building, program implementation and monitoring
and supervision.
Child survival and development
Child survival and development consists of an integrated package of interventions including health,
nutrition, sanitation and hygiene delivered to address the root causes of child mortality and morbidity,
particularly child malnutrition, focusing on addressing the inadequate coverage and quality of lifesaving
interventions.
Outcome 1: Health and Nutrition – by 2022, more children under the age of five years and women of
reproductive age utilize high-impact, quality health and nutrition services:
• Support to government at national and subnational levels to strengthen capacities and develop
evidence-based and equity, multi-sector focused policies, plans and budgets to improve health
and nutrition services;
• Strengthening health systems and communities through capacity building to deliver integrated
high-impact health and nutrition services;
• Providing Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) services to severely malnourished children
along with reliable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene;
• Strengthening capacities at the national, state and locality levels to design, implement and
monitor demand generation interventions for promoting key family practices and behaviour
change for high impact nutrition and health services.
136 https://www.unicef.org/executiveboard/media/6846/file/2021-PL28-Extensions_of_CPs-EN-ODS.pdf
50
Outcome 2: Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) – by 2022, more children and their families are living
in an open defecation free environment, using improved drinking water sources and adopting improved
hygiene practices.
• Providing access to basic sanitation facilities and supporting communities to adopt adequate
hygiene practices;
• Providing communities with equitable and sustainable access to improved drinking water
facilities;
• Supporting the government through institutional capacity and systems strengthening to scale-
up equitable and sustainable access to basic improved WASH services in schools and health
facilities.
Education and learning
The programme aim is to ensure more children in Sudan are in school and learning. UNICEF focused on
strengthening national education systems to be more inclusive ad equitable in their delivery of quality
education services to the children in most vulnerable situations who are out of school.
Outcome: Education – by 2022, more children have access to early stimulation and quality basic
education and learning in inclusive and safe school environments.
• Supporting the establishment of second-chance education learning opportunities in emergency
and non-emergency situations so that more out-of-school children in Sudan, especially girls
and those in the most vulnerable situations, access quality pre0primary and alternative learning
opportunities;
• Increasing capacity of the education system to deliver quality and inclusive education services
in conducive learning environments throughout the continuum of formal or non-formal
schooling, from pre-primary to primary and into secondary;
• Enhancing the governance and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education and other institutions to effectively legislate, plan, coordinate, and budget the
provision of equitable and inclusive education opportunities.
Child Protection
This programme component focuses on four child protection thematic areas: implementation of the
Action Plan and Reintegration of Children Associated with Armed Conflict / addressing grave violations
MRM in the context of armed conflict and humanitarian crises; justice for children; harmful practices
against children prioritizing FGM/C and child marriage; and prevention and responding to separation
of children.
Outcome: Child Protection – by 2022, more children are protected from violence, abuse, and
exploitation and benefit from improved response and prevention systems.
• Strengthening the national capacity and accountability through policy advocacy of the Ministry
of Social Affairs to address legal gaps in the protective environment and more effectively
implement existing laws and policies on child protection, policies and budgets integrated across
sectors;
• Supporting institutional and capacity development of Ministry of Security and Social
Development, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior and FCPU professionals to deliver
specialized child protection services at state and locality levels, in line with international
standards and referral mechanisms;
• Supporting the capacities of children, families, and communities to protect themselves by
enhancing the knowledge and skills of rights-holders, establishing formal community
51
commitments, and supporting risk mitigation activities promoting practices and behaviours
that protect children and women.
Policy, evidence and social protection
The programme component aims to generate evidence, strengthen capacities of national and state level
government agencies to analyze and use evidence and data for planning and ensure adequate budget
allocation and efficient financial disbursement for capital investment in health, nutrition, water and
sanitation, education, and social protection. More specifically UNICEF supports the government in the
ongoing development of legislation and policy reforms for adequate public financing and child rights,
developing an integrated social protection pilot system and generation of sound evidence for public
advocacy and scaling up high impact social protection systems.
Outcome: Policy, evidence and social protection – by 2022, disadvantaged and excluded children are
benefiting from improved policy environment and strengthened social protection system.
• Strengthening capacities of national and sub-national government partners for evidence-
informed child-centred policy formulation, planning and budgeting;
• Strengthening institutional capacities of government partners to develop and deliver child-
sensitive social protection, particularly to children and families in the most vulnerable
situations.
Programme effectiveness
UNICEF works with the Ministry of International Cooperation and line ministries, centrally and in field
offices, to ensure that the programme is effectively managed, coordinated, monitored and evaluated,
for the efficient delivery of results. UNICEF also provides cross-sectoral support for the mainstreaming
of gender-responsive programming and accountability to affected populations and ensures coherence
and coordination in emergency preparedness and response and resilience-strengthening actions across
sectors.
Outcome: Programme Effectiveness – The country programme is efficiently designed, coordinated,
managed and supported to meet quality programming standards within the priorities for affected
populations in achieving results for children.
• UNICEF staff and partners are provided with guidance, tools and resources to effectively
design, plan and manage programmes;
• UNICEF staff and partners are provided with tools, guidance and resources for effective
advocacy on child rights issues;
• Strategies to address cross-cutting issues related to child rights are developed and applied.
Purpose and Objectives of the Evaluation
Under the new Evaluation Policy of UNICEF Country Programme Evaluations are mandatory for every
second cycle. Sudan Country Office did not have a Country Programme Evaluation during its last cycle
and is therefore mandated to conduct a Country Programme Evaluation.
Purpose and Use
The purpose of the evaluation is to provide impartial and independent evidence to assist the Country
Office, and partners (government, implementing partners, donors, the UN country team) to identify the
results achieved, the gaps, and the key bottlenecks. As the country programme did not formally
envision the full extent of the humanitarian programming, the evaluation should have a strong focus
on the nexus approach given the multiple crises and humanitarian initiatives implemented in Sudan by
52
the UNICEF country office. The learning will primarily benefit the UNICEF Country Office, as well as
contribute to the UN system joint programming in Sudan and the programming of partners in Sudan.
Objective:
The objective of the independent evaluation of the UNICEF Country Programme (2018 - 2023),
acknowledging the verbal agreement of the UNICEF’s Executive Board to extend the programme to
2023, is to produce an independent and useful evaluation report that provides accountability, learning
and forward-looking recommendations. The evaluation will provide accountability to UNICEF, partners,
and rights-holders; elaborating whether UNICEF, through the implementation of its Country
Programme, was fit for purpose and strategically well positioned to respond to national and refugee
needs.
More specifically, the objectives of the evaluation are to:
• Assess key UNICEF contributions to the attainment of the results at the outcome level,
including cross-cutting strategies, based on existing evidence and analysis, and identify key
challenges and lessons learned.
• Identify the opportunities and potential strategic shifts for the next country programme vis
a vis UNICEF’s comparative advantage and potential ways to integrate the nexus approach
more systematically.
• Based on the evolving situation in Sudan and the potential strategic shifts identified, assess
whether UNICEF CO is "fit for purpose", in terms of strategic positioning, the current
implementation modalities and decentralized operations.
Scope
The evaluation will assess key results achieved and strategies applied within the current UNICEF Country
Programme as articulated through the Country Programme Document outcomes and outputs. It will
cover all activities planned and / or implemented during the period 2018-2023 within each programme
component (education, health and nutrition, WASH, child protection and social protection as well as
cross-cutting strategies (gender, adolescent and youth, C4D, T4D, PME, etc.). While initially the
humanitarian response was integrated in the programmatic interventions foreseen during the
development of the country programme, the evaluation will acknowledge the interventions especially
humanitarian and peace building ones that were amended during the period 2018 and 2023. The
management of the programme and the monitoring and reporting system are part of the scope.
In addition to the intended results of the country programme the evaluation will aim to identify
unintended effects. The evaluation will include the OECD DAC criteria of Relevance, Coherence,
Efficiency and Sustainability but exclude Impact from the evaluation. In addition, it will look at gender,
human rights. The evaluation will focus on higher level strategic results and not aim to conduct a
detailed analysis of all sectors of the country programme. The evaluation is summative looking at the
results during the implementation of the country programme.
Evaluability
The Country Programme Document is clear on the different areas of delivery. The programme strategic
notes provide enough of a basis to start the evaluation. Gaps in understanding of the theory of change
will be addressed during the inception phase. Monitoring data is available and a number of evaluations
of aspects of the country programme have already been conducted. Monitoring and reporting data
seem to be in principle available and will form a key element of the evaluation.
Evaluation questions:
The evaluation aims to answer the following questions:
53
Coherence
• To what extent are the Country Programme Document and subsequent humanitarian
responses aligned with national strategies, the strategy of the system wide country team,
other UNICEF strategies (e.g. UNICEF strategic plan, regional Strategy, CCCs, gender
mainstreaming, the peace building agenda, the triple nexus, SDGs, etc.), and other agencies
strategies?
Relevance
• To what extent has the country programme addressed the most urgent needs of girls and
boys in Sudan?
• To what extent has the Country Office been able to respond to changes in national and
district level needs, rights, and priorities or to shifts caused by crises or major political
changes? To what extend has the Country Office invested into the right programming?
What are the main emerging opportunities that the Country Office should prioritize?
• To what extent did the design and the interventions of the Country Programme Document
integrate cross cutting issues such as equity, gender, disability, inclusion, adolescent and
youth, technology and innovation (including technology for development (T4D)), social and
behaviour change (SBC) and prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA)?
• What are the key comparative advantages of UNICEF and to what extent is UNICEF Sudan
leveraging them? To what extend are synergies within the UN system leveraged? Which
areas should UNICEF Sudan focus on?
Efficiency
• Did the country programme use the resources (financial and human resources) in the most
economical manner to achieve its objectives?
• Did the country programme and its strategies lead to improvement in the allocation and
use of resources in the concerned programme areas, and improved more efficient
processes with partners?
• To what extent have programme strategies been effective in supporting delivery of country
programme outputs and outcomes? What can be learned about the most effective
programme strategies for achievement of programme results?
• To what degree, have the delivery strategy balanced reaching the most vulnerable and
reaching sufficient numbers of needy children?
Effectiveness
• To what extent were programme outputs delivered and did they contribute to progress
toward stated programme outcomes?
• Were there positive / negative unintended outcomes? Could they have been foreseen and
managed?
• To what extent did partnerships or coordination mechanisms at national and local levels,
established with other key actors e.g., government at national and local levels, civil society,
INGOs, NGOs, other UN agencies etc. contribute to the delivery of results for children?
• To what extent has UNICEF’s Country Programme contributed to improving performance
of Government institutions / service providers, systems, mechanisms, policies / strategies?
• To what degree is UNICEF Sudan office fit for purpose, to deliver key results to the most
vulnerable children and young people, in terms of structure (field offices), strategies (nexus
approach, peacebuilding, centralized planning and monitoring), implementation methods
(direct implementation, through government or other partners), scalability, and adapting
to changing realities on the ground through responsive implementation modalities?
54

integrated in all aspects of programming and implementation, including policy and
advocacy?
Stakeholders
• UNICEF Country Office, Regional Office and Headquarters
• Government of Sudan and its line ministries
• Other UN agencies
• Implementing Partners and INGOs / NGOs
• Donors
Methodology
This section provides the preliminary direction of the methodology. The methodology is based on
UNEG norms and standards and refers to relevant UNEG and UNICEF guidance materials such as the
guidance on integrating human rights and gender into evaluation. It will be further elaborated during
the inception phase in the annexes of the inception report including the research instruments and
evaluation matrix. Duplication of efforts will be avoided. Therefore, previous evaluations of sections of
the country programme document will be integrated in this evaluation.
If the security and the COVID situation allows the evaluation will be conducted with the ET visiting
Khartoum as well as a representative selection of field offices to gain a better understanding of the
situation on the ground and the various implementation environments in the country. This will allow
the team to discuss with implementing partners as well as district and regional government
representatives and potentially beneficiaries in some locations. Key informants especially from the
government partners, implementing partners and UNICEF should be interviewed to get a deeper
understanding of the political limitations, the relevance of the programme for the various stakeholders
and how the different strategies fit together. Focus groups might be conducted with staff from
partners137, UNICEF or with beneficiaries as appropriate.
The methodology is applying a mixed methods approach and will be as participatory as possible.
Information from the different lines of inquiry will be triangulated to improve the reliability of the
findings and to ensure that the recommendations are grounded in the reality. Documents to be
reviewed will include but are not limited to government strategies and policy documents, the UNDAF
documentation, UNICEF strategic documents, evaluations and reports produced by Sudan Country
Office, monitoring and progress reports concerning the different elements of the country programme.
Geospatial data, government surveys and other general information of the country will be reviewed. If
relevant additional primary data collection at larger scale will be initiated. The evaluation might also
benefit from the baseline efforts for the social cohesion programme.
Special attention will be given to the disaggregation of data by gender and other groups relevant. The
methodology will ensure that the numbers of men, women, boys and girls are sufficient to disaggregate
findings by gender where appropriate.
The research instruments as included in the inception report will go through an ethical review process
to ensure compliance with UNICEF policies for data collection.
137 Selected from the stakeholders mentioned in the section above
55
Ethical conduct
The evaluation consultancy will follow United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical conduct
guidance in data collection and verbal or written consent will be required from participants before
commencement of any interview.
The inception report, data collection tools and consent forms will go through an independent ethical
review body before proceeding to the fieldwork stage of the evaluation. All data collected and
confidential information shared during the evaluation shall be kept in a password protected system by
the ET.
Limitations
Some of the data might be sensitive and access restricted. To mitigate this the evaluation will collect
data from as many sources as possible as well as highlight any potential biases in data used in the
evaluation. For areas with access limitations the team will use remote data collection techniques and
individual key informant interviews.
Distribution
As part of the quality assurance processes the ET will present preliminary findings and recommendation
to relevant internal and external stakeholders. In the following discussion stakeholders can reflect on
the preliminary findings with the goal to make them more relevant to the country office. Commenting
on the draft report will be afforded to all institutional stakeholders interviewed during the primary data
collection. After the report is finalized a dedicated distribution workshop will be facilitated to discuss
the findings of the report as well as to design the actions that will address the recommendations of the
evaluation report. Additional sectoral working meetings and discussions of the findings and
recommendations might be facilitated ahead of the distribution workshop for those sections that
require more in-depth discussions.

the final version of the inception report, as well as provide guidance should major new challenges arise
that would affect the timely completing of the evaluation. The direct management of the evaluation
will be done by the regional evaluation advisor. The Sudan Country Office will ensure that all relevant
documentation is available to the consultants and support the arrangement of meetings with relevant
stakeholders.
The team leader will coordinate the inputs of the team and be responsible for the quality of the
deliverables. The consultant company will support the ET and backstop the team where required and
do quality assurance for all deliverables submitted to UNICEF. The team members will primarily focus
on their area of expertise but will engage with the team leader and the evaluation manager on issues
relating to the quality of the evidence of the overall evaluation.
Performance indicators for evaluation of results
All tasks have been delivered in a timely manner as indicated in the TOR/Contract. High quality of work
and results achieved correspond to the specification of the TORs. Deliverables are submitted on time
and the quality of work should be acceptable to UNICEF. Overall performance at the end of the contract
will be evaluated against the following criteria: timeliness (as per the timelines agreed with UNICEF),
responsibility, initiative, communication, and quality of the services delivered.
Frequency of performance reviews
A formal performance review will be performed at the end of the contract. The quality of the deliverables
will be assessed, and when satisfactory installments will be paid.

the transition government. Therefore, the depth to which an evaluation can go looking for evidence of nexus programming may be limited when it comes to assessing outcomes.
However, the evaluation will take a forward-looking approach and examine how opportunities for nexus programming are being explored.
