EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Country Context and UNICEF CP
Pakistan has an estimated population of 212 million, of which 45% are children, including 22.7%
adolescents aged 10-19 years. With an annual growth rate of 2.4%, the population doubles every 29
years, increasing pressure on social systems, which is compounded by rapid urbanization. Pakistan is a
low-income country with a GDP per capita of 1547.9 USD. On the Human Development Index (HDI)
Pakistan is ranked 150 out of 189 countries. After experiencing a decline in poverty to 24.3% in 2016,
Pakistan has seen rapid increase in poverty especially the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2018,
the government has embarked on a reform programme to address poverty, malnutrition, climate change
and fiscal instability. With different COVID-19 variants threatening the world, socioeconomic challenges
for Pakistan are likely to persist for the foreseeable future. The object of this evaluation is the UNICEF
Pakistan Country Programme 2018-20221 which is aligned with UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021.
The CP was presented to the UNICEF Executive Board for approval in September 2017 with a budget of
USD 600 million – USD 156,270,000 of which were financed from regular resources and USD
443,730,000 from other resources.2 The stated goal of the CP was “to enable girls and boys, including
adolescents to benefit from effective child-focused policies, services, and clear accountabilities”.
Rationale and Objectives of the CPE
The evaluation of the CP was carried out in line with UNICEF’s revised Evaluation Policy3which requires a
country programme evaluation at least once every two programme cycles. The main purpose of the
Pakistan CPE was to inform next Country Programme (2022-2026) design and support managerial
decision-making at country office level in preparation of the country programme and foster
organizational learning, especially in areas where the country programme components have not
achieved the intended results, provide an independent assessment of how selected results were
achieved (or not) and the factors that contributed to the achievement or lack of it.
The CPE focused on the theory of change for the different sections of the CP, changes in the TOC across
the cycle, including the extent to which these changes were implemented and the extent to which the
implemented TOC was relevant to meet the needs of children were explored. The evaluation was not
meant to be an evaluation of whole country program. It was supposed to focus on assessment of DAC
criteria4, relevance, coherence and effectiveness of nine selected themes in the five different sectors.
A key consideration was the amount of budget consumed, balanced by a negotiated understanding,
between ROSA and Pakistan Country Office, of the relative utility of the evaluation of different themes.
The themes selected for the evaluation included upstream activities and Alternative Learning
Pathways (ALP) in Education; Maternal Neo-natal and Child Health (MNCH) and Expanded
Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Health, Stunting and Wasting in Nutrition; Open Defecation
Free (ODF) and Handwashing with Soap (HWWS) in WASH; Birth Registration (BR) and Violence
Against Children (VAC) in Child Protection.

Evaluation Methodology
The evaluation used a mixed method approach, making use of desk review documents, key informant
interviews and group interviews. These were complemented by online, quantitative, perception survey. In
all 256 respondents participated in the evaluations, of which 191 participated in interviews (53 via key
informant interviews and 138 in group interviews) and 65 responded to the online survey. The design
and implementation of the evaluation was informed by Gender Equality and Human rights-Based
approach. Keeping in view restrictions on movements during COVID-19, the evaluation by design
primarily relied on remote data collection methods using remote meeting applications Zoom and Teams
Key Findings and Conclusions
Key findings and conclusions have been synthesized according to the DAC Criteria of Relevance,
Coherence and Effectiveness.
Relevance
All the interventions assessed were highly relevant and addressed important needs and were
aligned with the intended goals of their respective programmes. For example, UNICEF's heath
programming has focused on neonatal survival and immunization, using an integrated approach
that targets the most vulnerable population to address the issue of high neonatal and child mortality
rates and enhancing the proportion of children fully immunized. The Nutrition programme addresses the
very important issue of wasting and stunting through downstream and upstream interventions. ODF
interventions were relevant because open defecation, although on decline, remains an issue in
Pakistan, with more than 60% of households lacking access to toilets in some districts. Promotion of
HWWS was highly relevant because it is the second most cost-effective WASH intervention and one of
the most important ways to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. Two interventions of Child Protection
programmes, BR and CP-CMRS in Baluchistan were also very relevant to protect children from
neglect, abuse and exploitation, and provide systems to ensure the registration of every child and an
integrated mechanism that prevents and responds to cases of child abuse. Upstream interventions in
education were highly relevant because of a huge policy and planning vacuum in the provinces
generated after the 18th Amendment. The ALP program was adequate to address needs and achieve
the intended goals but not sufficient to enroll a significant number of children. The relevance of some
of these interventions like ALP and CP-CMRS should be seen in the light of the potential for replication.
During the CP 2018-22, UNICEF's strategic positioning was based on a close and trust-based
relationship with national and provincial governments. It was also reinforced by UNICEF’s upstream
work and the great contribution made to systems strengthening through evidence generation,
policy development; the introduction of equity-focused and gender responsive plans; advocacy;
and capacity development to enhance technical skills at the federal and provincial levels. UNICEF’s
work was also recognized for its ability to mobilize and promote strategic dialogue among different key
stakeholders and between the federal and provincial levels. UNICEF was also successful in leveraging
resources and policies. It was seen as a reliable partner in terms of piloting innovative
interventions which could be scaled up to bring about significant change. It piloted promising models,
with its own or donor funding, and if successful, it advocated for replication of these initiatives, policy
developments and reform at the federal and provincial levels. However, UNICEF’s upstream work was
limited by challenges related to the high turnover of high-ranking government officials which could
compromise the quality and effective implementation of the programmes, especially at the
provincial level. Upstream work was also sometimes affected by poor institutional memory and weak
knowledge management (e.g., limited documentation of how change happens in government
agencies).
UNICEF also provided downstream support through the provision of commodities and supplies and also
provided technical support on C4D. UNICEF was recognized for its capacity to mobilize communities and
communicate for social behavior change. However, C4D, when implemented through government
agencies, was only occasionally successful because it was limited by the government’s technical
capacity for C4D and motivation to position certain UNICEF priorities. C4D was also affected by the
6
verticality of programmes and the way that the PCO and FOs were structured., although it is now in the
process of strengthening C4D capacities in the provinces. C4D was seen by different stakeholders as an
area for improvement, especially in the area of MNCH and nutrition. In case of WASH the handiwork of
UNICEF was not visible when it comes to influencing hygiene promotion related practices of PHEDs
and local government departments.
Within this CP, UNICEF successfully addressed the needs of some of the most marginalized
communities by selecting geographic areas based-on evidence gleaned from key national level
surveys, sometimes balanced by other considerations, including justified political considerations and
security concerns. The use of survey data brought a great deal of objectivity and specificity to the
selection process, but occasionally restricted partners from making use of their knowledge of the
context as was the case in downstream WASH interventions. On the whole, UNICEF CP’s
interventions were spread across the four provinces including AJK and GB. However, there were some
geographic areas or districts which despite being extremely vulnerable remained excluded due to
concerns related to poor security and remoteness. Despite UNICEF’s efforts to work in urban slums,
the scope of such work appeared limited considering the lack of LHWs in some of these densely
populated areas. The CP also considered the needs of women and girls in its programme strategies and
included gender equality considerations in all programmes. However, different sources of information
confirmed that much more needs to be done in the programmes to adequately address the root causes
of gender inequalities in different contexts.
The capacity to respond to the holistic needs of the communities that UNICEF worked with,
particularly children, and especially the most vulnerable girls, was limited by working in silos. Silo
approach limited UNICEF's ability to develop comprehensive interventions that responded to the holistic
needs of the communities that it worked with. It affected many facets of work, including how needs
were identified, how UNICEF selected partners, how they approached government counterparts
and how UNICEF implemented its interventions. The silo approach was also influenced by a
hierarchical and silo culture that was also observed among governmental counterparts, indicating an
organizational culture that is very difficult to change and which requires long-term progressive solutions.
In response to COVID-19, UNICEF quicky adapted to the changed context and provided leadership
for the COVID-19 response, especially in WASH and Education, but also together with WHO in Health,
ensuring continuity of services to protect the most vulnerable women and children. UNICEF focused on
both upstream and downstream activities. UNICEF's upstream interventions were more strategic and
focused on developing sector-specific response plans and guidelines for implementation, together with
the relevant ministries at the federal level. UNICEF also participated in key committees and working
groups established to facilitate the COVID-19 response. It contributed to develop technological solutions
and facilitated coordination of the cross-sectoral response. UNICEF gradually adapted to changing
context and ceased a unique opportunity presented by the pandemic to promote its own agenda. As
downstream activities, UNICEF also contributed to increase the routine vaccination, facilitated essential
supplies and trained frontline healthcare care workers. It also had an important role communicating
and disseminating messages in response to COVID-19. UNICEF also introduced innovations to ensure
continuity of essential services and included new initiatives, such as mental health issues, that were not a
priority before the pandemic.
Coherence
The UNICEF CP is consistent with the SDGs, to which Pakistan is a signatory. More specifically it
contributes to the nine out of 17 SDGs. It contributes to SDGs 2, 3, 4, 6 through its sectoral interventions
in nutrition, health, polio eradication, education, WASH. The child protection programme addresses
indicators under SDG 5, 8 and 16. SGD 5 (gender equality), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) are concerns
that cut across all the sectors, while both SDG 16 (strong institutions), and SDG 17 (partnerships) are two
important approaches or delivery mechanisms for the current CP. UNICEF CP is also consistent with
Vision 2025 that identifies seven priority areas, which are also linked to SDGs. UNICEF also aligned its
strategies to two additional sources of priorities that emerged during the implementation of the CP, which
were the Ehsaas programme and the COVID-19- Pakistan Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP).
7
UNICEF directly complemented the government’s efforts as it increasingly worked directly with
government agencies. Through its upstream activities in different sectors (including, education, health,
nutrition, WASH and CP) it provided thought leadership and served as source of technical support for
developing policies, strategies, and plans. UNICEF helped to bring gender equality and equity issues
to the forefront and complemented the government in developing sector plans as well as social
mobilization initiatives that took gender and equity issues into account. However, it was widely
acknowledged that efforts to mainstream gender as a cross-cutting theme were insufficient to
enhance gender-transformative programming.
Effectiveness
The results achieved under the BR programme were generally very positive. UNICEF went from
providing service delivery in two provinces, to supporting four provinces and one region (AJK) and
achieved the expected targets which in some cases, were met beyond expectations. As part of this
support, the BR programme also facilitated the reform and modernization of the CRVS National Policy
and CVRS systems. However, there is still a lack of demand among the population for registration.
Challenges of implementation include disconnects between the federal and provincial databases, the
need to simplify the BR process, technological difficulties, connectivity issues and the low capacity of
government officials to carry out BR processes. The main limitation identified is that the process of BR is
not yet mandatory.
As a main result, the CP-CMRM supported by UNICEF in Balochistan, generated government
ownership and scale-up through an allocation of resources. The government of Balochistan demonstrated
its commitment through the establishment of the first District CPU in Quetta, and the approval of further
roll out of the CP-CMRM in ten additional districts. The CP-CMRS was also able to mobilize multiple
local government departments engaged in the public case management and referral system. The
programme still has some challenges that are linked to inadequate budgetary allocations and limited
technical human resources. In addition, further engagement is needed from different government
departments like police, prosecution and the Home and Tribal Affairs Department. The model is
also advancing efforts to strengthen evidence-based policy formulation by providing evidence-
based data on VAC.
In the health programme, most of the CP outputs were successfully delivered achieving all the
intended health outcomes except zero polio cases. In addition, UNICEF contributed to moving routine
immunisation from the development budget to the recurrent budget. UNICEF supported provincial
governments in developing child survival strategies, legislative work, advocating for budget
allocation for specific health activities. It also supported the formulation of gender responsive
health related policies and plans. The challenge of quality of care was addressed by UNICEF through
partnerships with professional organizations which contributed to maintain essential services and
improved healthcare quality for mothers and newborns during COVID-19. However, the protocols
regarding integration, particularly between paediatrician and the obstetrician for perinatal care, are
needed and need to be implemented to improve neonatal survival. The capacity of community health
workers (CHWs) women remains a challenge to address the health needs of women and girls.
Nutrition outputs were successfully achieved contributing to positive outcomes, especially a significant
reduction in stunting. Of the three outcome indicators, exclusive breastfeeding increased to 48.4% and a
significant reduction of stunting to 40.2% was reported. Wasting further decreased to 17.7 percent.5
Despite these positive trends, targets could not be achieved in all the three outcome indicators.
UNICEF supported all provinces and regions to develop their respective RMNCAH&N strategies. It also
supported the revision of the National Framework for Stunting Reduction and provincial action plans,
development of the IYCF strategy, and support for legislative work for the Breast Milk Substitutes
Marketing. UNICEF’s advocacy contributed to influencing the Pakistan National Nutrition
Coordination Council to commit to a costed Multisectoral National Nutrition Action Plan and to
5 NNS 2018.

scaling up nutrition-specific interventions. In Punjab, UNICEF supported outpatient therapeutic
programmes (OTP) and Stabilization Centers (SC) in the health facilities and the training of staff.
However, such initiatives are needed in other provinces and areas to train staff at primary health
care centers to adequately detect child malnutrition. Major factors that affected implementation were
related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and 18th amendment. However, UNICEF successfully managed to
work with and support federal and provincial governments to continue implementation of nutrition
interventions.
Despite the upstream Interventions of the education programme, education services do not directly
reach marginalized communities. Gender-responsive and equity-focused provincial Education Sector
Plans that UNICEF supported benefitted the most vulnerable communities, including children and
women, and disadvantaged areas within Pakistan. In terms of the achievement of outputs, of the three
indicators associated with the upstream activities one indicator (development and endorsement of
education sector plans) was achieved. No progress was reported against the other two indicators
(availability of cost-effective innovations to improve access and learning and the existence of an effective
early learning policy with clear budget allocation in place). The most important factor that influenced the
non-achievement the sated targets COVID-19 which caused delays because both UNICEF staff and
government officials had to pay more attention to COVID-19 response. However, COVID-19, also opened
opportunities for upstream contributions to education. The education sector plans formulated collectively
contributed to defining national priorities. The work performed by UNICEF related to systems
strengthening, reform, services delivery and community engagement for demand generation contributed
to the achievement of national level targets but making definitive assessment of relative contribution of
UNICEF is very challenging.
ALP was effective in providing access to education for some of the most disadvantaged boys and girls.
who otherwise would not have had access to education. These included married girls and children who
were engaged in income generating activities to support their families. Through ALP centers, UNICEF
was able to enroll an estimated 35,460 children, there being 30 students in 1182 centers across the four
provinces of Pakistan. This was well below the target of 2016. ALP centers on their own were not
adequate to address the overall need that exists in Pakistan. ALP centers addressed the needs of 0.18%
of the total population of out-of-school children in Pakistan. The ALP programme contributed to
increasing awareness about the issue of out-of-school children, which can be considered an unintended
positive outcome. The ALP model made Punjab Literacy Department more conscious about using its
centers to enroll older age children by demonstrating that it possible to attract older age children.
The ODF intervention was able to address the needs of marginalized communities, including
women, men and children, within more deserving districts. It additionally benefitted the most marginalized
households by giving them in-kind support for the construction of toilets. Of the 966,153 additional
households in Pakistan who gained access to toilets since 2016, 11.8% did so as a direct result of
UNICEF’s ODF interventions. Thus, it contributed to the national target of reducing the proportion the
population practicing open defecation. Though, relatively high percentage of slippage has
remained an issue. Voluntary replication of ODF by some communities on their own was an unintended
positive result. However, potential negative implications of increased demand for water resulting from
construction of pour-flush toilets remained under-studied and undocumented. The most important
external factor that impacted ODF interventions was COVID-19 pandemic. It caused delays in
implementation and severely constrained monitoring activities, restricting achievement of ODF status in
many communities. But COVID-19 also helped to put the WASH agenda at the front and centre of
COVID-19 response. It also created conditions for the WASH programme to tap the potential of social
media in ways that it had never done before.
Because RAM does not include a separate indicator of HWWS (WASH), HWWS results were not
separately reported. However, along with the safe disposal of excreta and safe water handling,
HWWS received special attention in WASH programming. Therefore, as part UNICEF downstream
WASH activities for promotion of HWWS, UNICEF programme also reached some of the most
disadvantaged segments of the population in underserved districts. UNICEF’s upstream activities
contributed to highlight WASH as a socio-technical enterprise which also emphasized the
9
importance of community participation and hygiene promotion activities. Yet, this increased
awareness of the importance of community participation and hygiene promotion among relevant
government agencies was not accompanied by changes in practices, as, with some exceptions in
Punjab province, the hygiene promotion component remains neglected in overall government
WASH interventions.
Lessons Learnt:
The lessons provided below synthesize the learnings from the current CP implementation. The learnings
are expected to have wider impact on UNICEF
• In a context where social service delivery has been devolved to the provinces, it is important to
bring UNICEF's work closer to provincial government counterparts to address the
differentiated needs of each province.
• A siloed approach can promote a silo mentality that limits cross-learning, affects communication
with government counterparts and reduces UNICEF's ability to provide integrated solutions
for beneficiary population.
• The ability to partner with other organizations such as The Aga Khan University and American
Academy of Science, USA allowed UNICEF to draw into a greater pool of technical expertise
to deliver high-quality services efficiently and effectively.
• UNICEF's experience demonstrates that when the use of technology is needed to reach a
very large segment of the population, it is better to rely on technologies already in use rather
than using experimental technologies. UNICEF used SMS and WhatsApp messages to send
awareness messages to communities.
• Some government agencies in Pakistan have a strong preference for infrastructure projects
or, as it were, the 'hard component' and less preference for community mobilization,
awareness raising and training on the operation and maintenance of the schemes. The
C4D function in the government agencies is either non-existent or under-utilized and under-
resourced. This has strong implications for C4D because, in the absence of systems for C4D,
C4D tends to be put on the back burner, which in turn compromises the outcomes associated
with C4D.
• Using differing approaches to partnerships is not necessarily an undesirable thing so long
as strategy is informed by shared, critically scrutinized, and well documented
assumptions.
• Harmful social norms and discriminatory practices towards women and girls can be
influenced better if the root causes of gender inequalities in different provinces are
addressed.
Key recommendations
The recommendations have been structured according to cross-sectoral and sectoral analysis. The
recommendations that are based on the cross-sectoral findings and conclusions have been included in
order of priority except sectoral recommendations that are presented according to sequence of the
chapters.
Cross sectoral recommendations:
Recommendation 1: Strengthen UNICEF's strategic positioning in the provinces by further adapting
programmes to the provincial context, integrating sectoral programmes and ensuring greater coordination
between the different programmes at FO level. It is also important to strengthen the technical and human
resource capacities needed to conduct upstream work. Recipient: UNICEF PCO, FOs, ROSA.
Recommendation 2: Ensure gender-transformative programming and gender integration while
deepening and strengthening the focus on adolescent girls in all programme sections. Recipient:
UNICEF PCO and FOs.
Recommendation 3: Making greater efforts to move away from a siloed approach to a networked
approach in which sectors integrate their efforts without losing sight of the results they want to achieve.
UNICEF could take some concrete measures including the following:
✓ Create a unified theory of change to further integrate programmes at FO level.
10
✓ Work with UNDP to create a Human Development Index for each province
✓ Create incentives for sectors to contribute to improving the composite index.
✓ Rotate of staff in different departments (but also between COs and provinces) could also help staff
to promote dialogue and understanding across sectors. Recipient: UNICEF PCO, FOs, ROSA.
Recommendation 4: Continue to advocate on the importance of community engagement and social
mobilization given the weak capacity of the government to implement C4D for “soft interventions”. At the
same time, UNICEF can continue to partner with NGOs and CBOs to benefit from their social mobilization
and community participation capacities. UNICEF should also facilitate dialogue and linkages between
government and local NGOs and local organizations to increase community outreach. Recipient:
UNICEF PCO and FOs.
Recommendation 5: The approach to partnerships should be guided by a clear strategy that can still
have different approaches that reflect contextual realities of different sectors and FOs, but it should
demonstrate the choices made are thoughtful and deliberate. Recipient: UNICEF PCO and FOs.
Recommendation 6: UNICEF should carefully document the process of its upstream work with the
government and then, through careful analysis, distil lessons regarding how change occurs in
government agencies and regarding the differences between provinces and different departments.
UNICEF can also consider what has been written about bureaucratic reform in Pakistan and add to it
their own knowledge and those of other UN partners to make more informed decisions. It can also
document what has been learned from the COVID-19 response. Recipient: UNICEF PCO and FOs.
Sectoral reccomendations
Recommendation 7 BR: Continue supporting the provinces in the updating of CRVS policies, upscaling
BR in other districts and strengthening the capacities of BR official levels at the provinces on BR and
prioritizing sites where rates are lowest. Recipient: UNICEF PCO and FOs.
Recommendation 8 VAC: Continue efforts to ensure that all sectors involved in the operation participate
and collaborate so that the child is not re-victimized. Put more effort into the prevention strategy to
publicize the system and raise awareness of the issue of VAC, especially among girls. Ensure continuous
learning for replication of the Model. Strengthen linkages with other organizations to prevent and respond
to GBV and create a method to rapidly deploy and operationalize child protection services in emergencies
(SOPS).
Recommendation 9-ALP: UNICEF should use ALP as a framework for creating multiple pathways to
enroll out of school children. The ALP model being used should be thought of as one of many alternative
pathways. Recipient; Departments, UNICEF PCO and FOs,
Recommendation 10- Health: Advocate and lobby for reforming and strengthening the LHW programme
with a particular focus on expanding it coverage and addressing programme key weaknesses.
Recommendation 11-Nutrition: Continue supporting the provincial/regional health departments in their
efforts to implement the national RMNCAH&N strategy across the country.
Recommendation 11- Nutrition: The role of LHWs in nutrition programmes needs to be bolstered in
order to promote Infant and Young Child Feeding practices and advise mothers on how to feed their
children properly.
Recommendation 13- WASH: C4D and WASH programme should try to revive the underutilized
community mobilization sections of PHED in Balochistan and KP. Recipient: UNICEF WASH program.
C4D Section, PHED Department.
Recommendation 14- ODF: Include a more participatory approach in the selection of beneficiary
communities for ODF interventions. This selection should also be based on local partners' knowledge of
the area and their understanding of what works and what does not work. UNICEF PCO and FO.

1. Introduction
This document is the Final Evaluation Report for the evaluation of the UNICEF Country Programme
Evaluation 2018-2022. The report represents a planning, data collection, and analysis process that began
in June 2021 and is expected to complete in January 2022.
This Final Evaluation Report is divided into 12 sections. Section 1 provides a map showing the
geographical scope of the evaluation and key locations, specifically the locations of the PCO and each of
the provincial FOs. This introduction comprises Section 2. Section 3 describes in detail the purpose of the
evaluation. Section 4 describes the scope of the evaluation. Section 5 describes the methodology of the
evaluation, including key data collection methods; the approach taken to the analysis of the data; gender,
equity and human rights concerns; quality assurance procedures; and the limitations of the evaluation.
Section 6 describes the context of Pakistan at the time that the Pakistan CP was developed and began
implementation, as well as aspects of how it evolved throughout the programme. Section 7 includes a
description of the object of the evaluation – specifically the Pakistan CP. The following two sections cover
the findings of the evaluation broken up into two parts – Section 8 describes the cross-cutting findings
while Section 9 provides findings broken up by thematic sections. Section 10 outlines the conclusions
which emerge from the findings. Section 11 lists the main lessons learned. Finally, Section 12 draws upon
the preceding 3 sections and presents the main recommendations of the evaluation.
An executive summary of the report is available in the opening pages, accompanied by a full list of
acronyms and initialisms. The report also includes a set of annexes6 which provide lists of the documents
reviewed in conducting the evaluation, the full list of references (which are primarily located in the
footnotes of the page on which they appear), the terms of reference, the inception report and the
evaluation matrix in full. This Final Evaluation Report was finalized on the basis of feedback received from
UNICEF.
2. Pakistan Country Context
Pakistan (formally named ‘The Islamic Republic of Pakistan’) is located in South Asia, bordering the
Indian Ocean to the south, India to the east, China to the north, Afghanistan to the north-west, and Iran to
the south-west.7 The country occupies a land area of 882,363 square km and has a coastline of roughly
1000 km. Administratively, the country is split into 4 provinces (Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
Punjab, and Sindh) and two territories (AJK and GB). The latest census (2017) places Pakistan’s
Population at 207,774,520 million people, with a sex ratio of 105.07 men/100 women and an average
annual growth rate of 2.4%.
In 2017, Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP - nominal) was USD 304,951.82 billion, placing it at
the 41st position according to the World Bank.8 Pakistan’s Human Development Index (HDI) score for
2017 was 0.562, placing it in the medium human development category and positioning it at 150 out of
189 countries. GDP per capita was 1547.9 USD, which put Pakistan into the ‘low-income category’
according to WB categorization system. At the time, around 2018 Pakistan was facing a significant
current account deficit crisis which at its lowest point fell to USD -6321 million. This crisis had mostly

resolved towards the end of 2020.9 In the financial year June 2018, Pakistan achieved a growth rate of
5.8%,10 which was the highest rate achieved in 13 years. However, from that point onwards growth
continued to slow due to the uncertainty about the economic policy around the over-valuation of the
rupee. Growth reached a low point when COVID-19 response containment measures were put into
place in mid-2020, resulting in a contraction of 1.5% in GDP. Leading into the start of the PCP, Pakistan’s
poverty rate had declined significantly to 24.3% in 201611. Despite this progress, roughly one-third of the
population still lived below the poverty line and a significant proportion remained vulnerable to poverty.12
The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a surge in poverty levels, rising from 4.4% to 5.4% with more
than two million people falling below this level.
With respect to CP, in 2017, it was found that on average, 76% of children experience psychological
aggression, 66% experience physical punishment, and 31% experience severe physical punishment.1314
Only 7% of children were found to experience non-violent forms of discipline. Under Section 89 of the
Pakistan Penal code, under 12 years of age, physical and psychological violence is legally condoned.
Data on CP issues is generally scarce, although this is especially the case for data on sexual violence
against children – unofficial studies suggest that 15-25% of all children in Pakistan endure some form of
child sexual abuse. Child marriage was reducing for children under the age of 15 but remained an issue.
For a long time, the 1996 National Child Labour Survey was the only one available – this survey found
that at least 3.3 million children between 5-14 years of age were economically active. As of August 2021,
the PBS is conducting a new child labour survey, but this is still in progress and the data has yet to be
released. At the time that the PCP began, no quality child protection and case management system had
been established anywhere in the country. The PDHS 2012-2013 found that the BR rate for children
under 5 stood at only 34%.15 The rate of BR was found to be in rural areas, particularly for new-born
children and those born to poor families. One study16 found that the key issues hampering birth
registration were a weak registration system, low demand among the population, social norms, and the
existence of marginalized populations (refugees, minority groups etc.).
In terms of education, several key steps had been taken by the time the PCP started. Key events include
the 2010 legislation in the constitution of free and compulsory education for children 5-16 years of age,
the development of subnational workplans, and an increase in the budget of 27% from 2013 to 2016.17
However, significant challenges remained to be addressed. Enrolment rates remained slow, and Pakistan
did not achieve its MDG targets of universal primary education and gender parity in education. Boys
continued to outnumber girls at every level within the education system and significant disparities were
found to exist between urban and rural areas and between provinces. Education infrastructure continued
to have significant gaps and an estimated 22.6 million children between the ages 5-16 were out of school
– Pakistan ranked as the country with the second-highest number of OOSC at the primary level. Key

systemic challenges included finance limitations, weak enforcement of policies, and challenges in
delivering education in an equitable fashion.
In terms of health, immunization was one of the key challenges in 2017 which significantly impacted the
survival of children – it was found that only 54% of children between 12-23 months were fully
immunized.1819 In particular, Polio was and remains an ongoing concern, with 8 cases reported in 2017
and millions of children remaining unvaccinated.20 The availability, quality, and utilization of neonatal care
were also low, with skilled birth attendants being present only at 52% of births and the neonatal mortality
rate was 55 per 1000 live births according to the 2012-2013 PDHS. There were and remain significant
disparities in access to healthcare in general and neonatal and immunization services in particular
between urban and rural areas; the wealthy and the poor; levels of education and between provinces.
Other key factors impacting the health of children were poor breastfeeding practices, sanitation and
hygiene issues, and insufficient awareness among the public of issues relevant to child health. All of the
above contributes to low birth weights, premature births, and high infant (74/1000) and under-5 (89/1000)
mortality rates. Immunization gaps exist across multiple dimensions, including for marginalized children,
remote areas, poorer provinces, and other access barriers. This can be seen, for example, in the fact that
in 2017, the immunization coverage of Punjab stood at 65.6% compared to just 16.4% for Balochistan.
In 2017, nutrition-related indicators were generally showing signs of improvement in response to
significant investment by the GOP.2122 Child stunting rates in Punjab dropped to 34% in 2014, from 38%
in a previous survey. Nevertheless, stunting remained a significant problem. According to 2011 National
Nutrition Survey Data, 43.7% of children under the age of five across the country were found to be
stunted while 31.5% were underweight and 15.1% were wasted. Stunting was higher in rural (46.3%)
areas compared to urban (36.9%) areas.23 Significant disparities also exist between the provinces in
terms of the intensity of stunting, with Sindh (56.7%) having the highest rate compared to a rate of just
(39.8%) in Punjab. Meanwhile, in many areas wasting was and remains high, even reaching emergency
levels (over 10%) with there being a significant urban-rural divide in this indicator as well. Poor diet quality
was a key challenge, either due to awareness or lack of access to a variety of foods. In particular,
children under five and pregnant mothers were found to have serious micronutrient deficiencies. By 2017,
progress had been made in the development of multi-sectoral nutrition plans, with Punjab and Sindh in
the early stages of implementing their respective plans, but the other provinces were less advanced on
this front.
In terms of WASH, according to the WHO/UNICEF JMP24, by 2015, at the national level, 89% of the
population had access to at least a basic water supply with 37% of the population having a safely

managed water supply. At least basic hygiene facilities (handwashing) were available to 60% of the
public, and 58% of people had access to sanitation facilities (with 20% having access to safely managed
sanitation facilities). By 2019, According to the recent PSLM (2019-20), 10% of people in Pakistan are still
without any toilet, with 9 % each in Punjab and Sindh, 11% in KP, and 17% in Balochistan. In terms of
indicators, inter-provincial disparities are not extreme although Balochistan continues to face the greatest
challenges in this regard. However, there remained a notable degree of disparity between urban and rural
areas in terms of access to sanitation facilities.
Three other broad contextual factors impacted the design and implementation of the 2018-2022 PCP.
First, the continued impact of the 18th amendment, promulgated in 2008, which devolved many powers
and responsibilities down to the provincial level, continues to shape UNICEF’s role. Each provincial
government has faced the challenge of developing its ministries, policies, and strategies. Much has been
accomplished since 2008, but even in 2017, numerous departments in different provinces were still in the
process of launching and gaps remained in the policy environment. Second, the merger of the ex-FATA
region into KP has had a significant effect on the priorities of the KP government – upon integration, this
region lacked a great deal of government infrastructure and systems for service delivery.
Finally, the advent of the COVID-19 Pandemic in late 2019/early 2020 greatly shaped the global and
national contexts. All of UNICEF's activities, including social mobilization, were disrupted by the
pandemic. The education sector had to cope with the closure of schools while exploring alternative ways
of providing continuing education using technologies such as the internet, television, and radio. However,
access to these technologies has been limited, especially among poor households, and many of these
children were deprived of learning opportunities in schools. It is beginning to be assessed that COVID-19
has caused learning losses. In the health and nutrition sector, the provision of and access to health
services at the federal and provincial levels has been disrupted. Public health budgets were also
depleted, and household finances and out-of-pocket health care expenditures were strained. The
pandemic led to a significant drop in immunization coverage; Mother and Child Health Weeks were
suspended as well as polio campaigns, and community vaccinators were unable to go door-to-door or
hold group discussion sessions with adequate security measures. On nutrition, there has been an
increase in food insecurity and vulnerability of food systems, with an urgent need to put more emphasis
on strengthening food security and health, reducing inequalities in access to health services, and also
focusing more on preparedness. In WASH Covid-pandemic, at least, initially dealt a major setback to
WASH programme, particularly putting community outreach activities on hold and constraining ODF
interventions. Staff were unable to attend their offices and because of restrictions on movement, the
UNICEF community engagement network was virtually immobilized. Contacts with government officials
were also halted and UNICEF and partners staff were unable to monitor field operations as if everything
had come to a standstill. In child protection, birth registrations during and after COVID-19 declined as
systems were unavailable and all offices closed, including the Child Protection Unit.
3. Object of the Evaluation
The object of this evaluation is the UNICEF Pakistan Country Programme 2018-202225 which is aligned
with UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2018-2021. The Pakistan CP was developed in 2017 after a consultative
review process that took inputs from a variety of stakeholders and also drew upon context analysis and
the lessons learned from the previous (2013-2017) CP. The CP was presented to the UNICEF executive
board in September 2017 with a budget totaling USD 600 million (USD 156,270,000 from regular
resources and USD 443,730,000 from other resources).26 The stated goal of the CP is “to enable girls
and boys, including adolescents to benefit from effective child-focused policies, services, and clear

accountabilities”. UNICEF interventions cover the whole Pakistan country, including its four
provinces – Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and KP (including MD). In addition, to smaller extent, it also
covers AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.
UNICEF Pakistan developed the country programme by analyzing the current country situation with
regard to child deprivations in UNICEF programme areas; using available evidence and strategic priority
filters to determine major outcome areas; and by consulting sectoral and provincial partners to identify
major strategies and outputs for focused work toward mutually agreed outcomes. It was clearly aligned
with the government’s priorities as outlined in Vision 2025 and provincial growth strategies, as
well as with the SDGs 1-6 and 16, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), and the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2018-22. Since Pakistan implemented
the One Programme (OP) and it was entering into OP III I at the moment of designing this CP, UNICEF’s
country programme was also fully aligned with 7 of the 10 proposed outcomes of UNDAF/One
Programme III (2018-2022)27. The CP also identified strong links between federal and provincial
governments to ensure the sustainability of policy initiatives and to remove missing links with respect to
accountability to create a stronger alliance for child rights within Pakistan.28
The CP was based on lessons learned from the previous Country Programme that highlighted the
need for a greater focus on effectiveness and sustainability. Key lessons learned included a) pilots and
projects need to be properly assessed to determine the feasibility of upscaling, leveraging and introducing
upstream work to address inequities; b) sectorial interventions have helped to achieve results, however
more multi-sectoral work proved to be more effective, and c) behavioral change initiatives take time, but
have proven necessary for real change to take place. Based on these lessons learned, the CP
emphasized different priorities; adopting more evidence-based advocacy; shifting from a project to a
programme approach; a balance between development and humanitarian work; and a focus on
strengthening partnerships with the government and the private sector. The CP also aims to take a multi-
sectoral approach to key cross-cutting challenges, including Early Childhood Development (ECD). The
mainstreaming of equity, social policy, gender, Communication for Development (C4D), and Disaster Risk
Reduction (DRR) are other focus areas.
The CP design addressed a number of implementation risks and considered the ongoing impact of
the devolution of powers and responsibilities to the provincial level under the 18th Amendment. It reflected
the differences between provinces, notably the fact that Punjab and, to a lesser extent, Sindh had been
more successful than the other provinces at developing the capacity of their provincial governments. In
contrast, the provincial authorities in Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as governance
structures in FATA relied more on direct service delivery. The CP also emphasized the ongoing shift of
UNICEF Pakistan towards upstream activities, given the uneven level of institutional maturity and
capacity of the governance structures in the provinces. The CP also took into account that Pakistan’s
national and provincial capacity to reduce the risk of and to mitigate the effects of, both natural and
manmade disasters had improved considerably, although it recognized that stronger coordination
between the humanitarian and development interventions of international development partners could
also be further improved. It envisaged that UNICEF’s activities in emergency response would have to
be reduced in the new programming period without previewing of course the sudden emerge of the
Covid Pandemic
27 “This United Nations Sustainable Development Framework for Pakistan (UNSDF), also known as the
Pakistan One United Nations Programme III (OP III) 2018-2022, is a medium-term strategic planning
document that articulates the collective vision and response of the UN system to Pakistan’s national
development priorities. It highlights activities to be implemented in partnership with the Government of
Pakistan, as well as in close cooperation with international and national partners and civil society.”

Note.
Given the thematic and geographic scope of the CP, encompassing a wide array of development and
humanitarian issues across the country a variety of stakeholders were engaged at various levels. The
CP highlighted the fact that UNICEF CP was moving toward upstream activities, given the uneven level of
maturity and capacity strengthening of the governance structures in the provinces. therefore, it envisaged
differentiated modes of engagement with partners and stakeholders29 . The CP emphasized engagement
with:
• Government stakeholders. This included working with government entities at the federal,
provincial, and local levels. At the federal and provincial levels, UNICEF engaged with departments such
as the MONHSR&C, MoPDR, PHED and the education ministries in order to advocate for and support the
development of national and provincial sectoral plans and to provide technical support and conduct
capacity building activities. As an example, each FO sought to engage with the provincial PHED in order
to support the development of drinking water and sanitation policies.
• NGOs/CSOs: UNICEF also continued to engage with some NGOs/CSOs, e.g., by working with
the Indus Resource Centre in Sindh to support ALP activities or by engaging BRSP, DANESH in
Balochistan in relation to WASH and VAC.
• Private sector: there was also a limited degree of involvement of private sector stakeholders. For
example, UNICEF worked to connect Telenor, a telecommunications company together with NADRA and
provincial governments to support the upscaling of digital birth registration systems. In addition, the
private sector was contracted for some downstream activities such as the direct construction of
handwashing stations and water supply schemes.
• Beneficiary communities and community-based development stakeholders were involved in
the in the CP, they were engaged in consultations, they participated in information sharing sessions and
they also received UNICEF support.
3.1 Country Programme Theory of Change
Using the standard RAM indicators, each programme section developed its results frameworks for each
of the outcome areas. They were accompanied by the development of Strategy Notes and Theories of
Change for each section outlining the rationalization for the choice of outcome area based on evidence
and prioritization. The strategy note of the overall CP also included TOC statements, but they only existed
in a narrative form, and they were not represented graphically. Considering this, the evaluation
consultants reconstructed the TOC and designed a visual representation of the CP Theory of
Change based on their understanding of the narrative provided in the CP but also based on the more
nuanced understanding of the programme developed during the evaluation process. The ToC aimed to
understand the overall goal and the intended results of the CP, the logical connections between the
various levels of these results, the preconditions or assumptions on which these connections were based,
and any inherent risks that could affect those assumptions and the achievement of results. The following
figure shows the Theory of Change conceptual framework that has been used to evaluate the CP.

Figure 2: Reconstruction of the UNICEF CP Pakistan Theory of Change
The overall goal of UNICEF CP 2018-22 was that girls and boys, including adolescents and particularly
the most disadvantaged, benefit from effective child-focused policies, services, and accountabilities in line
with the recommendations of the CRC. To contribute to this overall goal the CP identified 5 major
outcomes for UNICEF in 2018-22 related to each of the sections:
1. HEALTH: Neonatal and Child Health Outcome: By 2022, the most disadvantaged newborns and
children benefit from integrated newborn and child health interventions and healthy behaviours.
2. NUTRITION: Nutritional Status of Girls and Boys Outcome: By 2022, the most vulnerable boys
and girls, as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women through improved utilization of services
and improved practices show a measurable reduction in stunting and wasting.
3. EDUCATION: Children in School and Learning Outcome: By 2022, more children, particularly
girls and the most disadvantaged, benefit from equitable and appropriate early learning and basic
education.
4. CHILD PROTECTION: Children are protected from violence, neglect, and exploitation.
a. Outcome (VAC): By 2022, girls and boys access child protection preventive and/or
response services, as appropriate, primarily through public case management and
referral system, in at least two provinces and one territory of Pakistan, and communities
practice positive behaviours contributing towards a protective environment for children.
b. Outcome (BR): By 2022, 65% of girls and boys under-5 are registered in Pakistan, with
universal birth registration achieved and embedded within the Civil Registration and Vital
Statistics (CRVS) system, in at least two provinces of Pakistan.
5. WASH: Safely Managed Water and Sanitation Services Outcome: By 2022, more people in
Pakistan including women and children and the most deprived stop practicing open defecation,
and have access and use safely managed water and sanitation services in rural and deprived
urban areas.
In terms of accountability, the CP established direct links between Programme outcomes and Programme
staffing structures both in the PCO and the FOs. The structure was broadly uniform across programmes,
comprising two streams:
a) Supply-side with responsibilities for strengthening governmental delivery systems and facilitating
and enabling the legal and regulatory environment. UNICEF aimed to train, assist and support duty
bearers to effectively reach disadvantaged children/families, particularly those in urban areas, through the
proposed support in improving policies, financing, and implementation strategies for services benefitting
children’s rights.
Supply-side interventions include upstream and downstream interventions. Upstream
interventions include technical support for developing policies, plans and budgets, and
systems strengthening through evidence generation and advocacy work. They also include
downstream interventions by indirect and direct contribution to Service Delivery. Indirect
contribution is made by strengthening the capacity of the government to deliver services
more effectively and the replication of innovative models in partnership with governments.
Direct service delivery is through the delivery of logistics commodities and services through
NGOs and government agencies.
b) Demand-side with responsibilities for increasing awareness through behavioral change and via
non-governmental and other partnership building and engagement. It also entailed embedding C4D and
community engagement in a cross-thematic manner. UNICEF aimed to support communities, families,
and parents to adopt positive attitudes and behaviours for improved childcare at home, and for more
timely and effective use of social services when required.
The TOC included some bottlenecks that might have made the implementation of the different
interventions and the achievement of results more difficult. The CP identified as a bottleneck the weak
institutional capacity at Province and District levels and the difficult coordination between the
Federal & Province levels. Insufficient resources of the government were also considered a bottleneck,
especially at the province level. Disparities between rural and urban populations, urban slums were
also identified as a challenge. The negative impact of social norms, harmful practices, economic
scale, and gender inequalities also represented a major challenge for the country program.
The assumptions included in the ToC included the assumption that the decentralization process
continued under the 18th Amendment and that the continuity of essential services would be guaranteed
despite the COVID-19 pandemic. It also assumed that there would be political stability in the provincial
and national governments, that the government would continue to maintain its priority on the mandate
represented by UNICEF as well as assuming ownership. The greatest risks identified were that the
delivery of essential services could be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic or that national and
provincial government priorities could have changed. Access/service delivery could also be compromised
at scale by humanitarian situations and there could be insufficient prioritization and allocation of
resources at the province and national level.
4. CP Evaluation Purpose
As per the Revised UNICEF Evaluation Policy30 the PCO is required to undertake a country programme
evaluation at least once every two programme cycles. According to the revised policy, a UNICEF
evaluation, “serves interrelated purposes in support of the organization’s mandate. It supports learning
and decision-making, which in turn contributes to better results for children.” The TOR for this CPE listed
the following areas that are to be assessed:
1. Inform programme design and support managerial decision-taking at country office level in
preparation for the next the country programme. Recommendations are to be provided which
must be specific enough that necessary actions can be determined in response.
2. Foster organizational learning about what works and does not work, especially in areas where
the country programme components have not achieved the results.
3. UNICEF has an accountability to design and implement programmes at a standard of excellence.
The evaluation will support accountability by providing an independent assessment of how
selected results were achieved (or not) and the factors that contributed to the achievement or lack
thereof.
It should be noted that due to time constraints, this CPE was not intended to measure the full results
framework. This evaluation needed to be able to generate findings in time to support the development of
the next country programme (2022-2026). This CPE was particularly significant to UNICEF not only
because it was the final one before the next country programme, but because no CPE was undertaken in
the past two programme cycles, only a mid-term review and some thematic evaluations.
The TOR built on the purpose statements and defined the following specific objectives for the evaluation.
1. The CPE should provide an independent assessment of the relevance of the country
programme – focusing on specific programmatic areas – to local needs and context. The focus in
this question will be on areas that have not fully achieved results based on [the] results in the
UNICEF RAM for 2020 i.e., ECE, polio elimination, stunting and wasting.
2. The CPE should provide an independent assessment of results achieved – focusing on specific
programmatic areas – and explanatory factors for their achievement.
3. The CPE should provide an independent assessment of the internal and external coherence of the
programmatic focus areas and whether UNICEF is well-positioned to play a strategic role to advance
the goals in the country.
As stated in the TOR, by looking at the completion of Pakistan CP while at the same time focusing on
issues of strategic positioning and relevance, the CPE had a forward-looking lens that enabled PCO to
learn from its implementation as a new Pakistan CP was planned and developed. The CPE complimented
findings from the Situation Analysis, the Mid Term Review (MTR), and other assessments in providing
information that was used in planning the next Pakistan CP. The intended results of the evaluation remain
available for the development and fine-tuning of the objectives, components, and strategies for the new
Country Programme 2022-2026. UNICEF and the Government of Pakistan as well as UNICEF
implementing partners are the main users of this evaluation.

levels: did not look at all results achieved (or not) from all components of the Pakistan CP.
Specific sections were selected considering those which were the largest budget
consumers as well as those sections that had not fully achieved the results according to
the UNICEF RAM. Within each section, PCO decided to provide a narrowed down focus
on specific themes:
• Education: upstream education and Alternative Learning Programme (ALP)
• Health: Maternal Neo-natal and Child Health (MNCH) and Expanded
Programme on Immunization (EPI)31
• Nutrition
• WASH: Open Defecation Free (ODF) and Handwashing with Soap (HWWS)
• Child Protection: Birth Registration (BR) and Violence Against Children (VAC)
Baluchistan, Child Protection – Case Management and Referral System (CP-
CMRS)
Sectors Plus Programming sectors were an important but not the only analytic frame. Depending on
the topic the frame were programmes and sectors, or the linkages within the overall
country programme. The sectors and areas of focus noted above were at the core of this
CPE.
Geographical This evaluation covered all four provinces (Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab
and and Sindh) as well as the territories of GB and AJK. In each of the four provinces, the
Territorial focus was on evaluating the activities of the UNICEF FOs. In addition, the PCO, located
Scope in the capital remains at the centre of the evaluation.
It covered the formal start of the programme in 2018 through the current moment (2021,
when the evaluation is being conducted) and looks forward to what is expected to be
achieved by the formal end of the programme in 2022.
DAC Criteria In terms of criteria this evaluation focused on 3 of the 6 current DAC criteria (based on
the revised set issued in December 201932), specifically relevance, coherence and
effectiveness. Efficiency, impact, and sustainability are not criteria of focus in this
evaluation.
Participants Because a critical purpose of the evaluation was to inform UNICEF’s next country
programme, UNICEF stakeholders at the country and regional levels were primarily
involved in the design and governance of the evaluation. However, given that the
evaluation had a focus on the positioning of UNICEF and its Country Programme, the
consultation of external stakeholders is critical to addressing the evaluation questions.

6. Methodology
According to the two-fold purpose of the evaluation assignment, the evaluation is summative, aiming to
both evaluate the outgoing Pakistan CP and inform future programming covering the period from 2023 to
2027. In addition, the evaluation is formative, the findings will be used to formulate forward-looking
lessons learned, conclusions and recommendations to inform the next UNICEF Country Programme.
The overall methodological approach of this evaluation was based on a theory of change approach that
seeks to assess the extent to which UNICEF’s activities have contributed to the achievement of outputs,
which in turn have contributed to the achievement of expected results. In this sense, the evaluation
analysed the processes and strategies implemented during the programme cycle, intending to understand
their relevance, the internal and external coherence of the programmatic focus areas, and the extent to
which the results have or have not been achieved and the role played by the programme. The evaluation
will also explore the internal or external factors that have enabled or prevented the achievement of the
results.
33 While developing the evaluation matrix the evaluation questions included In the ToR were synthesized
them into 3 key question questions. .
The evaluation began in May 2021 and is planned to end in December 2021. The process of conducting
the evaluation spanned four main phases:
Table 3: Evaluation Phases
Evaluation Content
phases
Inception and The evaluation began with a series of meetings between the evaluators and the
Planning phase: evaluation managers on the TOR for the evaluation. The team then conducted an
initial document review, finalized a workplan, and conducted preliminary interviews.
In the interests of time, the team also developed and delivered an inception
presentation to the UNICEF evaluation managers.
Data Collection This phage covered the process of conducting the bulk of the planned group and
Phase; key informant interviews. The survey tool was finalized, and the survey was carried
out through online tools. A number of tracking and organization tools were
developed and implemented internally to record and manage data collection events.
Analysis Phase: Data collected through the interviews, surveys and document review was
processed, analyzed, and triangulated. The team held a number of internal
discussions as part of the process to generate findings and recommendations.
During this stage, a small number of additional interviews were conducted where
possible to fill gaps and the process of document review continued in parallel. At the
end of this phase, a set of preliminary findings were presented to the PCO.
Reporting The final phase of which this finalized version of the Final Evaluation Report is the
Phase: main output. The report finalization process consisted of the development of drafts
and feedback from the evaluation reference group. A final presentation on the
findings and recommendations was also made to ROSA staff and other relevant
stakeholders.

The analysis framework of this evaluation Figure 3: Evaluation Analysis Framework
includes different evaluation themes that
were integrated as the following figure
shows. All of them were assessed using
three important OECD/DAC criteria i.e.
relevance, coherence and
effectiveness. In addition, human rights
and gender mainstreaming aspects were
also assessed. The evaluation specifically
assessed how gender equality, human
rights, and disability issues have been
addressed and integrated into the country
programme. Lessons learned, conclusions
and recommendations have also been
made for the next country programme,
based on the evaluation findings.
Under each criterion, specific evaluation questions and indicators have been developed to guide the
evaluation exercise34. Criteria, questions, indicators, and related data sources have been compiled into
an evaluation matrix that served as the key guiding instrument throughout the evaluation35. The
evaluation is aligned with the UNEG norms and standards36 and the UNICEF Evaluation Guidelines,
including the UNICEF Evaluation Handbook37 and UNEG Guidance on Integrating Human Rights and
Gender in Evaluations38.
6.1 Data Collection Methods
The evaluation applied a mixed-methods approach, making use of desk review documents, key informant
interviews, group interviews, and surveys. In total, 256 respondents participated in the evaluations,
including 191 who were interviewed (53 via key informant interviews and 138 in group interviews) and
65 who responded to an online survey.
Figure 4: Distribution of Respondents by Data Collection Method (n=256)
The consultants consulted a wide range of different stakeholders by maintaining a gender balance in the
sampling of interviewees. In addition, the evaluation includes specific criteria and questions on human
rights and gender equality in the context of the Pakistan CP.
Sampling Strategy
The sampling strategy was based on a thorough stakeholder analysis conducted together with UNICEF
involving document review and inception interviews (UNICEF PCO and FOs). This process produced a
list of all relevant internal and external stakeholders and their categorization, according to their type of
relationship with the UNICEF and their importance to the data collection process. The table below
summarizes the resulting stakeholder classification system.

The evaluation took a participatory, inclusive, gender and human rights-based sensitive approach
by ensuring that the views of a wide range of stakeholders, including those whose voices are usually not
heard, are included. As a result, the evaluation team included all stakeholder types identified, including
the most important partners of UNICEF Pakistan.
The sample selection was carried out through purposeful sampling processes for each data collection
method. At each stage, the targeting of particular data collection methods was carried out in coordination
with UNICEF. The following table provides an overview on data collection methods, means of
implementation and the targeted stakeholder groups.

Desk Review of Relevant Documents
The consultants reviewed 306 documents, some provided by UNICEF and others obtained through own
research. Different UNICEF documents related to the CP 2018-22 were read and analysed, including
MTR assessments, RAM information 2018, 19 and 2020, annual provincial reports, strategy documents,
previous evaluation reports and evaluation summaries among others. The consultants also reviewed
Government and public documents related to policy, strategy and planning processes as well as
publications relevant to the topics covered in the evaluation. They also reviewed different sections of the
UNICEF Pakistan’s public website as well as social media content. In addition, UNICEF manuals and
guidance notes were also reviewed, for example on human rights and gender mainstreaming or on
UNICEF and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). A list of documents reviewed by the team is
provided in Annex 1.
Online Survey of UNICEF’s External Stakeholders
The online survey was conducted targeting UNICEF's external stakeholders, including government
officials (at the federal and provincial levels), NGOs, associations, and the private sector.
• This survey was developed using Google Forms; a mailing list of 253 external stakeholders
provided by UNICEF was used to share a link to the survey. In addition, the survey was
distributed by UNICEF staff at several levels among their networks. Due to this, we cannot
confirm how many people received the survey.
• The survey comprised 7 thematic sections on each of the themes covered in the evaluation:
MHNCH, Immunization, Nutrition, Birth Registration, Violence against Children, WASH, and
Education.
• Each of these sub-sections had between 15 and 20 questions. Most of the questions were
sector-specific, while some were the same for each survey.
• They were prepared and distributed on 11 July 2021 by email to all external stakeholders
including the mail list provided by UNICEF. Additionally, the survey was also disseminated by
UNICEF staff to their networks.
• The survey was open for 3 weeks and closed on 9th August. 4 reminders (11 July, 15 July, 4
August, 23 July 2021) were sent during the time it was open to encourage responses.
The survey respondents belonged to various types of organizations such as Government agencies, semi-
government agencies, NGOs, think-tanks, private entities.
The survey was responded to by 65 people (19 women, 45 men and one person who selected both
categories), 25.7% of the total email list39. The sections that have more participation were Education
(21), WASH (15) and MNCH (13) while Nutrition (7), VAC (5) Immunization (2), and BR (2), received a
lower number of responses.
39 This percentage is approximated and determined by the total number of people that we sent the
survey. However, UNICEF also disseminated it between their networks so the number of people that
received the survey may be higher
Figure 5: Percentage of Survey Responses by Section (n=65)
Table 6: Gender Disaggregation of Survey Respondents (n=65)
Due to the limited number of stakeholders available for the survey, and the segregation of responses by
thematic areas, most thematic questions had low response rates. In response to these
circumstances, the evaluation team combined the responses to some questions that were similar in
each thematic section where possible. The responses to other questions, particularly those with open-
ended responses, were used in combination with other data sources for triangulation purposes. The
quantitative and qualitative data collected through the surveys was extracted from Google Forms in an
Excel file for further processing and analysis. The respective data were organized according to the
evaluation criteria and the questions included in the evaluation matrix.
Semi-Structured Interviews
In total, 86 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 191 interviewees (52 women and 139
men) representing a range of organizations, including UNICEF PCO and FOs, ROSA staff, government
officials, UN agencies, NGOs, associations, and the private sector organizations (as listed in Annex 2).
72.3% of the interviews were individual interviews, while 27.7% were group interviews. All
interviews were conducted virtually, mainly through Zoom calls but occasionally using other methods
such as WhatsApp and phone calls when the call quality through zoom was insufficient.

Structured Interview Respondents (n=191)
a) UNICEF Staff Interviews
Of the 86 interviews, a total of 29 interviews were conducted with UNICEF staff involving 103
respondents. This included interviews with the officials representing ROSA, PCO, and four field offices.
All sections and provinces were represented in the interviews

b) External Stakeholders Interviews
A total of 57 interviews were conducted with external stakeholders with the participation of 88
interviewees. A large majority of interviews (77%) were held with individuals representing government
organizations. NGOs, associations, and the private sector represented 17%, and UN agencies, the
remaining 6%. Of those who represented government agencies, the majority came from the provinces.

6.2 Data analysis
The analysis of the qualitative data began as soon as the data collection started with the team discussing
the patterns and themes emerging from the data collection. As the data collection progressed, the
consultants looked for alternative explanations to validate the different themes and patterns. Formal
analysis took place at the end of the data collection process where the answers to the different questions
were entered into an Excel sheet. In this process, the responses to each question were carefully reviewed
and coded. The responses given by different respondents were read to identify variations between them.
Interview transcripts were also read in their entirety to ensure that the context of specific responses was
preserved. Similar themes were grouped and assigned into categories. In this case, the categories were
determined by the evaluation questions and the OECD. Throughout the process, gender and equity were
used as cross-cutting themes. The analysis identified commonalities and variations in individuals'
responses to common questions. The analysis also involved the development of interpretations, which in
turn involved explaining the results and answering "why" questions, attributing significance to particular
outcomes, and embedding patterns in an analytical framework.
The information obtained through desk review, surveys, and interviews was then triangulated to confirm
and validate information across different information sources. This process led to the formulation of
findings under each evaluation criterion, answering the respective evaluation questions. The findings
were used to draw a set of conclusions. Based on the conclusions a set of recommendations were drawn
and presented in the report. Some early findings and recommendations were shared with UNICEF
country office staff and ROSA. An early draft of the report was also shared with ROSA and UNICEF
Country Office Pakistan for comments and feedback. Their feedback is incorporated in this report. Some
recommendations which emerged during preliminary analysis were validated by sharing those with other
stakeholders.
RAM analysis
Consultants also conducted RAM analysis by reviewing the RAM reports of 2018, 2019 and 2020.
Information on RAM was compiled in an excel template to facilitate the comparative assessment of
quantitative and qualitative information. They also took into account the changes introduced during
the MTR process where some outputs and indicators were added or deleted.
Although the RAM monitoring system and the information provided has improved over the years (the
RAM 2020 system is more comprehensive than in previous years), it still has some limitations which are
listed below:
• Some of the outcome indicators have national level targets. The achievements reported
against these targets do not reflect the relative contribution of UNICEF.
• Some sectoral outputs and indicators did not capture all the streams of activities undertaken
by UNICEF.
• RAM reports did not consistently provide geographically disaggregated data, particularly for
AJK, GB. There was no easy way from the documents provided to build a cohesive picture of the
activities done and the progress made in each province. For example, urban vs rural and provincial
breakdowns were not consistently available.
• At times, third party field monitoring has been identified as a source (means of
verification), even for indicators which would require a representative survey.
• The scale used to rate the progress does not accurately reflect actual progress (e.g., any
progress between 10% or 90% was rated as partially achieved).
• Disaggregation of targets, status and results was inconsistent, often missing. Some targets
were defined on a yearly basis, while others were long term targets for the end of the Country Program (in
2022). This made it difficult to assess them since the evaluation period is focused on the years from
2018-2021.
• The figures/percentages/descriptions provided in the baseline were not always aligned
with the targets and the status statements, nor is it always clear from the RAM structure what was the
source of each baseline.
6.3 Gender, Equity, and Human Rights
The design and implementation of the evaluation took into account the UN and UNICEF's commitment
to a human rights-based approach to gender equality and equity. Throughout the evaluation phases,
the evaluation sought to be participatory and inclusive, integrating gender, equity, and human rights
aspects. The consultants ensured that the evaluation design, including methodology, data collection,
methods of analysis, and the development of different deliverables integrated gender, equity, and human
rights, including children's rights. The evaluation included quantitative and qualitative (mixed) data
collection methods that aimed to collect sex and gender disregarded data. Within the scope of the
evaluation, it was not possible to speak to the most vulnerable directly, but data collection tools included
many questions on human rights and the inclusion of the most vulnerable. Indicators included in the
evaluation matrix were gender and HR-sensitive and evaluation KIs and survey were designed in a way
that let the consultants capture the gender roles, attitudes, behaviors, and roles and included the most
vulnerable.
The consultants applied a participatory approach by including a wide range of different stakeholders
through interviews and surveys, and by maintaining a gender balance in the sampling of interviewees. To
address power bias, senior officials were interviewed separately from junior officials. The evaluation of
geographical equity (distance bias) was addressed by including stakeholders from all four provinces of
Pakistan.
Of the 256 respondents who participated in the assessment, only 30.9% were women while 69.1%
were men. One respondent identified as both male and female (an ‘other’ option was also available to
respondents). This gap is primarily due to the gender distribution inherent to the pool of potential
interviewees, not due to any bias in selection processes. To the extent possible, the evaluation team
sought to collect data from as gender-balanced a group as possible while also targeting all key
stakeholders.
Figure 13: Gender Distribution of Semi- Figure 14: Gender Distribution of Survey
Structured Interview Respondents Respondents
The human rights-based approach, gender equality, and equity were also taken into account during the
document review where gender and human rights aspects and gaps were identified. In order to do that,
the evaluation team looked for information on a) analysis of HR&GE issues, b) evidence of vulnerable
groups being consulted and their concerns being taken on board at the design stage and c) how HR&GE
issues were addressed by UNICEF.
The analysis provided in the evaluation document also assesses the extent to which the implementation
of the intervention addresses gender, equity, and children's rights. The main findings of last year's gender
review have been considered in the different evaluation criteria. The evaluation document includes an
explicit analysis of right holders, duty bearers, and socially marginalized groups, and the differential
benefits received by different groups of beneficiaries, particularly children. Analysis through the gender
and human rights approach lenses is included in the evaluation findings, conclusions and
recommendations.
Ethical Considerations,
Throughout the evaluation process, consultants strictly adhered to applicable UNICEF and UNEG
guidelines for evaluations, including the UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN system40;
the UNEG norms and standards for Evaluation41; the UNICEF Procedure on Ethical Standards in
40 United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG), 2008. UNEG Code of Conduct for Evaluation in the UN
System. Available at: http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/100 [Accessed 18 August 2021].
41 IBID (UNEG, 2017)
Research, Evaluation, Data Collection, and Analysis42; and ‘Response of the UNICEF Evaluation
Function to the COVID-19 Crisis43’. The evaluation exercise adhered to the core UNICEF evaluation
ethical principles of respect, beneficence, justice, integrity, and accountability.
a) Respect
The consultants ensured that the evaluation was sensitive to the beliefs, manners, and customs of
the social and cultural environment. The evaluation did not discriminate on the basis of gender, race,
religion or any other factor.
Consultants respected the rights of institutions and individuals to provide information in
confidence and ensured that sensitive data is protected such that it cannot be traced to its
source. Where appropriate, findings/statements were validated with those who provided the relevant
information. All information was obtained with written or verbal consent. Participants were clearly informed
that their participation was voluntary, that information shared would be anonymous and that the
information they provide would be used outside of the evaluation without their consent.
b) Beneficience
As a high-level country programme evaluation, direct data collection with children was not required,
removing one potential dimension of harm from the process. The evaluation’s purpose is both clear and
vital – the outputs of the process will be used directly to improve the design of the next country
programme in Pakistan which will bring benefits at many levels, both within the country and globally.
In accordance with the UNEG criteria, one of the important components of this evaluation was to
understand the mechanism used by PCO to address issues of equity, inclusion, and human rights, and
gender equality within the programme. Thus, the analysis was triangulated from the perspectives of
gender and the needs of vulnerable groups. The evaluation has been conducted under the principle of
‘do not harm’ by conducting ongoing risk assessments to clarify and mitigate potential and actual harms
that may arise and that go beyond what participants have consented to.
Ethical considerations were applied at two stages:
(i) Prior to initiation of the evaluation:
• An innovative approach was taken to data collection in light of COVID-19. Methods like online
surveys and group interviews for in-depth interviews.
• The participation of 4 national experts in the evaluation team contributed to the perspective on
the national context for framing a holistic and ethical evaluation design.
(ii) During data collection and reporting:
• The consultants managed the list of stakeholders with a view towards confidentiality. The list
was exclusively used for the evaluation and individually identifiable information was removed during

• Since the evaluation was virtual, the evaluation team requested permission in writing and
orally to record the conversation of some respondents. If permission was granted, the team recorded
the conversation for internal documentation purposes only. Only in exceptional cases, where due to
technical glitches or time constraints was not possible to obtain prior written consent, consent was
obtained verbally, but still on record. Written consent44 was obtained using an online Google Form.
c) Integrity:
Consultants ensured that the evaluation exercise was guided by and aligned with ethical principles
and professional standards. Consultants communicated truthfully and openly with different stakeholders
that participated in the evaluation concerning aspects of the evaluation, such as findings, procedures,
limitations, or changes that may have occurred. The evaluators took steps to preserve the
independence of the evaluation from external pressures and conversely sought to avoid
leading/influencing the responses of the respondents. Evaluators also were proven to be transparent
and honest about methodological or technical knowledge on the areas of expertise. There were no
conflicts of interest identified during the evaluation process.
d) Accountability
Evaluators have demonstrated through the inception and evaluation reports that the evaluation was
conducted in a rigorous, fair, and balanced manner and all judgments made were based on solid,
verifiable evidence. The consultants communicated transparently with the UNICEF PCO and ROSA,
addressed any concerns raised, and openly identified and devised mitigation measures for limitations.
a) Independence
Members of evaluation teams were independent and did not have any role in designing or implementing
the programme they were evaluating nor do not expect to have any such role in the near future. The
evaluation team had the freedom to conduct an evaluation and present the findings based on the analysis
of available data.
e) Impartiality
The evaluation team conducted the evaluation in an impartial manner and analysis is done based on the
available evidence. They have taken into account the views of stakeholders and appropriately reflected
these in the report.
6.4 Quality Assurance Procedures
The ROSA Regional Evaluation Advisor, with the support from the Multi-Country Evaluation Specialist,
were in charge of providing the quality assurance of the whole evaluation process, supervising the
assignment, and reviewing the different deliverables including data collection tools, sampling
strategy, inception, preliminary findings, and final presentations. A Reference Group (RG) was also
created to support the consultants with the participation of some UNICEF Pakistan Staff. The roles of the
RG were facilitating access to documentation and persons that had to be involved and reacting to draft
deliverables and other issues as required.
6.5 Limitations of the Evaluation
Overall, the evaluation process went well. UNICEF staff were very cooperative and provided all relevant
information and responded to any doubts or questions, and all stakeholders that were contacted for
interviews agreed to participate. The following limitations were encountered in the evaluation process.
Where possible mitigation measures were taken to reduce the negative impact:

7. Findings
Findings were divided into two sections: cross sector and sector analysis. To avoid the duplication of
information, some evaluation questions were directly addressed in the Cross-sector analysis and some
others in the sector analysis.
1. CROSS SECTORAL ANALYSIS: It integrated the cross-sectoral findings based on the
analysis of relevance and coherence criteria.
2. SECTORAL ANALYSIS: it presented findings for each of the selected themes separately,
covering the three criteria for the evaluation, relevance, coherence and effectiveness.45.
Both sections provided an overall analysis of the upstream and downstream work, where relevant, and
answered the evaluation questions in a comprehensive manner:
• Upstream work: included assessing UNICEF's capacity to advocate for and influence
legislation, policy and systems strengthening, as well as its ability to generate evidence for
advocacy purposes. It also analysed UNICEF's strategic positioning and coordination role
maintained in different areas of work at the federal and provincial levels. It also integrated the extent to
which UNICEF took into account the needs of children, adolescents and young people, especially
the most marginalized.
• Downstream work: covered assessment of technical assistance, C4D and service delivery.
The analysis included a table of key findings that was integrated at the beginning of each section
• COVID19 Response: UNICEF's capacity to respond and adapt to the COVID-19 situation was
also analysed in the cross-cutting section, as all sectors were affected. However, some sectoral analysis
also included information in this regard.
The analysis was based on information drawn from the both primary and secondary source. The desk
review included a review of UNICEF documents and a wide list of external documents, including
Government documents such as policy documents and strategies and relevant publications on the
themes that have been analyzed46.. Primary data collected for the evaluation is detailed above in the
methodology section.
8. Cross-Sectoral Analysis
The cross sectoral findings aimed to provide an intersectoral analysis in order to identify those factors that
were common across the sectors and that reflected the most characteristic features of UNICEF Pakistan
CP under review, including its strengths and areas for improvement. The main findings of the cross-
sectoral analysis responded to some evaluation questions detailed in the evaluation matrix (Annex 4) and
are summarized in the following table:

the selection process, but occasionally restricted partners from making use of their

systems.
• Finding CS5: The silo approach, which was also reflected in the lack of an

8.1 Influencing Legislation, Policies and Strengthening Systems
UNICEF took advantage of the opportunities offered by the 18th amendment to strengthen systems
through policy development, advocacy and ongoing technical support. Building on the opportunities
offered by the devolution, UNICEF had begun to focus more on upstream work under the previous
country programme, but during the current country programme focus was sharpened and intensity
increased. This shift was justified because the devolution had given rise to an unprecedent needs related
to systems strengthening and reform. The approach was also informed by growing realization that
UNICEF needs to move away from a piecemeal approach to capacity building and service delivery to
focus on systems strengthening. UNICEF CP tried to address upstream work through analysis of
sectoral needs, formulation of sector plans, evidence generation for advocacy, advocacy for
implementation of sector plans and equity-based allocations and strengthening technical
capacities.

UNICEF contributed to promoting a culture of evidence-based policy making among in the
governments agencies it worked with. Government stakeholders recognized the great contribution of
UNICEF in providing evidence-based information that facilitated advocacy and awareness-raising on
issues or problems related to its mandate. The best examples of UNICEF’s contribution to evidence
generation were MICs and National Nutrition Survey (NNS), two influential national surveys to which
UNICEF contributed. Both acquired a great deal of significance in informing government policy
(such as the Pakistan’s Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child Adolescent Health and Nutrition
(IRMNCAH) Strategy, which was influenced by the findings of NNS. MICs also cited as an important
source by the government officials as a source of identification of needs. UNICEF also conducted and
supported specialised studies and surveys to inform policy, including for example support to census of out
of school children in KP. The efforts to promote a culture of evidence-base policy also included technical
support UNICEF provides for strengthening M&E systems. Examples include Real Time School
Monitoring Systems (RTMS) in Balochistan and Sindh. In Balochistan UNICEF further strengthened
RTMS and in Sindh it revamped an RTSM which had become dysfunctional, because of lack of internal
capacities. As part of the revamping RTSM in Sindh province, UNICEF also developed internal capacities
to ensure sustainability.
UNICEF was notably successful in leveraging resources and policies. It was seen as a reliable
partner in terms of piloting innovative interventions which could be scaled up to bring about
significant change. It piloted promising models, with its own or donor funding, and if successful, it
advocated for replication these initiatives, policy development and reform at the federal and provincial
levels. Progressively, it moved towards a programmatic approach by supporting federal and provincial
governments for long-term policy reform and institutional strengthening, promoting institutional
change and progressive ownership by the government and its budgets. The following table show some
examples that provide evidence of this48:
48 This table shows some of the examples that are further analysed in each of the sections that are
analysed in section number 10
Table 9: UNICEF Contribution to Leverage Resources and Policies by Evaluation Themes
Evaluation UNICEF contribution to leverage resources and policies
Themes
WASH • UNICEF successfully piloted the Clean and Green Pakistan and Green
Champions programs which resulted in approval USD 800 million of the federal
funding to scale-up these programmers.
Education • ALP models piloted across the four provinces with some contextual
variations. It is being considered for replication in Sindh, Balochistan and KP. In
Sindh plans are at the advance stage for setting up 3000 NFE centers in five
districts through civil society organizations. Government would pay PKR 1000/child
for up to 30 children per center.
Nutrition • Based on the findings of the NNS, Pakistan NNCC facilitated allocation of
U$3.2 billion nutrition-specific development budget. Public finance tracking
support to the SUN units resulted in provincial public allocations for nutrition: US$3
million in Punjab and US$8.4 million in KP.
Health • UNICEF supported the UHC investment case which was owned by the
government. With COVID-19, routine immunization shifted from development to
recurrent budget.
• UNICEF support to UHC investment was instrumental in developing
Pakistan’s IRMNCAH Strategy at the national level, in the four provinces and two
regions.
VAC • Government allocated budget to implement CP CMRS in Quetta and
Balochistan: approved rolling out of the model in additional districts of Balochistan.
Birth • UNICEF moved from the partnership with Telenor to increase BR in 2
Registration provinces in very few districts on really modelling the digital BR in the 4
(BR) provinces. The BR program was taken over by government with budget
allocations and scaling up.
• UNICEF also facilitated and greatly contributed to the CRVS National
Policy reform in the country
However, there were important initiatives, such as the ALP programme, which had the potential to
be replicated and managed by the government, but which still had important questions around the
capacity of provincial governments to do so, and the extent to which the model was capable of being
replicated.
There were some challenges that compromised sustainable organizational change in the government
agencies and government ownership, which were partly related to the high turnover of government
staff and little technical expertise of government counterparts in the government. Some
interviewees confirmed that engaging with some lower-ranking civil servants, who tended to be more
permanent, served to mitigate these challenges. It was also acknowledged that there were some high-
level officials with little technical expertise, especially at the provincial level, which made it difficult
to advocate and position certain issues on the government agenda. At the provincial level, UNICEF Field
Offices sometimes needed to provide support to the government to fill unexpected human resource gaps.
UNICEF's support was often much faster than the rigid and slow government processes. Not engaging
directly with the political leadership (as high as Chief Minister) was also identified as a gap which
implications for stronger political will.
What UNICEF learnt over the years as to how change occurs in government institutions at federal
and provincial level is not well documented. No doubt perceptions about what worked and what and
did not were abound, but well researched nuanced understanding of how change happened in the public
sector organisations in Pakistan and in different provinces did not exist. This meant there was little
institutional memory to help position the various issues according to the context and need in
areas or agencies where change was required. As a result, ToC’s for different sectors were not well
informed by a distillation of lessons learnt regarding how change happened in the government agencies.
As a result, some of the underlying assumptions were rather simplistic. They did not address how, for
example, ESPs or WASH policies has to be implemented.
One of UNICEF staff agreed and said, change management is about “Change is centrally driven, but
changing minds, but “how will we actually change the minds of even cases where there is
people we work with… is not actually referred to in any of the political will, often technical
UNICEF documents.” Interestingly, UNICEF’s own experience

most difficult part.
8.2 UNICEF strategic positioning
UNICEF in Pakistan is only one year younger than the country itself. It has been working in Pakistan
since 1948, which is, perhaps, why it demonstrates an in-depth knowledge of the challenges facing
children in the country, and a high level of awareness of its mandate and activities on the part of
governmental partners. UNICEF is perceived by most of the external stakeholders interviewed for the
evaluation as a long-standing, trusted partner. The long term presence of UNICEF in the country , the
extensive participation of UNICEF staff in different working groups and task forces, as well as the
significant demand for UNICEF advice on policies and strategies also demonstrate the healthy state of
the relationship of UNICEF with the government: A trusted partnership with the Government has
reinforcedUNICEF’s strategic positioning in the country, allowing UNICEF to play an important role along
with other UN agencies and other development actors, including international and national ones. In
addition, UNICEF is the UN coordination lead in WASH, Child Protection and Education.
UNICEF has gained recognition for its technical expertise and its strong capacity for evidence
generation. It is also valued for its ability to mobilize external resources and its strong collaboration
with donors and other international organizations. It is seen as a lead agency for coordination. Most of
the stakeholders consulted acknowledged that UNICEF’s contribution in promoting strategic dialogue
among different key stakeholders, including, for example, Federal Government, provincial governments
and civil society organisations. These dialogues promote exchange of ideas and knowledge, develop
shared understanding, reduce conflict and prejudice and foster cooperation. Some examples of UNICEF’s
coordination role are provided in the following table:

including government at the federal and provincial level, private sector, other UN

WASH UNICEF as the Co-Chair of the WASH Sector Working Group coordinated with 70
members and contributed to drafting the National WASH/IPC COVID-19 Preparedness
and Response Plan
UNICEF has progressively strengthened its strategic positioning in the provinces and its ability to
provide targeted support according to context and needs. Most of external stakeholders value their
presence in the provinces and recognize UNICEFs support in the development of independent
provincial policies, and strategies.
UNICEF has demonstrated a strong capacity to partner with different organizations which are
recognized for their knowledge and strong technical capacities. UNICEF has been able to develop long-
term partnerships with various organisations which understand UNICEF systems, ethos and
expectations better. Examples of organisations with whom UNICEF frequently partners with include
WHO, WFP, Government institutions such as PHED, LGD, MONHSR&C, MoPDR, MFEPT, health and
education departments at the provincial level. They also include a large number of civil society
organisations, including some NGOs known for effective service delivery. Having long term partnerships
also reduces transaction cost and makes it possible to move seamlessly from one project to
another, even when there is a time lapse between two projects. Long term partnership means both
UNICEF and partners understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses and know very well how to
complement each other.
However, there are contrarian views as well. Some attribute this to a certain level of inertia on
UNICEF’s part, that it does not explore new partners as frequently as it should. Not changing
partners can breed complacency and can discourage other enterprising organizations who may wish to
partner with UNICEF but unable to do so because of reliance on its long-term, trusted partners. The
partnerships with NGOs are influenced by a context of shrinking spaces for Civil Society in
Pakistan49 which has direct bearing on downstream activities. Different stakeholders have also
highlighted that NGOs have more difficulties to operate in the country. For example, it was shared by
one of UNICEF programme teams that they had taken a conscious decision “not to work with NGOs,
because it takes a long time for NGOs to obtain NOCs, which has become a key requirement to
implement a project”. Impact on upstream activities has not been direct and pronounced. In fact, more
pragmatic NGOs, are benefiting from increased awareness in the government about importance of
participatory processes to inform policy formulation processes because it gives them space to engage
with the government. Although some partnerships with UN organizations are very strong, as the
partnership with WHO, some stakeholders believe that each UN agency is working on their own
domain and coordination among UN agencies need to be strengthened. As one of the stakeholders
stated, “If there is more synergy in their work it will be more beneficial for us”.
UNICEF has not been successful in leveraging its strategic position with the private sector during
this country programme despite a strong desire to do so. The Pakistan CP recognized that UNICEF
had a positive -- although still limited – experience in partnering with the private sector to deliver services
for children. It emphasized the need of establishing more innovative partnerships with the private

sector50. However, UNICEF has not established many partnerships with private sector beyond those
already established i.e., with Telenor and the IKEA Foundation51. In COVID-19 response, the WASH
programme established a partnership with Unilever to distribute cleaning and disinfection products to
targeted HCFs in Sindh and Punjab. Procter and Gamble Pakistan also participated in supporting
access to MHM products. This limitation is already recognized by senor UNICEF staff and argued that
that lack of relevant expertise is the main reason for this weakness. Apparently, relevant technical
expertise has been recently added to the pool. This person might help to promote a cultural shift in
UNICEF, but involving private sector would also require sustained commitment as well as a critical mass
of people to take the initiative of engagement with the private sector forward.
8.3 Addressing the needs of children, adolescents and young people, and
marginalized sections
UNICEF recognizes that the most disadvantaged children are not only those who are poor. It also
includes a) girls, experiencing serious discrimination and gender disparity; b) religious and ethnic
minorities; c) those in rural and remote areas or urban slums; d) those who are out of school; e)
temporarily displaced; and f) living in disaster-prone areas, among others52. The UNICEF Pakistan
largely focused on girls, including those out of school and rural vs urban, temporally displaced children
and those in disaster-prone areas. No evidence focuses on children belonging to religious and ethnic
minorities was found.
Selection of interventions
UNICEF identified the most marginalized communities in coordination and consultation with the relevant
government agencies for each sector and based on the evidence gleaned key national surveys such as
PSLM, NNS and MICS. UNICEF drew on information from these and other surveys to identified most
deserving areas and populations. The information was sometime balanced by other considerations
including some justified political considerations (e.g., balance between South and rest of Punjab and
urban-rural balance) and security clearance. One senior UNICEF staff acknowledged this, saying that “if
UNICEF were only guided by development indicators, most of their programmes in Punjab might go to
South Punjab, but they must maintain some balance”. Besides, it is not like needs do not exist in central
or northern parts of Punjab. This example reflects the complexity of planning processes, which require
careful balancing of multiple factors. The increased sophistication of information systems and the
availability of more nuanced information with the government departments, for which UNICEF can claim
some credit, has made it easier to identify very specific geographic units within districts, such as a
UC, or even specific villages within UCs. This level of specificity, if data-driven, brought a great deal of
objectivity and specificity to the selection process, but occasionally restricted partners from making use of
their knowledge of the context as it was the case in downstream WASH interventions. In this regard, it is
also important to have some flexibility to capture the contextual realities of each territory, which is
often not captured by big data systems.
Planning and implementation have been affected by the “I can give my opinion only in terms

or systemic analysis. Stakeholder-
In fact, this verticality extends beyond UNICEF to its implementing partners. UNICEF recognizes that
integrated or even convergent programming on key issues requiring a multi sectoral response (such as
the reduction of malnutrition) is still a challenge, especially since counterparts are often structured along
sectoral lines and very much work in their own silos.53 There is some evidence to suggest that the siloed
approach is also reflected in how UNICEF interacts with the government counterparts. Each
UNICEF programme is strongly wired with most relevant government counterpart department. Some
government departments found it difficult to draw on the support of other UNICEF sections that are not
directly linked to them. According to ROSA official, there were two main factors that prevent UNICEF
programmes from breaking out of silos: 1) internal reporting requirements, which require sector-wise
report and 2) the way UNICEF is structured.
The lack of coordination across sectors also has impact on the way the needs of the most vulnerable
are addressed (e.g., the adolescent girls’ needs). In this regard, the adolescent nutrition strategy
supported by UNICEF emphasizes the need of coordination across sectors to integrate nutrition for
adolescents into strategies and programmes for health, education, livelihood development, social
protection, economy, life skills and gender54. In nutrition, malnutrition is still a challenge, especially since
counterparts are often structured and working in a very sectoral way55.
• Geographical coverage
UNICEF’s programmes are spread across Pakistan -- mostly in four provinces, but also in AJK, and
GB. Further down the line, at district level, there are some districts, despite being deserving remain
excluded due to factors such as poor security and remoteness. The phenomenon of an unconscious bias
for rural areas or anti-urban bias is also discernable.
UNICEF experiences difficulties to operate in MD for security reasons. Challenges include
requirement applying three months in advance NOC. Even then there is not guarantee that NOC will be
provided. To overcome this challenge, UNICEF supported different initiatives through government
agencies and some NGOs. UNICEF reached the MD to increase BR (it has established BR cells in 7
districts and has conducted C4D activities). It also provided support on health and nutrition by supporting
DoH in functionalizing newly built hospitals in MD, with the Integrated Nutrition Project (INP) MNCH
Programme EX-FATA, among others. It has also Developed Community Engagement Strategies for
the UNICEF supported interventions. However, the challenge is that malnutrition status, stunting, wasting
level are higher in the MD, IYCF practices are at alarming situation and stakeholders express the need
for a lot of work in these districts.
Baluchistan is a province that is extremely vulnerable and where it is more difficult to work due to higher
costs of operations, security issues and weak government structures. In few cases, selection of districts is
also influenced by security concerns. For example, there are some districts, e.g., Dera Buttig, Musa Khail,
which despite being extremely poor with huge WASH related needs, have not been targeted by WASH
programme because UNICEF cannot obtain security clearance. UNICEF has tried to combine
upstream with downstream work in this province. Direct support and humanitarian response is required
because of the poor indicators and the emergency situation that most of these territories have. As one
UNICEF staff commented, based on its work in the field, and considering that many government officials
do not know what happens in the field, “UNICEF is better positioned to provide technical advice and
inform policy making because of its presence in these territories”.
Urban slum areas have not been generally covered during this CP, which is partly a reflection and
continuation of a phenomena in international development which some scholars term as “anti-urban
53 Joint RWP of UNICEF and Government of KP, 2020
54 Pakistan Adolescent Nutrition Strategy,
55 Annual review 2020
bias”56 which stems from the misplaced belief that urban areas are more developed than rural areas.
UNICEF is already present in some of these urban slums, but it has come around to accept that limited
presence in urban slums is a missing link that it needs to address. More recently, UNICEF has completed
a mapping of urban slums to develop an urban health strategy to work with communities in urban
slums on more systematic basis. This opportunity could well be utilized to address the issue of working in
silos.
• Gender equality and the inclusion of girls
Equity and gender equality remain at the forefront of UNICEF's work. UNICEF has complemented the
efforts of government and other development actors (e.g., UNWOMEN, UNFPA, DFID, the World Bank,
DFID, WHO) and has contributed to bringing gender equality and equity issues to the forefront.
UNICEF has supported the government in the development of sector plans that are gender-
responsive and equity-focused. The sectoral plans provide a blueprint for equity-focused and gender-
sensitive allocations. UNICEF's strategic positioning and relationship with the government has also
presented an opportunity to advance gender equality commitments at the federal and provincial
levels. As an example, UNICEF supported the administration of MICS in the four provinces and GB57
which provides gender disaggregated information. For example, MICS in Sindh highlighted discrimination
and harassment against men and women with regards to ethnicity, gender, age, education, religion and
disability. This evidence helped the National and provincial governments to include in the IRMNCAH
strategy the aspect of equity and gender in-equality.
However, many stakeholders interviewed for the evaluation recognize “If we don't address the
that much more –in fact, a lot more–still needs to be done to root causes of gender
promote gender equality. UN agencies in Pakistan are discussing the inequality, we will not get
possibility of including a gender outcome. It is recognized that efforts
the desired results”
to mainstream gender as a cross-cutting theme are not sufficient,
as it tends dilute the focus on gender, with the result that gender
- UNICEF staff-
does not clearly manifest in programming. The Gender Review also
recommended placing gender equality as a central pillar of the new
Pakistan CP and argued that Gender "deserves its own outcome-level
indicator" to enhance gender-transformative programming, in line with
UNICEF's Gender Action Plans.58
Both desk review and data collected from the field suggests that that CP Toc’s do not adequately
reflect the root causes of gender inequalities in different provinces and possible pathways to
achieve gender equality. A working group organized in 2017 to strengthen cross-sectoral coordination
of CP identified that UNICEF and its partners needed to do more to develop the knowledge and capacity
of stakeholders for in-depth assessment and analysis of harmful social norms and behaviors and to
improve the volume and quality of demand and/or use of services among women, men, girls and boys.
The 2020 gender review also stated that the current Pakistan CP could go further to examine the
socio-cultural and socio-religious barriers that limit the opportunities for Pakistani girls,
adolescents and women to access their full rights and opportunities.59
UNICEF tried adapt its interventions to different contextual realities and cultural sensitivities, which also
meant adopting different approaches in address to gender issues. However, these different approaches

are not part of an integrated gender strategy. Instead, they represent practical steps taken, keeping in
view contextual realities, to address gender concerns. As the Gender Review mentions, there is a need to
have a gender strategy bringing together a set of gender results; a gender-sensitive outcome or output;
and a set of fully gender-sensitive indicators. This will ensure that gender-responsive programming is
analyzed and reported adequately and will also help programmes to move from being gender-sensitive
to gender-transformative.
The silo approach is also a constraint to prioritizing the most vulnerable adolescent girls. UNICEF staff
also recognize that sectors must work together to address social norms that affect girls. As one UNICEF
interviewee mentioned, "you can't just work with non-formal education without addressing some of the
social norms, issues like child marriage or adolescent pregnancy, that prevent girls from going to school".
8.4 Downstream work
UNICEF’s downstream work cut across all the sectors. It includes both “hard” and “soft”
components. The support provided as “hard component” in WASH include the construction and
rehabilitation of water supply schemes and support for construction of toilets and the, installation of
handwashing stations, particularly under COVID-19 pandemic response. In the health, this involved
supporting logistics systems like creating and maintaining cold chain for vaccine distribution, providing
procurement and distribution of nutrition supplies. Provision of some supplies, including IT equipment also
falls under the “hard component”. 60 The soft component of downstream activities falls under C4D,
which includes community engagement, social mobilization, and social behavior change communication
activities.
C4D continues to be a central component of the country programme and is embedded within
programme sections at the federal and provincial levels. Consulted stakeholders recognize UNICEF
capacity to mobilize the community and communicate messages for positive change. It helps to create
demand for services, promote service uptake and influence behavior and social change and social norms
in benefit of children. According to the C4D framework61, C4D approaches should include a mix of: a)
advocacy, b) institutional capacity building, c) community engagement, d) social mobilization, and e)
individual behaviour and social change communication to influence all levels of the model described
below. UNICEF Community Engagement Strategy foresees CE as one of the pillars of C4D
strategy, although this strategy also recognizes that it’s not always the strongest area of UNICEF
work62

stakeholders confirm that conducting C4D
through the government is limited by their
lack of systems and/or human resources,
and adequate technical capacities. As the
C4D Framework states, not enough support
is given to building government systems’
capacity to manage strategic
Source: UNICEF CPE Survey 2021 communication and social mobilization in
a sustainable manner63.
Some of the consulted stakeholders confirm that C4D when implemented through government, is
occasionally successful since it is limited by capacity and motivation to position certain UNICEF
priorities.
The institutional set up to engage government around C4D activities is also a challenge. Although
all ministries have a designated person for institutional communication, among other functions, they do
not have a dedicated person with C4D training. This implies that UNICEF has no formal government
counterpart for C4D in those ministries, except for the Ministry of Health that is used as an entry
point. As the lead among all UN agencies for RCCE, UNICEF provided direct support to the Ministry of
Health's federal communications team formed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders
confirm that this support remains nowadays directly linked to COVID-19. Because of that, UNICEF's C4D
team is focusing directly on DG Health to create a permanent SBC team at the MoH level to
address issues beyond COVID-19, including other emergencies and routine development challenges.
Similar efforts also need to be made for other sectors.
In addition, UNICEF has made efforts to tailor the design and implementation of C4D strategies to the
context of each province and to the needs of the target populations. While the need for a provincial
C4D/RCCE framework is recognised, these have not yet been created. UNICEF initiated direct
discussions at the provincial level to create permanent C4D structures. Two of the four provinces
have accepted this new concept and have created a permanent government section focusing mainly
on integrated social and behavioural change communications.
C4D strategies have also been affected by verticality of UNICEF programmes and the way PCO
and FOs are structured. Although the field offices have strengthened C4D capacities by adding a C4D
officer, their work has been more focused on responding to the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. C4D
63 Management & Development Consulting, Inc, C4D Strategic Framework, UNICEF Pakistan Country
Programme (2018 – 2022)
officers in the field seem to be less involved in C4D activities that are coordinated by each section
from the federal level. Considering the lack of capacity of government counterparts in C4D issues,
UNICEF has made efforts to better integrate C4D field staff in the Nutrition, Health, WASH, CP and
Education programmes. In addition, their new PERs include a strong focus on C4D training and
understanding of roles beyond COVID-19. C4D team of the federal level are working on this with the
programme sections and C4D field officers. However, as mentioned, expectations must be realistic, as
one person (newly recruited) cannot meet all the needs of the CBS for all sections.
The C4D Strategic Framework also includes some challenges regarding the funding allocated for
C4D. As it states, although the bulk of programme work in Outcome 3 is C4D, separate budgets are rarely
allocated. C4D specialists/officials only manage project-based funding, such as campaigning or product
development. Therefore, the Strategic Framework recommends to PCO’s developing a programme
wide fundraising strategy for C4D while strengthening the integration of communication activities
in sector proposals and development plans, identifying resource gaps and resource mobilisation
to secure sufficient funding for communication priorities64.
UNICEF staff also expresses challenges to measure to what extent efforts in behaviour change leads
to specific results. As the C4D Framework states, behavioral indicators are too often limited to measuring
knowledge and rarely include other key C4D indicators such as interest, attitude, engagement, self-
efficiency, agency, empowerment, etc. Therefore, the Strategic Framework also emphasized the need to
provide more clarity around C4D results because poorly defined C4D-related results may undervalue
C4D and make the task of convincing donors to invest in C4D more challenging65.
8.5 COVID-19 Response
UNICEF strategic positioning to respond to COVID-19
Different stakeholders consulted and relevant documentation demonstrates that UNICEF was an
important actor when responding to the Covid Pandemic. UNICEF quickly adapted to the change
context to develop a UNICEF's response to the COVID-19 pandemic that was tailored to Pakistan's
needs and to specific government requests, in coordination with other UN agencies. UNICEF strategy
focused on supporting the government to ensure the continuity of essential services and facilitation
of essential supplies. UNICEF’s response aimed to ensure that the design of programmes remained
women- and child-centric to mitigate the negative impacts of the pandemic on women and children.

UNICEF capacity to respond and adapt to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the sectors of health, education
and WASH is described below:
Table 11: UNICEF COVId-19 response by sector
UNICEF UNICEF COVId-19 response
Sectors
Health • UNICEF response to COVID-19 in support of the government for continuation of
and health and nutrition activities was widely appreciated by different stakeholders. The
Nutrition COVID-19 Pakistan Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP),66. provided UNICEF
with different functions including the development of communication and C4D plans
as well as the promotion of community participation (RCCE) to ensure preventive
health and hygiene practices. UNICEF was included as an agent to provide sound and
timely epidemiological data to continuously inform risk assessment and support decision
making. It was also listed as a supporter of access to water and sanitation for health
(WASH) services in public places, selected health and quarantine facilities and
community spaces at higher risk. UNICEF was also mentioned as a guarantor of
comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial care for people with COVID-
19 and as an agent to review the supply chain management and control system67.
• In relation to the COVID-19 vaccination strategy, UNICEF contributed to
increase the routine vaccination during Covid Pandemic and it also supported the
communication strategy for increasing the acceptance of COVID- 19 vaccine. As a
prerequisite to the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine, the National Command and
Operations Centre (NCOC) organized two committees: the Expert committee on
vaccines and immunization and the National Vaccine Task Force (VTF), of which

Sectors
UNICEF was a member. A Development Partners Coordination Committee (DPCC),
which includes UNICEF, was also formed to make timely decisions and oversee the
process of preparing for vaccine deployment and to seek mobilisation of additional
resources to meet operational costs. UNICEF's Risk Communication and Community
Engagement (RCCE) survey on COVID-19 reported a 65 % of vaccine acceptance in
the country and it also analysed the key barriers to the acceptance of the vaccine, ,
which had a wider implication for the government in planning and developing strategies
for vaccination68. UNICEF’s RCCE assisted in the formulation and implementation of the
communication strategies and plans for COVID-19 roll-out in Pakistan69.. In addition,
UNICEF supported the incorporation of Guidelines for Sexual, Reproductive and
Maternal Health Services during COVID-1970.
• During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal and provincial governments revived its
nutrition emergency response, which was co-led by UNICEF and the government.
As a result, a coordinated emergency response was established, as well as the
development of the nutrition component of Pakistan's COVID-19 Preparedness
and Response Plan. UNICEF also led the development and updating of the monthly
4W matrix, provided technical support to the EHSAAS programme to develop the
nutrition dashboard providing up-to-date information on nutrition policies, strategies, and
programmes and supported the publication of two nutrition bulletins with UNOCHA.. .
This underpinned the PNNCC decision to allocate new funding for the nutrition sector
and to initiate dialogue on moving funding for nutrition from projects to the
recurrent budget. Likewise, the nutrition emergency response dashboard facilitated a
smooth nutrition response to COVID-19 with real-time information shared by and with
all stakeholders. These were highly cost-effective measures that produced substantial
long-term results.
• As part of humanitarian response for COVID-19, UNICEF supported continuation of
essential services, facilitated essential supplies, and enabled 130,154 frontline health
workers to protect themselves through provision of basic PPE. With UNICEF support,
83,744 healthcare workers were trained on COVID-19; 42,978 frontline healthcare
workers on infection prevention and control, and 1,570 pediatricians on management of
children. This contributed to identifying over 4 million suspected cases and managing
them safely.
WASH • UNICEF advocated and supported the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) to
convene WASH partner coordination meetings at the federal level with government
representatives from all the provinces, while the provinces also held regular WASH
coordination meetings. UNICEF revised its WASH/IPC strategy and refocused its efforts
towards Basic Health care facilities to ensure continuity of care to mothers and children.
• When UNICEF and WHO began the Hand Hygiene for All Global initiative, UNICEF
advocated and supported the development of Country Road Map. This initiative required
countries to develop comprehensive roadmaps “that bridge together national COVID-19
preparedness and response plans with mid- and long-term national development plans to

• UNICEF also supported capacity-building manuals and videos for frontline workers
and cleaners, engaged private business players like Unilever, and distributed cleaning and
disinfection materials to HCFs in all provinces. They also provided capacity development for
youth, frontline workers, and other health workers both in person and online. The UNICEF
WASH Section supported the development of several SOPs adopted and implemented
through the government, sector partners, or internally.
• UNICEF reached 9.5 million people with handwashing (and other) messages.
UNICEF used an extensive network of social mobilisers, religious leaders, Community
Resource Persons (CRPs), interpersonal communication and 120,000 strong Clean and
Green Champions to disseminate messages through digital and social media. Messages
were displayed at 1900 handwashing stations in 27 high-burden COVID-19 districts.
Education • COVID-19 pandemic forced UNICEF to postpone many of its system strengthening
activities, but UNICEF quickly adapted its coordination, convening and planning and
budgeting roles to provide leadership to Covid response in education. Most importantly,
UNICEF worked with MOFEPT to develop National Education Response and
Resilience Plan for COVID-19 which “provided a framework for Pakistan’s education
system to cope with the effects of COVID19.72 This was followed by development of
contextualized national provincial level guidelines for safe reopening of schools. The
National Covid Response Plan made it possible for the government to secure USD 200
million in accelerated funding from GPE for COVID-19 response.
• UNICEF also reprogrammed some core funding and funding from more flexible
sources to support COVID-19 response activities, including planning work, evidence
generation and capacity strengthening to respond to COVID-19. European Union also
allowed reprogramming of its funds for COVID. UNICEF also mobilized resources from
some other donors such UK Government, Japan, Govt of Canada.
Innovations introduced during CoVID-19 Pandemic
UNICEF gradually adapted to changing context and ceased a unique opportunity presented by the
pandemic to promote its own agenda. UNICEF had to introduce innovations to ensure continuity of
essential services and include new initiatives that were not incorporated into the original Pakistan
CP planning. Some UNICEF staff mentioned how some of these initiatives that were not a priority for the
government were directly prioritized with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as mental health issues.

Evaluation UNICEF innovations introduced during COVID-19 Response
Themes
Nutrition UNICEF trained service providers on appropriate nutrition services to promote healthy
eating using online platforms as part of efforts to continue nutrition services in the
context of COVID-19. A total of 16,022 service providers were trained on simplified
Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) and Infant and Young
Child Feeding (IYCF) guidelines. Counseling cards were provided in an online platform
in order to respond to the pandemic and provide safe nutrition services.
The EHSAAS programme distribution points were used for dissemination of nutrition
messages for marginalized groups.
UNICEF also supported an online training programme to train health care workers in
primary health centers which according to some stakeholders, was more cost-efficient
training modality
Health Telemedicine was introduced in KP and Punjab through CSOs and professional
organizations. This was a successful model for distance medical counselling and
management of common diseases which enabled 8,185 users to access healthcare
without infection risk, while 2.5 million received PHC services.
WASH Innovative partnership with the private sector (Unilever and Procter and Gamble) was a
way to reach vulnerable women and girls and distribute cleaning and disinfection
products to targeted HCFs in Sindh and Punjab. UNICEF extensively used digital
media, particularly WhatsApp groups, for community engagement activities.
VAC During the lockdown, the CPU closed so UNICEF took the opportunity to train social
Balochistan: service workers to respond to mental health, psychosocial support issues and stigma.
Once the Child Protection Unit was reopened, psychosocial mental health support
began to be offered through the CP-CMRS in Quetta. As some UNICEF staff
commented, “the issue of mental health was not a priority before COVID-19 and the
pandemic helped to bring it to the table”. Helpline was further strengthened during
the COVID and was proven to be an extremely important mechanism to report
cases.
BR UNICEF took advantage of some governmental initiatives as the cash grounds
provided to the vulnerable families (KP) and the mental health and psychosocial
support offered, to establish birth registration desks, which ensured continuity of
services.
In addition, due to the COVID-19 restrictions, the monitoring of field activities was delegated to
implementing partners who worked with their social mobilisers, volunteers, and community
resource persons. Implementing partners provided daily updates to UNICEF provincial focal persons
through phone calls and email. In Punjab, community feedback and monitoring were ensured through
field testimonials and community voices in the form of short video clips by community members UNICEF
supported the launch of an online 4W reporting matrix making it easy for sector partners to share their
updates.
The COVID-19 pandemic was also an opportunity to strengthen convergence among sectors. For
instance, WASH programme gradually concentrated its efforts on 20 out of the 27 high-burden districts
and then also on supporting Education Programme with safe reopening of school by ensuring availability
and functionality of WASH facilities.
• C4D response
UNICEF's expertise in communication and C4D was widely used by the Government as it is reflected
in the COVID-19 Pakistan Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP). During the first month of
COVID-19, an ad-hoc and make-shift team was created at Federal level to report to NCOC on Social and
Behaviour Change issues. UNICEF being in the lead among all UN agencies for RCCE, immediately
helped in the creation and support of a COVID-19 communication unit in the MoNHSR&C to coordinate
all the COVID-19 communication campaign.
UNICEF and its different sections demonstrated a strong capacity to provide digital print and social
media to disseminate messages in response to COVID-19.and contributed to mobilize the community.
Some examples in each evaluation theme are shown in the following table:
Table 13: C4D Response During the Covid Pandemic by Sector

themes
Health UNICEF involved front like workers, professional organizations (PMA, PPA etc.) on COVID-
19 response. It maintained essential services and improved healthcare quality. Digital
initiatives (telemedicine, virtual meetings and partnerships with social media such as
Facebook), were widely used to Inform about COVID-19.
BR The use of social networks like WhatsApp groups and Facebook was used to raise
awareness in the communities which resulted in a scale up on BR
WASH It was able to quickly adapt its activities and strategies and turned to its extensive network
of social mobilisers, religious leaders, Community Responsible Persons (CRPs) and the
120,000 Clean and Green Champions. It used digital and social media to disseminate
messages in response to COVID-19, with handwashing messages at the forefront which
reached 920,000 people
CP Recorded key messages related to mental health and psychological support were circulated
in local language through social media and WhatsApp group. This strategy was the first way
to reach vulnerable population and respond to emergency needs during COVID pandemic.
Nutrition During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social and mass media made it possible to
reach several million caregivers with adequate messages on child feeding and caring
practices.
Education Education worked with teachers, school management committees to disseminate messages
and increase awareness. In provinces teachers were trained on COVID-19 SOPs and
awareness raising.
• Capacity building and provision of essential services and commodities
UNICEF installed water purification plants in several health care facilities (HCFs) designated by
government as treatment centers. It also provided IPC supplies to schools and supported
vulnerable women by providing MHM supplies.
UNICEF facilitated the government and public water and sanitation utilities to install 1,915 handwashing
stations73 (HWS) in health care facilities, high-risk schools and at-risk public spaces. Mobile washing
stations were made available by converting bulk water tankers, 4x4 trucks, and motorcycles/rickshaws
into mobile handwashing stations. Handwashing facilities in public space were provided by converting old
200-litre drums into handwashing stations and placing them at strategic locations. These washing stations
also served as COVID-19 prevention and control information dissemination centers. Key stakeholders,

government officials, representatives of implementing partner interviewed for the evaluation were aware
of and appreciative of UNICEF’s response.
After a brief interruption due to COVID-19, UNICEF enabled 130,154 frontline health workers to protect
themselves through provision of basic Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Stakeholders have provided
positive feedback on UNICEF response with the establishment of cold chain mechanism that has enabled
different provincial governments, to manage rapid expanding COVID vaccination centres and manage
cold chain, including provision of the PPE, vaccine etc.
UNICEF developed training modules on COVID-19 and trained 83,744 healthcare workers on COVID-19
case management. It also provided training to 42,978 frontline healthcare workers on infection prevention
and control, and 1,570 paediatricians on management of children. This contributed to identifying over 4
million suspected cases and managing them safely.
9. Sectoral Findings
This section presents findings for each of the selected themes separately, covering the three criteria for
the evaluation, relevance, coherence and effectiveness. The analysis of each evaluation criterion is linked
to some of the evaluation questions that these section addresses74.

Questions
Relevance and Coherence
• Finding BR1: UNICEF's programme has adequately addressed th•e It answers
country's needs by improving the registration process, especially in the evaluation
provinces, where context-specific strategies have been identified and questions 1 and
implemented. The programme has combined advocacy, technical assistance, 6
capacity development and social mobilization strategies tailored to increase outreach
according to the needs of each province.
• Finding BR2: Among the federal and provincial governments, UNICEF
support is seen as a key factor in accelerating and improving CRVS reform by
supporting the development of the National Policy to Revamp & Reform CVRS
and responding to national priorities.
• Finding BR3: UNICEF’s coordination role at the federal and provincial
levels, the facilitation of dialogue and the involvement of different stakeholders
like the private sector (Telenor), district governments, NADRA etc. have been
key steps for the implementation of the BR programme and the digitalization of
the process.
• Finding BR4: The BR Programme has tried to cover the most vulnerabl•e It answers
communities, including women and children who live in remote areas by evaluation
holding BR camps, integrating BR in health facilities, and by making use of mass and question 2
social media campaigns. Digitalization has also contributed to lowering the cost of
BR. However, inequalities persist, and remote areas still have lower numbers of
registrations.

after birth. The need of BR was established by the government’s vital data
registration system which requires that a new-born be registered within the shortest
possible time after birth. However, by the beginning of the CP the national legislation
on BR was incomplete and a Uniform CRVS law was missing. During the CPD, the
government has approved The National Policy to Revamp & Reform CVR
Effectiveness
• Finding BR7: Thanks to UNICEF's upstream work and the government2's It answers
interest in accelerating BR, UNICEF went from providing service delivery in two evaluation
provinces, to supporting four provinces and one region (AJK) and achieved the questions 9, 10,
expected targets. As part of this support, it also facilitated the reform of the CRVS 11 and 12
National Policy.
• Finding BR8: The BR component has achieved the results expected in
all provinces. In some cases, targets have been met beyond expectations. UNICEF
supported registration processes in the different districts of the provinces. In total,
between 20% to 37.9% of districts in each province were supported.
• Finding BR9: UNICEF support has contributed to the modernization of
CRVS systems, making them more inclusive of vulnerable populations,
including stateless and refugee children. However, there is still a lack of demand
among the population for registration due to a number of factors, for example
people only receive a notification of an event (birth, death etc.) from the health
centre, but still have to obtain and pay for the BR certificate through a separate
process.
• Finding BR10: Despite the proven effectiveness of the programme, some
challenges and limitations persist i.e., disconnects between the federal and
provincial databases, the need to simplify the BR process, technological
difficulties, connectivity issues and the low capacity of government officials to
carry out BR processes. The main limitation identified is that the process of BR
is not yet mandatory.
Alignment of the BR Programme with National Priorities
The BR programme is aligned with article 7 of the 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),
which requires states to undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for a
child to be registered immediately after birth. It is also in line with Pakistan’s ratification of the 2001 UN
General Assembly Resolution ‘A World Fit for Children,’ Article. 44(1), which commits to developing
systems to ensure the registration of every child at or shortly after birth. CRC article 7 pertains to ensuring
the registration, naming, provision of nationality, and care of every child. The government’s vital data
registration system requires that a newborn be registered within the shortest possible time after birth.
However, by the beginning of the CP the national legislation on BR was incomplete and not consistent.
Byelaws/regulations, standard procedures, clear definitions and standard formats/forms etc. were not
available and data were kept in manual registers. A Uniform CRVS law was missing which posed a great
hurdle to the collection of vital statistics. There was also a conflict between the mandates of the local
government departments and NADRA.
Influencing legislation, Policies and Strengthening Systems
UNICEF has been able to support the federal and provincial governments at a time when they needed it
most. UNICEF has been instrumental in raising awareness among provincial governments about the
importance of civil registration, especially for the under-five population. Through UNICEF upstream
work, Pakistan was able to develop a broader framework for policy reforms in the country to improve civil
registration.
Given the government's willingness to undertake CRVS reform, national/provincial ministries and
departments wanted to learn from the experiences and good practices of other countries, especially
to learn how registration systems could be digitised and made interoperable. UNICEF responded to this
need by organising a CRVS exposure visit to Peru in 2019. This visit led to the development of a CRVS
infrastructure study that UNICEF supported by recruiting an international expert. The study was
conducted in collaboration with MoPDSI. The Technical Support Unit, with UNICEF support, also
commissioned a comprehensive CRVS legislative mapping and gap analysis, which was completed
and disseminated throughout the country.
Government stakeholders from the federal and provincial levels value UNICEF’s technical and financial
support to facilitate the reform of the CRVS that was piloted in Islamabad in 2020 and in two districts
in each province. The The National Policy to Revamp & Reform CVRS also reflects the Government’s
appreciation of UNICEF’s support.75 The reform promotes the modernization of CRVS systems, including
digitization and integration with existing administrative and survey data, while recognizing the
importance of ICT. Through this reform, the state is primarily responsible for ensuring that all persons are
notified and registered. The policy provides for the integration of the health sector into the civil registration
of births. Through this system, the CRVS process becomes more inclusive and facilitates the BR of
vulnerable populations, including stateless and refugee children. However, there is still a lack of
demand among the population for this registration, as people only receive a notification of an event from
the health centre, but still have to obtain and pay for the BR certificate.
UNICEF's upstream work has also reached out to the provinces and has helped generate high-level
political ownership translated into public expenditure allocations from annual provincial budgets and
systems strengthening, resulting in the expansion of BR. UNICEF planned to conduct a provincial CVRS
assessment to develop CVRS provincial strategies. However, this assessment could only be carried out
in Punjab, while only a dialogue was initiated in KP and Sindh.

Integrating the Most Vulnerable
• Equity and Gender inclusion:
UNICEF has selected specific districts to scale up BR, taking into account that BR is affected by poverty
issues, distances (remote areas), and also gender disparities. Remote areas have lower rates of birth
registration due to a lack of registration points. Gender differences are also present in birth
registration. Some parents may be unwilling to register their daughters, as they do not anticipate that their
daughters will participate in any form of public life in the future.
The selection of target districts was negotiated with the government, paying particular attention to districts
with lower birth registration rates. However, these differences persist in some territories such as in
Punjab where there are large BR gaps between North and South Punjab (10% of births are registered in
the southern districts of the province, while the rate is 70% in the northern districts76).
Gender disparities have also been considered in the selection and implementation of BR
programmes in those districts. In the MD, the BR system was introduced for the first time. Initially, the
government did not want to include female field staff. However, as the project progressed, the
government realised that there was a significant disparity in the number of girls versus boys being
registered, and changed course and allowed female staff to join, which had a significant impact on
improving the registration of women in these areas. In KP, they organised separate birth registration
committees for women and encouraged local women to come forward to register their children. However,
some of the CRVS provincial focal points interviewed have not reported any differences between
the registration rates of boys and girls. The 2020 gender review noted that more robust monitoring is
needed to capture any gender-related disparities.77
• Inclusion of Children without Parental Care
UNICEF originally included an output to ensure increased BR for children without parental care. However,
in 2019 the focus of this output was expanded, to respond to UNICEF's strategic priority to emphasise
family-based care. Given the weakness of the system, UNICEF advocated for the establishment of a
policy framework for institutional care in the provinces and sought to conduct an initial mapping of
alternative care institutions in Punjab. Due to the problems generated by the COVID-19 Pandemic,
this study could not be carried out.
At the federal level, UNICEF technically supported the Working Group on Orphanages under the
Government’s poverty alleviation programme (EHSAAS) in the finalization of minimum standards.
UNICEP also contributed to the development of a policy framework aligned to 2009 global standards on
alternative care and the recommendations of the 2019 UNGA Resolution on the Rights of the Child, with
a focus on children without parental care. The final draft was submitted for approval to the relevant
authority. UNICEF established a partnership with the working group convener, Pakistan Bait-ul-
Maal (PBM), Pakistan's largest social protection programme, to prioritise family-based care for children
76 UNICEF Gender Review 2020
77 UNICEF Gender Review 2020
over institutionalisation. However, no results related to this partnership have been reported so far.
Given that the government did not have any standards for registration of vulnerable children, UNICEF
also provided guidelines for achieving the registration of vulnerable groups, such as children in
institutions, refugee children, etc.
Implementation of the programme
The BR programme has been implemented and scaled up in all four provinces and one region (AJK)
by deploying different mechanisms and strategies according to the specific context and needs of
each location. These strategies include establishing synergies with the health and education sectors to
reach out to the population and address demand gaps. It also includes capacity building activities for BR
officials, the use of social media messages and the deployment of mass communication campaigns and
C4D strategies to raise awareness of the importance of registering child births.
Partnerships with the Private Sector (Telenor) in Punjab and Sindh have increased the adoption of
mobile phones in Pakistan to provide a solution for increased birth registration. A qualitative survey
conducted by UNICEF in 2015 showed that parents using the Digital Birth Registration (DBR) service
were more satisfied with the facilitation and quality of BR than those who had experienced the traditional,
paper-based process. The online registration form saved Pakistani families numerous (and sometimes
costly) trips to the union council office to register their child and helped reduce barriers to registration. It
also reduced the cost of the BR to 0.78 The different specific downstream strategies implemented are
shown in the table below:
Table 15: Downstream Strategies by Province
Province Provincial strategy
Punjab A partnership with the Punjab Information Technology Board and Telenor was
created to develop the Baldia Online application system. A hybrid model was successfully
implemented that combined manual data collection with digital entry. The programme
provided computers to the local official’s office to get online registration done. The
programme also provided lady health workers smartphones to use the app.
Sindh Telenor also played an important role in the process of digitalizing BR. The
programme also involved EPI vaccinators and community-based vaccinators (Polio) which
improved the number of birth registrations. BR desks were established in health facilities
and BR was included as one of the integrated services for the Polio High Risk areas in 2
districts as pilot. UNICEF also facilitated training for officials of Union Councils, elected
representatives of local bodies, health facilities and schools on BR. A strong
communication campaign, supported by UNICEF, helped to create demand for BR,
especially in rural areas by increasing awareness about the importance of registering
children.
KP / UNICEF provided capacity building to maliks and government staff in four KP
Merged districts and all seven KP Merged Districts. UNICEF supported BR camps and included
Districts social mobilization strategies addressed to men and women for sensitizing them on the
importance of BR. A successful Provincial C4D campaign was launched with the support
of UNICEF.
Balochista Social mobilization strategies were included, and UNICEF contributed to the scale upon
n by including community-based approaches. The strategy engaged Lady Health Workers
(LHWs), EPI centres, school management committees and community leaders in
awareness-raising, using gender-sensitive messages and by providing referrals for
processing birth registration. It also included door to door visits.
AJK UNICEF provided technical support in terms of equipment, computers and network
connections. It helped to introduce a new digital system for BR which provides
continuous updated information.
78 GSMA, Roadmap for Digital Birth Registration, Insights on Scale and Sustainability from Pakistan, 2018
The implementation of these strategies has contributed to the registration of 2,562,715 children in 5
years, against a target of 1,475,000 children by 2020. As a result, 784,432 children (boys: 55%; girls:
45%) obtained recognition of their identity through birth registration. Of these, 71% were under five years
of age (boys: 54%; girls: 46%)79. UNICEF scaled up BR in all provinces and achieved the expected
results, while in some provinces the results exceeded expectations (Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan). The
number of districts directly supported by UNICEF represents between 20% and 37.9% of the total
number of districts in each province. However, according to some sources consulted, UNICEF support
in some of the selected districts also had an impact on the rest of the districts. Support provided in terms
of legislation and awareness-raising and communication campaigns also had an indirect impact in other
districts. The following figures provide evidence of the results achieved by province:

BR Programme Implementation Challenges
The BR programme presents some challenges to which UNICEF is trying to respond to:

In response to this need, UNICEF has promoted different coordination mechanisms
such as the Coordination Committee for the CRVS under the chairmanship of the
Minister of Planning and Development, provincial committees as well as the
establishment of CRVS focal points. These committees, which meet and interact
regularly, have also involved different actors, public and private, and other UN agencies
(UNFPA, IOM, UNHR). Most consulted federal and provincial stakeholders confirmed
that UNICEF played a major role in the development and functioning of these BR
coordination mechanisms.
UNICEF facilitated dialogue between the federal and provincial levels to create
some compatibility between all the databases by encouraging all the different

organisations to talk to each other. It also promoted collaboration between the
provinces and NADRA on the hardware and software needed to implement the CRVS
reform. As a result of these efforts, the governments of Punjab, Sindh, KP and
Balochistan agreed to establish at least one CRVS model in one district by 2021.
Complexity Although online registration has simplified the BR process, some stakeholders point to
of BR forms the need for further simplification of BR forms. The current BR process and DBR
system cannot easily be implemented in all areas of the country. There are many
restrictions and technical requirements that cannot be met by remote registration sites,
resulting in limited or no registration of events in remote parts of the country. UNICEF is
aware of this problem and is supporting the government in providing a response.
Connectivity• In many areas of Pakistan, connectivity issues also hamper BR. Programme
issues: performance is also affected by the limited capacities of government officials to carry
out BR processes. UNICEF is trying to involve other institutions such as digital
centres and IT boards, as well as government academies where the workforce is
trained to increase their skills and competencies on BR. This is especially important in
a context where internet and technology access in households has become a major
issue.
• Need to make Many stakeholders also consider that the main constraint in scaling up the registration
BR process is the absence of legislation which would make BR mandatory. Some
mandatory: emphasize the importance of linking this registration to social benefits/services
despite the risk of exclusion that this would create for some sectors of the population

strengthen the CP-CMRS are adequate to provide a protective environment for
children: (i) promotion, (ii) prevention, and (iii) response. However, the prevention

stigma, the rural/urban divide, and age.
Finding VAC 6: The CP-CMRS model falls under the CRC, Art 19, the Constitutio•n

that states that every child has a right to protection from abuse, neglect, violence,

Committee on the Rights of the Child Recommendations for Pakistan in 2016,
incorporating a comprehensive case management and referral framework

The government of Balochistan has demonstrated its commitment through the questions 9, 10,
establishment of the first District Child Protection Unit in Quetta, and the approval of 11 and 12
further roll out of the CP-CMRM in ten additional districts. Remaining challenges are
linked to inadequate budgetary allocations and limited technical human resources
for children.
• Finding VAC8: The CP-CMRS has been able to mobilize multiple local
government departments engaged in the public case management and referral
system. Technical and operational working groups on child protection have
facilitated enhanced coordination among different government departments and with
civil society partners engaged at the community level. However, further
engagement is needed from some of these stakeholders like police,
prosecution and the Home and Tribal Affairs Department
• Finding VAC9: The model is also advancing efforts to strengthen the
evidence-based policy formulation, using data driven approaches and supporting
the set up and roll out of a Child Protection Information Management System (CP-
IMS). This information is very valuable given the lack of data on VAC in the country.
Alignment with National Priorities and With Government and Other Actors
The CP-CMRS model falls under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC, Art 19),
the Constitution of Pakistan (Art. 25, 35) and the Balochistan Child Protection Act of 2016 (BCPA), that
states that every child has a right to protection from abuse, neglect, violence, and exploitation (collectively
‘child abuse’). The CP-CMRS is designed to identify, register, assess reports of cases of child abuse,
refer, monitor, and follow-up on all types of abuse, including violence, exploitation, and neglect. The
overall outcome is that girls and boys access child protection preventive and/response services, as
appropriate, primarily through the CPCMRM. Referred to as ‘integrated case management´ utilizing inter-
sectoral collaboration, the CP-CMRM entails a ¨whole-of government¨ approach. Implementation of the
model is guided by the Balochistan Child Protection Act (BCPA) 2016, and it engages multiple public
departments, in partnership with civil society and the private sector. The law is fully aligned with the
Committee on the Rights of the Child Recommendations for Pakistan in 2016, incorporating a
comprehensive case management and referral framework. The CP-CMRS mobilizes multiple local
government departments involved with the public case management and referral system through the
District Child Protection Unit (DCPU). The success of the model depends upon the demand for the
services offered.
Building an Enabling environment for the Creation, Implementation and Coordination of the Model
UNICEF actively advocated for the establishment of mechanisms for comprehensive CP policies
which contributed to the enactment of the first Balochistan Child Protection Act (BCPA) in 2016.
Overall, UNICEF was a key actor in the design and implementation of the CP-CMRM to respond to VAC
in Balochistan. It promoted inter-sectoral dialogue and helped create linkages between the Social
Welfare Department (SWD) and various government departments through the Child Protection
Commission which has an oversight function, chaired by Minister of the SWD, with engagement of other
key government entities, including the Health Department, Social Labor Department, Home Department,
Local Government Department, Prosecution Department and Religious Affairs among others. It also
involved other institutions such as the Institute of Psychiatry, civil society, UN agencies (i.e., UNFPA and
UNHCR) and a representative of a local member of parliament at the committee level. In addition,
UNICEF facilitated greater collaboration between government and civil society, supporting the
creation of technical working groups and consultation processes. Members of the thematic technical
working group have played an important role in reviewing technical packages, manuals, and advocacy
materials, as well as in reviewing monitoring reports and taking corrective actions. Similarly, at the district
level, District Child Protection Committees were established and have played an important role. These
committees include focal points directly involved in case management and response as well as in service
delivery. Despite this collaboration among different institutions, stakeholders recognized that the model
needs more robust partnership strategies for gender responsive programming in order to properly
address linkages with strategic partners engaged in gender-based violence referral prevention and
response services. (i.e., developing/strengthening partnerships with the government, the Women
Development Department, UNFPA; developing/enhancing CP and GBV SOPs for emergency settings
etc.).
UNICEF, through its engagement with various government departments and civil society partners, has
established a good and trusting relationship with the Government of Balochistan which, in turn, has
helped to mobilize relevant stakeholders in all phases of planning and implementation for the roll-
out of the CP-CMRS and the establishment of the DCPU. UNICEF supported a stakeholder mapping and
capacity assessment of service providers. Given that the CP-CMRS was new, some external
stakeholders noted that overall accountability within government was a key challenge in terms of
coordination between different departments, especially in a context where government departments were
used to working in silos.
In this regard, a Coordination Agreement was developed “Without UNICEF technical support, [the]

between the DCPU and other departments/agencies implementation of the CP-CMRS”
involved. This coordination agreement constituted a way
to formalize these understandings in a document that can -External Stakeholder-
be used as a guide to maintain coherence.
External stakeholders positively acknowledge UNICEF's technical and financial support, having
supported consultations with relevant stakeholders and partners, the development of technical documents
and continued participation in technical working groups.
Addressing the Needs of Children, Adolescents and Young People, and Marginalized Groups,
Especially Girls
The model aims to help any child in need of protection. It includes a strong focus on identifying and
addressing the needs of children, adolescents, and youth, especially the most marginalized, regardless of
gender or age. To this end, the model places special emphasis on the response but also includes
prevention strategies and community participation to identify and address the needs of the most
marginalized children, especially those who live in the streets or children without parental care.
• Response strategies to VAC:
UNICEF supported the creation of the DCPU, which for the first time can provide an institutional and
comprehensive response to cases of VAC in collaboration with other departments that are part of the
CPC. As shared by a stakeholder interviewed, when the Child Protection Unit became operational, and
mental health and psychosocial support was integrated, psychologists found it very difficult to reach out to
girls and their mothers. To address this problem, the model integrated a community-based structure to
hold separate sessions for women and focus on frontline health workers, who were trained to identify
VAC and offer personalized services to girls and mothers. The model also established the inclusion of a
female Child protection officer (CPO to staff the District CPU and increase the demand for child
protection services among women and girls. The district child protection committees were established
by the model to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable, including girls. It serves as a one stop
centre to make available specialized services under one roof for victims of child abuse, provide case
management and assist in the referral for psychosocial support and counselling and other services.
However, no cases of abuse reported by community leaders have been identified and there is a
recognized need to build community support structures, strengthening the CP-CMRM and addressing
child protection issues.
The Case Management Reference Manual, one of the key technical documents guiding the CP-CMRM,
notes that although the Balochistan Child Protection Act, 2016 does not mention a response to a
province-wide emergency, the child protection system will need to create a method to rapidly deploy
and operationalize child protection services in areas impacted by emergencies. Further, it clearly
states that it will be essential to formulate SOPs to fulfill such a mandate. In fact, noting that the country
and region is prone to emergencies and that displaced populations and refugees may be at increased
risk, one of the key stakeholders interviewed also suggested that key stakeholders and service providers
should be trained on child protection and case management and should build the capacity to immediately
respond to the emergency needs of children.
• Prevention Strategies for VAC:
The model also includes social and behavioral communication strategies to increase the demand
for services and to promote greater public awareness of children's rights to protection. The rolling out
of C4D strategies responds to several socio-cultural barriers such as the tribal culture manifested in the
local justice system, the patriarchal make-up of society, strong madrassah networks and culture and poor
access to information. These barriers are in addition to the deeper constraints of poverty, illiteracy and
conflict. There are also greater gender disparities and social norms that generate accepted
inequalities such as child marriages. As noted in the Pakistan Gender Programmatic Review of 2020,
many women must rely on the agreement of male family members to seek health care for their children
and themselves, due to women's economic dependence and restricted mobility. Moreover, poorer families
are willing to spend more to take a son to a formal health facility than they are willing to pay for a
daughter, who can instead be taken to a traditional doctor (hakim).
All of the factors described above contribute to the of non-reporting of child abuse cases, especially
those involving girls, which comes from the stigma attached to child abuse, especially in the case of
sexual abuse. One key stakeholder interviewed emphasized the importance of linking the prevention
component with the response efforts. Explaining further, it was emphasized that while there are some
civil society organizations working on prevention at the community level, it is ultimately the responsibility
of the government and there is a need to increase advocacy activities which also engage community
leaders and media professionals, in addition to key government departments and service
providers. Despite the goal of the model to reach the most vulnerable, the technical documents,
guidelines and the communication strategy guiding the implementation of the model do not always
identify the various gender-related dimensions of vulnerability as well as other factors such as
power, social stigma, the rural/urban divide, and age. This is necessary to facilitate an enabling
environment for services and address the root causes that impede that demand.
Implementation and Challenges of the Model
The roll out of the CP-CMRM combines capacity strengthening activities and promotion of services
in all sectors to strength the response to VAC. The model became operational in the year 2019, which
indicates that it has been in place for a short time. From January to June 2021, the model has led to 709
registered children receiving services, of which 225 were girls (32%) and 484 were boys (68%).
UNICEF supported the development of a technical package of documents, used as a basis for the
establishment of a pilot DCPU, which for the first time can provide an institutional and comprehensive
response to cases of VAC in collaboration with other departments that are part of the CPC. It also
strengthened the capacities of five CPOs, including one female officer, to functionalize the District
CPU and it set up a Child Protection Toll-Free helpline (1121). Stakeholders interviewed do note pre-
existing capacity gaps linked to limited resources and weak technical capacity in some
government departments and key service providers (such as the police and the prosecutor’s office).
This limitation poses challenges to ongoing implementation of the CP-CMRM, affecting case
management follow ups which impact negatively on case management and referral quality.
UNICEF also supported the development and implementation of a child protection information
management system in the pilot DCPU to ensure efficient, secure and confidential handling of all case
data across all government departments. The model is also advancing efforts to strengthen the
evidence-based policy formulation, using data driven approaches and supporting the set up and roll
out of a CP-IMS. The monitoring and reporting is output based, and although it is disaggregated, it does
not sufficiently document what works, the appropriateness of interventions, critical barriers to
achieve goals, and missing areas for monitoring progress towards outcomes. The summary analysis of
the M&E system only reflects percentage of cases receiving services by type of abuse and gender but it
does not clearly include other dimensions and considerations (age, disability, economic status
etc.) and does not consider gender related barriers and underlying power dynamics. It does not
sufficiently document and support ongoing learning on the integrated model, which entails a whole
of government approach, with special attention on how all agencies, including frontline service providers,
collaborate and have strengthened their ability to protect more children (linked to District CPUs or One
Stop Centers).
Collaboration between government and civil society partners has been important for prevention
efforts and community engagement, addressing existing barriers and gaps. The model has
identified the importance of sensitizing key stakeholders and key decision-makers for prevention
purposes, in addition to maintaining child protection committees at the community level and holding direct
sessions with children. To date, the SWD has led some efforts through regular meetings and trainings for
gate keepers, and civil society organizations are supporting with community level efforts through
awareness raising, addressing stigmatization and sensitizing communities on VAC, in addition to
spreading information on available services. The recent roll out of the communication plan80 will be
important in stepping up prevention efforts, which is reportedly lagging behind as a component of the
programme in the implementation phase. Different stakeholders recognize that the government priority
is in the response system, and this implies that less priority is given to prevention efforts,
including the necessary allocation of resources to such interventions. The first quarterly monitoring
report findings also indicate that the gate keepers (health care workers, police officers, teachers etc.) are
underutilized and are not playing a significant role to identify cases of abuse and/or reporting to
the SWD/DCPU for registration81. Despite this, external stakeholders noted the importance of
continued prevention efforts and community engagement through awareness-raising, including the
promotion of services, building a relationship of trust with the community, addressing existing gender and
social norms that may pose barriers to access services, and ensuring the community has information on
available services. As explained by a key stakeholder interviewed, “there is a need to focus on
community engagement and social mobilization to break the cycle of violence and increase
information on the availability of services, sensitize key stakeholders - as they are key decision makers -
enhance and step-up prevention efforts, and ensure sessions [are] tailored by gender and age”.
80 CP-CMRM Balochistan Communication Strategy
81 CP-CMRM First Monitoring Report, Balochistan, February 2021
Replicability of the Model
The endorsement of the roll-out in other districts indicates overall government commitment and
ownership, despite acknowledging challenges related to inadequate budget allocations by some
government departments and limited technical human resources for children in need of protection.
Key stakeholders interviewed and recent findings from the first quarterly report emphasize the importance
of ensuring an enabling environment, and demand respectively, in order to reach those most
marginalized. Community engagement, including prompt implementation of communication action
plan, are emphasized as critical. Likewise, ensuring a careful balance between prevention and
response efforts is also noted as important. The collaboration between government and civil society
partners has been important for prevention and community engagement efforts, addressing barriers and
existent gaps. One key example is the formation of community child protection committees.
An effective case management and referral system needs to bring together relevant government
agencies, civil society and the private sector for comprehensive implementation of the mandate.
The system should incorporate, inter alia, regulation and monitoring of child protection standards
at all levels, (including in residential care/child foster care settings). It also needs to bring the provision of
child protection-related services supported by a committed workforce, particularly in the social/legal and
health/educational sectors, with relevant/appropriate competencies and mandates. Families, who are
central to the care and protection of their children, need access to appropriate support/reparative
mechanisms in a child-friendly context where confidentiality is guaranteed, regulated by quality
standards and provided by the government or relevant social agencies.

Adequacy to Address the Needs and Achieve the Intended Goals
UNICEF's upstream activities in Education were by and large adequate to address the needs
related to system development and reform at the national and provincial levels. However, UNICEF
has been unable to influence planning and budgeting processes in district education offices. Upstream
activities in education were highly relevant in the context of the 18th Amendment which created the need
for significant systems strengthening and reform.
Some of these needs were highlighted by an Education UNICEF proposals and work plans tend

systems, curriculum development and assessment.
The programme activities were adequate to meet the objectives of the programme, but two issues need
to be highlighted regarding the documented theory of change for upstream activities: First, the
underlying logic is somewhat linear and does not sufficiently recognize/reflect the complexity of
processes needed to achieve the desired change. Secondly, it does not sufficiently capture the
diversity of contexts among the four provinces. This is also recognized by education team. According
to a senior member of Education team, “it was quite a struggle to have a theory of change that would
work for all four provinces… there is this tension between having an education program that fits each
provincial context, and then having still a strategy, that applies across the four provinces." For example,
Education Department in Punjab is most resourceful and has stronger capacities compared to other
provinces; in KP security consideration had remained an overriding concern, particularly in merged
districts. In Balochistan capacities are relatively weak and political interreference in the decision-making
was cited to be more pronounced. In Sindh, where UNICEF is implementing a large EU-funded, systems
strengthening project, absence of focal points for different initiatives was identified as a big challenge.
These variations and others have significant consequences which are not captured in the theory of
change and other documentation. It also appears that theories of change for education are not well
informed by a distillation of lessons learnt regarding how change happens in government
agencies. Some of the underlying assumptions are rather simplistic.
Addressing the Needs of Children, Adolescents and Young People, and Marginalized Groups
The planning documents, particularly ESPs, were prepared after extensive consultative processes with a
range of stakeholders, including male and female community members, girls and boys. For example, in
case of the ESP in Balochistan, it was reported that an estimated 3000 people participated in different
consultative events leading to the preparation of the ESP. The consultations with community members,
including men, women, girls and boys were held in 12 sample districts. Apart from direct consultations
with communities, the views of communities were also taken on board indirectly through the participation
of NGOs, including local NGOs, in different consultative fora.
The needs of children, adolescents and young people are indirectly reflected in the results of
various surveys, MICS. Other national level surveys, like PSLM, PDHS, NNS and ASER also highlight
the needs of children (both girls and boys) and other marginalized communities. UNICEF Education
programme was also informed by Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) and Real Time
School Monitoring Systems that are being improved and used in different provinces. Sometimes surveys
are also conducted on specific topics to inform the planning process. For example, the Government of KP
with the technical assistance of UNICEF conducted a census of out of school children to determine the
exact number of out of school children in KP. The project also made use of used specific analyses (KAP
Surveys, third party monitoring and evaluations) as good sources of information about the needs of
marginalized children and groups.
Covid Pandemic- the Most Influential External Factor and Leveraging Policies and Resources
The COVID-19 pandemic forced UNICEF to postpone many of its system strengthening activities, but
UNICEF quickly adapted its coordination, convening and planning and budgeting roles to provide
leadership for Covid response in education. Most importantly, UNICEF worked with MOFEPT to develop
the National Education Response and Resilience Plan for COVID-19 which “provided a framework for
Pakistan’s education system to cope with the effects of COVID19.”83 This was followed by development of
contextualized national and provincial level guidelines for safe reopening of schools. The National Covid
Response Plan made it possible for the government to secure USD 200 million in accelerated funding
from GPE for COVID-19 response. UNICEF also reprogrammed part of its core funding and funding from
more flexible donors to support COVID-19 response activities, including planning work, evidence
generation and capacity strengthening to respond to COVID-19. European Union also allowed
reprogramming of its funds for COVID. UNICEF also mobilized resources from some other donors such
the governments of the UK, Japan and Canada.
Missing Elements
One of the key weaknesses which the Education Programme shares with the other sectors is a siloed
approach. It is widely acknowledged with the UNICEF education team that the education programme
could have done better in terms of integrated programming. This weakness is recognized by both internal
and external stakeholders. According to a senior official of UNICEF, ‘every time we develop a new
country programme or regional office management plan, we talk about those silos and how to collaborate
better", but with the notable exception of the Integrated Service Delivery model implemented in polio high-
burden districts, UNICEF's programmes have not been able to come out of their silos. According to
UNICEF the two main factors that prevent UNICEF programmes from adopting a more integrated
approach are: 1) internal reporting requirements which require sector-wise reporting, and 2) how UNICEF
is structured. UNICEF programmes from Country Office down to the provinces are verticality organized. In
fact, this extends beyond UNICEF to its implementing partners, many of whom are sector specific.
There is some evidence to suggest that the siloed approach is also reflected in how UNICEF interacts
with government counterparts. According to an official of the Education Department in one of the
provinces, even though the Education Sector Plan has clearly identified the responsibilities of other
departments of UNICEF (departments other than Education), she found it challenging to communicate
with them, so much so that even her emails were not answered, and the requested support was not
provided. Another official recounted a similar experience, the only difference was that in the latter case
support was provided after a year-long delay.
The evidence cited above also indicates that the sector plans have created space for integrated or cross-
sectoral interventions, but both government departments and UNICEF's own systems need to evolve to
deliver integrated services. Many implementing partners of UNICEF, particularly government agencies,
also work in their own silos, which serves as a disincentive for UNICEF to break down its own silos.
Alignment with National Priorities and Equity and Gender Equality Principles in Relation to
Government and Other Actors

The Education Programme is aligned with international, national and provincial priorities,
frameworks, strategies and laws. It is aligned with the Constitution of Pakistan’s Article 25-A, which
makes education compulsory for children from ages 5-16 years, and with Pakistan Vision 202584. Of the
seven priority areas or pillars identified in the Vision 2025, the education programme is aligned with three
priority areas: 1) development of social and human capital and empowering gender (priority one), 2)
modernization of the public sector (priority three) and development of a competitive knowledge economy
through value addition (priority 6).
Upstream activities in Education through reform, advocacy and system strengthening elements also
contribute to creating better alignment with national and international priorities. Upstream activities in
education are also aligned with SDG 4 which is concerned with quality education. The education
programme addresses multiple indicators for SDG 4 (i.e., 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 and to a small extent 4A which
deals with making education facilities gender sensitive), CRC and UNICEF’s new strategic plan.
Upstream activities in Education because of their emphasis on gender equality are also aligned with the
CEDAW, which discourages discrimination based on gender.
More than ever UNICEF is directly complementing the government’s efforts. In fact, under the country
programme UNICEF focused more on strengthening government systems for effective social service
delivery. Through its upstream activities in Education UNICEF has provided thought leadership by serving
as a source of technical support for developing policies, strategies, and plans. It also strengthened
capacities in key areas such as assessment, curriculum and information systems through the provision of
expert technical support, trainings, and when required, through financial and in-kind material support.
The UNICEF education programme is aligned with the priorities and policies of bilateral and
multilateral donor agencies and funding mechanisms as evidenced by UNICEF’s role as a grant
agent for GPE and as an implementer of EU grants in two provinces. UNICEF also seamlessly built on
the work done by JICA on non-formal education. UNICEF’s role as the lead international agency for
coordination through the National Educational Partners Group and Local Education Groups in the
provinces indicates that UNICEF is not only aligned with the priorities of national and international
development actors in Pakistan, but also serves as a catalyst for creating greater alignment between
other stakeholders involved in education.
Equity and gender equality always remain in the foreground in UNICEF’s work. Not only did the country
programme complement the efforts of the government and other development actors (e.g., UNWOMEN,
UNFPA. DFID, the World Bank, DFID, WHO), it has contributed to bringing issues of gender equality and
equity to the forefront.
There are a number of ways in which UNICEF‘s upstream activities in education complement the efforts
of the government and other development actors to address issues of inequity and gender imbalance in
education. Probably the most significant effort in this regard is making education sector plans gender-
responsive and equity-focused. Education Sector Plans provide a blueprint for equity-focused and
gender responsive allocations in education. Even though the implementation of plans remains a major
challenge because of a complex array of factors—ranging from system-wide factors to factors specific to
departments and even individuals—at least some challenges, such as those related to technical
capacities are being addressed through elements of UNICEF’s upstream work in Education. For example,
improving information systems contributed to better decision-making. Advocacy efforts also contribute to
more efficient and effective allocation of budgets. In the process, upstream activities contribute to making
downstream activities more sensitive to the needs of most disadvantaged sections of the communities,
including communities living in underserved districts, women and children.
Achievement of Outcomes

The main outcome for the education programme is expressed in terms of increased access to ECE and
basic education for children, particularly for girls. The results framework identifies high level national
targets for the outcome. It does make intuitive sense to assume that worked performed by UNICEF
related to systems strengthening, reform, services delivery through its implementing partners and
community engagement for demand generation would contribute to national level targets but making a
meaningful determination of relative contribution of UNICEF at this level is very challenging at best. But
UNICEF Education programme is cognizant of these limitations and hope not to choose such high-level
outcome indicators for the next country programme.
There are three indicators associated with the upstream activities: 1) availability of cost-effective
innovations to improve access and learning, 2) development and endorsement of education sector plans,
3) existence of an effective early learning policy with clear budget allocation in place. Of the three stated
indicators, only one indicator related to development and endorsement of education sector plans
has been achieved. No significant progress was reported regarding other two indicators.
The key plans UNICEF helped develop include four provincial Education Sector plans and the National
Education Response Resilience Plan for COVID-19. As a precursor to development of ESPs, UNICEF
also facilitated Education Departments in the four provinces to undertake education sector analysis.
UNICEF built on the lessons it had learnt during the previous country programme about the importance of
provincial sector planning in providing direction and focus to the provincial governments and all the
development partners. These plans were developed through a participatory consultative process. For
example, it was reported that in Balochistan more than 3000 people were consulted leading to
preparation of ESP. ESPs provide a detailed road map to education departments and other stakeholders,
including international development partners interested in making investments in education. An added
value of UNICEF involvement in developing ESPs and other policy documents is that these documents
directly address the issue of social exclusion and discrimination within education system and make
provisions for equity-based investments to address the needs of most disadvantaged girls and boys.
UNICEF has also tried to address the disconnect between ESP and budget allocations
experienced during the previous ESP to make the plans more realistic. UNICEF has tried to address
this issue by more closely looking into the political economy angle, which was missing when previous
education sector plans were developed.
But the stated indicators do not capture the full gamut of upstream activities. In fact, indicators
miss many broad areas that according to UNICEF emerged “in response to a changed and fluid
programme environment, new opportunities, and new international and national priorities and agendas.”
No indicators address system strengthening activities related to assessment, curriculum, and information
systems. In addition, the coordination and convening roles, are also missed in the results matrix. Also
missed are UNICEF's GPE role as a grant agent and the implementer of EU grants.
Discussions held with key stakeholders in the provinces point to very robust and effective support
provided by UNICEF to strengthen information systems, improve capacities related to assessment and
curriculum. Key instruments used for system strengthening included provision of expert technical support,
trainings, exposure visits, financial support, and material support. In terms of support to strengthening
information systems, in Sindh, UNICEF helped to revamp the existing RTSM which had become
dysfunctional. The revamping process also included expanding the scope to the monitoring of quality
aspects. In Balochistan RTSM established with the support of UNICEF a few years ago has been
successfully mainstreamed in the government system. As a next step, RTSM’s are being linked with the
mainstream EMIS through a joint cell. A proposal to integrate non-formal education MIS with EMIS are
also under serious consideration.
Examples of strengthening assessment systems include developing an item bank and instruments for
diagnostic assessments for the Punjab Examination Board, the development of the Student Learning
Assessment Framework (SLAF) for the Sindh DCAR and developing pools of teachers trained in
assessment methods. The Staff of the Sindh DCAR were trained on assessment and curriculum through
exposure visits to Balochistan and Punjab. The support provided to strengthening the assessment system
also included the provision of ITC equipment to the Punjab Examination Board.
Similarly, UNICEF also contributed to strengthening the capacities for curriculum development
through training, expert technical support and exposure visits. For example, a team of the Sindh
DCAR was taken on an exposure visit to Punjab to experience the curriculum review process. According
to an official who was part of the exposure visit to Punjab, he learnt new things about the scheme of
studies. UNICEF also facilitated the development of a curriculum and ECE syllabus in Sindh.
There was another stream of activities which did not figure "I can give my opinion based on my
in rolling work plans, but these activities were formed in experience. I think that the work they

because it either takes a long time to address these needs
through regular government channels or some of the needs

system.
This can range from basic as support for provision of water coolers for ALP Centers to as complex as
financial and technical support for undertaking research studies. According to one of the senior officials in
Government of Punjab, since there is limited support for evidence generation and research in the
government, UNICEF support his highly critical. Because some of needs emerge from almost
nowhere, flexibility shown by UNICEF is seen as a great asset. An example of this was support for
developing Rules of Business for Corporal Punishment in Sindh, responsibility of which was handed to
Education Department without necessary budget allocations. Subsequently these rules were developed
with the support of UNICEF.
One of the positive outcomes of upstream work in education, but not identified in the results matrix, is
increased budget allocations. This outcome is recognized not only within UNICEF but also by some
external stakeholders. This finding does seem to make an intuitive sense, but the claim merits more
rigorous analysis to identify other confounding factors which might have contributed to an increase in
sectoral allocations.

Questions
Addressed
Relevance and Coherence
• Finding ALP1: ALP is a highly relevant initiative which addresses a very 1,2, 4,5
important need of educating out-of-school children. It addresses the needs of some of
the most disadvantaged boys and girls who otherwise would not have access to
education.
• Finding ALP2: There is evidence to suggest that ALP is helping to
leverage government resources to benefit out of school children. In Sindh, KP
and Balochistan, the Education Departments are planning to replicate the ALP model.
In Sindh, where plans are reportedly at a more advanced stage, the Government is
planning to sponsor 3000 Centers in five districts over a period of three years.
• Finding ALP3: The model is not quite inventive and ambitious enough to
address the issue of out of 20 million out of school children. It does not build on
significant volunteer potential and does not connect with and support any existing
initiatives.
Coherence •
• Finding ALP4: The intervention is closely aligned with Article 25-A of th•e Questions 6, 7
Constitution of Pakistan which makes education compulsory for children from ages 5•-
16 years and Pakistan and Vision 2025. Because ALP directly addresses the Article 25
of the Constitution of Pakistan, by default, it is also aligned with Free and Compulsory
Education Acts passed by the four provincial assemblies of Pakistan. It also aligned
with key international frameworks, including SDGs (indicators i.e., 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5),
CEDAW, Convention on Child Rights (CRC), and Education for All Framework.
• Finding ALP5: Gender equality and equity are at the heart of ALP. ALP
model tries to ensure at least 50% students are girls. Female teachers are also
preferred over male teachers. the more obvious element of equity is providing
education to those who otherwise would remain out of school. ALP also addresses
equity not only in terms of rural-urban divide, but also the disparities between urban
centers and peri-urban settlements.

centers also provided opportunities to married girls to get an education and children
who were engaged in income generating activities to support their families
• Finding ALP 7: Through ALP centers UNICEF has been able to enroll an
estimated 35,460 children, there being 30 students in 1182 centers across the four
provinces of Pakistan. This is well below the target of 2016, ALP centres on their own
are not adequate to address the overall need that exist in Pakistan. ALP Centres
address the needs of 0.18% of the total population of out-of-school children in
Pakistan.
• Finding ALP 8: Increased awareness about the issue of out-of-school
children, specifically owing to ALP model is an unintended positive outcome. Punjab
Literacy Department, which is running 13000 NFE centres in 11 districts of Punjab,
faced challenges in attracting overage children. To make up for this they enrolled
smaller children, including pre-school age children. But having seen the ALP Centers
successfully attracting older age children, they have become more conscious about the
needs of overage children.
The Needs of Children and the Most Marginalized
ALP is a highly relevant initiative in that it addresses a very important need of providing education
to out-of-school children, including children who dropped out of school or those who never went to
school. With 20 million out-of-school children in Pakistan, the need to educate out of school children is
huge. ALP provides access to education for some of most disadvantaged boys and girls who otherwise
would not have access to education.
Those who attend ALP Centers also include children who “Over the last 70 years only 14000

The centers even provide opportunities to married girls to get an education. According to the head
of an implementing partner, in one of the centers she visited she found that out of 30 students, 14 were
married girls, and 11 had children. She also said that ALF and other NFE models address an
"unexpressed demand or a pent-up desire for education among the poor and marginalized communities”.
According to her, addressing immediate needs consume so much of poor people’s time that they do not
get to engage in a concerted effort to pressurize the government to provide education for their children,
but the desire to educate both girls and boys exists. According to a government official associated with
ALP initiative in Balochistan, the demand for ALP/NFE clearly outstrips the supply.
Alignment with Government Priorities and Global Frameworks
Because of its focus on providing education to children who otherwise were not getting an education, the
ALP is closely aligned with the Article 25-A of the Constitution of Pakistan which makes education
compulsory for children from ages 5-16 years, Pakistan Vision 2025, particularly with the priority 1:
development of social and human capital and empowering gender, but also with priority 6, development
of competitive knowledge economy through value addition. Because ALP directly addresses Article 25 of
the Constitution of Pakistan, by default, it is also aligned with the Free and Compulsory Education Acts
passed by the four provincial assemblies of Pakistan.
ALP is not only consistent with national priorities and policy frameworks, it also reflects key Global
Frameworks, including SDG 4 (indicators i.e., 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5), CEDAW, which addresses discrimination
based on gender, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and Education for All Framework.
ALP is also very much aligned with UNICEF's policy priorities and global strategy.
But ALP centres on their own are not adequate to address the overall need that exists in Pakistan. So far,
through ALP centers UNICEF has been able to enroll an estimated 35,460 children, there being
approximately 30 students center across 1182 centers in the four provinces of Pakistan. ALP centers
address the needs of 0.18% of the total population of out-of-school children in Pakistan, which is
estimated to be 20 million. The total number of ALP centers established with the help of UNICEF is 56%
of the total target (2106). Even if UNICEF had established all the centers, it would not meet half a
percentage point of the total population of out of school children.
Then where does the significance of the ALP model lie? The model 1) provides a more authentic and
replicable approach for accelerated learning, particularly for out of school children; 2) increases
awareness about the issue of out-of-school children in the government education departments by
directly involving them in the implementation of the model. This model is more authentic because the
curriculum is specifically designed to address the needs of out-of-school children, particularly overage
children, who are not accepted in regular schools and because there is a proper accreditation process.
Besides, the model is backed up by NFE policies. The model also has the potential of being
replicated by provincial governments. Talking about benefits of the model, an eminent educationist
who has long been involved in the implementation of NFE projects said that in the past there was no
formally approved curriculum and there was no accreditation. Therefore, the mainstreaming of students
really depended on the cooperation of education authorities. "If the authorities were cooperative, students
could be mainstreamed, otherwise it was an uphill task." Increased awareness about the issue of out-of-
school children, specifically owing to the ALP model, is also highlighted as a benefit of ALP by a senior
official of Literacy Department in Punjab, which is running 13000 NFE centers in the 11 districts of
Punjab. The official said, because they faced challenges in attracting overage children, they enrolled
smaller children, including pre-school age children. However, having seen the ALP centers successfully
attracting older age children, they have become more conscious about the needs of this group.
The 1182 centers established by UNICEF is well below the target set for 2016, mostly owing to
funding constraints. However, the number of ALP centers reflected in the RAM 2020 does not
accurately reflect the situation on the ground, and understandably so because the ALP programme is still
being implemented and scaled up. RAM does not reflect the addition of new centers in KP or that the
actual number of functional centers in Balochistan is 212, much lower than the theoretical number of
centers established there.
Equity and Gender Quality and Complementarity with Government and Other Actors
The ALP centers appropriately address gender equality and equity angles. Equity is addressed in two
important ways. The more obvious element of equity is providing education to those who otherwise would
remain out of school. ALP also addresses equity not only in terms of rural-urban divide, but also the
disparities within urban areas such as the disparity between urban centers and under-served peri-
urban settlements. ALP centers are established in districts where the issue of-out-school children is more
acute. Even within districts the centers are established in underserved areas and in areas where there
are no schools or schools are not easily accessible. For example, Haji Gul in Balochistan was cited as an
example of a far-flung area where ALP centers were established. There are also cases where schools
may be available, but children are unable to attend the schools, because they engage in income
generating activities to support their families. Centers located in peri-urban areas (or slums) may be an
example of centers which may not be far off from schools, but they provide opportunity to children
engaged in income generating activities. In KP a significant number of ALP centers are housed in
Government Schools, which is a unique feature of the ALP model being implemented in KP, a feature that
may be worth emulating in some cases in other provinces.
Gender equality is at the heart of ALP, the model tries to ensure at least 50% of students are girls.
Female teachers are also preferred over male teachers. Data shared by one of the implementing
partners in Sindh shows that a large majority of NFE centers are mixed centers i.e., they enroll both girls
and boys. There are girls-only and boys-only centers as well. It also shows that more than 50% of the
student population is of girls. In some cases, village education committees, established by the projects to
setup NFE centers, insist on not having mixed centers.
Leveraging Resources
There are some indications that the ALP model is helping to leverage government resources to benefit
out of school children. In Sindh, KP and Balochistan, the education departments are actively considering
replicating the ALP model. In Sindh, plans are reportedly at a more advanced stage. The government of
Sindh is planning to open 3000 Centers in five districts over a period of three years. According to an
official associated with ALP in Balochistan, the government of Balochistan had committed to provide
funding for establishing 2000 centers, but the department of education missed the opportunity by failing to
submit a PC-1 in time. In KP, where the ALP model was more recently implemented, the officials intend to
develop a PC-1 for replication of model. The hope is that the model will start in the project mode and will
then gradually be mainstreamed. The activity on ALP in Balochistan highlights the positive intent of
the government as well as the challenges that replication efforts might face. In Punjab, according to
a Senior Official of the Literacy Department, they would carefully study the results of pilot before taking
any decision to replicate the model. However, the Literacy Department does acknowledge that ALP
model has helped them to sharpen their focus on overage children, something their own NFE model did
not do as well.
Missing Elements
In terms of missing elements, ALP is neither very innovative nor very ambitious. For example, despite
being a model that hopes to address the issue of 20 million out of school children it does not factor in
potential volunteer resources that might exist in the community, including, for example, retired
teachers (and other retirees) and potential youth volunteers, who if engaged creatively can enhance
the scope and quality of work. This would be analogous to engaging 120,000 Clean and Green
Champions by a WASH programme. Possible linkages with initiatives like Teach for Pakistan could have
been explored. Teach for Pakistan engages high-caliber students from top-notch universities in Pakistan
to teach in government schools with the aim to improve the quality of instructions and to showcase these
student-teachers as role models to inspire children. It also serves to sensitize students and teachers to be
more responsible and sensitive citizens. However, it must be acknowledged that implementing such a
model with the government education departments would not be free from challenges. Nevertheless, only
an ambitious approach by UNICEF could hope to address the full scope of the OOSC problem. This
would also provide opportunities for inter-generational programming.
Ownership and Replication
There is considerable weight in the claim that the provincial governments own the ALP initiative. In fact, in
three provinces ALP centers are implemented through relevant government departments. The
provincial Governments also provide some logistical support such as office space and utilities in district
offices. However, closer scrutiny reveals that this is fundamentally an inside-outside model. Project
staff, including some officials of government education departments who are attached to the project, are
on UNICEF's payroll. All the teachers also remain on UNICEF's payroll. The salary structures of the
project are considerably different from regular government employees in that salaries paid to ALP center
teachers are significantly lower than what the regular government school teachers get. The support
provided to the centers (both material and soft components) are also considerably different from what
regular NFE centers receive. Therefore, the dynamics of the project are significantly different from
mainstream operations of Education Departments or NFEs centers being run by the government.
This raises a number of questions related to potential replication. For example, would the government
replicate the centers in the project mode? If yes, for how long? Would the government be able to provide
similar support that UNICEF provides? Why would it do so, when it does not extend the same support to
regular NFE centers? Would governments be able to mainstream the model and continue to pay smaller
salaries to ALP centers? Therefore, it is argued here that assumptions about government ownership and
replication need to be carefully scrutinized.
It also needs to be understood that government ownership of initiatives tends to be rather fickle. It can
change when the senior officials of the department, typically Secretaries, change. According to a key
informant sometimes secretaries change in only a few months. As a result, "explaining and convincing
new secretaries about the initiatives takes a lot [of] time."

Influencing Legislation, Policies and Strengthening Systems
UNICEF contributed to generating evidence to inform policy development, advocacy and the
implementation of equity focused MNCH and immunization. UNICEF supported the federal and provincial
governments in developing policies and strategies for health, with a special focus on new-born health and
child survival. Some of the major strategic shifts in the health sector are that UNICEF has been moving
away from a project to programme approach; a strengthening of partnerships with the government; and
enhanced policy work to achieve long-term change rather than short-term measures through the provision
of commodities and services. The thorough planning carried out by UNICEF for the current country
programme has been well appreciated by different stakeholders. A senior federal health official stated
that, “UNICEF has a more participatory way of planning national support strategies. They are making its
task more results oriented and [are] making their assistance more and more valuable.”
Stakeholders confirm that UNICEF’s coordination and constant engagement with the MoNHSRC,
provincial health departments and other development partners was key for the development of a UHC
investment case. The ministry’s ownership was crucial to facilitating provincial consultations and
participation. As the Pakistan RMNCAH Investment Case states, UNICEF strengthened national
coordination mechanisms across sectors and between provinces and the federal ministry for delivery
regulation, information collection, surveillance, and research for improved health systems.85
UNICEF provided technical support to develop different publications, research documents and
evaluations that influenced federal and provincial decisions on neonatal care and implementation of the
health programme at federal and provincial level. Some examples of this are the recommendations from
the Evaluation of the Lady Health Workers, which were very important for improving the quality of their
health service delivery and ensuring communities' access to maternal, child and neonatal health. It has
also facilitated UNICEF's advocacy work to reform the programme. Other evaluations such as the
Evaluation of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (PDD) provided recommendations to address two of the most
important leading causes of child mortality to be utilized by the government to improve both policy and
implementation.86
UNICEF's partnership with WHO also contributed to the integration of WASH and MNCH into first-level
health facilities. It supported the MoNHSRC in assessing WASH services in health facilities, leading to the
development of a WASH strategy and an action plan for implementation. This has addressed the issue of
infection prevention by integrating WASH and MNCH services and improving the quality of care for
mothers and new-borns.
The Polio eradication Initiative has been a major activity in the preparation of the National EPI Policy.
The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination has duly acknowledged the
technical assistance of WHO and UNICEF along with other partners in preparing the National EPI Policy
and strategic guidelines.87 UNICEF has been involved with EPI/PEI to assist other teams with research
on refusals for giving polio drops by parents/caregivers and to develop micro-plans for the campaign.88
As health is a provincial issue, UNICEF has supported provincial governments in developing child
survival strategies and legislative work, advocating for budget allocation for specific health
activities. It has tried to adapt a universal health package to the reality of each province. UNICEF is
recognized by the government to be an important player in the provinces. As a federal Health official
stated, “With the support of UNICEF, the provincial government[s] are taking complete [responsibility].”
As a part of the UHC process UNICEF started to advocate at the provincial level through the FO’s to
convince the provincial government of the importance of maternal health and child survival. With this
upstream work, UNICEF contributed to developing and implementing newborn survival strategies and
costed action plans in the four provinces. Balochistan included new-born care in a PC1 project, in
line with the approved provincial new-born strategy. As shown in the table below, all provinces have
allocated funds from 202089. Although in Balochistan and Sindh the numbers are higher, the table shows
that the percentage of QoC is higher in Balochistan due to the special needs of the province. The table
shows that. Balochistan needs more support to improve the quality of MNCH and overcome contextual
challenges such as scarce resources and capacity.90

UNICEF provided technical support for the transition from HMIS to DHIS2 in Punjab and Sindh. This
allowed for the inclusion of additional maternal, newborn and child health indicators and monthly reports
that facilitate planning and implementation processes. Consulted stakeholders confirm UNICEF's support
in establishing the DHIS dashboard, which has facilitated the federal government's monitoring of various
diseases using this data and planning accordingly. UNICEF promoted this initiative in other provinces and
organized a learning visit on DHIS2 to Punjab. This has motivated other provinces (Balochistan and KP)
to start the transition process.
Based on analysis of child indicators, UNICEF’s convergence programming in the Polio endemic
focused on super high risk union councils (SHRUC) throughout the programme cycle in KP, Sindh
and Balochistan. This initiative integrates MNHCH, WASH, Nutrition, EPI services to ensure maternal
health, neonatal and child survival. This convergence programming will directly impact child indicators
and will result in the development of replicable models of integrated child development and child-centered
evidence-based planning that can be scaled up in the future. While UNICEF and WHO have provided
additional funding and technical assistance to achieve this convergence, a major challenge remains
related to sustainability and government ownership. Additionally, other important upstream initiatives took
place in the provinces:
• In Sindh and Punjab: UNICEF supported the improvement of Integrated Management of
Maternal and New-born Care Initiative (IMNCI) guidelines. It also supported the agreement to
transition from HMIS to DHIS2. It launched of eLMIS systems for logistics management, and
development and rolled out a costed urban immunization action plan.
• In Punjab: UNICEF fully engaged and supported the Department of Health in the development
and preparation of the Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine (TCV) Campaign through technical
assistance, oversight support and a whole ACSM campaign. UNICEF also supported the
establishment of a digital integrated Health Logistics Management Information System (HLMIS),
deployed in HISDU of P&SHD for interfacing with existing information system (MIMS) for efficient
inventory data management.
• In KP: UNICEF supported the roll out of both the WASH information management system and
the DHIS2, including the integration of key nutrition indicators into HMIS. This provides regular
data on WASH to address problems related with services.
Addressing the Needs of Children; Adolescents and Young People; and Marginalized Groups
• Lady Health Workers and UHC/PHC for MNCH
The key component of UNICEF’s support to UHC should be to support provincial governments with
implementing the recommendations from the Lady Health Worker (LHW) evaluation so that this ‘frontline’
Primary Health Care workforce can more effectively deliver the Universal Health Benefit package.92 This
is a fair approach to address maternal and new-born survival as a long-term solution. LHWs act as a
liaison between the community and the formal health system while the LHW Programme (LHWP)

plays a key role in strengthening the PHC system and contributes to the achievement of universal health
care. Where the LHWP is operating, it does generally address the needs of marginalized and
vulnerable women and children. However, the extent to which it does is compromised across all
regions by: (i) the lack of an explicit focus on geographical areas and socio-economic groups with the
greatest need; (ii) an increasing focus on immunization relative to other health, health education, and
nutrition needs; and (iii) management and resourcing problems.93 In addition, the evaluation of the LHW
program and many informal reports have revealed several areas of weakness in their knowledge and
skills specially around standard best practices for maternal, newborn and child survival. Overall, for
Pakistan, for the bottom two quintiles, 54% of women are visited by LHWs. Primary care services are
critically dependent upon the LHWs and to some extent on the recently developed community midwives’
cadre. The Pakistan RMNCAH Investment Case states that around 30% to 50% of the rural population
especially in the poorest and most remote areas, are not covered by LHWs. In Balochistan, for
instance, only 13% of women living in the bottom two quintiles are visited by an LHW. This is followed by
KPK (33%) and AJK (40%). The regions where the bottom two quintiles have the most access to LHWs
are GB (72%), followed by Sindh (68%) and Punjab (64%). There is a linear, positive correlation between
the percentage of women visited by a LHW in the bottom two quintiles and the outcome indicators for
MNCH and nutrition.94
The evaluation of the LHW program supported by UNICEF and a number of informal reports post-
devolution has identified several areas of weaknesses and opportunities for further enhancement of their
knowledge and skills specially around standard best practices for MNCH95. Currently UNICEF is providing
technical and financial support and conducting consultations at the federal, provincial and district level for
the development of a strategic plan for LHWs. As a health stakeholder stated, “They aim to develop
consensus on strategic priorities and costing, for the provision of ‘community based essential health
services package through Lady Health Workers.’” An inter-ministerial agreement has been put in place to
execute the reform of the Lady Health Worker programme, the backbone of primary healthcare
acceleration in Pakistan.
• Urban Slums
UNICEF in its current Country Programme focuses on the delivery of integrated services to marginalized
communities and low-income urban areas for immunization and neonatal survival.96The Evaluation
of UNICEF’s Work on Children in Urban Settings was conducted in 2021 and demonstrated that there are
gaps in addressing provision of health and nutritional services in marginalized communities,
especially for adolescent girls. The evaluation also mentions a lack of strategic partnerships to address
the needs of the population, including the involvement of private practitioners for addressing the needs of
poor in urban areas.97
UNICEF supported efforts to profile eight megacities, which are home to 53% of Pakistan’s population.
The profiles – which identified 4,287 slums and 667 high-risk areas – generated evidence to inform
integrated health and immunization service delivery strategies, with a focus on missed and under-served
children.98 As an example, the data generated by the profile was incorporated into the national measles
campaign micro-plans, improving targeting and enhancing coverage.

Recognizing that an increasing proportion of Pakistani children live in cities, particularly in slums,
UNICEF’s CP added a strong focus on urban WASH programming.99 UNICEF’s integrative
programming in the Polio epidemic – focused on super high risk union councils (SHRUC) – Is reaching
children in urban slums in Karachi (Sindh), Quetta (Balochistan) and Peshawar (KP). In Karachi, a total
population of about 1.7 million was reached (5 populations of ~300,000). Other initiatives were
undertaken such as in Punjab, where UNICEF supported the Urban Immunization Strengthening
Initiative through the provision of a senior technical consultant to improve coverage in urban slums and
deprived areas. All these efforts resulted in the continued delivery of immunization services throughout
and the penta-3 dropout rate remained 6% only.100
Despite UNICEF’s efforts in some provinces to improve child survival in urban slums, the scope appears
limited and UNICEF recognizes that much more needs to be done. In addition, full integration with other
sectors is not observed, except in Sindh, where the private health sector is involved to some extent to
reach the urban slums population.101
Gender Equality and the Inclusion of Women and Girls
The CP makes particular reference to adolescent births, and the need of the programme to incorporate
targeted interventions by supporting the implementation of the ‘universal quality of care model’ around the
time of birth. Therefore, the programme aims to support the provincial government to adopt and
implement the ‘quality of care’ model and apply the relevant stipulations for the benefit of
adolescent mothers.102
The landscape of gender challenges is complex in a different way in each province, with one strong
commonality: vulnerabilities are higher for adolescent girls than boys. Balochistan has the widest
gender gaps and the highest levels of multi-dimensional poverty amongst provinces. Adolescent girls
have lower access than male household members to media (including social media) which provides
information about upcoming immunization sessions. For instance, immunization coverage in Punjab
province is 80%, as compared to 29% in Balochistan. However, when it comes to gender, robust gender
analysis is missing along with accurate and reliable sex disaggregated data of the 1.5 million under-
immunized Pakistani children.103
The Gender Review recommended that there was a need to distil multiple gender dimensions to
accessing quality health care and many other output level indicators. It emphasized that, “These
should be captured in the next CPD and Health PSN, and in programme design in the remaining term of
the current CPD.” It also recommended that further emphasis should be placed on adolescent health
and nutrition, implementing adolescent-responsive services with a focus on girls.104 In this regard,
UNICEF supported the Adolescent Strategy which considers that after the first 1,000 Days, adolescence
offers the second window of opportunity to break the vicious cycle of intergenerational malnutrition,
chronic disease and poverty.105
UNICEF’s Gender Action Plan 2018 to 2021 states that most community health workers (CHWs) are
women- who are often relatively low-skilled, voluntary or temporary workers, underpaid, overworked
and underrepresented in supervisory and decision-making roles. This then undermines the ability of
the community health system to deliver quality services to children and families and perpetuates
gender-based power imbalances and professional disadvantages within the health system106. The

situation analysis also acknowledges that a lack of female vaccinators can be a barrier in more traditional
communities.107
“The reason new-born mortality has

They are simply not allowed to work and if they do, they need Pakistan-
to be accompanied by a male.
To address the gap of human resources, like LHWs, female vaccinators and social mobilizers UNICEF
staff highlighted the need to continue monitoring the situation, while at the same time advocating
with the government for recruitment of additional staff, particularly female staff. It is also important
to provide logistics and equipment to those health workers and building strong working relationships
with community leaders and social mobilizers. The report ‘Profiles of Slums/Underserved Areas’ also
highlighted the importance of conducting realistic micro planning of vaccinators, Community-Based
Volunteers (CBVs) and LHWs so that adequate demand for health and EPI facilities can be generated.
The holistic profiles of slums/underserved areas call for such a well-integrated delivery model so that the
prevalent issues can be suitably addressed.108
Quality of Care
WASH in Health Care Facilities was a measure for infection prevention and improving QOC. UNICEF and
Aga Khan University developed an investment plan in 40 SHRUCs to address multiple deprivations and
to disrupt active poliovirus circulation. Of these, 8 SHRUs were in Karachi. These areas were selected on
the basis of highest numbers of zero-dose children and low OPV-0 coverage. Nutrition, WASH, EPI,
MNCH, and Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) were jointly involved, and all donor funding sources aligned
with Sindh PC-1 for EPI. Due to the multi-ethnicity of these localities, Karachi is considered to be a
persistent source of Polio transmission. While there were 6 WPV1 in 2019, reportedly there was no case
in 2020.109 UNICEF technical assistance was aligned with new-born strategies in all provinces, focusing
on the quality of perinatal care. With the support of UNICEF, 40,000 sick new-borns received lifesaving
medical care and 1,150 preterm babies were managed in 17 Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) centres.
Point of Care Quality Improvement started to rollout in health facilities of 10 districts.
A partnership with Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), Public Health Association (PHA) and Pakistan
Paediatric Association (PPA) contributed to maintaining essential services and improved healthcare
quality for mothers and newborns during COVID-19. The programme trained several pediatricians and
gynecologists and developed specialized protocols to address the problem of newborn mortality.
However, a study conducted by The Aga Khan University110 to prevent stillbirths recommends not only to
train these professionals but to establish a collaboration with the Pediatric and Obs/Gynae
department at the facility level. The Central official Pakistan Pediatric Association also states that the
professional organizations, PPA, PMA must play an important role for maternal and neonatal survival. For
good neonatal outcomes, there should be integration particularly between the pediatrician and the
obstetrician. Although this integration is foreseen in an official protocol, most of the time they work

separately. UNICEF recognizes that the current health model of pregnancy, birth delivery and post-natal
care puts all or most responsibilities on women. As stated in different documents as the MTR and the
Gender Review, the model needs to expand to encourage responsibilities and engagement from
fathers.111 With this alignment, good neonatal outcomes can be achieved.112
For improving the Quality of Care for the newborn, UNICEF in support of the MoNHSR&C, reviewed all
Newborn Training Curricula available113 within the country. Final recommendations were given to
incorporate best practices and lessons learnt shared regarding the nine key thematic areas of newborn
health care. Key recommendations regarding these trainings were given by province/areas as per their
contextual needs.
These efforts on Quality of Care have limitations due to the frequent turnover of staff and non-technical
heads within the health sector. A bottleneck analysis conducted by UNICEF in Sindh showed some of the
constraints of the health programme related to frequent transfers, constant movement of District Health
Officers (DHOs) and senior management officers. These constraints create problems in the
implementation of health programmes in different districts. For instance, in Sindh, among 29 districts,
there was only one DHO who stayed at his position for more than two years, an average stay of DHO was
seven months. Similarly in Punjab, secretaries change very frequently particularly in health. During the
current country program UNICEF FO Lahore has seen four secretaries of health.
Service Delivery
While the health programme is moving from service delivery to programme development, UNICEF
continues to provide support to the health infrastructure through direct support to logistical systems.
UNICEF has supported the government in establishing and maintaining the cold chain for the proper
distribution and supply of vaccines. Some stakeholders feel that UNICEF has responded effectively in
supplying and equipping the cold chain, and has provided a rapid and relevant response according to the
needs of the country.
UNICEF support to increase skilled birth attendance, postnatal care, routine immunization, and
treatment for acute respiratory infections contributed to reduction in new-born mortality from 54 per
1,000 live births in 2012–2013114 to 42 per 1000 live births in 2017–2018.115 This reduction in neonatal
mortality rate has been a real breakthrough after over a decade. Estimates from 2015 indicate that the
maternal mortality rate is 178 deaths per 100,000 live births116. Improvements in the status of maternal
and neonatal health are reflective of improved access, providers’ availability and competency, and
stronger infrastructure, systems and policies in place.117
Continued support from UNICEF for targeting poor and underserved communities, including urban slums,
improved quality of new-born care has resulted in all outcomes of the CP showing positive trends.
The only setback was seen in polio eradication. In 2019 there were 128 cases compared to 12 in 2018
resulting from interruptions in polio activity. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF supported, and
contributed to successfully managing the polio outbreak of 2019, thus limiting cases to 83 and bringing
the programme back on track towards eradication.118

UNICEF supported the government with the establishment of an online Knowledge Hub to facilitate easy
reference to health policies and programme document.119 The online hub by MoNHSR&C has a Maternal,
New-born, Child and Adolescent Health section.120 Module 3 gives guidance for developing C4D
strategies for the MNCH program.121
Most UNICEF social mobilization for health relates to immunization, polio campaigns and COVID-19
response with little attention given to MNCH and nutrition. 122 Communities have been engaged largely
during campaigns such as Measles, PCV, MNTe and Typhoid and during Mother and Child Health
Weeks. Micro-planning is done at the Union Council level during polio campaigns, where communities are
engaged at the planning stage. The same is being advocated for the broader immunization program.
Social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook are being used as CE tools to reach the
population, particularly in urban areas. A chat box on Facebook Messenger through ‘RapidPro’ software
is being actively used by the public as an automated helpline and additional queries on immunization are
answered within 24 hours. Some of the downstream social mobilization activities successfully carried out
by UNICEF are:
• Pakistan polio programme conducted 20 campaigns during 2019, targeting nearly 39 million
children during national immunization days.
• Social mobilization, community engagement and crisis communication contributed to reducing
immunization drop-out rates between Penta-1 and Penta-3 from 8% (2018) to 7% (2019). During
the typhoid conjugate vaccine campaign, negative perceptions were reduced from 14% to 5%
through crisis communication, contributing to reaching 99% of targeted children.
• UNICEF provided technical support to EPI to carry out a digital media campaign ‘#Vaccines
Work’ to re-engage the public in completing the vaccination schedule of children under two years
of age during the COVID-19 emergency.
Government ownership is important when developing C4D strategies and communication products. C4D
in health is seen by different stakeholders as an area for improvement. Some stakeholder state that
C4D is not a priority and communication is not a regular phenomenon of the health department at any
level, starting from the federal at the provincial level. A lack of C4D capacity within government to
ensure sustainability is identified. The evaluation of the LHW programme also pointed out the
limitations of such C4D activity, as LHWs, the most favoured and available platform for engaging
communities, especially women, have issues of coverage, funding and inadequate training123. The
Gender Review also states that access to information is one of the areas that needs further investments.
It emphasizes that outreach to men at the community level can be strengthened further encouraging their
involvement in all aspects of MNCH124.
Alignment with National Priorities and Complimentarity with Government and Other Actors
UNICEF health work is aligned with the National IRMNCAH&N Strategy 125 which was developed in line
with the National Health Vision 2016-2025. The Government of Pakistan remains committed to supporting
the efforts being undertaken to accelerate improvement in new-born, child and maternal survival,

objectives of the National Health Vision 2016-2025 are also in line with Sustainable Development Goal 3
and conforms to its indicators 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.7.1 and 3.7.2. All the provincial/regions following up on
the federal government have the same MNCAH policies and strategies.
The national vision requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the structural and social
determinants of health, addresses inequity in access to health care and promotes accountability. The
national strategy126, while consolidating individual provincial and regional action plans, ensures conformity
with the national vision. Health is affected by political, social, economic, developmental, environmental
and other factors. Gender inequality has a significant potential to aggravate the health status of
individuals and communities. The IRMNCAH&N strategy foresees the adoption of a multi-sectoral
approach to address the challenging issue of the social determinants of health.

children at risk of malnutrition. Advocacy for policy development led to the creation of the National
Nutrition Coordination Council chaired by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Support was given for revision of
the national framework for stunting reduction and provincial action plans at the federal and provincial
level. A positive result, with UNICEF’s technical support and advocacy, was increased funding
allocations for nutrition services and mainstreaming nutrition interventions into the routine health
service package, as part of the Universal Health Care package129. Thus, integration with health and the
involvement of LHWs will help promote and counsel mothers on infant and young child feeding (IYCF)
practices130. A senior federal government official remarked “This is a positive result backed by UNICEF
that the federal government has decided to support nutrition as a project during next five years".
UNICEF technical support for various research activities, surveys and publications brought up evidence
for the federal and provincial governments to develop their policies and strategies to address the
important issue of nutrition. Findings of the National Nutrition Survey were key for the decision to initiate
the development investment in nutrition. The nationwide survey, among other nutrition indicators,
provided stunting and wasting status by district so that the government could target its services and
resources where they were the most needed. The Pakistan Infant and Young Child Feeding
Strategy131 also brought some improvements in infant and young child feeding practices and has had a
positive effect on reducing stunting in Pakistan. As part of the National Complementary Feeding
Assessment, qualitative formative research on Complimentary Feeding Practices in Pakistan132 was
carried out with UNICEF support to explore mothers’ perceptions, enablers and barriers to breastfeeding
and complementary feeding. Based on its findings, targeted integrated messages will help improve breast
feeding and complimentary feeding practices.
UNICEF has contributed to government and other sectors' understanding that the causes of
malnutrition are multi-sectoral, for instance stunting is not only caused by lack of food, but lack of
sanitation or lack of hygiene. It has provided key information through nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-
specific indicators, leading to the establishment of Nutrition Units and Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)
coordination groups in all provinces. The SUN units played a key role in orientation and building
capacity of planners and decision-makers on multi-sectoral nutrition-specific and sensitive
programming. Pakistan plays a prominent role both globally and nationally in the Scaling Up Nutrition
(SUN) Movement, which advocates to and holds governments accountable for combating chronic
malnutrition through a multi-sectoral approach. In each province, SUN Units have been established at the
Planning and Development Departments (P&DD) with technical, human and secretariat support from
partners to support the SUN mission.133 Functional SUN Units in the federal Planning Commission,
and provincial/regions P&DDs, with UNICEF support, remained the main driving force for multisector
coordination and advocacy for nutrition investment. UNICEF provided technical support for the
operation of SUN Units in Punjab, KP, PAK and GB.
In Punjab and KP, the advocacy and technical support of UNICEF to establish provincial SUN Units,
resulted in public finance tracking and allocations for nutrition. This support resulted in the allocation of
US$3 million in Punjab and US$8.4 million in KP. Balochistan reported a lack of a SUN financial
account, absence of staff or any financial assistance from UNICEF or other UN agencies, so the SUN
Unit was not operationalized.134 In Balochistan and GB, some stakeholders, pointed out that there is still
a coordination challenge because of the lack of involvement of different sectors like WASH,
agriculture and fisheries. Stakeholders perceive a lack of interest in the provincial government on the
issues of nutrition and this is evident in the lack of funding and technical capacities.

Based on the UHC investment case, the National RMNCAH&N strategy 2016-20 was developed in
accordance with the National vision 2025. All provinces/regions participated in the process and developed
their respective RMNCAH&N strategies in line with the federal document. The strategy particularly
emphasizes the need for investing in nutrition especially for adolescent girls, mothers and children2.
UNICEF has been supporting the provinces in their nutrition strategies135 which have started recently to
be implemented with costed plans.
The MoNHSR&C, UNICEF and other relevant stakeholders recognized the need for improving
breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in Pakistan, and initiated the development of the
Pakistan IYCF Strategy 2006. The strategy was consistent with the Global Strategy for Infant and Young
Child Feeding136 and it provided a framework of action to protect, promote and support optimal infant and
young child feeding practices across the country. The National IYCF Practices Strategy137 and related
guidelines have been formulated and are bolstered by the formation of a National IYCF Technical
Advisory Group with representation from all provinces and administrative areas138. Punjab and
Balochistan have adopted the national strategy and a province-specific breastfeeding promotion, and
action plan has been developed. KP adopted the National IYCF strategy and the KP Infant and Young
Child Nutrition/ Breastfeeding law (2015) was amended. The revision was initiated in 2020, after
completion of provincial consultations will be submitted for cabinet approval in 2021. The Sindh IYCF
strategy is being finalized.
The Thirty-third World Health Assembly, in May 1980, endorsed in their entirety the statement and
recommendations agreed by the joint WHO/UNICEF consensus. It made a particular mention of the
recommendation that "There should be an international code of marketing of infant formula and other
products used as breast-milk substitutes,"139 and that it should be in, "close consultation with member
states and with all other parties concerned."The federal and all four provincial governments have
revised ACT so that it can be tabled by provincial and National Assemblies. Both regions (AJK & GB)
have their drafts available for final review. UNICEF was instrumental in ensuring that the legislation
on breast-milk substitutes and its recommendations, developed at the federal level with its
support, was also adopted in the province.140 Some stakeholders pointed out that while the legislation
is in place, implementation of the code is questionable and breast milk substitute manufacturers have
found loopholes to push their products. As the PPA officer said, “The 1000-day approach is a golden
concept, however [it] was stolen by the milk/formula companies. They started promoting their formula
feeds and [the] concept was misused. PPA intervened and asked its members not to participate in any
such activity sponsored by the pharma company. So, in practice, this 1000-day scale concept is not
particularly utilized in a positive way, as far as I know.”
While the MTR considers the provincial update of the Punjab and Sindh Breastmilk Substitute Act (in
NETCODE, and development of ECD policies and NETCODE) an achievement, ensuring strict
compliance with the code is seen as a challenge. The MTR expressed concern that monitoring of the
code is being overused through a third party as substitute for staff monitoring, and also expresses doubts
about the technical capacity of UNICEF staff. On the other hand, it is very likely to be cost effective
compared to cost of staff time.141 To overcome the issue of monitoring, UNICEF and WHO jointly
conducted training on revised Breast milk Substitute (BMS) NETCODE for 35 participants from all over
the country, including Food Authorities and District Health Officers. In provinces, a total of 3,563 health
practitioners (Punjab: 2,491; KP: 447; Sindh: 625) were trained on the Breast milk Substitutes (BMS)
code to promote breastfeeding in health facilities.

UNICEF reinitiated the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative along with regulation of breast milk
substitutes, which is a major strategy to support breastfeeding promotion.142 UNICEF supported
MNHSR&C to revitalize the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) in Pakistan with 25 master trainers
trained on revised guidelines, equipping provinces with know-how to scale up BFHI in all districts.
UNICEF and the Early Childhood Development (ECD) Alliance developed parenting packages
incorporating IYCF and hygiene information into holistic counselling for caregivers that was delivered
in multiple platforms throughout the country. UNICEF- supported mixed media messaging on infant
and young child feeding (IYCF) practices may have reached 75 million caregivers. The parenting
package is a stellar success produced by multiple sections in UNICEF working together. It
represents an integration of lessons and advice on good health, adequate nutrition, early stimulation,
WASH, child and social protection, and early learning opportunities all from a communication for
development (C4D) and life cycle approach. With this initiative Training of Trainers (TOT) was
conducted across Pakistan, and frontline workers, including polio workers. ECD messages were
also disseminated to families, parents/caregivers, youth representatives, community leaders. Parenting
package is proposed to be an integral part of facility-based service delivery as well as community-based
interventions. However, large scale implementation requires allocation of more resources within
governmental budgets. UNICEF prepares to move forward the ECD parenting package provincial policy
frameworks and related developments. The Programme is working with the SUN coordination unit to
develop a PC-4 budget for the ECD-parenting package.143
Addressing the Needs of Children, Adolescents and Young People, and Marginalized Groups
The TOC prioritizes integrated pathways in support of stunting and wasting particularly in collaboration
with WASH to address the nutritional needs of mothers, boys and girls, and adolescents. UNICEF
proposed to reach out to marginalized communities living in remote rural settings, of which Polio Tier 1
districts were also their target. In the cities, however, they planned to target the urban slums of major
cities in Pakistan. An estimated 12 million people are living in these slums in 10 megacities of Pakistan
with no civic amenities and poor WASH conditions. However, except for a particular province, where a
few such localities could be reached most of the slums remain un-addressed, and access to
women, adolescent girls and newborns could not be achieved in significant numbers. Women,
adolescent girls, and newborns are at risk of being from the lowest Socioeconomic Status (SES) with no
WASH facilities are prone to repeated infections and high rates of morbidity and mortality living in slum
areas. Functional integration with WASH is highly essential to contain stunting and wasting and to prevent
mothers and adolescent girls from malnutrition in marginalized communities.
The integrated health, nutrition, WASH and birth registration service delivery package for 40 SHRUCs
included an integrated referral system to identify and link zero-dose children with immunization and other
healthcare services. In seven union councils, where the distribution of 13,000 referral slips was piloted
during polio campaigns, about a third of those referred had used facility-based services, and half of the
identified zero-dose children were vaccinated. Of total children only 15% children were vaccinated. It
appears that for a pilot this is too small a proportion and it would be a challenge for the
programme to reach marginalized communities under normal circumstances.

In the far-flung area of different provinces or in urban slums, UNICEF also supported nutrition programme
using a variety of means such as outreach clinics, satellites (Mobile team), Through nutrition week, child
health week activities, and even through the polio campaign, but all these arrangements are temporary,
there is no uniform strategy available. In Punjab, with the support of UNICEF, outpatient therapeutic
programmes (OTP) and Stabilization Centers (SC) were established in the health facilities, and the
Medical Officer and Lady Health Visitor, who are stationed at BHU/RHC were trained on nutrition
interventions. Considering these initiatives, some stakeholders mentioned that staff at health facilities
should use these opportunities that women, adolescent girls and children are screened at the BHU/RHC.
The Ministry of Poverty Alleviation (EHSAAS) developed a strategy, with UNICEF technical support, for
the government's social protection scheme's nutrition component to make it nutrition-sensitive,
targeting the nutrition needs of children and mothers in 5.7 million poor households enrolled in the
Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
UNICEF supported the MoNHSRC in developing and disseminating the Pakistan adolescent nutrition
strategy, which benefits 47 million adolescent girls and boys, as well as initiating the development of
maternal nutrition and dietary diversification programmes144. Adolescents had a lot of micro nutrition
deficiencies and malnutrition so when becoming mothers this had an impact on children. Ehsaas and the
Benazir Income Support Programme are two social protection systems that can identify and reach the
most marginalized adolescents with cash transfers, food vouchers, and other types of assistance.145
UNICEF’s advocacy and technical support, including for the nutrition dashboard and policy brief
developed with the Ehsaas Programme, influenced the Pakistan National Nutrition Coordination Council
to commit to a costed Multisectoral National Nutrition Action Plan and scale up nutrition-specific
interventions to reach 11 million children and 5 million women in 67 high-burden districts.146
Provision of Services, Procurement and Distribution of Supplies
UNICEF provided capsules of Vitamin A to children twice a year through polio national immunization
days. The COVID-19 pandemic restricted vitamin A supplementation to a single distribution rather than
two.
To support the procurement of essential nutrition supplies, UNICEF extended to the Government of
Pakistan its procurement services and processed US$5.5 million for the procurement of RUTF and
multiple micronutrient powder. Nutrition supplies are expensive and imported from outside the country,
and there are no local recipes accessible. However, UNICEF plans to cooperate with producers in
2020 to investigate the development of high-quality RUTF using locally farmed chickpeas rather
than imported peanuts147. UNICEF has identified a local manufacturer of RUTF. Since mid-2021 100%
program supplies are being delivered from the local supplier. By 2022 UNICEF plans to review
bottlenecks to see if it is possible to do the same for PS PO’s. In addition, one of the key activities of
UNICEF's country nutrition programme was to push for the inclusion of full sets of vitamins and minerals,
as well as RUTF, in the country's essential medicine list. However, because the government does not
consider RUTF to be a medicine and instead views it as food, it is not currently included in Pakistan's
national essential medicine list. The UNICEF provincial offices are still lobbying for RUTF to be added to
the province's essential drug list
During the year 2018-2020, UNICEF supported governments and non-governmental organizations in
establishing outpatient treatment programme (OTP) sites for treatment of severe acute malnutrition
(SAM) in public sector health facilities, resulting in an increase in the number of OTP sites from 1,962 to
3,342. UNICEF also provided technical assistance and the delivery of RUTF resulted in the treatment of
244,565 children (136,701 girls and 107,864 boys) for SAM at 3,342 OTP sites. Of these, 54,745 children
(28,467 girls, 26,278 boys) were treated with UNICEF direct support in 2020. With UNICEF support to the

government, 1,012,992 children and 459,517 mothers received multiple micronutrient supplementations
through the health system to prevent these vulnerable groups from micronutrient deficiencies.
Management of Nutrition Information and C4D
The Nutrition Management Information System (NMIS) was developed by UNICEF. In 2018, three
provinces, KP, Sindh, and Balochistan, opted to use this system for internal data entry and information
sharing. This system is not owned by the government. UNICEF, on the other hand, partnered with the
University of Oslo to help the transition to DHIS2 from the existing HMIS system in Sindh and Punjab in
2019. The new DHIS-2 includes a chapter on nutrition. Based on UNICEF’s international partnership with
University of Oslo and with their experience in similar initiatives in other countries, this support can further
be strengthened through technology transfer, capacity building of provincial and district health managers,
define and operate DHIS-2 certification program and design and approve a master DHIS-2 rollout plan for
other provinces and regions148. The implementation at the district level is underway, and training is
ongoing, but the province has yet to produce a complete report. None of the external stakeholders
consulted were aware of the nutrition indicator's presence in DHIS-2.
UNICEF co-led, with Government, the Nutrition Cluster at federal and provincial levels and ensured
coordinated action, harmonized messaging, technical leadership for the development of guidelines,
SOPs, community engagement messages, communication tools, and robust reporting and information
sharing for Communication for Development. In this line, UNICEF strengthened Communication for
Development (C4D) capacities in Punjab’s and Sindh’s Planning Departments. Technical support
for multisectoral gender-responsive communication strategies and action plans enhanced
government capacity to design and implement gender-sensitive, nutrition-focused C4D initiatives.
However, nutrition programme needs to continue to leverage the health workforce for nutrition screening
and for educating caregivers on good nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, adolescents, infants
and young children. This communication must be locally tailored to foods that are available seasonally.
The health workforce includes facility-based staff, LHWs, Community-based Volunteers (CBVs), mobile
health teams, civil society, and faith-based services149.
In addition, UNICEF supported creation of 3,658 mother and 2,783 father support groups which reached
about 391,090 caregivers with information on maternal and IYCF practices in Sindh, KP and
Balochistan.150
Alignment with National Priorities and Complementarity with Government and Other Actors
UNICEF’s country programme objectives are in line with the national and provincial priorities and their
policy frameworks. Pakistan Vision 2025 highlights nutrition as a key issue of concern. In response,
the Pakistan Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy (PMNS) was developed in 2018, to create new
opportunities and change the way nutrition is approached at the national, provincial, and local
levels. This policy is as given in Sustainable Development Goal 2 indicator “2.2.1. reduce stunting in
children under five years of age from 44.8% to 10% (moderate) and 11.9% (severe).”151 While objective 6
of Pakistan RMNCAHN Investment Case152 is to invest in nutrition especially of adolescent girls, mothers
and children. Since RMNCAHN strategies have been developed based on the National policy, all
provinces and regions are working on the above policy and accordingly have developed their respective
RMNCAHN strategies.

defecation, although on the decline, remains an important issue in Pakistan. In evaluation
districts like Umerkot in Sindh and Khuzdar in Balochistan more than 65% of question 1,2,
households are without toilets.
Finding ODF 2: Selection of target communities for ODF interventions was
informed by key survey results and discussions with relevant Government
departments. The use of survey data helps to bring a greatly deal of objectivity and
specificity to the selection process, but it does, occasionally, restrict partners from
making use of their knowledge of the context.
• Coherence
Finding ODF3: ODF interventions were well aligned with key national prioritie•s Questions 6, 7
as reflected in Vision 2025 and the SDGs, to which Pakistan is a signatory. It is als•o
aligned with the Clean and Green Pakistan initiative and with the COVID-19
response.
Finding ODF4: ODF interventions are aligned with the priorities and policies of
other donors. An example of this alignment with ODF interventions supported by the
World Bank and EU under a nutrition sensitive programme in Sindh. ODF
intervention by focusing on most deserving communities, including women, children,
and underserved communities, complement the Government and other development
actors’ efforts for achieving equity and gender equality.
Effectiveness
Finding ODF 5: On the whole, UNICEF was able to address the needs of th7e Questions
marginalized communities, including women, men and children, within more 8,9,10,11, 12
deserving districts. ODF interventions benefited the most marginalized households
most by giving them in-kind support for the construction of toilets.
Finding ODF 6: ODF interventions contributed to reducing the proportion the
population practicing open defecation. Of the 966,153 additional households in
Pakistan who gained access to toilets since 2016, 11.8% did so as a direct result of
UNICEF’s ODF interventions. By doing so it contributed to achieving the national
related to reduction of open defecation. This does not reflect the contribution
UNICEF may have made to reducing open defecation through its upstream
activities.
Finding ODF 7: Relatively high percentage of slippage has remained an issue.
But voluntary replication was ODF by some communities in their own was an
unintended positive result. Potential negative implications of increased demand for
water resulting from construction of pour-flush toilets are not looked into or
documented
Finding ODF 8: The most important external factor that impacted ODF
interventions was Covid- 19 pandemic. It caused delays in implementation and
severely constrained monitoring activities. Restricted achievement of ODF status in
many communities. But COVID-19 also helped to put the WASH agenda at the
center stage. It also created conditions for the WASH programme to tap the potential
of social media in ways that it had never done before.
UNICEF’s WASH ODF interventions were highly relevant because open defecation, although on the
decline, still remains an important issue in Pakistan. According the recent PSLM (2019-20), 10% of
people in Pakistan are still without any toilet, with 9 % each in Punjab and Sindh, 11% in KP and 17% in
the Balochistan. Disparities among provinces are not as stark as disparities among districts within the
provinces. In Umerkot, a district in Sindh 67% households do have not access to toilets, which places it at
the bottom of the ladder. District Khuzdar in Balochistan is also not far behind with 65% households
having no toilets. Punjab, where 89% households have access to pour flush latrine, also has a district,
Chiniot, where 31% people do not have access to toilets. These numbers sufficiently indicate why ODF
interventions remain highly relevant.
Target communities for ODF interventions are identified in consultation with LGD and/or PHED in
each province, depending on where the responsibilities for sanitation lie. Selection is also informed by
the results of key surveys. (e.g., MICS, PLSM), but other considerations also play a part. For example,
during the current country programme polio high-burden districts were prioritized. In few cases, selection
of districts also influenced by security concerns. For example, in Balochistan, it was mentioned by a key
informant with the knowledge of WASH interventions, that there are some districts, e.g., Dera Buttig and
Musa Khail, which despite being extremely poor with huge WASH related needs, are not selected by
WASH programme because UNICEF cannot obtain security clearance.

Although it is not acknowledged in the programme documents, selection of geographic areas is
sometimes influenced by political considerations as well. As one of the senior UNICEF staff
acknowledged, and using Punjab as an example he said, if UNICEF were only guided by development
indicators, most of their programmes in Punjab might go to South Punjab, because South Punjab lags far
behind, but they must maintain some balance. Besides, it is not like needs do not exist in central or
northern parts of Punjab. In fact, Chiniot is a district in Central Punjab, which is at the lowest rung in terms
of access to toilets. The larger point is not about Punjab and or a specific district, but about the complexity
of planning processes, which requires careful balancing of many factors and diverse influences. A
Government official whose views matter in the selection process may have their own subjective views.
Therefore, any claims about the selection of geographic areas and the selection of most marginalized
communities that project an image of absolutely objectivity and clinical precision should be treated
with a considerable degree of caution because the programmes are not developed in a vacuum.
On the whole, UNICEF WASH was able to address the needs of underserved communities within
more deserving districts. Increased sophistication of information systems and availability of more
nuanced information with the government departments, for which UNICEF’s upstream work deserve
some credit, means that UNICEF and its implementing partners can focus on very specific geographic
units within the districts--sometimes as specific as a UC (traditionally the lowest administrative tier of the
government),153 or even specific villages within UCs. This level of specificity, if it is data-driven, does help
to take more objective decisions, but at times it ties the hands of implementing partners too tight. As a
result, it does not allow them to make use of, what some believe, deeper appreciation of the context,
153 UCs were the lowest administrative tier across Pakistan until the advent of villages Councils in KP
during the previous tenure of Pakistan Tehrik Insaf Government. UCs still remain the smallest
administrative unit in rest of the Pakistan.
which is not captured by aggregated survey findings. But this is not always the case. There are also times
when implementing partners have flexibility to select villages based on contextual realities.
The point about deeper appreciation of the context can be explained using a concept in marketing.
Sometimes prioritizing the selection of geographic unit is advisable because with the knowledge of
context it can be categorized, using a marketing term, as an ‘early adopter’. Going with an early adopter
might be advisable compared to a ‘late adopter’ or a ‘laggard’, which ensures success and sets a
precedent. This kind of information is often not captured by the surveys. Surveys would, for example,
show which communities are lagging behind in terms of access to toilets, but a savvy implementing
partner can determine whether it could be advisable to capture low hanging fruit first and use the success
lever to work with more challenging communities later. This is just one example to explain why some
WASH implementing partners feel PCAs remain water-tight and do not offer sufficient room for
adjustments based on their knowledge of the local context.
ODF interventions address the needs of women, men, and children, although impacts can vary
depending on the context. ODF interventions by design offer additional benefits to most marginalized
households in the form of in-kind support for construction of toilets for the most vulnerable households.
These often include women, child or elderly-headed households, households with persons with
disabilities or households with no income or households where earning member of the family is sick etc.
Toilets are also constructed in schools and health facilities as part of ODF interventions. Toilets
constructed in schools benefit school children. Toilets constructed in girls’ schools are particularly
beneficial because absence of toilets in schools tends to be more challenging for girls. In fact, it becomes
doubly challenging for girls when menstrual hygiene needs arise. ODF interventions by constructing
toilets in girls’ schools address differentiated gender needs.
ODF is interventions are well aligned with key national priorities as reflected in Vision 2025 and SDGs, to
which Pakistan is a signatory. It is also aligned with Clean and Green Pakistan initiative and COVID-19
response. ODF has potential linkages with the Ehsaas programme, a flagship social safety network,
developed to support the marginalized and underprivileged sections of society such as extremely poor,
orphans, the homeless and people with disabilities. More specifically, ODF is directly linked to SDG 6,
goal 6.2, that has to do with access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and an end
to open defecation. ODF also links to CRC because access to basic sanitation services is key to healthy
living and survival for girls and boys. It also addresses government’s priorities regarding gender
empowerment.
Achievements
The WASH outcome indicator associated with ODF is, “[The] proportion of the population practicing open
defecation.” RAM shows that baseline for the indicator in 2016 was 13% and that the current status is
10%, which indicates 3% reduction in incidence of open defecation. A reduction of 3% over the last five
years is rather modest. In the UNICEF documents these is no discussion around the relative
contribution of UNICEF in achieving this reduction, given that many other actors might have also
contributed to this outcome. Using total number of households in Pakistan as per 2017 census i.e.,
32,205,111 as a base, 3% reduction in open defecation suggests that 966,153 additional households now
have access to toilets. Since average family size as per 2017 census is 6.25, so the estimated number of
people who benefited from the ODF interventions would be 6,038,458.
Elsewhere in RAM report (under outputs) UNICEF acknowledges that the WASH programme helped 744
communities to become open defecation free with an estimated population of 1,119,303 people (548,458
men and boys; 570,845 women and girls; including 514,248 children). This success was achieved by
providing 711,526 people access to basic sanitation facilities.154
154 The number provided in RAM is 531,775 people (269,318 men and boys; 262,457 women and girls;
including 254,663 children). It showed zero progress for Balochistan. 711526 also includes figure for
Balochistan as shown in the graph.
Figure 20: Distribution of Households Who Gained Access to Basic Sanitation Services
by Provinces
If ODF interventions supported 711,526 people in gaining access to basic sanitation facilities,
based on the household size of 6.25, it means 113,844155 households must have built toilets or gained
access to basic sanitation facilities. Thus, it can be deduced from this that of 966,153 additional
households in Pakistan who gained access to toilets since 2016, 11.8% did so as a direct result of
UNICEF’s ODF interventions. This is equivalent to 0.35% of total households (32,205,111) in Pakistan.
RAM reports and other documents do not seem engage in any analysis of relative contribution. The way
data is presented in RAM report can potentially lead people into assuming that the reduction of 3% is the
result of UNICEF intervention.
It must be acknowledged that this calculation does not take into account indirect contribution of UNICEF
through its upstream work, including policy development, capacity building and technical support. For
example, the IEC material UNICEF provided to LGD in Sindh to support AAP WASH intervention might
have influenced some households to construct toilets. This contribution is much more difficult to quantify.
It would take some painstaking analysis to provide some sense of to what extent UNICEF’s support to
upstream activities translated into improved service delivery. At the same time, strictly speaking, all those
who constructed toilets in the ODF villages cannot be attributed to UNICEF. Still, it is safe to assume, with
some give and take, that toilets constructed in the interventions areas during the project period can be
attributed to ODF interventions. Not to forget, as we will note later, that ODF influences can also go
beyond the boundaries of intervention village.
UNICEF has moved away from negative emotional triggers --shame, shock and disgust-- to more positive
or aspirational triggers, dignity and pride, because critics of CLTS approach considered shame as a
“volatile and often harmful emotion, particularly in conditions of poverty.”156 Implementing partners did
mention that this change was made with the knowledge that people in the flood affected areas were
already going through a hard time, therefore a more positive approach would be beneficial. But did not
cite any concrete examples of how this changed approach helped in practice. They could not come up
with a meaningful comparison to explain the implications of new approach. This may be the case because
shame and disgust were not used with great intensity earlier or it may be that in practice the approach
has not changed much. This might require a separate investigation.157

“Slippage” has remained one of the key concerns for the WASH programme. Implementing partners
generally claim very low slippage, but the baseline figures noted by UNICEF provide an important reality
check. According to baseline figures provided in RAM slippage could be as high as 35%. In three
provinces it was 35%. It was relatively small at 25% for FATA.158 However, one key informant
representing an implementing partner identified slippage as an important concern. In his experience, this
happens because implementing agencies and UNICEF leave the UC soon after the area is certified as
ODF, with no monitoring mechanism in place to check if ODF status is sustained.
On one hand, there is this issue of slippage, but implementing partners also reported evidence of
voluntary replication of ODF in neighboring UCs after witnessing the results of ODF in
intervention UCs. One example given was of Qilla Abduallh, where BRSP with the support of UNICEF
had helped two UCs to achieve ODF status, but, according to BRSP representative, at least 7-8 UCs
have achieved ODF status on their own. This may well be true, but it appears rather remarkable given
that PATS process is described to be very rigorous and highly structured. Apparently, these cases or
similar cases have not been studied to draw lessons to inform PATS.
Figure 21: RAM Baseline (2016) Figures for ODF Slippage
ODF interventions are aligned with the priorities and policies of other donors e.g., the World Bank and EU
are implementing nutrition sensitive interventions in Sindh, which includes strong ODF interventions. One
example of some misalignment was reported in Balochistan, where some international donors have
constructed more expensive toilets for the communities, which presented challenges for UNICEF
implementing partners in promoting low-cost toilets promoted by UNICEF. According to one of the
representatives of an implementing partner, even though they found low-cost model promoted by
UNICEF more effective and sustainable, drawing such favorable comparisons to convince people is
challenging because people find more sophisticated looking and expensive models more attractive.
There is limited critical discussion in the UNICEF documents on the implications of increased
demand for water resulting from construction of toilets, particularly pour-flush toilets. On the
ground, however, the issue is addressed by constructing pit latrines in water-stressed areas, because pit
latrines require much less water, roughly one fourth of the water needed for pour flush toilets. In areas
where it is the responsibility of women and children to fetch water, increased demand for water can add to
their burden. But such implications remain under discussed or under studied. According to one of the
implementing partners, they have never performed a systematic gender analysis of WASH activities.
Similarly, in the discourse around construction of toilets, be it in writing or verbal discussions, there was
very little mention of making toilets more accessible for people with disabilities, although people with
disabilities are selected to receive materials support for construction of toilets.
158 RAM did include baseline data for slippage for KP; instead it provided data for FATA and three other
provinces
The most important external factor that impacted WASH programme, including ODF intervention, was the
COVID-19 pandemic. It caused delays in implementation and severely constrained monitoring activities.
It also hampered some of gains made and restricted achievement of ODF status in many communities.
However, it also presented an opportunity in that it laid bare some of the important gaps and helped to put
the WASH agenda at the center stage. As a result, many schools and health facilities benefited from IPC-
WASH services. UNICEF was also quick to adapt to the context to revive its community mobilization and
engagement efforts using technology, particularly WhatsApp messaging and WhatsApp groups. The
WASH programme revived its network of CRPs and Clean and Green Champions in ways it had not
imagined before.

second most cost-effective WASH intervention. It is also considered “one of the 4, 5
cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of the COVID-19.
According to PSLM (2019-20), only 54% of households in Pakistan have specific
places for handwashing with soap, clearly indicating the low priority accorded to
HWWS
Finding HWWS 2: UNICEF gradually adapted to changing context and ceased a
unique opportunity presented by the pandemic, particularly from HWWS
perspective, to promote HWWS. UNICEF’s initial response was broad-based, but it
gradually sharpened its focus on 20 out of the 27 high-burden districts. UNICEF also
supported Education Programme with safe reopening of school by ensuring
availability and functionality of WASH facilities.
Finding HWWS 3: UNICEF and other WASH actors leveraged the opportunity
created by COVID-19 pandemic to put handwashing at the front and center of the
agenda. As part of Hand Hygiene for All Global initiative, UNICEF advocated and
supported the development of Country Road Map which linked COVID-19
preparedness and response plans with mid- and long-term national development
plans to ensure that hand hygiene remains as a key focus beyond the pandemic for
infection prevention and control (IPC) and WASH efforts.
Finding HWWS 4: Not having a separate indicator for HWWS could be
considered a missing element, which makes it impossible to measure results
for HWWS. Besides, it is clear how the fairly sophisticated C4D strategy, which
aimed to move away from technical communication to transformative communication,
was applied in practice.

domains as targets for critical behavior messaging.
Finding HWWS 7: UNICEF contributed to raising awareness of WASH as a
socio-technical enterprise and continues to highlight the importance of the
“soft-component”. However, the handiwork of the WASH programme is not
visible when it comes to influencing hygiene promotion related practices of
PHEDs and Local Governments Departments.
Finding HWWS 8: As part of COVID-19 pandemic response, UNICEF facilitated the
government and public water and sanitation utilities to install handwashing stations
(HWS) in health care facilities, high-risk schools and at-risk public spaces. Mobile
washing stations were made available by converting bulk water tankers, 4x4 trucks,
and motorcycles/rickshaws into mobile handwashing stations. Handwashing facilities
in public spaces were provided by converting old, 200-litre drums into handwashing
stations and placing them at strategic locations. These washing stations also doubled
as COVID-19 prevention and control information dissemination centers.
Finding HWWS 9: The positive unintended outcome of COVID-19 pandemic was
putting HWWS at the front and center of COVID response and possibly, through
Handwashing for All Initiative at the center of WASH agenda as well.
Finding HWWS 10: The most important factor influencing the programme was
COVID-19 pandemic. It dealt a major setback to WASH programme by constraining
its community outreach activities and immobilizing its community engagement
network. Its hold and interventions in the process constraining hygiene promotion
interventions.
Handwashing with soap (HWWS), one of the integral components of UNICEF WASH Programme, is a
highly relevant intervention because HWWS is considered the second most cost-effective WASH
interventions.160 It reduces the risk of leading causes of child mortality, including diarrhea, pneumonia,
and respiratory infections: it reduces the risk of diarrhea by 42% to 47%, pneumonia and respiratory
infection by 50% among children under five."161. Despite the proven efficacy of HWWS, the practice of
HWWS in Pakistan is very low. The most recent Pakistan Living Standard Measurement Survey (2019-
20) found that only 54% of households in Pakistan have specific places for handwashing with soap, which
clearly underlines the relevance of interventions to promote HWWS. In the context of COVID-19, HWWS
is “one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your
hands frequently with soap and water”.162
UNICEF promotes HWWS in conjunction with other positive hygiene behaviors such as the following:
1. Safe disposal of human faces
2. Safe water handling
3. Personal hygiene (washing of hands with soap and as well as body, face and clothes)
4. Food hygiene
5. Domestic and environmental hygiene
The UNICEF WASH programme does not have a separate indicator for HWWS. As a result, RAM
does not separately report achievements with respect to HWWS. However, along with the safe disposal
of excreta, safe water handling, HWWS receives greater attention in WASH programming. This

preference is also reflected in UNICEF strategy for WASH (2016-2030) which identifies these three
domains as targets for critical behavior messaging.163 UNICEF’s Pakistan’s C4D strategy, in fact, singles
out handwashing with soap as one behavior that should be promoted in all households. Despite these
emphases, not having a separate indicator for handwashing with soap in the results framework is
rather surprising, which can potentially dilute the focus on handwashing, as one of the saying
goes, “what is measured gets done”. The evaluators did not find any concrete evidence of focus being
diluted; but a specific indicator for HWWS can provide can give HWWS an additional impetus.
Impact of COVID-19 and HWWS
COVID-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity for UNICEF and other WASH actors to put HWWS at
the front and center of COVID-19 response. Covid-pandemic, at least, initially dealt a major setback to
WASH programme, particularly putting its community outreach activities on hold and constraining ODF
interventions. UNICEF staff were unable to attend their offices and because of restrictions on movement
the UNICEF community engagement network was virtually immobilized. Contacts with government
officials were also halted and UNICEF and partners staff were unable to monitor field operations.
UNICEF gradually adapted to this changing context and seized a unique opportunity presented by the
pandemic, particularly from HWWS perspective, to promote the HWWS agenda. UNICEF’s initial
response to COVID-19 was broad-based with a focus on provision of water, sanitation, hygiene
promotion, environmental cleaning and disinfection, solid waste management and capacity-building
support. These interventions were spread across Pakistan. The WASH programme gradually
concentrated its efforts on 20 out of the 27 high-burden districts. Later, it also supported the Education
Programme with safe reopening of school by ensuring availability and functionality of WASH facilities.
When UNICEF and WHO began the Hand Hygiene for All Global initiative, UNICEF advocated and
supported the development of the Country Road Map. This initiative required countries to develop
comprehensive roadmaps “that bridge together national COVID-19 preparedness and response plans
with mid- and long-term national development plans to ensure that hand hygiene remains as a key focus
beyond the pandemic for infection prevention and control (IPC) and WASH efforts.164
UNICEF facilitated the government and public water and sanitation utilities to install handwashing stations
(HWS) in health care facilities, high-risk schools and at-risk public spaces. Mobile washing stations were
made available by converting bulk water tankers, 4x4 trucks, and motorcycles/rickshaws into mobile
handwashing stations. Handwashing facilities in public spaces were provided by converting old, 200-litre
drums into handwashing stations and placing them at strategic locations. These washing stations also
doubled as COVID-19 prevention and control information dissemination centers. Key stakeholders,
government officials, representatives of implementing partners interviewed for the evaluation were aware
of and very appreciative of the responsiveness of the UNICEF WASH programme.
Handwashing with Soap in the Mainstream WASH Programme
UNICEF contributes to HWWS in direct and indirect ways. It directly contributes to promotion of
HWWS through its downstream activities implemented through implementing partners (through NGOs
in Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan and through PHED and LGD in KP).165 The indirect contributions
comes from upstream activities such as formulation or refinement of WASH policies, development
of plans, budget analyses, technical assistance to facilitate implementation of policies and Joint Sectoral
163 UNICEF (2016). Strategy for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (2016-2030).

164 WHO, Hand Hygiene for All Global Initiative
https://www.who.int/initiatives/hand-hygiene-for-all-global-initiative
165 In KP, including in merged districts, UNICEF implemented WASH interventions through the
Government agencies (PHED and LG) under a ‘special arrangement’, whereby project is actually
implemented by project teams hired by UNICEF through a third party, but they work under the umbrella of
relevant Government Departments (e.g. PHED in merged district and LGD in Mardan).
Reviews.166 Through its upstream activities UNICEF contributes to highlighting WASH as a socio-
technical enterprise as opposed to the formerly well-entrenched but gradually weakening conception of
water supply and sanitation as solely technical enterprises. In other words, through its upstream work
on policies and system strengthening UNICEF is contributing to highlight the importance of ‘soft-
component’, of which HWWS is an important part. In Sindh, for example, where LGD is leading the
implementation of World Bank-funded WASH project, which is part of multi-sectoral project for nutrition,
UNICEF provided technical support in the form of IEC material for hygiene promotion activities.
No doubt upstream work and downstream work carried out in partnership with the Government agencies
has the potential to gradually increase awareness among the government agencies about the importance
of ‘soft-component’, but the handiwork of the WASH programme is not yet visible in terms of influencing
hygiene promotion related practices of PHEDs and Local Governments Departments. In recent years,
awareness among the relevant government agencies about importance of ‘soft component’ has
noticeably increased and UNICEF can justifiably claim some credit for this. But there is plenty of evidence
to suggest that “soft component” remains either a fringe or a non-existent factor in the mainstream
WASH infrastructure, with the notable exception of Punjab where PHED has a relatively strong
Community Development Section headed by an Additional Secretary. PHED Balochistan, by some
accounts, has around 40 social mobilizers and supervisors on its payroll, but they are completely
underutilized. They do not go to office because they do not have desks assigned to them, nor any work is
assigned to them because there are no resources allocated to support their work. Similarly, PHED in KP
also has on its payroll social mobilizers (although a smaller number), who are not as underutilized as the
ones in Balochistan, but they also face resource constraints to be undertake meaningful social
mobilization or awareness raising activities. LGDs in Sindh and Balochistan despite being responsible for
sanitation functions, including monitoring of ODF activities, do not have any social mobilisers or hygiene
promoters on board. According to a UNICEF representative this neglect is partly due to absence of
approved sanitation policy, which is drafted, but it is awaiting approval for a long time. They delay is
apparently caused the high-level committee, responsible for approving the policy, was unable to meet.
However, there is one silver lining. The implementation of downstream activities, in partnership with
PHED and LGDs, even when partnership mostly means providing a broad umbrella, has the potential for
increasing awareness about importance of ‘soft component. One of the senior officials of LGD in KP
mentioned that in a sanitation project they are implementing in Mardan with the support of UNICEF, they
will deploy their sub-engineers to work with UNICEF project staff so that they can gain new knowledge
and skills.
The main vehicle used to promote HWWS is Social Behavior Change Communication (SBCC). In
practical terms, the application of SBCC involved holding meetings with the community members, forming
male and female community groups, organizing youth groups, WASH clubs in schools, conducting
awareness sessions, distribution of IEC material, in some cases, theatre performances or some variation
of these activities. SBCC activities were sometimes augmented by provision of basic wash facilities,
including toilets and handwashing facilities in communities, schools and health facilities. However, it does
come out quite clearly from the discussions with the stakeholders as well from the review of
documentation how a fairly sophisticated C4D strategy which aimed to move away from technical
communication to transformative communication was applied in practice to promote handwashing.

10. Conclusions
Conclusions are divided into two sections: cross-sectoral and sectoral. Cross sectoral conclusions are
based on the cross sectoral findings that respond to the analysis of relevance and coherence criteria.
Sectoral conclusions are based on sectoral findings for each of the selected themes separately, covering
the three criteria for the evaluation, relevance, coherence and effectiveness.167.
10.1 Cross-Sectoral Conclusions
Adequacy of CONCLUSION 1: Based on Findings BR1, BR2, BR3, VAC1, Edu-UPS1, ALP1, H1-3,
Programmes N1-2, ODF1 and HHWS1(Relevance)
All the interventions assessed were highly relevant and addressed important
needs and were aligned with the intended goals of their respective programmes.
For example, UNICEF's heath programming focused on neonatal survival and
immunization, using an integrated approach that targets the most vulnerable population.
The nutrition programme addresses the very important issue of wasting and stunting
through downstream and upstream interventions. ODF interventions were relevant
because open defecation, although on the decline, remains an ongoing issue in
Pakistan, with more than 60% of households lacking access to toilets in some districts.
Promotion of HWWS was highly relevant because it is the second most cost-effective
WASH intervention and one of the most important ways to prevent the spread of
COVID-19. Two interventions of the Child Protection programme, BR and CP-CMRS
in Baluchistan were also very relevant to protect children from neglect, abuse and
exploitation, and to provide an integrated mechanism that prevents and responds to
cases of child abuse. Upstream interventions in education were highly relevant because
of a huge policy and planning vacuum in the provinces generated after the 18th
Amendment. The ALP program was adequate to address needs and achieve the
intended goals but not sufficient enough to enroll a significant number of children.
Upstream CONCLUSION 2: Based on Findings CS1, CS2, CS3, BR2, Edu-UPS3, H2, H3, N2,
Work ODF6
UNICEF’s upstream work is the most important contribution of the UNICEF CP.
UNICEF took advantage of the opportunities offered by the 18th Amendment to
contribute to systems strengthening through evidence generation; policy
development; the introduction of equity-focused and gender responsive plans;
advocacy; and capacity development to enhance technical skills at the federal and
province levels. However, there are still challenges related to the high turnover of both
high and lower ranking government staff (owing to frequent transfers and postings);
poor institutional memory on how change happens in government agencies; and
personality driven decisions. These challenges make advocacy an uphill task and
sometimes even reverses gain already made.
CONCLUSION 3: Based on Findings CS3, BR2, VAC6, ALP3, N2 (Relevance)
UNICEF has been able to successfully leverage its resources and policies across
sectors by generating critical evidence, developing models, piloting the models, and
using advocacy to promote the scaling up of good initiatives across all sectors.
Partnerships CONCLUSION 4: Based on Findings CS8 and CS3 (Relevance)
Increased attention on upstream activities has also meant that UNICEF has further
strengthened its partnerships with government agencies. This, together with the
167 See Evaluation Matrix in Annex 4
challenges of working with NGOs, especially in KP but also in other provinces, and
concerns about managing numerous PCAs with NGOs, has meant that UNICEF has
reduced the amount of work it used to do with NGOs. Partnership with private
sector organizations has been one of the weakest areas of the Pakistan CP.
CONCLUSION 5: Based on Finding CS5, CS8 (Relevance)
The lack of a partnership strategy, coupled with a siloed approach, resulted in
significant variation in the partnership approaches adopted by different sectors and
field offices. Some of these approaches were based on conflicting assumptions. For
example, the decision to not partner with NGOs was dictated by two contradictory
assumptions. Some sections highlighted challenges related to NOCs as a reason not to
partner with NGOs, while others highlighted transparency and sustainability concerns as
a reason not to partner with them.
Addressing CONCLUSION 6: Based on Findings CS4, BR4, VAC3, Edu-UPS7, ALP 1, ALP 6, H4,
the needs of H5, N3, ODF1, ODF2, ODF5, HHWS5 (Relevance and Effectiveness)
the most
vulnerable Within this CP, UNICEF had successfully addressed the needs of some of the most
marginalized communities by selecting geographic areas based-on evidence
gleaned from key national level surveys, sometimes balanced by other considerations,
including justified political considerations and security concerns. Despite UNICEF
interventions were spread in four provinces including AJK and GB, there were some
geographic areas or districts which despite being extremely vulnerable remained
excluded due to concerns related to poor, security and remoteness (e.g., remote
areas/urban areas without LHW). The CP also considered the needs of women and
girls in its programme strategies and included gender equality considerations in all
programmes. However, different sources of information confirmed that much more
needs to be done in the programmes to adequately address the root causes of
gender inequalities in different contexts and possible ways to achieve gender equality.
Working in CONCLUSION 7: Based on Findings CS5 (Relevance)
Silos
Working in silos has limited UNICEF's ability to develop comprehensive
interventions that respond to the holistic needs of the communities that it works
with, particularly children, and especially the most vulnerable girls. It affects
many facets of work, including how needs are identified, how UNICEF selects
partners, how they approach government counterparts and how UNICEF
implements its interventions. The silo approach is also influenced by a hierarchical
and silo culture that is also observed among governmental counterparts, indicating an
organizational culture that is very difficult to change and requires long-term progressive
solutions.
C4D CONCLUSION 8:C4D: Based on Finding CS9, VAC4, H6, HHWS4, HHWS7
(Relevance)
UNICEF is recognized for its capacity to mobilize communities and communicate
messages for positive social and behavioral change. However, C4D, when
implemented through the government, is only occasionally successful since they
do not consider it a priority and are therefore not well oriented to be able to support and
implement C4D interventions. There are limitations both in terms of available resources
and capacities. C4D was seen by different stakeholders as an area for improvement,
especially in the area of MNCH and nutrition. In HWWS (WASH) where the hygiene
promotion component is not visible when it comes to influencing hygiene promotion
related practices of PHEDs and Local Governments Departments.
COVID-19 CONCLUSION 9: Based on Finding CS7, ODF8, HHWS3, HHWS 8,9, 10, H13
Response (Relevance and effectiveness)
UNICEF quicky adapted to the changed context and provided leadership for the
COVID-19 response, especially in WASH and Education, but also together with WHO in
Health, ensuring continuity of services to protect the most vulnerable women and
children. UNICEF's upstream interventions were more strategic and focused on
developing sector-specific response plans and guidelines for implementation, together
with the relevant ministries at the federal level. As downstream activities, UNICEF also
contributed to increase the routine vaccination, facilitated essential supplies and trained
frontline healthcare care workers. It also had an important role communicating and
disseminating messages in response to COVID-19. UNICEF also introduced
innovations to ensure continuity of essential services and include new initiatives,
that were not a priority before the Pandemic, but which were directly prioritized with the
COVID-19 pandemic, such as mental health issues.

The support provided by UNICEF to promote BR, including UNICEF's coordination role
at the federal and provincial levels has contributed to steadily increased registration
rates in the different provinces but above all, to the initiation of a CRVS reform
process that responds to one of the government’s key priorities. The BR programme
sought to include the most vulnerable communities/groups, including women and
children living in remote areas, despite the fact that inequalities still persist, and
remote areas continue to have lower numbers of BRs.

UNICEF has been an important strategic actor in the creation and implementation of
the CP-CMRS Model which has been taken up by the government and has promoted
cross-sectoral collaboration between different sectors. The Model has represented a step
forward in Balochistan and Pakistan in that it has the potential to improve the
protection of children who suffer abuse or violence as well as to advance efforts to
strengthen evidence-based policy making. Although the model integrates measures to
protect girls, the reporting of violence among girls remains lower than among boys.
The technical documents guiding the implementation of the model do not always identify
the different dimensions of vulnerability that integrate gender. In addition, the
prevention component of the programme is moving at a slow pace in its
implementation.
Upstream CONCLUSION 14: Based on Findings UPS 1-12 (Relevance, coherence and
Activities in effectiveness)
Education
UNICEF's upstream activities in Education were relevant and, by and large, adequate
to address the needs related to policy development and system strengthening,
including emerging needs in an evolving context. However, the underlying logic of the
Theory of Change for upstream activities was somewhat linear and did not
sufficiently recognize/reflect the complexity of processes needed to achieve the
desired change. This is in part because context-specific knowledge of how change
happens in the Government agencies, that UNICEF staff might have gleaned over the
years, is not very well documented, making it challenging to develop theories of change
that capture these complexities.
ALP CONCLUSION 15: Based on Findings ALP 1-8 (Relevance, coherence and
effectiveness)
The model implemented under the rubric of ALP is very useful in bringing a
significant number of out of school children to schools, but the model alone is not
sufficient to address the out of school problem. There are inherent contradictions
in the model regarding mainstreaming of students in regular education, especially when
it comes to the mainstreaming of girls because girls’ schools remain few and far
between, and the mobility of girls is further constrained when they reach puberty age. It
is also not ambitious and inventive enough to create a moment necessary to address
the problem of out of school children since it is only reaching out to a small percentage
of out of school children. The model does not leverage the enormous potential of
volunteers and does not seek to build on existing initiatives.
Health CONCLUSION 16: Based on Findings H1-12 (Relevance, coherence and
effectiveness)
UNICEF's heath programming has focused on neonatal survival and immunization,
using an integrated approach that targets the most vulnerable according to
government priorities and strategies. Support to all provinces and regions in
implementing the model has helped to improve neonatal and child survival rates
although challenges persist in some remote areas and urban slums where
populations are not covered by LHWs. The Integration of various sectors also
needs to be addressed as most of the slum areas are devoid of civic amenities.
Nutrition CONCLUSION 17: Based on Findings N1-N10. (Relevance, coherence and
effectiveness)
UNICEF’s nutrition programme has been relevant and has contributed to
mainstreaming nutrition interventions into the routine health service package and
to increasing regular budget allocations for nutrition services. The Nutrition
component has been added as part of the RMNCAH and thus has been making it part
and parcel of the regular programme. Strong investment cases, especially about
prevention, are needed in order to increase government ownership, predictable funding,
and change the thinking from nutrition as a response to SAM to nutrition as a multi-
sectoral programme for the good nutrition, health and productivity of the population168.
UNICEF supported all provinces and regions to develop their respective RMNCAH
strategies which are currently in use and at different stages of implementation.
The lack of funding and limited technical expertise, especially in the provinces, can
compromise the quality and effective implementation of the programme.
Handwashing CONCLUSION 18: Based on Findings HWWS 1-10 (Relevance, coherence
and effectiveness)
Promotion of HWWS is highly relevant. UNICEF has significantly contributed to the
promotion of HWWS – directly, through downstream WASH activities implemented
through its partners, and indirectly, through upstream activities. However, not having a
separate indicator for HWWS makes it challenging to measure the progress made.
UNICEF has significantly contributed to raising awareness in the government
agencies about the importance of the “soft component”, but UNICEF’s handiwork
is not quite visible when comes to influencing practices. In the mainstream
Government water supply and sanitation projects, the hygiene promotion component is
either completely neglected or remains on the fringes with the notable exception
of Punjab where there is a functional community development department.
ODF CONCLUSION 19: Based on Findings ODF 1-8 (Relevance, coherence and
effectiveness)
ODF interventions remain highly relevant because open defecation, although on
the decline, remains an important issue in Pakistan, with a few districts having more
than 60% households without access to toilets. Selection of target communities for
168 MTR 2020.
ODF interventions is typically informed by key survey results and discussions with
relevant government departments. The use of survey data does bring a great deal
of objectivity and specificity to the selection process, but occasionally this restricts
partners from making use of their knowledge of the context. On the whole, UNICEF
was able to address the needs of the most underserved communities within
more deserving districts. UNICEF also offered additional benefits to the most
marginalized households in the form of in-kind support for the construction of toilets.
‘slippage’ however, remains a key concern for the WASH programme.
11. Lessons Learnt
The lessons learnt, provided below, are a distilled synthesis from the analysis and findings with reference
to the evaluation questions. The lessons provided below are learnings from the current CP
implementation. The learnings are expected to have a wider impact on UNICEF. They support the
recommendations and actions that should be taken into consideration when developing the next CP
1 In a context where social service delivery has been devolved to the provinces, it is important
to bring UNICEF's work closer to provincial government counterparts to address the
differentiated needs of each province.
2 A siloed approach can promote a silo mentality that limits cross-learning, affects
communication with government counterparts and reduces UNICEF's ability to provide
integrated solutions for the beneficiary population.
3 The ability to partner with other organizations such as The Aga Khan University and American
Academy of Science, USA allowed UNICEF to draw from a larger pool of technical
expertise to deliver high-quality services efficiently and effectively.
4 UNICEF's experience demonstrates that when the use of technology is needed to reach a very
large segment of the population, it is better to rely on technologies that are already in use
rather than using experimental technologies. UNICEF used SMS and WhatsApp messages
to send awareness messages to communities.
5 Many government agencies in Pakistan appear to have a strong preference for the 'hard
component' (such as infrastructure projects) over the ‘softer components’ (such as
community mobilization, awareness raising and less preference for community
mobilization, awareness raising and capacity building). The preference for physical
infrastructure projects is also reflected in the way government departments are organized,
which explains why UNICEF’s C4D section also found it difficult to find a counterpart in
government departments. The C4D function in the government agencies is either non-existent
or under-utilized and under-resourced. This has strong implications for C4D because, in the
absence of systems for C4D, it tends to be put on the back burner, which in turn
compromises the outcomes associated with C4D.
6 Using differing approaches to partnerships is not necessarily an undesirable thing so
long as strategy is informed by shared, critically scrutinized, and well documented
assumptions.
7 Harmful social norms and discriminatory practices towards women and girls can be reduced
by addressing the root causes of gender inequalities in the various different geographic
and cultural contexts of the country.
12. Recommendations
Recommendations have been structured according to cross-sectoral and sectoral analysis. The
recommendations that are based on the cross-sectoral findings and conclusions have been included in
order of priority except sectoral recommendations that are presented according to sequence of the
chapters, and they are not presented in order of priority. There has been some participation of UNICEF
staff in the process of developing the recommendations. They were partially presented and discussed
with PCO in the preliminary findings presentation and they were also presented to ROSA regional
advisors who provided their feedback involved in the process of developing the recommendations.
12.1 Cross-Sectoral Recommendations
Recommendation 1- UNICEF Strategic Positioning in the Provinces
Strengthen UNICEF's strategic positioning in the provinces by Recipient: Based on
further adapting programmes to the provincial context, UNICEF PCO, conclusions
integrating sectoral programmes and ensuring greater FOs, ROSA 1, 2, 3 and 4
coordination between the different programmes at the provincial
level. It is also important to strengthen the technical and human
resource capacities needed to conduct upstream work.
In practical terms, this might require, among other things, the
development of a more contextualised and unified theory of change for
each province, the production of unified province-wide annual reports,
the development of new capacities such as political economy analysis
and systems thinking, and the strengthening of C4D capacities.
Recommendation 2- Gender Transformative Programming
Ensure gender-transformative programming and gender Recipient: Based on
integration while deepening and strengthening the focus on UNICEF PCO conclusions
adolescent girls in all programme sections. and FOs 6, 7 and 11
Gender-transformative programming, will allow UNICEF to adequately
reflect the root causes of gender inequalities in the different provinces.
This will in turn contribute to addressing gender inequalities, removing
structural barriers to equality, and empowering disadvantaged girls,
boys, women, and men from diverse population groups.169 UNICEF
could consider adding a gender outcome, along with a specific
indicator focused on adolescent girls. This would reduce to risk of
diluting the focus on gender and would bring all sections under one
umbrella and would help reduce siloed work while helping to provide a
holistic response to the needs of girls and women.
Recommendation 3- Siloed Approach
Make greater efforts to move away from a siloed approach to a Recipient: Based on
networked approach in which sectors integrate their efforts UNICEF PCO, Conclusions:
without losing sight of the results they want to achieve. FOs, ROSA 5, 6, 7, 10, 15
and 16
UNICEF could take some concrete measures including the following:
169 This is aligned with the Gender Policy GAP III that is going to be submitted to the Executive Board this
year and with the UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022–2025, (draft for review)
• Create a unified theory of change at the FO level to
provide a conceptual basis for the integration of
programmes.
• Work with UNDP to create a composite ‘development
index’ along the lines of the Human Development Index.
• Create incentives for sectors to work together to improve
the composite index rather than focusing on their sectoral
achievements
• Cross-functional and sectoral integration and
coordination among existing teams should be
strengthened for joint planning, implementation and
monitoring to implement integrated projects.
• Rotating staff between different departments (but also
between COs and provinces) could also help to promote
dialogue and understanding across sectors.
Recommendation 4- C4D
Continue to advocate for the importance of community Recipient: Based on
engagement and social mobilisation given the weak capacity of UNICEF PCO Conclusions
the government to implement C4D for “soft interventions”. At the and FOs 7, 8 10, 12,
same time, UNICEF can continue to partner with NGOs and CBOs 15, 16, 17
to benefit from their social mobilization and community
participation capacities. UNICEF should also facilitate dialogue
and linkages between government and local NGOs and local
organisations to increase community outreach.
Community engagement can be compromised by working with the
government. It would be interesting for UNICEF Pakistan to continue
to engage with NGOs and CBOs while also encouraging the
government to make use of those organizations for social mobilization,
awareness raising and so on. With C4D being a central component of
the country programme, UNICEF could strengthen the capacity of the
C4D offices in the provinces, which so far have mainly focused on the
COVID-19 response. Given the broad scope of activities that each
sector has in the provinces, it may be unrealistic for a single field
officer to manage all the work done by the sectors. In this regard, the
country office needs to introduce formulas that are financially
sustainable but also respond to the needs of the provinces.
Recommendation 5- Partnerships
The approach to partnerships should be guided by a clear Recipient: Based on
strategy that continues to include different approaches that UNICEF PCO Conclusions
reflect contextual realities of different sectors and FOs, but it and FOs 4 and 5
should demonstrate that the choices made are thoughtful and
deliberate.
Recommendation 6- Knowledge Management
UNICEF should carefully document the process of its upstream Recipient: Based on
work with the government and then, through careful analysis, distil UNICEF PCO Conclusions:
lessons regarding how change occurs in government agencies and and FOs 1, 2 and 8
regarding the differences in this regard between provincial contexts
and different government departments.
UNICEF can also make use of what has been written about
bureaucratic reform in Pakistan and add to it their own knowledge
and those of other UN partners to make more informed decisions. It
can also document what has been learned from the COVID-19
response

replication of the Model. Strengthen linkages with other
organizations to prevent and respond to GBV and create a
method to rapidly deploy and operationalize child protection
services in emergencies (SOPS).
In a context of strong inequalities and tribal traditions such as in
Baluchistan, it is very important to strengthen prevention and
awareness raising, especially regarding girls who are the most
vulnerable and face the greatest problems of social stigma. It is also
important to work with the child protection committees, to ensure that
the most vulnerable children are integrated and protected by the
model. Continuous learning should be considered to identify how all
parties involved work together, but also to identify best practices,
challenges and ways to overcome them, especially for replication.
Recommendation 9- ALP
UNICEF should use ALP as a framework for creating multiple Recipient; Based on
pathways to enroll out of school children. The ALP model being Departments, Conclusion
used should be thought of as one of many alternative pathways. UNICEF PCO 15

support the most promising ones. There is also a need to build on the
huge untapped volunteer potential, including retired teachers and
other government servants and student’ volunteers who might like to
volunteer for initiatives to educate OOSC.
Recommendation 10- Health

Coverage should be enhanced by increasing the number of LHWs up
to 150,000. Expansion of LHW Programme should be to priority areas as
defined by health needs and marginalization based on evidence to improve
equity and to enhance the pro-poor performance of the programme170. The
reform effort should also address the reported issue that much of the
LHWs’ time is consumed by planning and implementation of polio
campaigns leaving little time to address MNCH issues. LHWs also
need to be better equipped by giving them more rigorous training on
MNCH--especially on the C4D, and nutrition, including demand
generation, nutrition screening and early detections – and by providing
them with essential supplies.
Recommendation 11- Health and Nutrition
Continue supporting the provincial/regional health departments Recipient: Based on

across the country. and FOs 17
Given that government technical and financial capacities are still too
weak to implement the national RMNCAH&N strategy effectively,
UNICEF should continue providing assistance in the form of trainings,
materials and monitoring support. UNICEF FOs should increase their
staff capacities in order to assist the provinces.
Recommendation 12- Nutrition
The role of LHWs in the nutrition programmes needs to be Recipient: Based on

practices so that mothers adopt healthy feeding practices, as well and FOs 17
as prevent, early detect and treat acute malnutrition.
As part of the RMNCAH programme, the nutrition component should
be emphasized to educate mothers on optimal breastfeeding,
complementary feeding and dietary diversity. It also needs to be
integrated with the WASH component, especially, excreta disposal,
and hand washing with soap. Improved and integrated nutrition and
WASH training may be a challenge due to the cost. However, there is
a need to support the LHW programme to improve its coverage in
remote and marginalized areas, as well as to implement C4D-
integrated communication activities to educate women and adolescent
girls, and to have sufficient resources of supplies. Another challenge
may be the integration of sectors for health and nutrition promotion;
nutrition and WASH should work in unison to help improve nutrition. In
addition, policy environment for support and integration of nutrition with
primary health care (PHC) and nutrition information system (NIS) need
also to be strengthened.

Recommendation 14- ODF
Include a more participatory approach in the selection of UNICEF PCO Based on

should also be based on local partners' knowledge of the area 19
and their understanding of what works and what does not work.
The data-driven approach needs to be balanced with a more
qualitative understanding of the local context. Local implementing
partners may have insights into local dynamics that are not captured
by aggregate percentages. Local implementers may be in a better
position to identify risks and decide which communities to target first to
ensure a higher success rate. This may to some extent address the
relatively high slippage rates.
