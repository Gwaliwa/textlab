PREFACE
South Africa spends 6.2% of its GDP on education2 - the largest allocation compared with other sectors –
but its learning outcomes have not been commensurate with this level of spending. The challenge is not
enrolment – the country has achieved near universal access to education, with gender parity, at primary
and secondary levels. To address historical inequalities of a highly unequal education system inherited from
colonialism and Apartheid, the government has prioritised education as a key area of investment and
implemented policies and programmes, including the promotion of gender parity in education, i.e., equal
access to quality education for all citizens, regardless of their gender. Despite progress, systemic
challenges remain, and outcomes are extremely unequal. The majority of primary schools in South Africa
are severely under resourced. Other serious challenges in the sector are a lack of accountability and
technical capacity in the system. One of the outcomes of concern are literacy: almost a third of South African
learners are still functionally illiterate in English by the end of Grade 6.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to make the already glaring inequalities in South Africa
even worse. As part of the nationwide lockdown on the economy and social activities, schools in South
Africa were closed, with some later shifting to online learning to compensate for the time that had been lost
in the school year. While this may not have been a difficult shift for higher-income (quintile 4-5) schools,
approximately 74% of children in South Africa attending lower-income (quintile 1, 2 and 3) schools and
have limited access to IT resources and internet. Thus, school closures resulted in a devastating loss in
teaching and learning time.
In spite of schools reopening, the challenge with learning losses remains and will be difficult to recover. For
example, learners who were in Grade 1 in 2020 and lost approximately 4-6 months of learning time. Those
same learners would have ideally been in Grade 2 in 2021, and again lost a significant amount of learning
time. These losses are already anticipated to have displaced learners and their levels of literacy, especially
in relation to previous generations. Even as children returned to school, the need for continued educational
and gap bridging support remained a major imperative.
Through a programme called the Reading and Leadership Strengthening in South African Schools for
Learning during COVID-19 and Beyond (REALS-SA) Programme, UNICEF partnered with the South
African Department of Basic Education (DBE) to support the continuation of learning, particularly in lower
quintile schools; as well as to contribute to the achievement of the DBE’s pre-existing strategic ambitions
around teaching capacity development and assessment. This is in alignment to UNICEF’s cooperation with
the DBE on achieving “quality basic education by improving the key determinants that impact the quality of
education and educational outcomes…to confront South Africa’s reading and numeracy challenges”
(UNICEF, 2022). The European Union was the main funder. The National Education Collaboration Trust
(NECT) and three other South African entities acted as implementing partners. The programme focused on
three of South Africa’s nine provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and the Eastern Cape) with direct support
to 650 schools in total. The programme consisted of four sub-programmes with mutually reinforcing
objectives: Leadership and Management; Recovery curriculum; Reading Recovery; and Assessment for
Learning. The programme was implemented from 2021 to 2023.
The evaluation was conducted in early 2023, i.e. towards the end of the implementation period, and focused
on the design and implementation of the programme. A mixed-methods approach was employed, drawing
on programme documentation and data; seven school case studies; and interviews and focus groups with
stakeholders. The report makes recommendations for the final stages of REALS-SA implementation as well
as future similar initiatives that may be undertaken by UNICEF, DBE, NECT or others.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The Reading and Leadership Strengthening in South Africa (REALS SA) Programme was conceptualised
and implemented in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education system and
learners. The South African education system was already struggling with underperformance and inequality
when Covid-19 crisis and school closures hit, exacerbating the challenges. The loss of learning time,
combined with systemic factors and the unprecedented nature of the situation, highlighted the urgent need
for support interventions to ensure continued learning. Informed by, and in an attempt to correct this, the
REALS SA programme was launched in 2021 in collaboration with the Department of Basic Education
(DBE), the National Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) and the European Union (EU), with the aim of
improving literacy rates and strengthening leadership in the education sector, particularly during times of
crises.
The programme focused on quintiles 1, 2, and 3 schools in South Africa, and had several objectives. First,
it aimed to support the DBE’s efforts to continue learning through both traditional and innovative
approaches. Second, it sought to support curriculum trimming as part of a larger curriculum recovery
programme, with a focus on developing a quality assurance framework and capacity building. Third, the
programme aimed to develop training and coaching programmes for school leadership, governance, and
districts, with a focus on accountability, emergency response and parental involvement. Given that this
programme was intended as a recovery programme, it did not exclusively work with education officials, but
instead focused on building the capacity of caregivers and stakeholders involved in teaching and learning
such as principals, teachers, SMT members and education officials. The 4 main workstreams or pillars of
the programme were: Reading Recovery; Recovery Curriculum; Assessment for Learning (AfL); and
Leadership and Management.
Evaluation objectives
The evaluation focused on the design and implementation of the REALS SA programme, with an aim to
understand whether the programme was designed and implemented in a way that would contribute
meaningfully to achieving its intended outcomes and inform future educational programmes of a similar
nature. The evaluation did not assess the impact of the programme as this is not feasible given the timing
of the evaluation and the design of the programme.
Methodology
This was a theory-based evaluation which applied participatory, utilisation-focused and equity approaches.
A Theory of Change (ToC) and logical framework were employed to construct the evaluation matrix, which
facilitated the tracking of implementation results. A subset of OECD-DAC evaluation criteria (relevance,
effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability) were applied with a gender and equity analysis framework to
capture and report on both dimensions.
The evaluation employed a mixed method approach of both primary and secondary data collection. The
evaluation conducted desk reviews of programme documents and wider literature, and conducted focus
groups and interviews conducted at both programme and school case study levels, and an online survey.
The biggest challenges faced were limited programme monitoring data and documentation, and poor
engagement from education officials.
iii
Key findings
In terms of relevance, the REALS SA programme benefited from the collaboration of EU, DBE, UNICEF
and the NECT in their respective programme governance and management roles. Leveraging each
institution’s strengths and positioning, the programme was able to work directly within and through the
education system, drawing on the experience of similar work in the South African context, with international
funding and expertise. The programme had a logic strong enough to translate into a coherent ToC through
a co-creation process with programme stakeholders and role-players. Nevertheless, the programme’s
design had potential for improvement, particularly due to unmet assumptions, notably underestimating the
time required for implementation. Most participants understood the programme’s intent. Gender and equity
sensitivity was intended in some workstreams, with the recovery curriculum being the only one to explicitly
achieve it. Overall, this was a relevant programme whose design aligned with stakeholders and context,
yet underestimated risks that strained implementation.
In terms of effectiveness, planned activities were largely successfully implemented, although time
constraints impacted completion rates. Most targeted participants were reached, with a few remaining
activities that could potentially reach more participants. Where data was available, the training and coaching
sessions, as well as the produced materials, have been described as relevant and useful by the recipients.
There have been early reports of the training content filtering into daily practices, such as the use of reading
resources or school management, although the SMT survey also suggested that it is not always easy to
apply leadership training (albeit relevant and easy-to-understand) in a school environment. The materials
that have been received are being adequately used, except for the reading resources where training has
not been received yet. The effectiveness of the “train the trainer” design in the AfL workstream is uncertain,
with an enthusiastic response by those trained, but limited evidence of the education system’s ability to
facilitate the necessary next layer of implementation without the support of the implementing partner.
In evaluating the efficiency of the programme, it is notable that while there were some successes, there
were several challenges that impacted on the quality of programme delivery and allocation of budget for
planned activities. The no-cost extension provided some relief, enabling service providers to complete some
planned activities that were affected by the delays in implementation. Implementation delays were mainly
attributable to contextual factors such as floods, a lack of technological support in some provinces, delays
and unavailability of officials, and difficulties in securing approval for dates and venues. These limitations
led to sessions being rescheduled and additional funding being required, with insufficient initial budgeting
for streaming reading programmes in radio stations and limited reading materials contributing to further
budget shortfalls. It also appears that there was inadequate resourcing of a central monitoring function.
Despite these challenges, the programme was efficient in delivering some of its activities and relevant
outputs, with the use of service providers allowing NECT to deliver on key activities without being
overburdened.
Finally, for the likelihood of sustained benefits from capacity building and training, the evidence is uneven
across workstreams. Materials that have been developed through the workstreams such as the quality
assurance framework (QAF), the reading resource audit and the training modules for school principals, are
likely to remain available for use and/or adaptation in the education system post-REALS SA
implementation. It remains unclear, however, to what extent there is an intention on the part of national or
provincial departments to do so.
In terms of incorporating gender and equity, the programme design was inherently responsive to inequities
in that it targeted provinces with persistently poor educational outcomes, high poverty rates, and lower
quintiles comprising of no-fee schools. However, it did not include any explicit measures to ensure that
iv
equity and gender considerations were factored into each workstream and accommodated into
implementation planning. In other words, despite a gender and equity responsive overall design, the
programme did not fully incorporate gender and equity elements in implementation, which could have
improved its effectiveness. Nevertheless, the targeted interventions did provide opportunities for vulnerable
participants from historically disadvantaged backgrounds and caregivers who are often excluded from
educational programmes to participate in their children's education. These efforts aimed to build capacity
and empower these individuals, while also promoting inclusivity in the educational system.
Conclusions
The programme’s alignment with both EU priorities and the DBE's objectives, coupled with the combined
strengths of DBE, UNICEF, and NECT, underscores the importance of collaboration and strategic planning
in designing impactful educational initiatives. The programme’s positive assessment, particularly in terms
of the relevance of materials and capacity-building sessions, indicates largely successful implementation.
Early reports of training content influencing daily practices demonstrate early signs of impact, although the
evaluation's inability to gauge long-term outcomes suggests the need for continued monitoring and
evaluation.
While the programme set ambitious timelines, it encountered challenges related to procurement, delivery,
and implementation. Delays in book distribution and the necessity for a no-cost extension highlight the
complexities of large-scale projects, especially when confronted with external contextual factors beyond
the programme’s immediate control. The programme’s adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as
underestimations of expenses and connectivity challenges hampering the use of online modes of delivery,
showcases the importance of flexible budget management and the ability to respond to evolving situations.
The Lessons Learned section's recommendations for more realistic budgeting demonstrate a commitment
to continuous improvement.
Despite its successes, the programme missed opportunities, such as excluding deputy principals from
certain training sessions and limited support for certain training initiatives. These gaps underscore the
importance of comprehensive inclusivity and support strategies. The focus on creating reusable and
adaptable materials offers potential for long-term sustainability within the education system.
Involving education officials in the programme’s development and rollout showcases a commitment to
engaging key stakeholders. However, the uncertainty surrounding the advancement of certain workstreams
by the DBE and PDEs indicates a need for transparent communication and clear plans for the programme’s
future.
Overall, the REALS SA programme demonstrated the value of collaboration, targeted capacity building,
and adaptive management in educational initiatives. While achieving positive outcomes and impactful
materials, the programme also highlights the complexities of implementation, the importance of ongoing
evaluation, and the potential for sustainable impact within the education system.
Lessons learned
Many of the evaluation insights are best applied as lessons for future programmes of a similar nature by
the participating organisations. The following lessons have been identified, informed and supplemented by
REALS SA stakeholders:
v
- Collaboration across entities: It appears that the overall arrangements for collaboration between
UNICEF, DBE, NECT and the EU were effective, leveraging their strengths, and a similar
arrangement may be considered in future.
- Prioritisation of the programme: The workstreams were in line with departmental priorities, but
the DBE and provincial departments had competing priorities and stretched capacity, affecting their
responsiveness and communication, and there are concerns about the commitment to taking the
work further. The REALS SA experience nevertheless reinforces the importance of working with
and through the system. Further stakeholder reflection should distil lessons on how to do so
effectively.
- Co-designing workstreams: Collaborative co-design of interventions with provincial departments
and even target populations may have resolved logistical challenges and increased ownership and
prioritization of the program.
- Integrated vs. standalone workstreams: There are advantages and disadvantages to having
multiple workstreams as a single programme, and stakeholders should reflect on this to determine
what would work best under specific circumstances.
- Train the trainer model: Programme experience suggests that a train-the-trainer model is risky,
as it involves a longer causal chain and assumes the commitment and capacity of the recipient
institution or trainees for further implementation. Therefore assumptions and risks must be carefully
articulated and tracked with sufficient space for adaptation.
- Careful logistical planning: Logistical realities must be factored into planning for a programme
that involves physical travel to schools, in order to set realistic time frames and allocate sufficient
resources.
- Factors conducive to online engagement: Lessons from the REALS SA programme show that
good connectivity, age profiles, digital confidence, relationships between schools and
implementers, support from district officials, and general health and performance of the institution
are factors that affect online engagement, and if these factors are unconducive, online training
should be avoided.
- Adequate resourcing of monitoring: The REALS SA programme's reliance on progress reporting
for monitoring, with no centralised monitoring and data management and analysis function, was
disadvantageous, obscuring the extent of workstreams' convergence on the ground, and
undermining the quality of data available for the evaluation, demonstrating the need for investment
in a sound monitoring system and human resources to implement it consistently.
- Gender and equity considerations: The REALS SA programme's gender and equity
considerations highlighted the importance of translating an overall inclusive approach carefully into
practicalities of implementation and the content of materials and training to remove barriers to
education and promote a more supportive learning environment that ensures all students have
access to quality education and promotes diversity and inclusion in the classroom.
- Radio programmes: Although the evaluation’s evidence was very limited, it appears that radio
programmes are not necessarily a high-impact intervention to reach parents in the South African
context. Forthcoming listenership reports must help to confirm or disprove this.
Recommendations
Informed by a workshopping process with all REALS SA programme stakeholders, role players and
recipients, the report makes recommendations on and exit and sustainability plan, as well as general
recommendations for DBE, UNICEF and NECT.
vi
Recommendations for the exit and sustainability strategy are for it to prioritise three objectives: (1)
strengthening data on what was achieved and who was reached, (2) responding to gaps in implementation,
and (3) working with DBE and PDEs to develop and endorse plans for taking forward each workstream.
This is needed in order to manage reputation risk, substantiate claims, and ensure sustained benefit and
use. Strengthening data is important to confirm which interventions were received, while responding to gaps
in implementation may require distribution of materials. Finally, working with DBE and PDEs is crucial to
develop a plan on how to use the materials and assets going forward, ideally integrated into their next draft
Strategic Plans, Annual Performance Plans, and budgets for the upcoming MTEF.
In addition to the above, the evaluation recommends five key actions for the EU, UNICEF, DBE and NECT
to take forward. Firstly, to build on the collaboration achieved during the REALS SA programme by
considering further collaboration to strengthen education outcomes. Secondly, UNICEF should allocate
additional resources to mitigate the most salient identified threats to programme effectiveness, including
the rollout of AfL training. Thirdly, assess the realisation of outcomes by incorporating data from forthcoming
datasets and embarking on a qualitative and potentially case study-based approach. Fourthly, reflect further
and articulate more actionable lessons on some of the key programme issues such as multi-workstream
programmes, gender and equity, working with and through the education system, and online delivery.
Lastly, ensure that the lessons learned are communicated and applied in future programmes through a
communications and learning plan.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and purpose of the evaluation
This is the Final Report for the evaluation of the Reading and Leadership Strengthening in South African
Schools for Learning during COVID-19 and Beyond (REALS SA) programme. This programme was
developed by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) in collaboration with UNICEF, the National
Education Collaboration Trust (NECT) and the European Union (EU) as a response to the risk and crises
incited by the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in Quintile 1, 2 and 3 schools in South Africa. The
programme commenced in 2021 and is scheduled to conclude by mid-2023.
The purpose of this evaluation is to understand whether the REALS SA project was designed and
implemented in a way that contributes meaningfully to achieving the intended outcomes, and to inform
future programming to make the impact of these outcomes more likely. The programme is evaluated against
the criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability. It does not address the criterion of
impact as this would not be feasible given the timing of the evaluation and the design of the programme,
but comments on the likely achievement of outcomes based on the quality of implementation.
The evaluation is being conducted at this stage to help programme stakeholders and role players to better
understand and the programme theory of change and logic, and to assess programme delivery, procedures,
and processes to understand what is happening in practice, how it is happening, and why it is
happening. The final evaluation products will be used by the NECT, DBE, UNICEF, and broader members
of the education sector to identify lessons learned for similar future projects, including how to better design
and implement programmes, and to inform future programme funding decisions.
1.2 Structure of the report
Beginning with an in-depth description of the REALS SA programme, section 2 looks at the context in which
the programme was conceptualised, inquiring into the problem statement(s) that triggered the
implementation of the programme. It then gives a description of the programme, the programme structure,
how sub-programmes relate to the main programme as well as the programme’s high-level theory of
change.
Section 3 speaks to the evaluation framework and methodology, highlighting that this evaluation is a
combination of a design and implementation evaluation. It then discusses the evaluation criteria applied
along with the evaluation questions, the evaluation matrix, the evaluation methodology, programme
documentation and data that has informed the evaluation to date as well as the primary data collected
during the evaluation. Section 3 also focuses on the analytical approaches employed by the evaluation, the
ethical considerations applied, as well as the various limitations encountered during the process.
Section 4 presents the findings of the evaluation. It does so by firstly presenting findings in relation to the
relevance and sustainability of the programme design, then proceeds to discuss the effectiveness and
efficiency of the overall programme implementation. Part of distilling the programme implementation
findings is assessing the implementation of each of the four sub-programmes against the evaluation criteria,
segueing into the next section.

Section 5 of the report presents the evaluation’s conclusions on the REALS SA programme design and
implementation. Section 6 then presents the programme lessons learnt and section 7 presents the
programme recommendations distilled through the evaluation.
It is important to note that this final report is preceded by three other reports, namely: the Evaluation
Inception Report; Revised Full Inception Report (as approved by the Ethical Review Board), and the
Evaluation Fieldwork Report. These offer further details on some aspects of the evaluation design,
methodology and data collection.
2 CONTEXT AND DESCRIPTION OF THE
REALS SA PROGRAMME
This section provides a description of the REALS SA programme. It begins by providing contextual
information, proceeding to link policy and strategic relevance of the programme, and then finally discusses
the programme design inclusive of the ToC.
2.1 Context And Problem Statement
The ability to read is one of the many building blocks for learning, and ensures children get the most out of
their schooling. Literacy at the primary school level is the most cost-effective investment in the fight against
poverty as it directly tackles unemployment by upskilling people to a level where they can secure a job or
start a business and make a meaningful contribution to society (Help2Read, 2022). Future learning depends
on the ability to read for meaning and pleasure, and the fundamental understanding of the relation between
print and spoken language that comes with this ability (Spaull & Draper, 2015). In order to be able to read
to learn, children must be able to “decode text relatively fluently and accurately; this is a prerequisite for
learning higher order literacy skills such as the comprehension of text and assimilation [absorption] of
knowledge communicated in text” (Meiklejohn et al., 2021).
Unfortunately, the opportunity of learning to read for meaning as well as with fluency, accuracy and
comprehension is scarce for the majority of South African children. Spaull & Draper (2015) find that
“whether children are tested in their home language or in English, the conclusions are the same: the vast
majority of South African children cannot read for meaning by the end of Grade 4 – even in their home
language – and almost a third are still functionally illiterate in English by the end of Grade 6”.
In the South African context, the difficulties involved in making this transition from ‘learning to read’ to
‘reading to learn’ are compounded by the change in the Language of Learning and Teaching (LoLT) that
most South African learners experience when they progress into the intermediate phase, or Grade 4. Given
this reality, ideally one of the most common types of literacy interventions employed in South Africa, similar
to the global trend, should be early grade reading interventions (Meiklejohn et al., 2021). Graham & Kelly
(2019) define these as “interventions that employ a combination of five components: at a minimum, they
must train teachers to teach reading using simplified instructional techniques and evidence-based curricula.
In addition, they typically include in-class coaching and the provision of instructional guidelines, instructional
materials, or tools for student assessment” (Meiklejohn et al., 2021).
2
While the country spends 6.2% of its GDP on education3 - the largest allocation compared to other sectors
- the learning outcomes have not been commensurate with this level of spending. High rates of grade
repetition are observed in Grades 1, 8 and 11, signalling potential inadequacies in preparing children for
curriculum-related challenges, most especially with respect to reading acquisition. Furthermore, a historic
failure to problematise the material conditions of marginalised children’s lives is a shortcoming of literacy
policy, hence the continuation of largely unequal schooling (Meiklejohn et al., 2021). The majority of primary
schools in South Africa are severely under resourced. Two or three books are shared between an entire
classroom of learners, while writing utensils and literacy resources are scarce (Help2Read, 2022). Few
children from poor township communities have books at home, and libraries are often too far away for these
learners to access on a regular basis, if at all. Other serious challenges in the sector are a lack of
accountability and technical capacity in the system, which continue to threaten the already poor quality of
education outcomes.
In a strategic attempt to address the varying challenges within under-resourced communities, the schooling
quintile system was introduced. Predicated on the unemployment rate and literacy rate of the community
in which the school is located, the development of the National Norms and Standards for School Funding
(NNSSF) aimed to improve equity in the funding of education by ranking each school into one of five
quintiles. A Quintile 1 ranking indicates a poor/impoverished school, and a Quintile 5 ranking indicates a
wealthy/affluent school (Department of Education, 2006). The reasoning behind this notion is that schools
serving poor communities (Quintiles 1, 2 and 3) should receive more state funding than schools serving
wealthier communities (van Dyk & White, 2019).
Learners from Quintile 4 and 5 schools often perform better than learners from Quintile 1, 2 and 3 schools
(Ferguson, Bovaird & Mueller, 2007). Furthermore, rural children and poor children in South Africa perform
worse than children from other African countries living under similar circumstances, despite better access
to resources, better-qualified teachers and lower learner/educator ratios in South Africa. Similarly, based
on data from the PIRLS on Grade 5 reading assessment and dividing schools based on their medium of
instruction (English or Afrikaans vs. African language), learners from schools using African Languages as
a medium of instruction perform lower than those from English/Afrikaans medium schools (Taylor & Yu,
2009).
Despite SA achieving near universal access to education, with gender parity, at primary and secondary
levels, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened to make the already glaring inequalities in
South Africa even worse. The COVID-19 pandemic represented the biggest shock to the global public
health system in over a century with resounding impact on economies and societies. The pandemic created
uncertainties that led countries to take bold actions to safeguard public health, such as “complete lockdowns
of economies and social activities” (COGTA & UNDP South Africa, 2020). Poor households and
communities have carried the greater burden of the pandemic’s impact, particularly within the schooling
environment.
As part of the nationwide lockdown on the economy and social activities, schools in South Africa were
closed, with some later shifting to online learning in order to compensate for the time that had been lost in
the school year. While this may not have been a difficult shift for Quintile 4 and 5 schools, Quintile 1-3
schools were disproportionately affected by the school closures as they generally have poor infrastructure
and IT connectivity (UNICEF, 2021a). With approximately 74% of children in South Africa attending Quintile
1, 2 and 3 schools, school closures resulted in a devastating loss in teaching and learning time. All schools
were closed from the third week of March through to 31 August 2020, with subsequent limited, phased
return of learners to classes, meaning over 40% of school days were lost for most children in 2020 because

of the pandemic. The missed school days have threatened the many gains towards remedying the already
sub-optimal outcomes for children in SA.
The Covid-19 crisis and school closure has brought havoc on the already underperforming and unequal
South African education system. The loss of learning time4, coupled with the compounding factors of the
sector (highlighted above) and the constraints of schools having to deal with an unprecedented situation,
underscores the crucial need for support interventions for continuation of learning. More than 13 million
children were affected by the closure of schools with a further 9 million children who normally benefit from
the government school-feeding programme not having access to a nutritious meal during the periods of
complete school closure, and on some days during the partial return to school. In addition, school health
programmes have been disrupted and some children are more vulnerable to abuse and violence outside
of the learning environment (UNICEF, 2021a). While distance-learning mechanisms are continuously being
implemented, they are disadvantaging those without internet access or adult supervision.
In spite of schools reopening, the challenge with learning losses remains and will be difficult to recover. For
example, learners who are currently in Grade 3 were in Grade 1 in 2020 and lost approximately 4-6 months
of learning time. Those same learners were in Grade 2 in 2021 and again lost a significant amount of
learning time. These losses are already anticipated to have displaced learners and their levels of literacy,
especially in relation to previous generations. It is recognised that even as children return to school, the
need for continued educational support remains a major imperative.
2.2 Policy and strategic relevance
The urgency of implementing the programme was underscored by a convergence of crucial factors,
including recovering lost learning time. The proposed intervention aligned seamlessly with the revised
"Education for Employability" (E4E) Financing Agreement between the EU and the Government of South
Africa, a commitment that gained significance within the multifaceted context of the crisis (European
Commission, 2018). Beyond its classification as a health crisis, the far-reaching ramifications of COVID-19
encompassed economic, security, educational, humanitarian, and human rights dimensions. Globally,
substantial evidence indicated that the COVID-19-induced learning losses were anticipated to endure over
an extended period. Under the umbrella of the UNICEF Emergency Appeal, a vital contribution agreement
was envisaged between UNICEF and the EU Delegation in South Africa, aimed at supporting the
Department of Basic Education (DBE) in its comprehensive response to COVID-19 through the E4E
initiative.
This programme manifested with a sense of immediacy, as it sought to empower schools to address and
mitigate the educational fallout of COVID-19. Support for the DBE encompassed a spectrum of
interventions, ranging from reading recovery to curriculum catch-up and wider systems strengthening. The
UNICEF Emergency Appeal (2020) operated with a twofold objective, centering on the immediate
exigencies of school closures and extending its purview to the post-closure phase. Collaborating closely
with governmental bodies, the private sector, and civil society, the programme sought to bridge educational
gaps and facilitate curriculum catch-up. An illustrative instance of this collaboration was evident in the
partnership with the Children’s Radio Foundation (UNICEF, 2021a), facilitating the development and
dissemination of educational messages through youth-friendly radio media, as exemplified by the
production of radio episodes for the REALS SA programme.
4 Lack of play opportunities due to COVID confinement- resulted in further psychological trauma for children, with attendant need for
psychosocial support for learners, which is one of the prioritised activities by UNICEF using a separate stream of financial support.
4
Further accentuating the urgency, the programme extended its impact through capacity support and system
strengthening of the DBE. This included the provision of embedded technical assistance to facilitate the
implementation of Standard Operating Procedures, offering comprehensive guidance to educational
institutions on preparing for the eventual reopening of schools. The convergence of these diverse elements
underscored the pressing need to execute the programme promptly, acknowledging the intricate and
evolving challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis while pursuing avenues for educational continuity,
recovery, and enhanced resilience.
In addition to the international relevance, the DBE has various institutional programmes that are being
implemented, guided by the DBE Action Plan to 2024. The Action Plan is intended to “guide the system, in
part explaining where the problems lie, and how the various solutions are interconnected” (Department of
Basic Education, 2020). It supports Chapter 9 of the National Development Plan (NDP) and is moreover
aligned with the 2019 to 2024 Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF) of the Presidency. The Action
Plan guides a number of education-specific plans, in particular the five-year strategic plans of the ten
departments dealing with basic education, as well as the annual performance plans of these departments.
Of the five institutional programmes being implemented by the department as part of achieving the Action
Plan, the REALS SA programme is in direct alignment with two. The first of the two is Programme 3, which
focuses on Teachers, Education Human Resources and Institutional Arrangements. This programme has
the overarching aim of “promoting quality teaching and institutional performance through the effective
supply, development and utilization of human resources in the basic education sector” (Department of Basic
Education, 2021). Sub-programmes include Teacher and Professional Development and Curriculum and
Professional Development, which are directly aligned to sub-programmes of the REALS SA programme.
The second relevant programme, Programme 4, focuses on Planning, Information and Assessment with
the overarching responsibility of promoting quality and effective service delivery in the basic education
system through planning, implementation and assessment. The indicators in this programme are
fundamentally directed towards “quality improvements, assessments and physical and financial planning”
(Department of Basic Education, 2021). Main outcomes of this programme are to maintain and develop
information and other systems which enable transformation and an efficient and accountable sector, and
conducting strategic interventions to assist and develop provincial education systems (Department of Basic
Education, 2021).
Looking at international development frameworks and commitments, the REALS SA programme is well
aligned to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The programme is in direct
alignment with goals 4 and 8. Respectively, these goals are to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality
education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” as well as to “promote sustained, inclusive
and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”.
By aligning with the abovementioned SDGs, the programme continues the thread of alignment through to
the abovementioned E4E Financing Agreement. In keeping with a joint approach to solving challenges in
respective countries as exampled by the above financing agreement, UNICEF is supporting the South
African education sector through interventions that are in line with the Education Component of the UN
Emergency Flash Appeal. Recognizing that the Covid-19 pandemic was a global challenge, UNICEF
advocated for the challenge to be addressed through an inclusive approach based on international solidarity
and cooperation among all stakeholders. Complementary to government’s three-pronged strategy, the
Emergency Appeal for South Africa “prioritises the response necessary to address the immediate public
health crisis and the secondary impacts of the pandemic” (United Nations South Africa, 2020). The appeal
was developed to support the existing coordination efforts of government, stakeholders and other partners
with the aim to ensure efficient and effective prevention and response to identified national priorities.
5
In summary, by achieving direct alignment to policy-related issues, the REALS SA programme is
strategically relevant for organisations in the following ways:
EU: Through active participation, collaborative decision-making, and flexible procedures, the EU has
established a robust partnership with the DBE, aligning with both national objectives, such as the E4E
initiative, and global imperatives. This engagement not only enhances the programme’s design and
implementation but also showcases the EU's commitment to addressing dynamic challenges, exemplified
by the redirection of funds during the COVID-19 crisis. The EU's strategic contributions resonate with the
programme’s adaptable nature, ensuring its efficacy in tackling multifaceted crises while fostering a
cohesive approach towards achieving overarching goals (UNICEF, 2021).
UNICEF: By partaking in the REALS SA programme, UNICEF is providing support to the South African
government on the continuation of learning, particularly in lower quintile schools. This is in alignment to
UNICEF’s cooperation with the DBE on achieving “quality basic education by improving the key
determinants that impact the quality of education and educational outcomes…to confront South Africa’s
reading and numeracy challenges” (UNICEF, 2022). By doing so, the organisation ensures the stabilisation
of the education sector for learners and teachers, and further addresses the newfound need to depend on
other forms of media for educational purposes. Finally, there is a generation of lessons in relation to
implementing interventions in the worst contexts by implementing the pilot programme in lower quintile
schools.
DBE: The DBE’s participation in the REALS SA programme addresses literacy issues, the issue of recovery
of learning in schools, the strengthening of the capacity of the education system, the promotion of parental
participation in education as well as the upscaling of programmes that are directly aligned to departmental
strategic thrusts.
NECT: Finally, for the NECT, this programme will assist with achieving long-term improvements in the
education sector generated by a short-term programme.
2.3 Programme description
Considering the South African education sector context, in line with their policies and strategies, and in
response to the COVID-19 crisis, the DBE, in collaboration with UNICEF, the NECT and with funding from
the EU, developed the REALS SA school support programme to be implemented in 2021 and 2022. The
programme aimed to cover 650 primary schools in Quintiles 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. schools in low income
communities) across the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Eastern Cape (EC) and Limpopo (LP) (of
South Africa’s nine provinces, these have relatively large rural populations).
The objective of the programme was to ensure that the Department of Basic Education, Provincial
Departments and schools are supported to respond to and manage the impact of Covid-19 on education
for improved learning outcomes, including a focus on parental involvement and support.

Figure 1: Programme and Sub-programme Structure
As depicted in Figure 1, the programme design was structured around two main programme “outputs”.
While activities have been separated under two main strands, the anticipated outcomes will have varying
levels of relevance across all strands and sub-strands. It is worth noting at this point that while the
programme refers to these as outputs, the evaluation categorised them as outcomes. This is due to the
evaluative definition of ‘outputs’ and ‘outcomes’; the former refers to products that result directly from
activities, such as tangible materials, whereas the latter refers to changes in behaviour and practices as a
result of the produced output. Given the nature of what the programme describes as outputs – which are
overall systemic changes through capacitation and provision of support using the materials produced
through the planned activities – the programme outputs are in fact programme outcomes.
The first strand of the programme was the provision of support to the Department of Basic Education’s
efforts on continuity of learning through traditional and innovative approaches by supporting the
implementation of the reading recovery programme for better learning outcomes (sub output 1.1) and
curriculum trimming as part of the overall recovery curriculum programme (sub output 1.2). The second
output was strengthened capacity of key stakeholders in the education sector and enhanced access to
learning materials. The focus in this area was on enhancing parental engagement, accountability, and
leadership for sustainability through capacity building of district officials and SMT’s on effective leadership
during emergencies and after.
The REALS SA programme was further broken down into sub-programmes (also referred to as
workstreams) focused on achieving the two main programme outputs. The sub-programmes were that of
Reading Recovery, Assessment for Learning, Recovery curriculum as well as Leadership and
Management. Each had a defined set of activities which were implemented by a service provider, working
closely with the provincial education departments (PEDs) and other REALS SA stakeholders.
A wide range of activities including radio broadcasts with reading content, provision of storybooks, a parent
intervention to support reading at home and training of subject advisors and SMTs to support and monitor
curriculum delivery were planned as part of programme implementation. With these activities, the REALS
SA programme supported the implementation of the reading recovery programme for better learning
7
outcomes, curriculum trimming5 as part of the overall recovery curriculum programme and strengthening
the capacity of education sector stakeholders for improved learning outcomes in no fee schools in the
selected provinces. The sub-programmes are summarised in Table 1 below and will be further expanded
on in section 2.5. Information summarised below is sourced from the service level agreements between the
service providers and REALS SA programme implementors, as well as REALS SA programme planning
documentation.
5 Curriculum trimming simply refers to the process of reducing the content to be covered in the school curriculum given the
remaining time in the school year.

2.4 Programme stakeholders
Figure 2Figure 2 below gives an overview of the stakeholders in the REALS SA programme. It is important
to note that this diagram is not intended to show how programme stakeholders interact, which is captured
in Figure 2Error! Reference source not found. as well as in the programme theory.
Figure 2: REALS SA Stakeholder Map
As depicted above:
- The EU is the (main) programme funder.
- UNICEF is the programme fiduciary, and is accountable for the overall project design,
implementation, monitoring, budget as well as communication and visibility associated with the
programme.
o The DBE is the South African government department that owns the intervention. Together,
the DBE and UNICEF form the administrative layer of the programme .
- The NECT, PSA, TUT and UKZN are the programme’s implementing partners. The NECT has been
noted with a red asterisk as it is the only implementing partner involved in programme governance,
as will be discussed in the implementation arrangements.
- Finally, the programme is intended to reach Circuit Managers (CMs) and Subject Advisors (SAs)
in their capacities as district officials, Senior Management Team (SMT) members from schools,
School Governing Body (SGB) members, schoolteachers as well as learners and their parents /
caregivers.
- These stakeholders, apart from the funder and target audience, then form various structures that
handle different aspect of programme implementation. As shown in Figure 3 below:
o The Programme Steering Committee (PSC) comprises of DBE, the NECT and UNICEF
and meets every quarter. This structure is responsible for overall REALS SA strategy and
governance
- The Programme Management Team (PMT) comprises of UNICEF, the NECT, a PED counterpart
from each of the targeted provinces, as well as DBE officials who serve as chairpersons of the
Technical Teams (TTs). This structure is responsible for programme coordination.
11
- Finally, programme operations were overseen by six technical teams, also referred to as TTs.
There are 4 respective technical teams for each of the sub-programmes, one for monitoring and
evaluation, and one for programme Communications and Visibility.

2.5 High-level Theory of Change
A Theory of Change (ToC)7 is “a tool that describes the process of planned change, from the assumptions
that guide its design, the planned outputs and outcomes to the long-term impacts it seeks to achieve”
(Department of Planning Monitoring and Evaluation, 2011). A ToC expresses the underlying logic or
reasoning of a programme, explaining what it seeks to achieve and why it is expected that the programmes
activities will achieve it.
The REALS SA programme has a simplified ToC that demonstrates the combination of four workstreams
to achieve outcomes.
Figure 1 Theory of change for the REALS SA programme
For the purpose of evaluation, a more detailed high level ToC was developed as well as workstream specific
ones. To commence this process, a situational analysis was completed during the inception phase of the
programme, including a desktop review of existing programme and relevant documentation, which further
explained why the REALS SA programme was conceptualized. The evaluation also interacted with
additional information such as relevant scholarship on education in South Africa, other evidence from
7 For the purpose of this report, “theory of change” and “programme theory” are used interchangeably.

policies, and results from similar interventions. The most crucial step was that of stakeholder engagement
– individual interviews as well as a workshop with programme stakeholders – to ensure that the
understanding of how the intervention was intended to work was indeed correct and depicted adequately
on the summary diagram below.
To reiterate, the main goal of the programme was to support the DBE’s interventions geared towards
reading recovery, curriculum catch-up and system strengthening for the immediate period of school
closures and for the post-closure duration. The focus in these stages was in-line with learner support
programmes for online and broadcast support resources, capacity support and system strengthening of the
DBE through recovery curriculum as well as strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders (UNICEF,
2021a).
Figure 4: REALS SA High-level ToC
Figure 4 is the overview ToC for the REALS SA programme, depicting the overall causal logic for the various
components addressed by the programme itself. While the components appear interrelated in the overall
ToC, individual activities and outputs for each of the subsequent workstreams were designed to work
independently of each other except for close integration of the Reading Recovery workstream’s provision
of books, with the “Leading for Reading” capacity building delivered through the Leadership and
Management workstream. This was discussed in Evaluation Inception Report Version B and will be made
clearer in the discussion of the findings in section 4.3.
While the majority of the problem statements were highlighted by the circumstance of the COVID-19
pandemic, they had been historic issues plaguing the South African education sector. These problem
statements are expanded on in further detail in the subsequent workstream-specific ToCs; however, they
are in relation to issues such as the extent of the lack of digital access and internet connectivity in quintile
1-3 schools, an overall disruption to learning due to the school closures in line with national lockdown
regulations during the pandemic, as well as the incapacitation of school leadership structures and members
thereof to lead adequately during times of crises. Other setbacks include the pre-existing challenge of
13
-
-
-
-

children struggling to read for comprehension due to incorrect pedagogical approaches and dysfunctional
accountability frameworks within schools, which is linked to the final problem statement represented on the
diagram of parents not having enough information on how to assist children with reading at home.
The specification of the problem statements set into motion a series of activities directed towards
addressing these issues. The first activity was to conduct a review of the trimmed curriculum that had been
implemented since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review of the curriculum shed light on how it
was being received by teachers, school leaders and learners, while also highlighting any content and
concept gaps that may have formed as part of the curriculum trimming process. Information received from
the review assisted with the development of a Quality Assurance Framework (QAF) for continuing to
monitor the quality of the trimmed curriculum and its implementation. This resulted in a QAF being available
for use by school officials, and it was assumed that it would be (A1) comprehensive enough for beneficiaries
to begin using it.
After sufficient time had passed, a report on current school capacities in relation to curriculum
implementation was to be compiled informed by the results from the QAF. This, together with school-based
research conducted for the purpose of developing a baseline for the programme was to produce a
consolidated report of current school capacities looking at all aspects from school management abilities to
curriculum implementation. This consolidated report was then intended to inform the development of
training and coaching materials and workshops to ensure that school leadership and teachers are trained
in the areas that have been identified as shortcomings by the consolidated report as well as the original
problem statements of the programme.
Once the training and coaching programmes and materials had been developed, key education
stakeholders were the recipients of the specified training and coaching programmes, resulting in trained
stakeholders. The attached assumption (A2) to the training was that it would be delivered in such a way
that would make it easier for trainees to later become trainers to colleagues, efficiently sharing learnings
and approaches with colleagues. The short-term outcome from training the key education sector officials is
that their capacity is strengthened, as well as an increased ability to manage and perform during times of
crises or disaster. The consolidated report of school capacities also then becomes evidence that the DBE
has access to for the purpose of informing curriculum strengthening and other initiatives.
The final set of activities is related to the issues of access to technological and reading resources. The
programme conducted a survey of radio reading programmes and books. This audit was then followed by
another activity of developing radio programmes that are related to reading, as well as procuring national
bulk printing arrangements for the production of parent guides as well as purchasing books for learners.
The output from these three activities combined is the availability of reading support guides for parents,
storybooks and books for learners as well as 24 radio programmes related to reading materials.
A major activity following the production of the reading support resources is the learners and parents
engaging with said materials. This activity is important as there are various factors that could potentially
break the causal link between the two ToC components, such as whether or not households have access
to the radio, if they listen to the radio at all, if parents have the time and required levels of literacy to
effectively engage with the guides, and whether or not parents or learners are interested in improving their
reading capabilities.
The short-term outcome from the parents and learners engaging with their respective materials adequately
is that parents will then have access to resources that help them better support their children with reading,
as well as children having improved access to reading resources.
14
The DBE having access to evidence to inform policy decisions, increased capacity of key education sector
stakeholders to lead and manage, and increased access of parents and learners to reading resources
ultimately culminate in learning continuity being supported so that learning outcomes are safeguarded and
strengthened despite times of crises.
3 EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Evaluation Design
The evaluation type was a combination of design and implementation, while the evaluation methodology
was mixed-methods.
Design evaluations are defined by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) as
exercises that are conducted after an intervention has been designed, focusing on “analysing the theory of
change as well as the inner logic and consistency of a programme” (Department of Planning Monitoring
and Evaluation, 2014). Implementation evaluations, also referred to as process evaluations, are
assessments of “programme delivery, strategies, procedures and processes, with the aim of answering
questions about what is happening in practice, how it is happening and why it is happening” (Department
of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, 2014).
A mixed-method approach including quantitative and qualitative research methods was used to
adequately answer both design and implementation questions. A mixed methods design is appropriate for
answering research questions that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods could answer alone and can
be used to gain a better understanding of connections or contradictions between qualitative and quantitative
data. The possibility of statistically calculating and attributing impact was eliminated both due to the non-
randomised nature of intervention rollout, and the timing of the evaluation during the period when results
were expected to be realized up to the level of early outcomes, at best.
A case study approach was also utilized. The case studies produced qualitative perspectives on how and
why the REALS programme worked or hasn’t worked under certain conditions. In addition, the case studies
were intended to understand the context in which the programme has been working in such a way to elicit
lessons for future programmes of this nature. Furthermore, the case studies provided a closer perspective
on overall programme wide data.
The evaluation design and main parameters remained largely consistent with the original evaluation Terms
of Reference, with some adjustments to the evaluation questions. Furthermore, it was agreed that a single
report judging both the programme’s design and implementation would be more appropriate than two
separate reports on design and implementation respectively. Evaluation time frames were adjusted to
accommodate an extension in the project’s implementation time frames from December 2022 to June 2023.
3.2 Evaluation Scope
The scope of the REALS SA evaluation included a comprehensive assessment of the programme's
management arrangements, financial agreement, organizational alignments, strategic coherence, and
workstream-related strategies. The evaluation assessed the operational aspects overseen by the EU and
UNICEF, and further explored the dynamic organizational relationships such as the indirect link with the
NECT and higher education institutions. It scrutinized the strategic coherence of the programme, and
analysed the implementation strategies across various workstreams. The assessment also highlighted
15
challenges in reporting, deviations from core objectives, and the programme’s impact in addressing urgent
educational needs. The full period of implementation was in scope (2021 to July 2023), and all three
provinces. As a design and implementation evaluation, a rigorous evaluation of the outcomes and impact
were not in scope, and some recommendations are made in this regard.
3.3 Evaluation Criteria and questions
The original Terms of Reference (TOR) included 26 questions. These were slightly amended during the
inception phase of the evaluation process, with the approval of the evaluation steering committee, to allow
for more comprehensive assessment of implementation and the equity considerations. The high level
evaluation questions are listed below. The full set are included in the appendix.
Table 2: Evaluation Criteria and Questions
DESIGN
1. Relevance: To what extent is the programme’s objectives and design responsive to beneficiaries’
needs. Is the REALS SA theory of change designed in a manner that is likely to lead to the
anticipated results?
2. Sustainability: to what extent are the net benefits from the programme likely to continue
IMPLEMENTATION
3. Effectiveness: To what extent has the programme achieved, or is expected to achieve, its
objectives and results? To what extent we the REALS SA interventions implemented with fidelity
4. Relevance: To what extent were the REALS SA programme’s interventions relevant?
5. Efficiency: To what extent were the programme’s interventions undertaken in an economic
manner? This being the efficient conversion of inputs into outputs and outcomes in a cost-
effective manner.
3.4 Methodology
3.4.1 Evaluation planning
It was agreed during inception that it would be suitable for the evaluation to use a combination of qualitative
and quantitative methods, including focus groups, interviews, surveys, and analysis of programme
documents and data. With this broad approach confirmed, the evaluation team (in consultation with the
steering committee) developed two tools - an evaluation matrix and logical framework - to aid in the planning
of the evaluation methods, data collection and analysis. The evaluation matrix, which is attached as an
annexure, showed the methods by which each of the evaluation questions would be addressed and criteria
to be applied.
The logical framework set out indicators in relation to each workstream. It drew, where possible, on an
original draft logical framework which had not been updated since the programme commenced. The team
designed at least one quantitative indicator for each activity, output, and early outcome, as well as for
selected critical assumptions, which were mapped onto the Theory of Change diagrams. Because the
evaluation focused on the programme's design and early implementation, priority was given to data
collection at the activity, output, and early outcome levels. Although the logical framework was circulated
to several stakeholders reviewed and approved by the steering committee, in practice a number of the
anticipated datasets proved not to exist, as discussed in the next sections.
16
3.4.2 Data collection
The main data collection phase began on February 6th, 2023, after introductory interviews were conducted
in the first part of 2022.
The primary data collection phase comprised of four components:
1. School case studies (6 schools) involving interviews and focus groups with school management,
staff and parents (February 2023)
2. Semi-structured interviews with programme stakeholders (February to April 2023);
3. Focus groups with programme stakeholders (February to April 2023); and
4. An electronic survey of Senior Management Team (SMT) members (distributed using WhatsApp)
(February to March 2023).
Each of these is discussed very briefly here. More details on respondents and response rates are provided
in the Annexure. See the Fieldwork Report for full details on all aspects of data collection, including sampling
and logistics, a summary of documents and data collected, and the names of organisations, schools and
respondents.
For the school case studies, the evaluation team visited six schools across the three targeted provinces,
with two schools in each province. The final sample of six schools includes a spread of quintile 1, 2 and 3
schools, including one special school (these are classified as quintile 0). A seventh school had been
targeted in KwaZulu-Natal, but for logistical and resource reasons, this school was dropped.
The interviews and focus groups with programme stakeholders were all conducted virtually. Most of
these sessions were implemented successfully, with 11 respondents participating in 7 sessions overall.
However, the failure to interview DBE Provincial officials from KZN and Limpopo is an important gap. Only
half of the planned focus groups were executed successfully with the intended stakeholders – limiting the
insight from circuit managers and Task Team members in particular – and some online interviews and focus
groups with key stakeholder groups remained outstanding even after extending the data collection phase
by two weeks.
The electronic survey was aimed at all SMT members of all the REALS-SA schools. In practice, because
NECT did not have a full consolidated database of programme participants, the contact numbers were
sourced from Performance Solutions Africa (PSA) based on those who had (up until March 2023)
participated in PSA’s workshops. As a result, the survey results over-represent principals and under-
represent some districts in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo. Nevertheless, 230 respondents participated,
and the respondents are distributed quite evenly across provinces.
Documents and data were also sourced, in addition to the primary data collected as part of the fieldwork.
The objective was to assess the relevant documentation pertaining to the implementation of REALS SA
and the corresponding institutional arrangements. However, the reader should note some gaps in the
documentation that was available for the evaluation. After several rounds of correspondence and efforts on
PDG’s as well as NECT’s part, it has been confirmed that the data available to the evaluation team is
complete in terms of what exists and that remaining gaps are a result of limitations in record keeping, not
withholding of data.
17
There are three types of data limitations that the reader should note. Firstly, a detailed level of interrogation
of monitoring data was not possible as originally anticipated in the logical framework8. There is no
consolidated description of the monitoring system nor a consolidated record of performance against the
indicators laid out in the original draft logical framework. The monitoring data shared among the participating
organisations consists mainly of progress reports by implementing partners, which summarises their
progress in relation to key activities (rather than, for instance, sharing individual attendance registers).
Secondly, no entity was responsible for consolidation and record keeping of monitoring data across all
programme components9. As a result, there was no systematic record keeping at the centre of the
programme; for instance, many documents were forwarded to the evaluation team from emails rather than
through sharing of a consolidated, structured and clearly named folder or repository. There were no meeting
minutes for task team meetings and inconsistent record keeping on REALS SA update meetings.
Thirdly, there is no documentation specifying gender disaggregation, except for two presentations from one
implementing partner.
Overall, the data collection phase was adequately executed in terms of ethics, and a good response rate
was achieved in the school case studies and survey. The available data is largely adequate to fulfill the
evaluation questions. However, the data gaps mentioned above limit the evaluation team’s ability to
triangulate data on some of the more detailed aspects of the programme. Where remaining gaps are
pertinent to the strength of evaluative judgements, it is noted in the sections that follow.
3.4.3 Ethical considerations
The evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Ethical Guidelines. A detailed
discussion of how each ethical principle would be applied was included in the Inception Report; and this
report and full data collection instruments and procedures were approved by an Ethics Review Board before
being implemented. The main ethical considerations in this evaluation were to remove personal identifiers
in data collection instruments, avoid power imbalances within data collection sessions, ensure sensitivity to
socioeconomic background of participants, and ensure gender and equity considerations, as well as to
ensure informed voluntary consent from interviewees, focus group participants, and survey participants.
Below follows a brief discussion of the most salient steps taken to uphold the ethical principles.
Approval of data collection plan and instruments. The data collection plan was shared with the
evaluation steering committee, REALS-SA implementing partners, and UNICEF’s ethical review service
provider. Ethical approval was received after incorporating verbal and written comments from stakeholders
and detailed feedback from the ethical review board.
Inclusion of special schools. The evaluation guidelines and ethical guidelines emphasized the inclusion
of special schools. Two special schools were sampled, and only one was successfully visited as a case
8 Initially, the plan was to use data required to be generated and submitted to NECT by implementation partners per Service Level
Agreements, such as attendance registers, participant evaluation forms, and lists of completed activities. However, it became apparent
that implementation partners do not submit these types of documents to NECT. Instead, they provide summary figures on their
progress in the implementation of key project tasks, as part of “update” meetings and in periodic reports.
9 As far as the evaluation team can ascertain, the reason for having no single consolidated set of programme monitoring data is that
the M&E budget was reallocated to each of the service providers across the workstreams to monitor their own activities (refer to
section 4.2.2 for further budgetary discussion). This led to a lack of awareness of what monitoring data was available from
implementing partners. Hence NECT did not monitor overall activities across all service providers and there was no systematic way
to track outstanding documentation and monitoring data from partners.
18
study. Although not representative, this case provided unique insight into how the REALS SA programme
played out in a special school while the other five schools brought out nuances of non-special schools.
Ethics and Gender Sensitivity Workshop. The fieldwork team conducted a workshop with the designated
ethics officer (a senior member of the evaluation team) to discuss potential ethical issues and gender
considerations before school visits and how to mitigate and manage them.
Anonymity of participants: In terms of the treatment of personal identifying information, the qualitative
data obtained during the inception phase and collected during the fieldwork phase (interviews, attendance
registers, meeting minutes, etc.) included personal information such as names of participants, but the
names of participants were not quoted by name in the report. No names were captured for the school-
based respondents as it was not necessary. Secondary data such as attendance registers from programme
activities, progress reports, and lists of participating schools and individuals were also treated confidentially,
and analysis was presented in aggregate form so as not to render any individuals identifiable in the report.
Obtaining consent in engagements. The fieldwork team obtained verbal consent from participants at the
beginning of each session for virtual interviews and focus groups, while case study engagements were
conducted in person with signed consent from participants. The sampling strategy included the selection of
backup schools in case a school opted not to participate.
Overall, the evaluation team considered ethical guidelines in all phases of the evaluation to ensure ethical
and unbiased data collection and reporting. No ethical issues were reported in the field.
3.4.4 Analytical approaches
The evaluation matrix set out the planned data analysis for each evaluation question, which has largely
been followed. For judging implementation (resourcing, activities, outputs), the overall method has been
process-tracing against the theory of change (including the detailed workstream theories of change). The
planned activities were compared against those that occurred. In relation to outcomes, process-tracing was
also employed, along with the noting of unintended or unanticipated outcomes.
The data obtained during the inception phase (interviews, programme documents, meeting minutes,
meeting agendas, etc.) and collected during the fieldwork phase were triangulated using NVivo. Using
NVivo, factual data was triangulated across sources as necessary, while the main analytical approach was
thematic analysis.
Two main types of quantitative data were used for analysis: survey results and financial data. Although the
evaluation team had initially planned to explore three types of data, including programme monitoring data,
they were unable to obtain the detailed information needed to perform quantitative analysis in this area.
Nonetheless, the use of quantitative data was important for complementing and triangulating the data
gathered from the case studies. To conduct the analysis, the quantitative data was analyzed descriptively
using Microsoft Excel, in accordance with the evaluation questions outlined in the logical framework.
Finally, the evaluation used an equity-focused analytical approach that considered criteria such as gender,
human rights, social inclusion, and the environment. The evaluation findings were assessed using a four-
level rating scale, ranging from equity-blind to equity-positive. Details are provided in the Annexures.
Using the preliminary findings generated by the respective analyses, a process of triangulating these
findings was followed in broad sequence to the overarching evaluation questions.
19
3.5 Limitations
In light of the methodology and data collection processes, as described above, the following limitations
should be noted. Where challenges were identified in advance, active steps were taken to mitigate these,
including appeals for updated information, documentation, and revised monitoring data.
Delays in implementation. The programme implementation experienced delays, and the evaluation data
collection period was adjusted to allow enough time for implementation to progress. Nonetheless, at the
time of data collection, some components had still not reached schools. Notably, some Subject Advisors
had only recently begun receiving training, despite their role as important stakeholders in training teachers.
Engagement of education officials. The main limitation of the evaluation was the unavailability of
education officials, particularly in KZN and LP provinces. The evaluation team had difficulty contacting DBE
officials, who are crucial stakeholders for the REALS SA programme. This limited the information available
to the evaluation team and reduced the number of scheduled engagements for data collection. As a result,
the perspectives of these officials are not captured in the final report, potentially impacting the upscaling
and sustainability of the programme and other decision-making influenced by the evaluation. However, the
evaluation team was able to engage with the EC department and obtain some departmental insights.
Incomplete datasets with participant contact details and poor availability of participants. Incomplete
and occasionally inaccurate contact information was received for school-based stakeholders and district
officials. Despite multiple follow-up efforts, there were still a significant number of participants who did not
respond to invitations to virtual interviews and focus groups, and in two cases, a failure to attend scheduled
sessions. These factors adversely impacted the comprehensiveness of the primary data for evaluating the
programme, with less insight into the views and experiences of subject advisors, circuit managers and SMT
members (except for principals) than was planned.
Gaps in documentation. As mentioned, the documents provided are not as comprehensive as intended,
and key monitoring data and reports do not exist because of poor record keeping. The received financial
data only represents a portion of the budget, leaving some uncertainties including the scale of human
resources involved in the programme, resourcing of budget extensions, and the extent to which losses have
been absorbed by the entities involved. Moreover, recent progress reports lack the expected level of detail.
Lack of gender disaggregated data. As mentioned earlier, the monitoring data received was not
disaggregated by gender as the gender-based breakdown of participants was seldom reported by the
implementing partners. However, since this is marginally reported on by implementing partners, it makes it
difficult to review and triangulate with the primary data collected. There was an imbalance in the gender
distribution amongst both parents and teachers with female participants, notably, more prominent.
Reasonable efforts have been made by some implementing partners to apply a gender lens in their
reporting; the report will discuss the implications of this.
The evaluation thus has a strong evidence base in relation to the programme design, the views and
perspectives of the main implementing organisations, and overall implementation progress. But the
implications of the issues described above is that the evaluation draws from a more limited evidence base
in relation to the views of education officials at provincial and district level, and is unable to discuss matters
of resources, gender and equity as extensively as may have benefited the users of the evaluation. There
are also implementation areas where detail is somewhat lacking. These limitations should be borne in mind
in reading the report. Many of these limitations offer lessons for future practice and are thus addressed
again in the section on lessons learned.

4 FINDINGS
This chapter will present the findings of the evaluation related to the programme’s design and
implementation to date. It will do so by answering the evaluation questions through the presentation of the
various findings related to the REALS Design and subsequent implementation.
The first two main sections in this chapter focus on the overall programme’s design and implementation
respectively. The subsequent sections discuss the design and implementation of each of the four sub-
programmes in turn.
After this chapter, the report will proceed to discuss what conclusions can be made based on the observed
findings, as well as the emerging lessons and recommendations.
4.1 Programme Design
As noted in section 2.3 above, the REALS SA programme design is structured around two main programme
“outputs”: (1) the provision of support to the Department of Basic Education’s efforts on continuity of learning
through traditional and innovative approaches and (2) strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders in the
education sector and enhancing access to learning materials. With two main outputs, each with sub-outputs
that are to be delivered through a series of sub-programmes, REALS SA is an emergency response
programme with a complex design.
4.1.1 Relevance
The programme had a high-level theory of change that noted the chain of events leading to the
transformation anticipated by the programme. Through the programme evaluation, a more detailed high-
level theory of change was compiled together with the programme stakeholders and role-players,
graphically laying out the related activities, outputs, outcomes, and impact of the programme. In the
compilation of the ToC, programme stakeholders were able to co-create and agree on the overall
understanding of the programme as well as what it was aiming to achieve. According to one of the managers
involved in the original design (I406), the programme was designed to have the sub-programmes work
independently of each other, but there was an anticipation of synergy in their overall outcomes which
justified packaging them into a single programme. This is demonstrated in the interrelationships at outcome
level on the high-level theory of change. The value of purposefully integrating the workstreams into a single
programme is clearest in the case of the L&M and Reading Recovery workstreams, as the L&M
implementing partner (PSA) was well positioned to offer training for the effective use of reading materials
distributed through the Reading recovery workstream. The co-creation process of the programme theory
highlighted areas of overlap and coherence within the programme that could potentially be better leveraged
going forward or in future similar programmes.
The programme design implicitly took into consideration gender and equity considerations. As a national
DBE policy, all programmes implemented as part of the department are to be underpinned by the inclusive
education policy, which necessitates that all programmes reach learners marginalized by gender and equity
barriers the same way in which they would reach learners without barriers. It can be assumed that the
programme took this into consideration by focusing specifically on learners in Quintile 0 – 3 schools and
their surrounding communities. Furthermore, I401 noted that the selection of the three pilot provinces was
based on “their demography and that all of them are large, rural provinces with large school enrolments”.
21
The selection of the 650 schools was “done to enhance and build on the work undertaken thus far under
the National Reading Coalition (NRC), the Primary School Reading Improvement programme (PSRIP) and
the National/ Provincial Reading Plan” (NECT, 2021b). Given the number of circuits, districts and schools
selected as part of the sample, the programme was anticipated to impact 73.5% of districts in the three
largest provinces in the system (NECT, 2021a). Through this, the REALS SA programme envisioned that
the “implementation of the reading, curriculum and assessment recovery sub-programmes AND
appropriately supported by districts, school leaders and parents is likely to increase access to reading
resources and sustainable support for learning and curriculum catch-up” (NECT, 2021b). And therefore,
this consideration highlighted the programme’s focus on building on previous efforts, reaching a large
percentage of districts, and increasing access to reading resources to support learning and curriculum
catch-up.
In terms of sharing the programme understanding by way of communications and visibility, the responsibility
for the programme was shifted from NECT to UNICEF, altering the original design of the programme
management arrangements. It is unclear what motivated this shift. After the shift took place, UNICEF
nevertheless sought NECT’s inputs on the strategy: “the NECT Marketing and Communications team,
together with the UNICEF Communication Specialist met on two occasions to discuss and finalize the
communications and visibility strategy in an effort to make the REALS SA more visible to the public and the
media” (NECT, 2021b). Visibility materials developed as part of this included printed banners, t-shirts and
other REALS SA branded materials (I556; REALS SA Reports).
In addition to the above, the Comms and Visibility technical team developed an introductory phase REALS
SA communications and visibility plan inclusive of a press release and social media campaign. The
approach in implementing the communications and visibility plan was said to be centred around human
interest stories which are linked to the overall impact of the REALS SA programme in the three provinces
(I558). The purpose of the campaign was ultimately to expose the media and the public to the REALS SA
programme in an accessible manner. As part of the campaign, a press release on the REALS SA
programme was disseminated to media houses across the country, as well as published on IOL.com on
International Literacy Day which took place on 08 September 2021. The press release reached a total of 8
600 846 unique readers (NECT, 2021c).
In sharing this understanding through the widespread communications and advocacy strategy, it was
understood that the main implementation methods of the programme anticipated to result in a change and
improvement in classroom practices were the provision of capacity building through training and coaching,
as well as the provision of guidelines and modules. The variety of resources was anticipated to inculcate a
culture of reading within the learners and teachers, resulting in improved literacy and numeracy skills.
Furthermore, the capacity building for teachers, SMTs, circuit managers and subject advisors would help
strengthen the overall school ecosystem against dealing with other forms of disaster should they arise.
Overall, the success of the programme was anticipated to be highlighted by an observable improvement in
the quality of education and a narrowing of the gaps exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Programme risks and their respective mitigation measures were noted in programme documentation. Two
high-impact risks were identified, namely the intermittent opening and closing of schools due to the spread
of the coronavirus, as well as teacher unions not fully understanding or supporting the intervention
(UNICEF, 2021a). Mitigation measures for the intermittent opening and closing of schools was the use of
online platforms for meetings and coaching sessions should schools close. The mitigation measure for the
risk related to teacher unions was to ensure that teacher unions are engaged in conjunction with district
and provincial leadership (UNICEF, 2021a). Both these measures were successfully implemented, as
teacher unions have been engaged (as will be unpacked in the Assessment for Learning programme
22
findings), and online platforms were indeed used for coaching sessions as well as meetings throughout the
programme. The use of online platforms did not however fully ensure the presence of participants in the
sessions due to connectivity issues, discussed throughout the report.
Various programme design assumptions further became apparent during the course of the evaluation
process. Two of the sub-programmes relied on a “train the trainer” model, in which the REALS SA
programme worked directly with a certain group and then expected this group to train others. Because the
programme was implemented in and through the education system, the REALS SA programme targeted
groups whose responsibilities formally include the training (in the case of Subject Advisors) or mobilising of
fellow parents/caregivers in support of the school (in the case of caregivers elected to School Governing
Bodies). For this reason, it was expected that if they were thoroughly trained on a topic that aligned with
the Department's policy, provided with effective support and held accountable for implementing the training
with teachers, it could be expected that they would do so.
The obvious potential benefit of a “train the trainer” approach is that project resources were concentrated
on a small group while ultimately reaching a much larger group with the same training content and
resources. The trade-off was that only a small subset of the target group received the intervention “first-
hand”, with the programme having less control over the quality, pace, and reach of the intervention as
implemented by the those who were directly trained. As will be unpacked in the sections focusing on the
relevant workstreams, this may have undermined the achievement of the intended outcomes. The risk that
the programme fails to achieve its intended outcomes (to the desired extent) in the broader target
population, was heightened by the short life span of the project and implementation delays (especially in
the training of Subject Advisors). There will be little to no scope to monitor their rollout of the training to
teachers, and therefore limited scope for the programme to support or intervene if concerns are picked up.
As pointed out by a stakeholder during the review of the evaluation’s inception report, the train the trainer
model should arguably be seen more as a necessary trade-off; outcomes may be attenuated but still
represent the best outcome for the available resources. In mid-2022 there was also discussion underway
to provide more support for those trained to implement the model, but it does not appear that this had been
done as of May 2023.
Two of the sub-programmes – Assessment for Learning and Leadership and Management - involved
communities of practice (COPs) as part of the intervention strategy. COPs are professional learning
communities of practitioners who are expected to enhance learning outcomes beyond the life span of the
programme by offering space for peer interaction, supportive relationships, mutual accountability, access
to and sharing of resources, learning from shared experiences, and recognition of achievements and good
practices. Some of the groups who were intended to participate in COPs were already familiar with the
notion of COPs. Again, the limited time span of the programme and pressure on resources in both these
workstreams posed a risk to the extent to which COPs could be supported and thus expected to become
independent and effective by the time of the programme’s end.
A final design consideration is the deliberate mainstreaming of certain priorities into the intervention, such
as gender and the environment. It was assumed that explicit consideration of these issues would result in
more inclusive, equitable outcomes for vulnerable groups; and that the environmental cost could be
minimised or that there could be environmental benefits derived. There was also a potential “demonstration
effect” here in that education sector stakeholders in the REALS SA programme would be exposed to these
in the kinds of teaching and learning approaches and practices and may choose to replicate them
elsewhere. In practice, some workstreams factored gender and equity considerations in more effectively
than others, as will be discussed in section 4.3.
23
In order for the programme ToC to hold true, all the abovementioned design elements needed to hold true
as they were envisioned. Sustainability measures by way of national rollout have been worked into the
programme design, and from early 2023 onwards stakeholders began to plan a colloquium at the end of
the programme to bring together the different components of REALS SA and extending them to the
academic environment” (I404)10. The colloquium was successfully hosted at the University of KwaZulu-
Natal towards the end of June 2023.
Taking into consideration the above design factors, the evaluation has found that the REALS SA design is
one of relevance as its objectives are responsive to the needs of the identified beneficiaries as well as the
overall education system. The ToC was designed in such a manner that it was reasonable to expect that if
the programme was implemented as planned, the anticipated results would be achieved. Although not
fundamental flaws to the programme logic, some implementation realities were underestimated in the
articulation and management of risks and assumptions. This will be unpacked in the upcoming programme
implementation section.
4.2 Programme Implementation
In terms of implementation, the REALS SA arrangements were as follows. The programme was managed
by the EU, UNICEF, DBE and the NECT.
NECT mostly handled operational management such as ensuring programme endorsement, the
compilation of service level agreements with implementing partners and monitoring their performance
against this, sourcing contacts for the training of CMs and SAs, organizing the advocacy sessions in the
various provinces, setting up and ensuring the success of the technical teams, and various other
programme management elements. NECT also enabled the monitoring of implementation progress through
the production of REALS SA progress reports at least every quarter. However, a member of the programme
management team (I559) noted that resourcing did not allow for NECT to implement any standardised and
regular monitoring. As discussed earlier, there was also no systematic record keeping or management of a
database on the achievement of targets across the full programme. NECT also originally held the
Communications and Visibility portfolio for the programme, which was later shifted over to UNICEF for
reasons that will be discussed further in this section. The implementation of the programme was therefore
mainly the responsibility of the NECT in conjunction with the implementing partners, working closely with
UNICEF and the DBE.
4.2.1 Effectiveness
The findings presented in this section examined the effectiveness of the REALS-SA programme by first
assessing the programme's "implementation fidelity" as a prerequisite for effectiveness. It was emphasized
that the programme needed to be implemented as designed before it could be expected to generate the
intended outcomes. If the implementation deviated from the design, it would need to be justified in light of
changing conditions or lessons learned on how to best achieve the intended results.
Beginning with overall programme management, it was noted on multiple occasions that the NECT put the
DBE in the “front seat’’ of the programme, ensuring that they do not approach any of the provincial
departments or other stakeholders without the approval of the DBE. This strategic arrangement allowed for
effective programme embedding within the education system which will remain in place beyond the life of

24
the REALS-SA programme. However, the disadvantage of this approach was that the programme was
dependent on DBE capacity, and where this was stretched it resulted in time constraints and
implementation delays. Although the programme had annual management plans, frequent meetings, and
involved various education system officials, practical factors such as logistical delays and the availability of
officials affected the implementation process. Despite the effective project management on paper, these
practical factors impeded the programme’s successful implementation.
The provincial advocacy initiatives were reportedly well attended by the invited officials, with Table 3 below
depicting the provincial attendance rates:
Table 3: Provincial Attendance Rate of Advocacy Sessions
Province Attendance Attendance as % of invites
KZN 123/113 109%
LP 178/317 56%
EC 142/150 95%
Total 443/580 76%
(NECT, 2022a)
The advocacy initiative aimed to spread awareness about the programme and its benefits to the public and
stakeholders. However, the marketing approach applied to promote the programme was programme wide
with no sub-programme specific components, which may have contributed to the limited understanding of
the programme's components by those not directly involved in it. According to the advocacy reports,
provincial officials were aware of the programme, but this did not necessarily translate through to district
level as some subject advisors had no knowledge of it at all (FG498).
From the feedback received during the evaluation it emerged that the complexity of the programme may
have contributed to the limited understanding of the programme's multiple levers by its intended
beneficiaries. Many programme participants were only aware of the programme as a reading initiative or
only the training component they had attended, rather than as a programme with four different components.
This lack of clarity about the different components of the programme led to conflation, with some not
knowing that there were different components. Despite this, the sub-programmes managed to implement
most of their planned activities, and where each sub-programme reached, there was a perceived
understanding of its purpose and how it could help the beneficiaries. Overall, the lack of clarity about the
different components of the programme and the one-size-fits-all marketing approach applied may have
limited the understanding of the programme among the intended beneficiaries, which may, in turn, have
affected their ability to integrate the sub-programmes and derive the intended synergies between them to
strengthen outcomes.
In terms of assumptions in relation to implementation planning, one of the biggest assumptions regarding
a hybrid approach to delivering the training, was the assumption that quintile 1-3 schools in areas of low
socioeconomic status will have access to the internet, good enough to hold a stable connection for more
than an hour in order for principals, SMTs and district officials to be trained. This proved to be one of the
programme’s biggest shortcomings, as the access to data was an issue, as was connectivity due to frequent
power cuts (Kanjee, 2022; Performance Solutions Africa, 2022). Related to the assumed availability of
internet connectivity was the access to multimedia devices such as radio or television in households. This
did not have too large an effect on the delivery of paper-based materials and in-person trainings where
possible.
25
The provision of resources through the programme was anticipated to influence change in the education
system. The review of the post-COVID trimmed curriculum which led to the development of a quality
assurance framework was anticipated to heighten the education system’s awareness to content and
coherence issues in relation to the curriculum. Similarly, the development and delivering of training and
related materials was anticipated to capacitate all those who had been privy to the training with new skills
to adequately deal either with school or curriculum management, as well as the management of resources
related to reading. Finally, the list of available books generated through the audit has now shed light on
where the literature-related gaps are in the system and what can be done to ensure that these gaps are
filled going forward. Therefore, there was coherence and it appeared reasonable that if the REALS-SA
26
programme was implemented as planned, it would achieve its outcomes including mutual reinforcement between the different sub-programmes.
While the abovementioned assumptions may not have held, the justification related to the selection of quintile 1-3 schools across KZN, LP and EC
was validated. The fieldwork visits to the evaluation sample schools corroborated the similarity in context between the schools as well as the
communities they are in their respective provinces. While the case studies were not representative of the full population of REALS-SA schools (as
discussed in the methodology section), it is worth noting that the evaluation sample schools had similar characteristics overall. Across the three
provinces, schools were located in communities of low socio-economic status, and adequately classified between quintiles 1 – 3. Learners often
lived with older caregivers, but there were also instances of child-headed households in other communities. Whether the learners came from near
or far distances, weather conditions play a large role in the ability of learners and teachers to access the school, with the infrastructure often being
difficult to navigate on rainy days. Gender-related considerations also varied across provinces, with a mix in responses from teachers and parents
on who they perceive to perform and achieve and to struggle more with learning, i.e., academic performance and achievement, between young girls
and young boys.
Table 4 below provides a snapshot of the contextual factors related to the sample schools visited during the evaluation fieldwork.

The design of the programme, the programme management as well as communications and visibility revealed many strengths but also some
weaknesses. The main strength of the programme is the involvement of the DBE and the integration of the programme outputs into the larger
education system. The increasing of access to books for learners, development of a curriculum quality assurance framework, and overall capacitation
of practitioners were relevant interventions within the South Africa context; the approach to selection of schools and districts was appropriate; and
thus there was the potential to make a lasting impact on the quality of education if implemented adequately.
28
While the inclusion of the DBE was the main strength, it did however contribute to some shortcomings in the design, one them being the amount of
time it took to process activities. Reflections from an implementing partner noted that past experiences have shown that direct engagement with
district officials is always more beneficial than when it happens through layers of coordination by others. In this programme, “everything had to go
through NECT, who went through DBE who went through provinces who went through districts, and as a consequence, there was a whole host of
issues that have negatively impacted on the actual professional development activities we are able to offer” (FG530).
Table 5 below provides a summary of programme activities and their originally scheduled dates of completion, next to their dates of actual completion

A small portion of the evaluation participants were of the view that the time constraints that faced the programme and its various workstreams would
have potentially been mitigated had the programme been adequately advocated for. Stakeholders and role-players involved in the programme noted
that more time and resources for advocacy would have been beneficial as it would have assisted with fostering necessary relationships between
programme partners and the provincial departments.
31
4.2.2 Efficiency
In applying the criterion of efficiency, the evaluation’s focus is on the extent to which the distribution of
financial resources across programme components was appropriate, and the extent to which costs were
accurately anticipated. Budget data, expenditure data, and qualitative data are incorporated in this
section as appropriate to render judgments on these issues. The emphasis is on deriving lessons from
this for the future.
The entire project budget was USD 2.5 million. The EU funded this, except for a small contribution by
UNICEF. UNICEF disbursed ZAR 23.25 million to NECT. Approximately 30% was re-allocated from the
NECT budget back to UNICEF in September 2021 after a programme document amendment addendum
was signed (UNICEF & NECT, 2021). The adjustment resulted from a reallocation of direct
management of funds back to UNICEF.
After the budget adjustment, NECT’s budget covered Project Management and the four sub-
programmes: Leadership & Management, Assessment Recovery, Reading Recovery and Recovery
curriculum. UNICEF’s budget covered Staff & Personnel, Communications and Visibility supplies as
well as a consultant, Travel, General Costs and Administration. Reading materials and supplies were
to be directly procured by UNICEF as well.
Of the four workstreams, Reading Recovery had the largest budget allocation, with a substantial portion
spent directly by UNICEF to procure books and other items; and another portion allocated to NECT for
implementing the other components of the workstream. Leadership & Management received the second
highest budget allocation. It is appropriate that the Reading Recovery and L&M workstreams would
have the largest budget allocations, because both included large disbursement components. The
Reading Recovery workstream, cited by some members of the programme management and
governance team as the most important component of the programme, included the procurement of
thousands of books, while the L&M workstream was designed to engage directly with all 650 schools,
not just to deliver leadership and management training and coaching, but also to conduct the baseline
and endline assessments. In doing so, the L&M workstream was also the most important workstream
for reinforcing the intended outcomes of the other workstreams, because it included training principals
and SGB members on how to support learners’ engagement with the books. It is reasonable for this to
require the largest budget for travel and staff time over the life span of the project. In comparison, the
other two workstreams relied more on desktop research and material development, and incorporated a
smaller number of contact sessions with a smaller population (mainly district officials and not all 650
schools).
While the original budget made provision for an M&E component, in a 2022 version of the budget the
M&E budget appears to have been withdrawn – it was originally in the NECT budget, but by 2022
appears neither in the UNICEF nor the NECT budgets. In response to a query the evaluation team was
informed that these resources were reallocated to implementing partners responsible for conducting
their own M&E on programme activities (I407) but there is no record of this in terms of changed budgets.
The evaluation identified important shortcomings in programme monitoring (as described in section 3),
suggesting that this component was not well resourced. This is arguably a weakness of the resource
allocation approach in the REALS SA programme.
Given that the expenditure data alone offers limited insight into the appropriateness of budgeting and
expenditure, the evaluation also analysed progress reports and interviewed stakeholders to understand
whether resources were sufficient and to what extent they were used efficiently. Table 6 provides a
32
summary, based on this qualitative data, of the reported sufficiency of budgets for each workstream
and some of their main sub-components12.

(Interviews, NECT & UNICEF, 2022; UNICEF, 2021b)
As the table shows, programme reporting and stakeholder interviews suggested that the programme
has faced unanticipated costs across most of the main components.
The AfL component appears to have budgeted adequately for the agreed scope of work to be
implemented, but it has been repeatedly noted that the likelihood of achieving outcomes would have
been enhanced by building in a stronger subject advisor support component. The reason for not
including this in the agreed scope appears to be budget related.
The Reading Recovery workstream reportedly underbudgeted for critical activities including the audit
of story books, reading guides and radio programmes which placed programme outcomes at risk. The
additional cost of auditing was reportedly borne by NECT. The monitoring budget for RR also did not
allow for as many schools to be monitored as planned. The sample had to be reduced to save costs,
as explained in the report: “the biggest limitation to the study was the budget allocated towards M&E.
With the risk of overspending, the sample size of schools was reduced from 66 schools to 54 schools
to fit the budget” (NECT, n.d.). It is implied that the findings of this monitoring exercise may not be
reflective of the full school population, leaving uncertainty about exact number of schools that received
books and whether these books were of the intended number and variety. Further, the budget for
broadcasting radio episodes was revised upwards when it was discovered that it had been
underestimated. UNICEF sourced additional funds to achieve this, as a UNICEF staff member
explained: “When we finally had the 24 episodes, what had not been built into the budget was a financial
incentive for a radio station to broadcast episodes. Thus, an additional budget was made. However, all
of that took time, we didn’t have enough money in budget, it wasn’t anticipated that all these other things
would arise”. This impacted on the budget significantly as one financial document shows that an invoice
for radio programmes was underbudgeted by more than double the budgeted amount. One interviewee
also suggested that the cost of reader books was underestimated, although there is no quantitative data
on this.
12 It should be noted that the qualitative data used in this analysis varied in terms of its strength and the extent to which it was
corroborated across multiple sources.
13 See extensive discussion in the Findings section.
33
For the Recovery Curriculum workstream, the main pressure on budgets was the unanticipated need
for extensive face to face training and coaching. But they had budgeted to mainly deliver training online,
and the decision to revert to face to face delivery in some areas significant budgetary implications as it
required catering for participants and covering travel expenses for facilitators. According to PSA, L&M
had originally planned for all training other than for CMs to be face-to-face - but coaching was intended
to be online. This was reversed soon after the project started in the Eastern Cape and then significant
amounts of coaching had to be done face-to-face largely because of loadshedding. The workstream
also narrowed their training population to exclude deputy principals. It is also reported that NECT
assumed responsibility for these costs, thereby providing relief and enabling the implementing partners
to complete their activities as planned.
Inadequate resources were also reported to support programme management in completing planned
activities (I556).
In summary, a number of expenses were underestimated, and it also proved unfeasible to rely on online
programme delivery to the extent that partners had agreed when the programme had been designed
and budgeted for. The Lessons Learned section at the end of the report discusses how future
programmes may draw on this experience to budget more realistically in future. The responsiveness of
UNICEF and NECT to secure additional funding where the need arose, was an important enabler in
this regard. There were nevertheless some missed opportunities to support the achievement of
outcomes, such as the exclusion of deputy principals from L&M training and the limited support offered
to SAs to roll out AfL training. In addition, the monitoring function was arguably poorly resourced, with
negative impacts that are discussed elsewhere in the report. Despite these challenges, the programme
has managed to achieve most of the critical components of programme design within the available
resources. There is no doubt, based on progress reports and interviews, that considerable effort went
into effective budget management, finding ways to optimize spending or reduce costs, in order to ensure
this.
4.3 Workstream Implementation
The rest of the evaluation findings will focus on the implementation of the four programme workstreams.
Within this section, the report will delve into findings related to the design of these workstreams, how
those engaged in the workstreams understood the design and intent and assess how this understanding
translated into effective implementation, if indeed it did, recipients' perceptions of the workstream
activities and both the strengths and weaknesses that characterize the overall performance of the
workstreams. The findings are inclusive of each of the workstreams’ ToCs in order to help remind the
reader of the workstream’s logic, with the accompanying narrative for each to be found in the
evaluation’s Inception Report Version B.
4.3.1 Assessment for Learning (AfL)
Figure 5 below is the ToC for the Assessment for Learning (AfL) workstream. This workstream was in
line with strand two of sub-output 1.2, which “focuses on developing teachers’ and SMTs’ use of AfL
approaches to enhance the implementation of the trimmed curriculum in order to improve teaching and
learning” (UNICEF, 2021b). The objective of the workstream was to equip subject advisors and teachers
with the necessary skills to have an impact on the education system by effectively utilizing pedagogies
to improve learning outcomes and promote learning recovery (FG410). This was to be done through
helping educators understand the gap between where a child is and where a child is meant to be so
that the educator may teach accordingly.
34
Figure 5: Theory of Change for Assessment for Learning workstream
The workstream was intended to help the education system catch-up on the implementation of AfL
(FG410). The applied model for the implementation of the workstream was described as a 3-phase
model where the key intervention was “at a district level focusing on subject advisors as the nexus for
change and improvement. The second phase was supporting subject advisors to provide capacity
development for teachers, and the third phase, was to support subject advisors to support teachers to
implement” (FG415). It was thus one of the workstreams that utilized the train the trainer model, with
the subject advisors expected to train teachers.
During the evaluation it emerged that Afl has been in the policy environment for a long period of time,
however it was the implementation of the policy that had been lacking. Given the importance of learning
recovery post-COVID, and the realization of the imbalance in how formative and summative
assessment were understood, it was deemed important that teachers understand and are able to use
the AfL pedagogy.
Similar to the overall REALS SA programme, the workstream did not have a consolidated theory of
change, but did however have a logic that was used to co-create a theory of change. The evaluation
process provided the stakeholders involved in AfL specifically the opportunity to share their
understandings of the workstream and how it was intended to achieve its overall goal. In addition to
what has been noted above about the relation of the workstream to the strategic thrust of the DBE,
there was a shared understanding of the intent of the workstream to emphasize the importance of
formative assessment in conjunction with summative assessment. Members of the task team
specifically noted that “we need to de-emphasize summative assessment and realize formative
assessment is helpful to help close the gaps for learners in their minds and learning”.
When considering whether or not programme stakeholders had a shared understanding of the intent of
the workstream, findings suggested that the overall intent of the programme was collectively
understood. However, the evaluation found that in the implementation of the workstream activities, there
was a slight divergence in the understanding of who was to be trained. In the developed ToC, circuit
managers, subject advisors and lead teachers were identified as direct beneficiaries for the workstream.
As per figure 1, the workstream was intended to affect a total of 104 circuit managers and subject
advisors, as well as 304 teachers. The circuit managers and subjects advisors were to be directly
influenced by the AfL resource guide and teacher training, as well as the actual training on the use of
the AfL practices (UNICEF & NECT, 2022). The divergence arose in the inclusion of teachers in the
training, with the technical team noting that the training was in fact only intended for district level officials
35
-
and not teachers. FG410 noted that the “AFL programme is all about training subject advisors; if you
look at the concept documents it is clear that AfL goes up to subject advisor level – they are given
orientation and guidance on how to cascade the information down to teachers”. FG415 was of the
opinion that the inclusion of teachers in the training was in fact a capacitation strategy developed by the
different provincial departments where subject advisors and circuit managers have too many schools
under their jurisdiction. To their understanding, lead teachers were brought on board to partially address
the high subject-advisor to school ratio, as well as increase existing capacity in the system in relation
to AfL.
The workstream was focused on producing a full set of AfL materials, a workshop plan for the rollout of
the training sessions, contextually customized subject advisor and teacher portfolios, as well as to
support those trained directly to develop intervention plans for rolling AfL out to teachers. The LMS as
well as the formative assessment booklet were successfully developed. The LMS was designed to
engage subject advisors and teachers in AfL workshops, its successful development owed to a decade
of pre-pandemic research resulting in a well-defined operational model. Currently maintained by TUT,
the system’s responsibilities include participant enrolment and access management. These materials
have been lauded for their user-friendliness and relevance, facilitating creative assessment
approaches, as affirmed by training attendees who found the experience informative and revitalizing,
particularly for educators without formal teaching methods education, underlining the need for support
and effective pedagogical application (FG459). Efforts were reportedly made to ensure that these
materials are gender and equity sensitive, free of any biases.
In addition to the LMS, subject advisors noted that they received “an AfL module which was on the
Moodle platform; we were given a link to use in order to access the module” (FG498). Once this system
and the training materials were developed, training on their use commenced, with the technical team
conducting “six face-to-face workshops on AfL for subject advisors and teachers of language, EFAL,
Mathematics, Natural Science and Technology” (NECT, 2022b).
Despite significant implementation delays in the province of KZN specifically due to extreme weather
conditions, significant progress was made with the training being successfully completed on May 25,
2023. The subject advisor training witnessed impressive coverage across provinces, with 93% (310 out
of 333) of subject advisors trained in Limpopo, 85% (109 out of 128) in the Eastern Cape, and 89.2%
(250 out of 280) in KwaZulu-Natal, culminating in a total of 90.2% (669 out of 741) subject advisors
trained across these three regions (UNICEF & NECT, 2023). The gender distribution within the trained
cohort is well-balanced, with 60% being female and 40% male, reflecting an inclusive participation.
These figures were subject to one final round of updates; a final report by TUT was expected in July
but had not been shared at the time of finalising the evaluation report.
While no risks to implementation were identified during the design phase of the workstream, multiple
assumptions were noted which were required to hold true in order for the intervention logic to be
feasible. A key assumption that did not hold true, as part of the overall programme and not just this
workstream, was the availability of online access for those involved in the training. It was found that,
since the criteria of the workstream was paper-based, there was a built-in mitigation strategy for this in
the form of physically printing out the materials that were online. These printed back-ups were to be
used when load shedding was experienced, with the technical team then transferring the information
onto the online system when there was connectivity again (FG417). Although this worked, it was noted
as a challenge mainly because it was time consuming manually capturing what could have originally
been entered directly onto the system.
Related to this was the assumption of the ability of trainees to navigate online systems. With the LMS
being on an online platform, mobile data and access were required for teachers and subject advisors
to be able to access the system during the training. This was challenged by the power outages as well
as the price of mobile data, with I399 notably stating that “the assumption that blended learning works
in South Africa is a massive issue which the higher-ups don’t quite understand”. Pertaining to this is the
36
ability and comfort of teachers to frequently use the online system. Subject advisors reflected that they
did not feel there was enough time to learn how to use the system, noting that “most of the teachers
who were participating in the training were not well versed about the Moodle system, and there was not
enough time to orient teachers first on how to use the system before starting with the training” (FG501).
Despite initial challenges in implementing the system, the other materials developed within the
workstream were well-received by intended beneficiaries.
As part of gathering inputs on how the training was received, the evaluation sought to speak to subject
advisors and teachers who had attended the training. These focus groups did indeed take place, with
a much lesser number of subject advisors than had been hoped for. Apart from the reflections noted
above on the useful nature of the materials produced by the workstream, the engagements did not yield
further insights as the small number of subject advisors who participated in the focus groups said that
they “have not yet started cascading the information down to teachers” (FG501). It is notable that for
most of those in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo, training commenced nearly a year ago, but the
“cascading” phase has not yet begun. As the implementing partner has raised as a concern from early
on, it was not in the scope of the sub-programme to facilitate or manage this “cascading”.
While it is encouraging that the training has been received well by those that have been exposed to it,
there is no information, at the time of finalising the evaluation report, as to how many of those trained
have commenced training teachers, and how effective it is proving to be14. It is also therefore unclear
whether or not the materials and the LMS have been helpful in capacitating them in training teachers
This is further supported by observations that occurred during the fieldwork phase of the evaluation in
the visited sample schools. While these observations are not representative of the pilot programme
beneficiary schools, they align with other sources suggesting limited “cascading” by those trained.
Table 7 below shows that only one of the six visited schools reported involvement in the AfL workstream,
but this may not be accurate as AfL training of subject advisors themselves had only recently
commenced in that province.

As noted earlier, the implementation partners have no resources for supporting the next step in the
“train the trainer” model. This seems to have put the theory of change at risk: the realisation of outcomes
depends entirely on the follow-through of subject advisors. Subject advisors may have a better grasp
of AfL but if they fail to train teachers, there will be little to no change in classroom outcomes. This is a
risk to effectiveness and will have implications on the intended longer-term benefits of the workstream.
In mid-2022 there was a discussion underway to provide more support for those trained to implement
the model, but it does not appear that this had been done as of August 2023.
14 Once this begins, the subject advisors and teachers would be able to record their progress on the LMS, allowing the department
the ability to gauge if there is progress in the implementation of AfL practices in the classroom. The implementation partner has
not indicated whether or not such progress has yet been captured on the LMS.
37
Despite the evaluation’s inability to conclude reliably on whether this cohort of trained participants will
train teachers, there is clear interest and confidence in the materials and curriculum to be rolled out
further beyond the REALS SA districts and schools. The embedding of the workstream on an existing
educational policy has been beneficial for the uptake of the programme at the provincial level, and the
enthusiasm of those involved appears to have bolstered the momentum to capacitate others in the
system. According to the technical team, provincial education departments have shown interest in the
uptake of the work being done, noting that “several districts demonstrated excellent take up and initiative
for wanting to continue the programme – by completion of activities, participation, etc” (FG459).

As noted in Table 8 above, it was communicated in the last few months of the programme that the AfL
practices and resources have gained the attention of the largest teacher’s union in the country, SADTU.
The AfL resource pack has been updated and shared with SADTU, who will rollout training on a national
scale. In addition, the provinces of NW and MP have also agreed to collaborate in the rollout on a
provincial level.
Summary
In summary, the evaluation has found that the conceptualization and implementation of the AfL
workstream has been relevant to improving pedagogical practices related to assessment and closing
the implementation gap on a longstanding DBE policy. The workstream was underpinned by a logic that
appeared sound when compiled into a ToC, with a shared understanding on what the intent of the
workstream was. While this understanding existed, there was slight divergence in the understanding of
training participants. This however did not take away from the materials and the delivering of training
on the materials being well received by those who were privy to them, noting that this was efficiently
and effectively done. The overall programme extension allowed the workstream the opportunity to
complete the implementation of its activities, albeit with the anticipated outcomes in classrooms only
expected to be realised outside of the REALS SA implementation and timeframes. There are various
opportunities for the continued implementation of AfL outside of the REALS SA programme, even while
risks remain to achieving the intended improvements in teacher capacity and learning via those trained
as part of REALS SA.
4.3.2 Recovery Curriculum
Figure 6 below is the ToC for the Recovery Curriculum workstream, which was created with the aim of
swiftly evaluating the suitability and pertinence of the existing school curriculum for the forthcoming 10
to 50 years, as well as examining its historical and anticipated impact on learner achievement. This was
in line with the first strand of sub-output 1.2, which is to conduct “a review of SMTs’ and teachers’ views
and experiences with the trimmed curriculum and the application of a quality assurance framework for
monitoring curriculum implementation” (UNICEF, 2021b).
38
Figure 6: Theory of Change for Recovery Curriculum workstream
It is important to highlight at this point the difference between the terms “trimmed curriculum” and
“recovery curriculum”, as these will be used frequently throughout the discussion. The former refers to
the curriculum that had been implemented during the COVID-19 period, which had been drastically cut
down and was a deviation from the original curriculum in order to accommodate the negative impact of
the pandemic (Department of Basic Education, 2021). This curriculum is now referred to as the recovery
curriculum, as it continues to aim to recover the learning losses incurred during the period of the
pandemic.
Similar to the AfL workstream, the Recovery Curriculum workstream drew heavily on the work of the
DBE in relation to the curriculum being implemented. The workstream technical team consisted of the
abovementioned two organisations, as well as the DBE. With its work reportedly beginning on the 1st of
October 2021, the recovery curriculum technical team experienced delays in finalising the agreement
with UKZN, but this was finalised and workstream implementation was able to proceed. The technical
team was headed by UKZN and worked with researchers from the Nelson Mandela University and the
University of Limpopo. Interestingly, the selection of researchers from these provincially located
universities was considered as the developmental aspect of the workstream, through the upskilling of
researchers. Activities were planned to review the trimmed curriculum against the Curriculum
Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS) curriculum for grades 1 to 715, establish and evaluate
differences in terms of conceptual coherence, content and concept gaps, and report on the conceptual
coherence, content and concept gaps of the trimmed curriculum
The primary activities of this workstream were the review of the revised annual teaching plans (ATPs)
and of the trimmed curriculum, in order to report on the implementation of the recovery curriculum as
well as the quality of its review. This review commenced in 2021 and was completed in 2022, resulting
in the anticipated review report of the recovery curriculum undertaken in order to explore content gaps
and curriculum coherence for selected subject in grades 1 to 7 (Ramrathan, 2022). The review of the
trimmed curriculum found that while the main parts of the curriculum were still there, some parts were
removed which could affect learners' ability to read, write, listen and communicate effectively. The
removal of some parts of the curriculum could have both positive and negative effects - more time for
developing these core skills, but less exposure to indigenous knowledge (Ramrathan, 2022). The
technical team noted that the changes mostly involved reorganizing content and reducing practice
opportunities, rather than actually cutting out content. This could impact learners' ability to learn in later
15 The curriculum for Home Languages, First Additional Languages, Natural Sciences and Mathematics.
39
grades. One of the gaps identified was that learners had less time to learn important skills in the
foundation phase. Overall, while some parts of the curriculum were trimmed, it may have unintended
consequences for student learning. While the DBE has had sight of these results for more than a year
now, it is unclear how they have been utilised. The assumption is that the results have fed, or will feed,
into informing what content is removed and kept in the curriculum going forward.
The second main activity was to develop a quality assurance framework to monitor and track the
recovery curriculum, as well as for lesson planning and preparation for use by teachers and HoDs. This
framework was successfully developed, informed by the findings presented in the review report based
on the review of the trimmed curriculum. The development of the framework was also where the
workstream integrated equity considerations (although none explicitly for gender), by ensuring that the
framework is applicable in both mainstream and special schools (I401).
Once the quality assurance framework had been developed, the next and final step was to train subject
advisors, circuit managers and the provincial DBE on the use of the framework, in order for them to
develop an understanding of the framework and how to optimally use it. Subject advisors and circuit
managers were specifically identified as participants as they play a critical role in the implementation
and management of the school curriculum. A training plan was developed for the district level officials
on the monitoring of the implementation of recovery ATPs in schools, and a training manual on the use
of the quality assurance framework was developed and edited. This training manual was used by PSA
as part of Resilient School Management training.
In agreeing on and proceeding to implement these activities, the NECT, UKZN, DBE and UNICEF
collectively identified one potential risk related to the successful implementation and success of the
workstream. The workstream ran the risk of there not being clarity on the purpose of the review of the
curriculum in the wider education system. The contextual factors of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
effect it had on the schooling system aided in making clearer why a review of the curriculum was
necessary, especially because of the classroom learning time that had been lost. The overall
understanding from reviewed documentation and collected data from participant subject advisors is
that the programme was related to reviewing the effectiveness of the annual teaching plans, and
through this, monitoring the implementation of the trimmed curriculum which informs the review of the
curriculum as and when necessary (FG535, I404).
To corroborate the information presented in the implementation reports, the SMT survey conducted as
part of this evaluation gathered inputs from school principals as training recipients on their experience
with the materials and the workstream in general. The findings were analysed and are presented
visually in Figure 7 below:
Figure 7: SMT Survey Results for Recovery Curriculum
-

As depicted above, the majority of respondents across all three provinces noted that the training
improved their understanding of the quality assurance framework as well as their ability to use it
appropriately. It is possible that the shared understanding between the stakeholders and the
40
beneficiaries contributed towards the understanding and uptake of the materials. Those who have been
exposed to the materials – i.e. the quality assurance framework, the revised ATPs and training content
– have reflected on them as being relevant and therefore required (FG450). They have also proceeded
to note that because of the rather academic nature of the content, those who do not have access to the
materials would find it difficult to understand the overall intent and process followed for the quality
assurance of the curriculum. Subject advisors, who the workstream aimed to capacitate in terms of
understanding the purpose of the framework and revised ATPs, specially noted their overall impression
as being “that it was explained at an academic level - there was a slight concern that it needed to be
engaged with more deeply” (FG535).
It is however not yet clear to what extent the use of the framework has been useful in improving the
implementation of the curriculum in the classroom. Data collected from the few trained subject advisors
during the evaluation process presented the same trend. The discrepancy between planned and actual
involvement of SA’s suggests reconsidering the role that they were envisioned to play with the
framework, but the evaluation team remains uncertain due to poor representation across provinces of
SA’s during virtual engagements and their lack of awareness of the programme. Subject advisor training
has been completed, and the fully comprehensive feedback on how the training was received is
anticipated to be reflected on in the final recovery curriculum report due to be completed and published
by UKZN in 2025 (NECT & DBE, 2022b).
Related to the relevance of the workstream to the DBE curriculum, the workstream’s most notable
success has been reflected on as the production of a quality assurance framework. This tool is the first
of its kind according to literature that informed the workstream and can be used in future if the
department wants to further review their curriculum (I404). Because of this, the workstream has been a
large contributor towards rebooting recovery curriculum, with effects that are anticipated to be long-
lasting. Like the rest of the programme, the biggest weakness to the workstream has been the time
taken to implement the activities. The technical team noted that the delays in training were a setback,
but implementation was completed by the end of April 2023.
The key findings of the curriculum review exercise continue to hold potential to inform curriculum
decisions, although it is concerning that there is little evidence of DBE’s engagement with the review
report for this purpose. There is also potential for the QAF to be taken further by the DBE, but the
evaluation has found no evidence of plans for the tool to continue being used in its current form, or
continuing to being developed.
The intention was to promote this with DBE; for instance, during a recovery curriculum technical team
meeting the NECT had committed to presenting the REALS-SA programme as part of the agenda for
the DBE Chief Directors Forum (NECT & DBE, 2021) to secure buy-in and ensure its sustainability. The
colloquium also included presentations on the QAF and the feedback that had been received from those
who had implemented it on the ground. Based on this, there is potential value in the QAF, as well as
insights as to how it may be strengthened to make it more useful. However, neither the colloquium nor
documentary evidence available as of June have any evidence of plans by DBE or others to take it
forward as of June 2023.

Summary
41
The conceptualization of the recovery curriculum workstream was directly influenced by the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic, making it one of extreme relevance in relation to the context at the time. The
logic underpinning the workstream was sound, and coherent enough to develop into a shared ToC.
Programme activities were implemented as planned albeit not without delays, with the quality assurance
framework being the biggest takeaway from the workstream. Despite its potential to be refined and
used, there is no evidence of further momentum within DBE to continue to use or roll out the QAF.
4.3.3 Leadership and Management (L&M)
Figure 8 is the ToC for the Leadership and Management (L&M) workstream. It depicts how the
workstream aimed to ensure that school management and leadership become better equipped to lead
in times of crises, but also in general. This was in line with output 2 of the REALS SA programme, which
was to “strengthen the capacity of key stakeholders in the education sector and enhance access to
learning materials” (UNICEF, 2021a). As further expanded on in programme documentation, the focus
of this workstream was specifically on enhancing parental engagement, and the accountability and
leadership of school management during an emergency and after.
Figure 8: Theory of Change for Leadership and Management
As mentioned above, the L&M workstream sought to empower schools and their respective
management teams to be able to deal with future crises and disasters (I395). When the COVID-19 crisis
hit the globe, operations of all systems including schools were severely disrupted. Ensuring the
continuity of education was difficult amidst national lockdowns and overall situational uncertainty, and
this exposed the need for a disaster-ready education system with equally ready officials. In recognizing
this, the L&M workstream was conceptualized in an attempt to build “institutional capacity and resilience
at school and departmental level, to ensure the functioning of schools even during times of crises”
(FG410).
As part of the evaluation process, the abovementioned intentions as well as the overall understanding
of the workstream theory were agreed on by relevant DBE officials, PSA, NECT and UNICEF.
Programme documentation brought to light that this shared understanding did however begin on uneven
grounds, as there was hesitance to participate in the workstream from the DBE head of technical team.
The REALS SA Advocacy Meeting minutes noted various concerns from a DBE official regarding the
uptake of the programme without having consulted various institutions and other stakeholders in
42
-
agreeing on the objective of the workstream. This concern was shared with various other members
present at the meeting. This was however settled by NECT and PSA reassuring the provincial education
departments of the management measures put into place to aid the running of the programme in the
pilot provinces (DBE & NECT, 2021). This appears to have addressed all concerns, as the technical
team was formed and implementation continued in all three provinces.
As the first key activity, a baseline assessment was conducted by the workstream implementing partner,
PSA. The purpose of the baseline was to gauge the capacities of schools and their respective
management teams, which would then inform the development of training and coaching programmes
that will sufficiently fill the identified gaps. It was anticipated that the capacitation of the school principals,
deputies and SMTs would culminate into a strong school management environment and system in all
types of crises and overall school operation. This was meant to be reinforced through trainees getting
together to form communities of practice (CoPs) to continue sharing experiences and learnings with the
application of the training content. Community members and the SGB were capacitated with the
anticipation that they would foster a healthy environment for learning outside of school. Principals and
their deputies were to be trained and coached on three aspects, namely: Leading for Reading16, School
Leadership in Times of Crises and Parental Support for Reading. Circuit managers were to receive
training on Remote Planning, Performance and Governance. Finally, SGBs were trained and coached
on Parental Support for Reading. Once all the training sessions were completed and various coaching
sessions conducted, PSA was planned to then conduct an endline assessment to gauge the
effectiveness of their training sessions, materials and follow-up sessions.
The core method of delivery for the workstream was training and coaching sessions on the topics
related to school leadership and management as well as community capacitation, highlighted at the
beginning of this section. Through the training and coaching, the L&M workstream anticipated to reach
104 CMs and subject advisors, 650 school principals and SMT members and 3 250 SGB members as
well as parents/caregivers (UNICEF & NECT, 2022). It is worth noting that while the workstream training
and coaching directly aimed to reach 3 250, this was anticipated to reach further into the community
through the train the trainer model; the trained SGB members were anticipated to train an additional
300 parents/caregivers each, reaching a grand total of 195 000 parents.
The expectation was that training would result in several improvements, including enhanced disaster
management through trained SMTs, and improved management of curriculum and reading materials,
and assessment processes through the collaboration of CMs and the community. This was to be
supplemented in parallel by the continued implementation of CoPs via trained principals, who would
share learnings and experiences as and when they occur within their respective contexts. The initial
goal was to encompass 60% of schools within online CoPs. As of May 2023 approximately 58% of
CoPs or WhatsApp groups are operational, marked by at least one weekly interaction per member
(PSA, 2023). During the programme’s duration, a total of 138 WhatsApp groups were established, with
58% (86 groups) currently meeting the criterion of weekly activity by members (PSA, 2023).
The initiation of WhatsApp groups was primarily for communication and logistical purposes between
coaches and principals, with a noteworthy outcome being the introduction of social media to some
principals. Subsequently, CoPs underwent training through the SLITD workshop, focusing on disaster
management plans, resulting in the groups’ refinement to serve these particular objectives (PSA, 2023).
While it is advantageous that all principals have now gained exposure to online groups and their
potential functionality, one can anticipate that without external guidance and continuous curation of
CoPs, many groups might not remain active in the long term. It is foreseeable that they could be revived
only when the need arises.
In relation to CoPs and their anticipated reach, the L&M workstream theory was underpinned by various
assumptions that have held true for the most part, except that of the programme implementation being
adequately resourced. While this may only have been implied, the assumption of adequate resourcing
16 This overlapped with the Reading Recovery workstream.
43
of the programme was not only related to financial and human capacity, but the availability of the time
required to adequately conduct the planned activities. The L&M workstream made explicit identified
risks and mitigation strategies into the implementation of the programme, one of which was related to
the resourcing of the programme, as depicted in Table 10 below.
Table 10: L&M Perceived Risks and Mitigation Strategies
(Performance Solutions Africa, 2022)
The identified risk factors mainly pertained to connectivity and availability of resources to adequately
implement the workstream activities. This suggests that the assumption of the programme being
adequately resourced did not hold true. This resulted in the workstream altering its design, where it had
originally planned to train principals and deputies but later only trained principals due to cost-related
factors (PSA, 2022). Despite this, the workstream was able to develop an adequate mitigation strategy,
an important component of which was the overall extension17 of the programme.
Despite the abovementioned risks that were identified during implementation, the programme was able
to produce the training materials that it had originally sought to, as well as deliver the training and
commence coaching in some instances. The materials that were developed included two training and
coaching guides for school leadership and district officials on (1) accountability, curriculum tracking and
reading resource management (2) emergency response and (3) parental involvement (NECT, 2021c).
In addition to these guidelines, the workstream also produced a ‘Resilient School Leadership in Times
of Crises’ Module, which dealt with understanding the various components related to leadership in
difficult times (Performance Solutions Africa, n.d.). Officials have reportedly noted that the materials
have begun to influence the manner in which they approach their overall management activities,
however this will be adequately captured in PSA’s endline report which is yet to be produced and
finalized.
As noted above, the main activities of the workstream were the conducting of the baseline assessment,
which led to the development of training and coaching materials, as well as the delivery of said training
and coaching. All these elements have been completed. Overall, the access and reach statistics for the
L&M workstream are good. The baseline of management practices were assessed in more than 90%
of the targeted schools, amounting to 591 out of 657, having participated by the cutoff date of April 15,
2022 (UNICEF & NECT, 2023). Subsequently, the training of 104 Circuit Managers and governance
officials, a crucial component, reached a completion rate of 83.3%, with 231 out of 277 successfully
trained by May 24, 2023. In parallel, the training of 650 principals in resilient school leadership during
crises and engagement in communities of practice has demonstrated substantial progress,
encompassing 79.5% of principals, equating to 517 out of 650, successfully trained as of January 31,
2023. The gender distribution of these trained principals reflects a balanced participation, with 52%
17 Note that the extension addressed the time issue but not the budget issue, as it was a no-cost extension.
44
being male and 48% female. Moreover, the coaching support provided to 650 principals for resilient
school leadership and community engagement has been implemented, with 70.7% of principals,
totalling 460 out of 650, having received coaching support by the conclusion of April 30, 2023 (UNICEF
& NECT, 2023).
Furthermore, implementation updates in the workstream’s October 2022 reported on practices of school
principals, and noted that there were plans to develop department head improvement plans. As part of
utilising the teacher guides on Supporting Reading in the Classroom under the reading workstream,
school principals were required to disseminate the teacher guides to department heads. Principals were
to give an overview of the content of the guide, then proceed to ensure that the respective department
heads develop training plans to capacitate their respective teachers, and these plans are referred to as
Department Head (DH) improvement plans. As per the October report, these improvement plans are in
place for the remaining schools (Performance Solutions Africa, 2022).
To assess the benefit derived from this high level of reach and access, the evaluation conducted a
survey for SMT members that were recipients of REALS-SA training and/or coaching18. In this survey,
respondents noted how many sessions they attended in total, if these were relevant to their daily
activities, clear and easy to put into practice. The results have been summarized in Figure 9.
Figure 9: SMT Survey Results: L&M Specific
Of 229 total respondents, a large portion of the survey respondents (mainly principals) noted that they
had attended at least 1 to 5 of the L&M training sessions. Overwhelming majorities of those that had
been exposed to the training note that it was relevant to their responsibilities and clear. Despite this, a
relatively large percentage rated it not as “easy” but only “OK” (neither easy nor difficult) put into
practice. There could be several reasons for this apparent contradiction. One possibility is that the
training was theoretical in nature and did not provide practical examples or guidance on how to apply
the concepts learners to the specific challenges faced by the targeted schools. Additionally, contextual
challenges such as poor school infrastructure, and capacity constraints could make it difficult for
participants to prioritize implementing the training recommendations. It could also be due to the inherent
challenge of implementing new practices and changes in any institutional environment. Overall, Error!

may be additional support and resources needed to help SMT members implement the concepts and
recommendations of the training in practice.
Interviews and fieldwork observations gathered additional data on the attendance of the training and
overall reception of the material. The table below presents the evaluation team’s collected data in
conjunction with empirical observations at the evaluation sample schools. The data reflects whether or
not the evaluation team met with the school principal, how many L&M training sessions the principal
reported to have attended, awareness of and involvement in CoPs as well as the usefulness of the
training and whether or not the SGB received training as well.

Two of the visited six schools did not provide any insights related to attendance of L&M training and/or
coaching sessions, and another two in relation to SGB training. Those that have attended the training
and coaching reported to have found it useful, with all of them having attended more than one session.
Focus group sessions with the subject advisors revealed a similar attendance trend, with the majority
of the engaged subject advisors noting that they had attended either one or more L&M session,
alongside those of curriculum management. Participants in FG533 and FG498 reflected that they had
attended at least 1 training session specific to leadership and management. Substantiating this, the
PSA also reports that there have been glowing reviews on the quality of the workshops that have been
delivered (I391). The reaction to the training and coaching sessions is a notable success for the L&M
workstream, with a FG450 participant noting that they “learnt a lot about dealing with crisis when in
leadership and how to manage when in crisis – I also learnt a lot about methods on dealing and
managing with crisis as a leader and a manager”. A potential contributor to this is the insurance that the
technical team took in venues with generators, so that power outages do not disrupt the planned
workstream implementation. This allowed sessions to continue, even though overall the rollout has
been affected by time constraints and other logistical challenges that are not unique to this workstream.
It is unclear to what extent the REALS SA programme was able to facilitate the creation of COPs, as
the available data suggests that there are very few CoPs in practice, and it appears that these few had
been in place before the start of the programme (CS103, CS105).
46
Commendable planning and delivery of training unfortunately does not guarantee perfect attendance
from beneficiaries, and this was one of the shortcomings L&M faced. Multiple attempts were reportedly
made through the DBE technical chair to schedule virtual sessions for CMs late last year, with the help
of the DBE Director of Governance, to no avail (Performance Solutions Africa, 2022). This may have
been due to officials not receiving communication on the training on time, as this was the case in KZN
during the month of May last year (I395). Alternatively, it may be due to the constrained availability of
CMs, which remains an overall challenge in the larger education system. Furthermore, there were
delays in the workstream, which may be partially attributed to the limited support from provincial DOEs
as well as severe natural disasters during the rollout, but also possibly due to the underestimation by
PSA, the NECT and UNICEF of the time required to conduct a baseline study in schools and districts
served by REALS-SA.
Initially, the intention was to incorporate Deputy Principals into the program, a decision that would have
been highly beneficial. Deputy Principals typically oversee crucial curriculum aspects and would have
resulted in a more profound integration of the programme within each school. As discussed earlier, a
decision was made after the signing of the SLA to reduce the target population for the leadership training
in order to remain within the allocated budget (PSA, 2022). As a result of not including Deputy Principals,
there is a potential jeopardy to the programme’s effectiveness, as the principals might not adequately
transmit essential information and innovative practices to other members of the SMT (PSA, 2023).
It is however encouraging that the implementing partner has a tracking mechanism in place in the form
of coaching, which has been a useful mechanism for gauging uptake thus far (I391) and could be
analysed eventually to yield representative data on this outcome.
The workshops have received consistently favourable participant feedback across various indicators,
including the relevance of the material, session engagement, implementation confidence, facilitation
quality, and coaching quality. Notably, the parent working sessions achieved the highest rating of 4.8
out of 5 (PSA, 2023). PSA does however note that this impressive score should be considered within
the context that many attendees, including SGB members and parents, might not have had prior training
experiences for comparison. Circuit Managers also provided positive feedback, giving the training a
score of 4.5 out of 5. The Confidence to Implement indicator scored relatively lower at 4.2 out of 5 (PSA,
2023). This is in line with typical outcomes for new material and practices, indicating significant progress
in building confidence levels.
Aside from the direct benefit to the schools and districts that REALS SA reached through this
workstream, the continued benefit of the workstream for the larger education system is reliant on the
willingness of the DBE together with provincial departments to continue actively using the materials
and/or rolling out the materials from this pilot programme which are listed in the table below. As far as
this evaluation can ascertain, there are no concrete plans on the part of DBE and/or provincial DOEs
to upscale training or further roll out any other outputs from the L&M workstream.

Summary
In summary, the evaluation has found that the conceptualization and implementation of the L&M
workstream has been relevant to capacitating an education system to be less at risk from future
disasters. The workstream was underpinned by a ToC with a shared understanding on what the intent
of the workstream was, which fed into the development and delivery of the training materials, modules
and coaching. This was done in an efficient manner that met the needs of the beneficiaries. There are
various opportunities for the continued use of training programme produced through the workstream,
which could greatly increase the value of this intervention beyond the REALS-SA schools, but it is
unclear whether there is any intention to do so.
4.3.4 Reading Recovery
Figure 10 is the ToC for the reading recovery programme, which is in direct relation to sub-output 1.1
of supporting the implementation of the reading recovery programme for better learning outcomes. The
justification for the specific focus on reading recovery was based on research that shows that the world
is facing a global reading crisis as many countries have challenges with children, youth and adults who
are unable to read with comprehension. This workstream specifically acknowledged the longstanding
literacy challenge that had been exacerbated by the learning losses during the school closures caused
by COVID-19. Through the provision of reading resources as well as guidance on how to use the
materials adequately, the workstream sought to help schools and learners recover their reading learning
losses and also improve their access to reading books for pleasure (I316).
Figure 10: Theory of Change for Reading Recovery
-
The logic underpinning the reading recovery workstream was heavily informed by the recovery efforts
of the REALS SA Programme. Programme partners had an empirical understanding that multiple
reading programmes that support teachers and children in the technical space of reading can exist,
which is why this workstream aimed to focus on increasing access to actual materials, which can
additionally be used for pleasure to foster a reading culture. The rationale for the programme is
understood as being to support the DBE’s efforts regarding the continuity of learning through traditional
and innovative approaches, the implementation of the DBE’s reading strategy for improved learning
and reading outcomes, as well as to provide learners with increased access to reading resources
through print and broadcast media resulting in improved learning and reading outcomes (Marneweck,
48
2022). Through this, it was anticipated that learners would have increased access and exposure to
reading resources through print, and broadcast, resulting in improved learning outcomes.
Like the other three workstreams, the evaluation process afforded the reading recovery stakeholders
and role-players the chance to co-create a programme ToC, depicting the overall process and
anticipated outcomes. Through this process, it was evident that programme stakeholders had an
overwhelming understanding of the reading recovery workstream and its intent. Because of its
centrality, stakeholders and role-players were also aware of the various opportunities of integration with
other workstreams in the programme and larger education system, particularly AfL and curriculum
management.
Given the envisioned reach and impact of the workstream, various activities formed part of the success
of the intervention. The first activity was conducting an audit of available reading books in the DBE
system, as well as reading programmes being broadcast on the radio. This audit was to then lead to
the procurement, printing and delivery of 230 000 books storybooks to 650 schools. Additionally, book
bags were to be created and delivered to 4 600 teachers. Guides were then to be developed and
distributed to 65 000 parents and caregivers on how to assist children with reading and homework at
home through the training and coaching sessions provided by the L&M workstream. This was to be
supplemented by the development and promotion of 24 reading episode aligned to the storybooks for
radio broadcast. These were intended to reach 292 500 learners, 4 600 teachers, 650 principals and
SMT members and 3 250 parents and caregivers (UNICEF & NECT, 2022).
It is important to understand that these activities were specifically designed to incorporate gender and
equity considerations within their respective workstreams. The procurement and delivery of books to
schools was intended to be equity sensitive through the procurement of braille books for special
schools, which did not materialize due to resource-related shortcoming (I316). Additionally, the
programme had sought to ensure that, within the package of materials to be produced, there would be
books that dealt with gender equity, human rights etc. This was however also not successful due to the
dire lack of variety of books leading to the limitation of what can be selected as part of the materials
(I318).
The inability to follow through on these gender and equity related intentions highlights the overall
programme risks and assumptions that have come into effect. One of the assumptions that appears not
to have held true is that of the target audience’s ability to engage with the produced resources,
particularly the reading radio programmes and the parent/caregiver guidelines. Although the evaluation
had very limited data on how the radio programmes were received, the school staff and caregivers in
the case study schools tended to argue that modern day context favours television more than radio,
with a small percentage of people actively listening to radio episodes. In relation to the parent/caregiver
guides, there was an assumption that parents have the ability and are willing to assist their children with
homework and reading at home, when in fact, many of the learners in the targeted schools either live
with illiterate elderly caregivers or have parents that work extremely long hours and therefore have no
time to help with homework, while some have no caregivers at home altogether. The final set of
assumptions that were challenged in implementation was related to the availability of reading books in
the DBE system, the time taken to procure books as well as whether or not people want to read for
pleasure.
In addition to the abovementioned assumptions, two risks were identified, namely the risk of limited
reading materials being available for certain African languages, as well as limited feedback from radio
stations (see Inception Report B). Both these risks manifested in the programme and caused delays in
implementation. The first risk held true with the audit showing that there is a lack of published books in
the African literature. This led to more books needing to be procured, taking longer than what the
programme had planned for in relation to the sourcing of books. In relation to the radio programmes, all
49
24 radio episodes were developed, with multiple being broadcasted already. While this had been done,
what had not been built into the budget was a financial incentive for a radio station to broadcast episodes
- thus additional budget was made available (I317). This process ended up consuming a lot of time and
financial resources. The assumption of the radio episodes further raising the awareness of parents and
children to the available reading resources is also likely19 to have not held as the evaluation findings
revealed that a small number of households actively listen to the radio, if they own one at all.
Because the implementation process was interrupted by these encountered risks, the probability of the
workstream achieving its intended outcomes has been negatively impacted. Due to the pressing nature
of the programme outlined in section 2.2, the disruptions in programme execution had negative
consequences, as they prevented the timely addressing of the immediate impact of COVID-19 on
students. This also applies to the distribution of books, which programme coordinators indicated in
interviews they had envisioned as accessible to children while they were at home during the pandemic,
and for continued use immediately after its conclusion (UNICEF, 2021). The delay in book distribution
resulted in the unfulfillment of this vision, as the reading books were only delivered in November of
2022. By this time schools had re-opened, meaning that the most pressing need to support children’s
continued reading stimulation at home had passed. Nevertheless, some schools were still rotating
school attendance, and the possibility of needing to lock down again persisted into the second half of
2022.
The biggest factor contributing to this delay is that in most instances the training delivered through PSA
and reading materials were not received in close succession to each other. The training materials and
sessions were either received well before the books arrived, or vice versa. This was reflected on during
the evaluation fieldwork visits, where teachers in some schools noted that they did not make use of the
materials received because they were still waiting for training and proper information on them in order
to use them adequately (CS100). Reports from PSA also noted instances of schools not making
adequate use of received resources – for example, by not allowing learners to take the books home or
by keeping the books in inaccessible locations – which has potential to be due to the schools not
receiving adequate training, if they had received it at all. These findings suggest that the training was a
relevant enabler to the adequate use of the received reading resources.
While the abovementioned successes and challenges give a sense of the likely benefits derived from
the workstream, it is still difficult to adequately determine the overall use of the books, with (I317) noting
that “we can never make a link between what this workstream has done and achievements that children
might realise in a classroom”.
This does not negate the fact that where books have been received, they have been reflected on as
being relevant and appropriate in terms of reading level, grade and language. The shortages in certain
African languages again negatively impacted the appropriate apportionment of books to schools, as the
number of copies provided varied from school to school, with (NECT, n.d.) stating that “the number of
copies received in the schools surveyed ranged from 5 copies in one school to 222 copies in another
school.” This has not affected the use of the received books in schools as at least 50% of the schools
that has received the books per province reported to be using the books (Mbhalati, 2023). During
feedback and monitoring, teachers have emphasized the use of the books at school and to a much
lesser extent at home, which goes against the design of the project. In some schools they are still being
kept in places where they are only accessible by teachers and not easily by pupils (Mbhalati, 2023). At
least 38% of the schools visited by NECT during a storybook reach survey stored/kept the books where
the books were not easily accessible by learners – i.e. storeroom/containers/offices (NECT, n.d.).
Where books are kept affects present and future use of the books. Very few teachers are encouraging
the movement of the books between school and home. Teachers that encourage learners to take the
19 This can be confirmed by the listenership report from SABC once it is available.
50
books home are doing so at least once or more in a week (Mbhalati, 2023). However, this monitoring
data was based on a small sample of schools.
24 radio episodes related to the delivered books have been developed and are still in the process of
being broadcasted. It is unclear the extent to which the radio episodes are being listened to as a
listenership report has not yet been received from the SABC.
The planned activities were implemented, albeit not all to completion. Storybook and radio audit
templates were designed and distributed to “27 community radio stations, 25 NGOs and 20 publishers”
(NECT, 2021b). The audit of storybooks and radio programmes was then conducted, producing lists by
language and level for each. This informed the selection of 900 storybook titles to be procured and
delivered to schools by January 2022 (NECT, 2021b). Although UNICEF was in charge of procurement,
NGOs and NECT also contributed towards the REALS SA reading materials, with each organization
contributing various portions in the different provinces as depicted in the table below:

The majority of the books were received from publishers, across all the provinces and languages20.
Given the analysed budget information, it is assumed that books were largely bought from publishers
due to the high allocation for procuring resources. As part of monitoring the reach and utilization rate of
the distributed materials, NECT conducted a snapshot survey across 53 schools in total to collect data
on the received materials (NECT, n.d.). At least 89% of the 53 surveyed schools had received books
from the workstream. It is further noted that 64% of school principals have completed the Learning for
Results outcomes, with 60-80% of schools reporting that resources are being used in class, taken home
and tracked through the use of loan sheets. It is reported that each school got 50 books in 6 different
levels (50 books in level 121, 50 books in level 2 etc), however data collected through the evaluation did
not manage to corroborate this. As mentioned in the relevance section above, there were large levels
of variance in the number of books delivered to schools, ranging between 5 to 222 copies; furthermore,
information collected from evaluation case study schools shows further variance in number of books
received.
Due to the low number of books in grades 5 and 6, a decision was taken to procure and deliver books
for grades 1 to 4 to all 650 schools in January 2022 (NECT, 2021b). A total of 170 000 out of230 000
(74%) story books for grades 1 to 4 have been distributed to 650 schools in the three provinces. In
addition to this, draft teacher and SMT guidelines for managing and utilizing storybooks were developed
and distributed during the training sessions through the Leadership and Management workstream,
which, as discussed earlier, sometimes occurred considerably later after the materials have been
received. In total, two parent guidelines were produced and translated into seven different African
languages, as well as a set of teacher guidelines. At the time of writing, the latest data available to the

21 Please note that ‘levels’ are not school grades; they are instead the levels of reading for learners within a grade. Each grade
therefore has books for reading levels 1 - 6, with 1 being for the weaker readers and 6 being for those that are reading ahead of
their grade. I will put this clarification in a footnote

evaluation indicates that all 36 000 foundation phase anthologies are still in the process of being
procured and yet to be distributed.
The SMT survey conducted as part of the evaluation gathered inputs from respondents on whether or
not they have received reading books as part of the REALS SA programme. Figure 11 below depicts
the received responses disaggregated by the various school quintiles:

Apart from the quintile 4 respondents, all respondent schools have largely received storybooks as part
of the programme. In addition to these responses, the evaluation team sought to observe the presence
of the books in the sample schools visited as part of the evaluation process. Table 14 below presents
the data, which is related to reading recovery specific training sessions, the reception of reading
materials and their respective languages, as well as levels of awareness to the radio programmes that
have been developed:

As the table shows, all six schools were aware of the reading recovery workstream, and had either
received training, books or both training and books as part of the reading recovery workstream.
Quantities of books received did indeed vary across the schools, however, it was not clear as to how
the quantities had been determined for each grade and/or level. Teachers particularly noted requests
for additional copies of books as they struggle with sharing what they currently have with their learners
accordingly.
As mentioned in the L&M workstream findings, principals were to be trained and coached on Leading
for Reading, which was directly related to the management of the reading resources received though
the reading recovery workstream. The training and coaching aimed to reach 650 school principals, and
Subject Advisors were to be given guidance on how teachers may support reading in the classroom,
but there was no intention to train teachers on this directly. Teachers were instead to receive guidelines
on how to use the materials received. In light of this, all interviewed teachers expressed a need for
direct training to supplement the received guidelines, with other evaluation participants sharing the
same sentiments.
Overall, the reading recovery workstream has made notable progress in identifying the literature-related
gaps in primary schools through the storybook audit and using these results to procure outstanding
materials. This procurement process was however a lengthy one given the limited implementation
period of the programme, which may have been a potential contributor towards the delivery of uneven
numbers of books as opposed to what had been originally planned for. The workstream has also
managed to produce the complete set of planned radio episodes, although the broadcasting of these
became an expense that was unexpectedly borne by the programme as well. Financial and time-related
constraints therefore had an observable impact on the effective implementation of the reading recovery
workstream.

Based on the evaluation results regarding perceived sustainability, schools that have received books
and training are likely to experience long-term effects. The received materials will remain in the schools
and serve as educational resources for learners, while teachers will continue to use these resources
effectively, and their potential could be further enhanced by receiving training on the guides and reading
materials provided. Additionally, merging a programme such as Reading Recovery with other related
initiatives that share the same objective would be beneficial in combining available resources to achieve
the goal.
Summary
In summary, the evaluation has found that the conceptualization and implementation of the reading
recovery workstream was relevant to the recovering reading and losses and increasing access to
reading resources. The workstream was underpinned by a logic and ToC that had a shared
understanding of intent amongst stakeholders and role-players, however this did not always filter
through to teachers (i.e. teachers understanding how to use the resources and what the overall goal
is). The shared understating of the programme stakeholders and role-players fed into the conducting of
the storybook and radio audits respectively, procurement of outstanding storybooks as well as creation
of guidelines for school and community members on how to make optimal use of received resources
5 CONCLUSIONS
This section of the report presents the evaluation’s conclusions on the REALS SA programme design
and implementation, based on the findings presented in the preceding section 4. It offers a concluding
judgement on each of the evaluation criteria – relevance, sustainability, effectiveness and efficiency –
and in so doing, responds to the evaluation questions.
In terms of relevance, the REALS SA programme benefited from being collectively managed by the
DBE, UNICEF and the NECT. Leveraging each institution’s strengths and positioning, the programme
was able to work directly within and through the education system, drawing on the experience of similar
work in the South African context, with international funding and expertise. The programme had a logic
strong enough to translate into a coherent ToC through a co-creation process with programme
stakeholders and role-players.
There was room for this design to be strengthened as there were various assumptions that did not hold
true, the most glaring one being the time that it would take to implement the programme. All those
involved in the programme largely held a shared understanding of the intention of the programme, with
the exception of provincial leaders in one province requiring more clarity on the purpose of the
54
programme before uptake of the Leadership and Management workstream. Programme
implementation mainly took place through various training and coaching sessions, as well as through
the development of materials. Although some workstreams had intended to differentiate their materials
to be sensitive to gender and equity considerations, the recovery curriculum workstream is the only one
that explicitly managed to do so by developing a framework applicable to both mainstream and special
schools. This may be partly attributed to the limited emphasis and implicit way in which gender and
equity considerations were articulated in the programme design. Given these factors, the evaluation
concludes that the design of the REALS SA programme was relevant and appropriate given the role
players and context, except in that it underestimated some risks which placed implementation under
pressure.
In terms of effectiveness, the majority of planned activities were successfully implemented, although
time constraints impacted completion rates. Most targeted participants were reached, with a few
remaining activities that could potentially reach more participants. Where data was available, the
training and coaching sessions, as well as the produced materials, have been described as relevant
and useful by the recipients. However, the programme did not explicitly consider gender and equity
elements, which could have improved its effectiveness. The evaluation was unable to determine the
extent of medium- and longer-term changes in outcomes. There have been early reports of the training
content filtering into daily practices, such as the use of reading resources or school management,
although the SMT survey also suggested that it is not always easy to apply leadership training (albeit
relevant and easy-to-understand) in a school environment. The effectiveness of the “train the trainer”
design is uncertain, with an enthusiastic response by those trained, but limited evidence of the
education system’s ability to facilitate the necessary next layer of implementation, notably for the AfL
workstream. Further and consistent monitoring of the training recipients is necessary to observe the
extent of changes.
In evaluating the efficiency of the programme, it is notable that while there were some successes,
there were several challenges that impacted on the quality of programme delivery and allocation of
budget for planned activities. The no-cost extension provided some relief, enabling service providers to
complete some planned activities that were affected by the delays in implementation. Implementation
delays were mainly attributable to contextual factors such as floods, a lack of technological support in
some provinces, delays and unavailability of officials, and difficulties in securing approval for dates and
venues. These limitations led to sessions being rescheduled and additional funding being required, with
insufficient initial budgeting for streaming reading programmes in radio stations and limited reading
materials contributing to further budget shortfalls. It also appears that there was inadequate resourcing
of a central monitoring function. Despite these challenges, the programme was efficient in delivering
some of its activities and relevant outputs, with the use of service providers allowing NECT to deliver
on key activities without being overburdened.
Finally, this evaluation sought to judge sustainability by determining the extent to which the net
benefits from the programme are likely to continue. Materials that have been developed through the
workstreams such as the QAF, the reading resource audit and the training modules for school
principals, are likely to remain available for use and/or adaptation in the education system post-REALS
SA implementation. The REALS SA programme therefore has strong potential for sustainability, in that
most of the expenditure has gone into materials that can be expected to remain within the system for
re-use and/or adaptation. It remains unclear, however, to what extent there is an intention on the part
of national or provincial departments to do so. As for the likelihood of sustained benefits from capacity
building and training, the evidence is more uneven across workstreams. A later section makes
recommendations for an exit and sustainability plan to strengthen this.
6 LESSONS LEARNED
55
The REALS SA programme is in its concluding stages. The scope for the evaluation to inform course
correction or changes to implementation is therefore limited, with the recommendations (the following
section) focusing on ensuring full programme reach and arrangements for effective exit and handover.
Rather than giving rise to recommendations for action in relation to the REALS SA, at this stage many
of the evaluation insights are best applied as lessons for future programmes of a similar nature by the
participating organisations.
Collaboration across entities: It appears that the overall arrangements for collaboration between
UNICEF, DBE, NECT and the EU were effective and a similar arrangement may be considered in future.
Prioritisation of the programme: It is clear that although the REALS SA interventions are clearly in
line with departmental priorities, the DBE and provincial departments had competing priorities and/or
stretched capacity. This impacted their responsiveness, availability for monitoring/oversight as well as
(as far as the evaluation can ascertain) intergovernmental and intra-departmental communication about
the programme. This is despite advocacy sessions and inclusion of provincial representatives on
technical teams. Coming towards the end of the programme, the evaluation also flagged concerns about
the extent of commitment to taking the work further (in some workstreams more than in others.) Despite
this, it is clear that a programme of this nature must work with and through the department and not
external to it – the question is how to do so well. Given how fundamental this challenge was and the
limited insight that the evaluation yielded into it, it is included in the recommendations below as a topic
for further stakeholder reflection.
Co-designing workstreams: It appears that some of the logistical challenges and apparent competing
priorities of provincial and district officials, which undermined implementation, could have been resolved
through greater co-designing of the interventions with provincial departments. Provincial departments
may have given inputs to make the planned interventions more realistic for the context (e.g. the number
of sessions, mode of delivery) and this may also have increased their ownership and prioritisation of
the programme. An even stronger approach – but perhaps less feasible – would be to include
representatives of the target populations (subject advisors, teachers etc.).
Integrated vs. standalone workstreams: The REALS SA programme demonstrates that there are
benefits as well as disadvantages to conceiving of multiple workstreams as a single programme. There
may be institutional or resourcing factors that make this unavoidable, there are some economies of
scale for programme management and administration, and it may be easier to leverage natural
synergies between interventions. However, this is traded off against greater complexity in
communicating about the programme; and diluted governance, management and monitoring attention
across a wide set of activities and results (and concomitant risks and intricacies). Since this design
choice is likely to arise in many future programmes of this nature, the evaluation team recommends that
stakeholders jointly reflect further on this lesson to deepen their insight of what would work best under
what circumstances.
Train the trainer model: While a train-the-trainer model is attractive from a resource efficiency
perspective, the REALS SA experience suggests that there is significant risk in this approach. A longer
causal chain must be realised in order for programme implementation (training of the trainers) to change
outcomes. Wherever a train-the-trainer approach is taken, any doubt about the commitment/capacity
of the recipient institution or trainees to roll the training out further, introduces the risk of spent resources
having been wasted. Whereas there was scope within the Reading workstream to at least monitor (if
not directly support) SGB members’ sharing of their lessons with parents, the delays in implementation
of AfL subject advisor training means that very little time and resources remain to influence the extent
to which they convey their lessons to teachers. This does not mean that a train the trainer approach is
56
always ill advised, but that assumptions and risks must be particularly carefully articulated and tracked,
with sufficient space for adaptation.
Careful logistical planning: The evaluation clearly demonstrates that logistical realities – such as poor
road infrastructure, poorly mapped areas, and imperfect contact databases – must be factored into
planning for a programme that involves physical travel to schools, in order to set realistic time frames
and allocate sufficient resources.
Factors conducive to online engagement: From implementing both face to face and online training
sessions, the REALS SA programme can derive lessons about the conditions under which online
delivery can work or should rather be avoided. Of course, good connectivity is essential, and
loadshedding impacts on this. Where online training is undertaken, creative approaches will need to be
conceptualized to deal with power cuts and other factors related to online connectivity. These can
include hosting sessions after hours where trainees are in areas with better connectivity, or all trainees
clustering in one venue to avoid multiple connection issues (Performance Solutions Africa, 2022). Even
where connectivity is conducive, participants’ age profiles and digital confidence are also factors, but
PSA (in a 2023 progress report) suggested that the relationship between the school and the broader
programme / implementers (such as REALS SA), and support from district officials matter too. The
general health and performance of the institution (in this case, schools) may influence the quality of
engagement with online training too – in this case, the observation was in relation to schools, but it may
also help to explain variations in engagement among subject advisors and circuit managers from
different areas. It appears reasonable, when several of these factors are unconducive, not to opt for
online training.
Adequate investment in monitoring. The REALS SA programme’s decision to rely mainly on progress
reporting to oversight structures as a form of monitoring, was disadvantageous in a number of ways.
Implementation partners reported on progress in distinct workstreams, but the lack of a central
monitoring and data management function obscured the extent to which workstreams were “coming
together” on the ground as intended. It also undermined the quality and clarity of data available for the
evaluation and will hamper attempts to follow up with district and school based stakeholders, or refer
back to programme information in future. Programmes of this nature warrant investment in a sound
monitoring system and allocation of human resources to implement it consistently. The question of
relying on DBE’s and PDEs’ own databases vs. developing programme-specific databases, is part of
the recommendations for further reflection in the next section.
Gender and equity considerations: Two lessons emerge from the evaluation findings in this regard.
The first is implementation related: The REALS SA programme aimed to include special schools in its
pilot programme along with mainstream schools but did not have an explicitly differentiated approach
in implementation. This proved to be a disadvantage in special schools where the mainstream materials
were not as useful without other additional considerations such as books in braille for visually impaired
learners, for example. Arguably, some resources could have been better spent had this been factored
in during planning. It is therefore imperative to note that where a programme aims to serve participants
in different contexts, deliberate attention should be given to what an inclusive approach will require, for
each of the main interventions (e.g. workstreams).
The second lesson pertains to the content of materials and training. In addition to considering the
practicalities of implementation in diverse environments, gender and equity considerations need to be
made more explicit and purpose-oriented within the programme design so that it builds participants’
capacity to promote a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Such a focus could enhance
programme effectiveness through gender-sensitive teaching practices and learning materials that
increase awareness about gender biases and stereotypes. A focus on gender and equity considerations
can help to identify, and remove, barriers to education, such as poverty, racial and/or cultural norms, or
gender-based violence. It can help ensure that all students have access to quality education and the
57
support they need to perform and succeed academically; promote diversity and inclusion in the
classroom where students learn from and appreciate different perspectives and experiences; and
support a positive impact on society.
Radio programmes: Although the evaluation’s evidence was very limited, it appears that radio
programmes are not necessarily a high-impact intervention to reach parents in the South African
context. Forthcoming listenership reports must help to confirm or disprove this. It is possible that
distribution of audio content via multiple means (radio plus a mobile platform for instance) can
strengthen audio recordings. Lessons can also be learned from similar programmes.
7 RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1 Recommendations for an exit and sustainability
plan
It is recommended that the REALS SA exit and sustainability plan address three major objectives:
1. Strengthen data about what was achieved and who was reached.
The sample-based approach to both the Reading Recovery monitoring exercise and the evaluation
school case studies, suggested that a comprehensive follow-up with all 650 schools is needed
and/or consolidation of workstreams’ monitoring data by school. This is needed to confirm which
interventions were received and to what extent (e.g. number of books - “dosage” in monitoring and
evaluation terminology). Similar enumeration is needed in relation to subject advisor and circuit
manager training, distinguishing between individuals who benefited from the full set of sessions and
those who benefited from most, or few, sessions.
In the process, contact databases should be strengthened. A consolidated repository of programme
documentation should also be developed and stored, in line with knowledge management policies
of the governing entities.
2. Informed by the above, and prioritising as needed, “mop up” and/or respond to gaps in
implementation. The evaluation findings suggest that this will require distribution of materials in
several instances.
The above two objectives must be addressed in order for UNICEF and partners to manage
reputation risk (where expectations were not met) and to substantiate the claim as to the
number of schools and others reached with the full programme. It would also be a prerequisite
to any future attempts to track outcomes (see later recommendation).
3. For each workstream, work with DBE and PDEs to develop and secure endorsement of the
way forward.
At national level, partners should work with DBE to develop a plan indicating how it intends to use
the materials and other assets going forward. Building on lessons, it may be best to write separate
plans for each of the four workstreams to facilitate close engagement and endorsement by different
units and senior managers within DBE.
58
PDEs should be part of this planning. At PDE level, this may take the form of the technical team
members (including UNICEF, DBE and NECT, the implementation partners and the PDE officials)
returning to those who participated in advocacy sessions, to discuss achievements and agree on
how best to ensure sustained benefit, use, and where appropriate, further rollout.
Ideally both DBE and PDEs can demonstrate integration of this into their next draft Strategic Plans
(2024-2029), Annual Performance Plans and budgets for the upcoming MTEF. However, the
emphasis should be on the strategic discussion and ownership of the way forward, regardless of
mechanisms for operationalising this intent.
7.2 General recommendations for the REALS SA
programme and partners
In addition to the above exit planning recommendations, the following recommendations are made.
A. The EU, UNICEF, DBE and NECT should explore opportunities to build on the foundation
of good collaboration that has been laid through the REALS SA programme.
B. UNICEF should allocate (or ensure the allocation of) additional resources to mitigating
the clearest threats to programme effectiveness. In addition to ensuring full rollout of
interventions, the evaluation has highlighted risk in relation to the rollout of Assessment for
Learning training from subject advisors to teachers. However it was also reported that AfL
training is proceeding in other provinces, which may present opportunities in this regard.
C. UNICEF, DBE and NECT should assess the realisation of outcomes, whether in the form
of a fully-fledged outcome evaluation or not. This would be based on an assumption of
implementation fidelity (hence the dependence on addressing implementation gaps as part of
exit). This can incorporate the forthcoming datasets from implementation partners (respondent
feedback from the AfL workstream; and the endline study on school governance and
management from PSA). Even with limited resources, if it is not feasible to use a methodology
that would allow for estimation of impact across the entire programme population(s),
considerable insight can be gained into what has worked under different conditions by taking a
qualitative and potentially case study-based approach, focusing on the workstreams or
population(s) of greatest interest.
D. The EU, UNICEF, DBE and NECT should embark on a process of deeper learning /
investigation on some of the key programme issues. Based on the evaluation, the following
are recommended.
o How to approach multi-workstream programmes – whether and to what extent to
integrate them into a single programme, and how to mitigate disadvantages of the
approach chosen.
o Gender & equity. Clearly more deliberate consideration of this would have assisted.
But more reflection is required to come up with actionable means of doing this in future.
o Working with and through the education system – How to leverage DBE’s and
PDEs’ strengths but mitigate the risks that come with their internal weaknesses and
challenges. Practically speaking, how can one manage shortcomings in
communication, coordination and stakeholder management?
o Online delivery – what may be incorporated into a “readiness assessment” to inform
the choice of online delivery of interventions such as these? And during
59
implementation, how might risks and assumptions be effectively monitored to ensure a
prompt response to problems?

9.5 Equity Analysis Framework
REALS SA EVALUATION: EQUITY ANALYSIS
GUIDELINE
18 May 2022
Purpose
The Equity Analysis Guideline is intended to provide an equity-focused lens to the evaluation questions,
but in the main, to analyse the evaluation findings of the Reading and Leadership Strengthening in
South African Schools for Learning during COVID-19 and Beyond (REALS SA) Programme. The
Guideline begins with a definition of What is Equity and thereafter proposes criteria for equity
considerations in the planning and implementation of the evaluation and arriving at findings. The criteria
will be used by the evaluation team to guide and inform their data collection from an equity perspective.
Through this, the team will be able to evaluate the extent to which equity considerations have been
mainstreamed in the planning and implementation of REALS SA (reference: key evaluation question j).
What is Equity?
“Equity means that all children have an opportunity to survive, develop, and reach their full potential,
without discrimination, bias or favouritism.”22
Equity is understood as the goal towards eliminating the unfair and avoidable circumstances that
deprive and prevent access to the realisation of rights regardless of gender, race, religious beliefs,
income, physical attributes, geographical location, environment, and/or other related and
relevant status. Programmes and projects with an equity focus aim to prioritise less fortunate,
underprivileged, and systematically disadvantaged groups.
This document will guide the evaluation to appraise and judge the extent to which the Programme has
factored in achieving equitable results.
Equity-focused criteria
The proposed equity-focused criteria consider gender, human rights (access, race, religious beliefs),
and social inclusion (income, physical attributes, geographical location) and the environment. For the
purposes of the evaluation, the equity criteria are categorised in these four broad categories.
The table below proposes a rating scale with 4 levels for assessing the equity criteria, these are:
1. Equity-blind: Ignoring the relevance of equity dimensions; failure to recognise the existing
differences in gender, human rights-related attributes or that related to aspects of social
inclusion and the environment.
2. Equity-neutral: There is no apparent association to the inclusion or exclusion of gender,
human rights, social inclusion, or environmental dimensions.
3. Equity-sensitive: There is evidence of equity dimensions having been considered in the
Programme planning and design to implementation.
4. Equity-positive: The focus is on Programme outcomes with a clear focus on the inclusion of
equity dimensions that seed (and may realise) transformative change.
For each criterion a rating ranging from “Equity-blind” (colour coded RED) to “Equity-positive” (colour
coded GREEN) will be applied.
The equity-focused criteria provide clear points of reference in relation to the extent to which equity
considerations have been included in the design and implementation of the REALS SA Programme.

INFORMATION STATEMENT AND INFORMED
CONSENT: READING AND LEADERSHIP
STRENGTHENING IN SOUTH AFRICAN
SCHOOLS (REALS SA) EVALUATION
Information Statement for focus group and interview
participants
Please keep this statement for your records
Introduction
Palmer Development Group (PDG) has been appointed by UNICEF to conduct an evaluation
on the REALS-SA programme. The following information is provided to inform you of the
evaluation research. Your participation is completely voluntary, and you are free to withdraw
from the interview at any time, without providing any reasons.
Purpose of the study
To evaluate the REALS SA programme design and implementation in the Eastern Cape,
KwaZulu Natal, and Limpopo. The focus is to understand whether the programme was
designed and partially implemented in a way that is meaningful to achieve the intended
outcomes. The results of the evaluation will be used to identify what is working well and what
can be improved.
Procedures
As part of this study, programme stakeholders such as DBE officials, programme
implementers, subject advisors and circuit managers will be interviewed to give their views
on the programme. Parents and SGB members will participate in focus groups and teachers
will be interviewed to share their experiences of the programme. A virtual survey of senior
management teams will also be conducted. Your participation will help the programme
partners to understand whether the project is on track to meet its goals, and to improve results
going forward.
All interviews and focus groups will be recorded for reference purposes. Where quotes are
used, PDG takes reasonable care to anonymise respondents within the context of the study.
No quotes or responses will be attributed to individuals.
Participants in focus groups are requested to keep the discussion confidential, i.e. not to share
what was discussed with anyone who was not present.
Benefits
The information that participants share in surveys, interviews and focus groups will inform the evaluation
of the REALS SA programme in Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal and Limpopo. This will contribute to
82
identifying lessons and making recommendations for improvement going forward. Ultimately this is
expected to contribute to help learners recover from the learning losses experienced from the impact
of COVID-19 and improve learner outcomes. There are no direct personal benefits to your participation.
Questions about participation
Should you have any questions regarding participation in the interview, please contact Ms
Cara Hartley (PDG), or Dr Stephen Taylor (Department of Education).
