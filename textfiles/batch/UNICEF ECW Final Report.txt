EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview
i. The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Seed Fund program1 is an initial investment under the Multi Year
Resilience Program Plan (MYRP). The MYRP aims to (re)engage children aged 3 to 17 in learning by
providing equitable access to safe and inclusive learning spaces where children can acquire the
foundational, socio-emotional, life and, where relevant, vocational skills necessary to continue their
education and be prepared for adult life. The ECW was implemented over a three-year and six-month period
(January 2020 -September 2023). It addresses specific critical interventions that build on lessons learned
and achievements from previous ECW investments in Syria which ended in September 2019.2 UNICEF is
the lead grant holder of the ECW program. The programme is jointly managed by a Programme
Management Unit (PMU) composed of two grantees, UNICEF and the second grantee. Activities are
implemented directly as well as through contracted service providers and partners.
ii. The ECW program supported education programming in formal non-accredited education or non-formal
education (NFE) settings. UNICEF is implementing the ECW in seven governorates, namely: Idleb, Aleppo,
Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor, Hama, and Homs. The reach includes 80,558 directly supported children
(40,109 girls) and 5,126 intermediate supported children (2,266 girls). This represents slightly over 100 per
cent of the cumulative target.3 Of these, UNICEF has reached 69,453 (34,668 girls) (as of August 2022).
iii. These activities seek to respond to the urgent educational needs of children in Syria, where approximately 2
million children in Syria (40 per cent girls) are out of school, and an additional 1.5 million are at risk of
dropping out.4 Child labor remains a key reason for children being out-of-school in all regions in Syria, with
nearly 48 per cent of children not attending school due to child labour/work to support the household. Early
and forced marriages have increased across Syria, compounding barriers to accessing education and
detracting from achievement of SDG5 (Gender Equality).5 The fragmented educational system poses
particular challenges for internally displaced persons (IDPs) to smoothly transfer or integrate into the
education systems which vary by area.
iv. Program activities are organized around four outcomes with related activities. First, the program seeks to
equitably respond to the educational needs of girls and boys (Outcome 1) through light rehabilitation of
learning spaces to make them safer and more accessible, providing transportation and equipping learning
spaces with adequate learning and teaching supplies. At the same time, the program sought to improve
teacher capacity to deliver foundation, socio-emotional and life skills (Outcome 2) through training and
financial support combined with establishing referral pathways to specialised protection services. UNICEF
temporarily paused ECW activities following devastating earthquakes that hit Syria and Turkey in February
2023 with a subsequent reprioritization of responses.
v. The program also sought to support more equitable learning opportunities for the education sector in Syria
more broadly (Outcome 3) with UNICEF responsible for the development of a summative or placement
assessment tool. Activities have been delayed as the PMU sought to meet the immediate needs of rights
holders over support to education sector members. Outcome 4-resource mobilization, aimed to encourage
the continuation of funding from traditional and non-traditional donors, including the private sector, to
support the bridging of the funding gap. Activities under this outcome have also been delayed.
vi. The main purpose of this Final Evaluation (FE) is to support the PMU of UNICEF, partners and donors in
evaluating the results achieved; helping to identify gaps and key bottlenecks; and assessing the extent to
which the implementation of the ECW Program in the Whole of Syria has been equitable and inclusive.6

Furthermore, the evaluation intends to assess whether it has been implemented in an efficient, effective,
and well-coordinated manner.
vii. The objective of this FE is to provide accountability to donors and rights holders,
28 FGDs (182
including IDPs and host communities, with respect to whether activities, through the
participants, 51
implementation of the ECW program, are fit for purpose in response to the education per cent
girls/women)
needs of Syrian children, adolescent girls and boys. While there was no dedicated
objective of assessing the contribution to human rights and gender equality, this has
been mainstreamed within the aforementioned objectives with cross-cutting issues
23 KIIs with duty
explored as a standalone evaluation criterion. The evaluation is timely for UNICEF and bearers
the donor, the primary intended users, to use findings to inform learning for designing
and implementing the next phase of the ECW program.
viii. This evaluation applied a mixed-methods approach that was participatory, inclusive and
35 observations
respondent-group sensitive. Primary data was collected in both government controlled
areas (GCA) and non-government controlled areas (NGCA) with data collection taking
place between February and June 2023. Data collection involved a thorough desk
50 teacher
review in combination of remote and face to face methods including key informant surveys (42 per
interviews (KIIs), focus-group discussions (FGDs), quantitative surveys, and classroom cent women)382
student surveys
and facility observations. Following the earthquakes, UNICEF requested a contract (55 per cent girls)
extension to conduct a post-earthquake assessment including a light desk review and
direct observations.
Post-earthquake
ix. Evaluation findings were derived from analysis of a wide range of primary and assessment
secondary data sources for triangulation to reduce potential bias and strengthen
credibility of findings. The evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation
Group (UNEG) ethical standards for evaluation. The ET referred to relevant guidance to ensure appropriate
data collection protocols were in place to protect child participants.7 Findings were consistently
disaggregated by gender.
x. Key findings and Conclusions
xi. Key findings and conclusions (in bold) are presented below, organized by evaluation criteria.
xii. Program activities were relevant to the educational and psycho-social support (PSS) needs of children in
program areas as well as emerging needs. UNICEF and partners took several steps to ensure program
relevance including seeking feedback from rightsholders, assessing learning outcomes and adapting
programming to shifts in the operating context. However, the fact that the program did not dedicate a
specific component for children with disabilities (CwDs) in its initial design meant that the responsiveness
of the program to the needs of CwDs has not been prioritized nor systematic. The limited involvement of
rightsholders -particularly those who are most vulnerable such as CwDs, IDPs and caregivers representing
them – during decisions on what activities to implement in the design phase (proposals) was a limiting
factor in ensuring relevance.
xiii. Following the earthquakes, UNICEF took swift action in prioritising responses for the most urgent needs to
support the safe re-opening of schools. This included the identification of the need to provide for children
and teachers with psychosocial support and health and safety awareness. UNICEF’s rapid post-earthquakes
response was relevant given the damage to physical infrastructure as a result of the earthquakes, as
reported in the SitReps and confirmed through school observations.
xiv. The program as it was designed is coherent with other humanitarian responses and clusters though
implementation is not always standardized beyond meeting minimum standards. Harmonisation requests
need to be assessed in light of the operational context. Standardisation of implementation depends heavily
on the different realities on the ground and the operational context in general, which vary greatly from one
7 UNICEF’s pre-existing ‘Strategic Guidance Note on Institutionalizing Ethical Practice for UNICEF Research,’ and the ‘Evaluation
Technical Note No. 1, Children Participating in Research, Monitoring and Evaluation’ to ensure ethical safeguards were respected
concerning data collection with children. Data collection took place in compliance with UNICEF and Child Watch International
Research Network (et al)’s ‘Ethical Research Involving Children’ – specifically in the areas of ‘Harms and Benefits’
area to the next. Therefore, aligned implementation is only possible to a degree and should focus on setting
minimum standards rather than full alignment across all contexts.
xv. Donor funding interests are not wholly consistent with needs in the supported areas, especially regarding
early child development (ECD) and secondary education and vocational learning opportunities. The
Education Response Snapshot issues by the Whole of Syria Cluster called for support for community based
ECD and opportunities for adolescents, both of which are currently absent from the ECW. According to
interviewed staff, the primary reasons cited were the lack of donor appetite to fund these activities and the
absence of ECD and secondary NFE curriculum. It was also highlighted that donor requirements and
parameters can at times limit the interventions UNICEF can provide.
xvi. The program has been effective in extending learning opportunities and improving learning outcomes for
affected populations meeting or surpassing most program output and outcome targets. Overachievement
in student participation and learning outcomes is a positive indication of the ECW program effectiveness.
However, differences in inclusion and learning outcomes shows that vulnerable populations, particularly
CwDs, have not been as effectively supported. Despite systematic investigation throughout primary and
secondary data collection, no unintended effects were identified.
xvii. Teachers are largely positive about the effectiveness of training and learning circles in improving teaching
and PSS capacities. Positive changes in teaching strategies can be observed and are appreciated by
students despite teaching practices remaining largely teacher centred as opposed to more active learning
strategies that involve higher order thinking skills. Stipends provided to teachers, although greatly valued,
were reported to not be adequate to meet teachers needs and approximately a third of surveyed teachers
reporting delays in payment delivery. Many teachers interviewed mentioned that they would leave their
current jobs if they found other opportunities with higher salaries, even if they were not in their fields.
Space and materials to implement interactive teaching methods remain a primary challenge reported by
teachers.
xviii. Protection form Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and child protection mechanisms were in place, as
were referral mechanisms used to refer children in need of specialized care. However, it is not clear from
monitoring data to what extent they were followed. Findings from the teacher survey show gaps in PSS
training, referrals for students as well as in teacher capacity to identify PSS systems. Teachers used non-
violent methods to manage classroom behaviour, with a few exceptions of corporal punishment. In
contrast, children frequently reported parents’ use of corporal punishment.
xix. While most activities were cancelled or delayed under Outcome 4: resource mobilization, a major
achievement was the October 2023 meeting as it brought the donors together to discuss key challenges to
implementation. This advocacy effort aimed at improving and/or clarifying the current red lines to enable
better alignment of program activities with financial restrictions on use of funds for the renewal program.
The meeting also facilitated coordination among donors.
xx. Most outcomes and outputs targets were achieved indicating efficient use of resources despite internal and
external factors affecting implementation. UNICEF’s establishment of standards and mechanisms, their
flexibility in responding to changing context, and the establishment of feedback and complaints
mechanisms and third-party monitoring (TPM) helped ensure compliance, accountability and efficiency.
However, implementation varied across learning centres and very few accountability mechanisms were
observed or reported to be sufficiently inclusive.
xxi. As cluster lead/co-lead for the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Nutrition and Education clusters,
UNICEF was at the forefront of ensuring that assessments were rapidly undertaken to assess damage to
learning facilities following the earthquake and ensuring that facilities would be safe for children to return.
UNICEF worked collaboratively with partners to rapidly identify the impacts of the earthquakes on the ECW
program and responded in a timely manner to address a range of needs which ensured minimal disruption
to continued learning.
xxii. The program showed attention to cross-cutting issues, involving a broad range of persons with acute
humanitarian and education needs. Boys and girls were reached equitably. Inclusion of IDPs (63 per cent of
rightsholders) demonstrates the program’s success in including marginalised groups. Currently, referral
services are providing an essential link for CwDs to access more specialized services; it is anticipated that
the eventual roll out of the capacity building plan would address current inconsistencies in identification and
response.
xxiii. It was challenging to ensure equitable learning outcomes, particularly during COVID-19 and for CwDs
requiring more specialized support. Stakeholders identified needs for additional and/or adapted learning
materials (such as access to devices and internet), trainings and transportation support to reach these
populations more effectively.
xxiv. Coordination between UNICEF and the second grantee, between ECW partners and UNICEF, and between
ECW partners and other organizations working in the Education sector was generally smooth and worked
well. However, confidentiality concerns and sensitivity of the context created challenges in coordination
between partners within and beyond each hub. Interviewed implementing partners (IPs) expressed a need
for more participatory opportunities to share experiences and lessons learned between each other that go
beyond current practices of dissemination of best practices and guidance.
xxv. The intervention coverage focused on the most severely affected locations and vulnerable groups based on
robust needs assessments and consultations with local (education) authorities. Continuous and thorough
service mapping throughout the intervention ensures there is no duplication of education services and
allows for wider geographical coverage. By design, the program does not target ECD nor secondary level
education and does not include a specific intervention for CwDs, despite substantial needs in the country.
The transition to a closed selection was reported to improve efficiency and quality of capacitated partners.
xxvi. Lessons learned
xxvii. The findings generated the following lessons learned which have wider applicability and relevance beyond
the ECW program:
Ensuring that all teachers are trained on interactive learning strategies and PSS and regularly
monitoring teachers to make sure they correctly implement student-centred and interactive
learning strategies is likely to improve student’s learning outcomes.
Ensuring that teachers receive stipends without delays is important to mitigate staff turnover
and support service continuity.
Raising awareness of parents/caregivers on how to manage their children’s behaviour without
the use of violence is crucial to better protecting children from harm.
High level advocacy has been effective in providing greater clarity around red lines and improving
donor engagement.
Enhancing Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) mechanisms so that they are more
inclusive is an important element to responding to the needs of participants, particularly those
most vulnerable.
Investing in accountability mechanisms and developing more detailed protocols to use during
emergencies is likely to have improved UNICEF’s capacity to deliver better outcomes in a more
equitable manner.
Adequate funding to support disability inclusive education is key to better addressing the needs
of CwDs.
Additional PSS support for rights holders is needed following unanticipated traumatic events,
such as large scale disasters.
Strengthening PSS support and referral mechanisms in coordination with child protection teams
of IPs is needed to better protect children.
Flexibility has been essential for addressing needs of the most vulnerable and adapting to
shifting priorities.
xxviii. Recommendations:
xxix. The following set of recommendations has been derived from the evaluation process following logically
from the findings, conclusions and lessons learned. Recommendations were validated through validation
workshops in consultation with UNICEF Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (MENARO), and
cross-border and Syria country offices.

1.2 Context of intervention
8. The education system in Syria has become increasingly fragmented over the past decade with multiple
overlapping systems in place which suffer from difficulties in recognition, certifications, and transfers due to the
nature of the authorities involved.15 The two main education systems in Syria are the formal and non-formal systems.
The formal education system includes the curriculum of the GoS and an accelerated version, called Curriculum B,16
12 In GCA, UNICEF had 5 partners through June 2022. After July 2022, five additional partners joined making the total of 10
partners by June 2023 (end of Year 3).
13 In NGCA, UNICEF had 3 partners as of June 2022.
14 Partner names have been removed at the request of UNICEF.

(GoT), which has some influence in north-west Syria, supports the delivery of the Syrian Interim Government
curriculum. Territories under the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria follow their own Kurdish curriculum
as well as the GoS curriculum in GoS controlled areas. Additionally, humanitarian actors in NFE centres throughout
Syria have adopted the Syria Self-Learning Program.17 Palestine refugees in Syria access schools (1st - 9th grade)
through the United Nations Works and Relief Agency (UNRWA). The Agency operates 102 schools, applying the GoS
curriculum, benefiting approximately 50,000 children across the country.18

exposed to grave protection violations including recruitment by armed groups and conflict-related deaths and injuries.
The worsening economic situation has heightened negative coping strategies including child marriage and child
labour. According to the WHO, one in ten people in Syria are expected to be living with a mild to moderate mental
health condition.20 A recent press release issued by UNICEF reported that mental health needs were particularly high
for children, with one third of Syrian children in 2021 showing signs of psychological distress including anxiety,
sadness, fatigue or frequent trouble sleeping.21
11. The protracted crisis has also taken a devastating toll on the country’s education sector. Major challenges
remain in achieving SDG4 (Quality Education).22 Prior to the conflict, the school attendance rate at the primary level
was estimated at 98 per cent with achievement of two education-related Millenium Development Goals: Education
for All for basic education and gender parity in enrolment.23 However, education has been severely disrupted
following 12 years of conflict and an associated economic crisis. COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated
challenges.24 Currently, approximately 2 million children in Syria (40 per cent girls) are out of school, and an additional
1.5 million are at risk of dropping out.25 The conflict has led to the destruction and damage of over 7,000 schools,26
loss of structures and supplies, and psychological distress and fear of returning to schools by students and their
parents.27 Security and hostilities remain primarily in non-government-controlled areas in the north-west and
northeast Syria.28
12. The deteriorating socio-economic conditions and increased poverty rates in Syria makes it difficult for
families to maintain school-enrolment, largely due to the inability to cover school transportation fees. The shortage of
schools also forces many students to travel long distances, raising security and safety concerns.29
Education Needs of Relevant Communities
13. Educational attainment for both girls and boys is negatively impacted by gendered social norms with boys
expected to work and early marriage among girls.30 Child labor remains a key reason for children being out-of-school
in all regions in Syria, with nearly 48% of children not attending school due to child labour/work to support the
household. Early and forced marriages have increased across Syria, often as an economic coping mechanism,
compounding barriers to accessing education and detracting from achievement of SDG5 (Gender Equality).31
Moreover, the lack of gender-sensitive latrines in schools and shortages in soap and water disproportionately affect
girls’ enrolment in schools.32 The 2022 Whole of Syria Humanitarian Situation Report highlighted that children with
disabilities (CwDs) are disproportionately underserved with 65 per cent of school-age CwDs not having attended any
form of education.33
14. The education needs of relevant communities, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), pose additional
challenges. With approximately 6.8 million IDPs in Syria, internal migration is widespread34 making it difficult for
those moving between areas with different curriculums to smoothly transfer or integrate into the new education
system. The country’s fragmentation, including the involvement of multiple authorities, exacerbates the inability to
deliver quality education, especially in areas like Deir ez-Zor and Al-Hasakeh, which have territories both under and
outside GoS control. This leads to high rates of out-of-school children.35

15. Aleppo, Idlib, and rural Damascus face particularly catastrophic education situations, including unsafe
journeys to schools, high drop-out rates, and limited return to learning after COVID-19. Education opportunities for
children with disabilities are severely lacking in these areas, though access for CwDs is an issue throughout Syria.36
16. The severe political and socio-economic situation, coupled with protracted displacements, contribute to
increased child marriage, child labour, and armed recruitment of children, especially in north-west Syria, raising
serious child protection concerns.37
Earthquakes that struck Türkiye and Syria
17. On 6 February 2023, southwest Türkiye and Syria were struck by two devastating earthquakes, measuring
7.7 and 7.6 on the Richter Scale. The earthquakes were followed by a series of aftershocks.
18. In Syria, the Cabinet of the Government of Syria subsequently declared Aleppo, Hama and Lattakia as
disaster zones. The affected areas had already been severely impacted by ongoing armed conflict since March 2011.
The earthquakes exacerbated high levels of vulnerability, negatively impacting the affected population’s ability to
cope and increasing the risk of long-term welfare consequences.
19. The earthquakes impacted 38 districts in 8 of Syria’s 14 governorates. According to the World Bank’s Global
Rapid Post-Disaster Estimation (GRADE) report (20 February 2023), the governorates with the highest total median
estimated damage were Aleppo and Idleb – governorates in which UNICEF’s ECW program is being implemented.
The subsequent March 2023 World Bank Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA) estimated that a total of
6.6 million Syrians lived in the impacted areas with economic damages and losses in education amounting to
US$30.7 million and US$85.4 million, respectively.
20. The RDNA found that of the 803 education facilities assessed across the 9 affected cities in NGCA were
damaged or destroyed, a total of 188 primary schools, 41 secondary schools, 31 kindergartens and 5
colleges/universities. Up to 10 per cent of Aleppo and Idleb’s education facilities were damaged or destroyed. With a
child population of 2.3 million, initial estimates by the Education Cluster highlighted that over 1 million children were
affected by the earthquakes, further exposing them to negative coping mechanisms, early childhood marriage, and
child labour – this combined with the risk that the longer children are out of education, the greater the risk of them
never returning.38
1.3 Evaluation purpose, objectives and scope
21. The main purpose of this Final Evaluation (FE) is to support the project management unit (PMU) of UNICEF,
partners and donors in evaluating the results achieved; helping to identify gaps and key bottlenecks; and assessing
the extent to which the implementation of the ECW Program in the Whole of Syria has been equitable and
inclusive.39 Furthermore, the evaluation intends to assess whether it has been implemented in an efficient, effective,
and well-coordinated manner. The evaluation is timely to inform learning for designing and implementing the next
phase of the ECW program (2023- 2027). The primary intended user of this evaluation report is UNICEF.
22. The objective of this FE is to provide accountability to donors, rights holders, IDPs and host communities
with respect to whether UNICEF, through the implementation of the ECW program, are fit for purpose in response
to the education needs of Syrian children, adolescent girls and boys.
23. More specifically, this evaluation has the following four main objectives identified in the Terms of Reference
(ToR):
• Assess UNICEF’s progress towards the attainment of ECW results at output and outcome levels, and the
overall goal, including cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender, and disability, based on existing
evidence and analysis. The evaluation will also aim to identify unintended (positive/negative) effects.
• Assess the relevance to context and needs, efficiency, coverage and coherence of the ECW Program in
terms of design, implementation, partnership and community/ rights holder engagement.
• Document programmatic and operational lessons learned and opportunities that will inform the design of
the next ECW funding.

• Provide key recommendations (including potential shifts) for the planning, implementation, monitoring and
coordination of the ECW program.
24. While there is no dedicated objective of assessing the contribution to human rights and gender equality,
this has been mainstreamed within the aforementioned objectives.
25. As specified in the ToR, the evaluation scope covers the entirety of the ECW Seed Fund program between
January 2020 to June 2022. This includes all output and outcomes detailed in the program’s results framework,
presented in Annex 12.40 The geographical coverage of this FE encompassed all seven governorates where the
program is being implemented: Idleb, Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor, Hama and Homs. Assessing
progress on human rights and gender equality results is included within the evaluation scope through a dedicated
evaluation criteria.
2. EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
26. This evaluation applied a mixed-methods approach that is participatory, inclusive and respondent-group
sensitive. Evaluation findings were derived from the collective contribution of a wide range of stakeholders which
were triangulated and validated. Gender considerations were integrated into the data collection and analysis
methods, where relevant.
27. Data collection involved a combination of remote and face to face methods and included key informant
interviews (KIIs), focus-group discussions (FGDs), quantitative surveys, and classroom and facility observations. In
addition, the evaluation undertook a detailed document review (see Annex 2) of program related documents shared
by UNICEF, as well as a broader review on the education sector in Syria in general. Findings from the desk review
were triangulated with fieldwork to answer the evaluation questions, including the sub-questions highlighted in the
evaluation matrix (see Annex 11).
28. The evaluation team used a variety of data collection methods eliciting information from different
stakeholder groups to ensure that diverse perspectives were captured. The evaluation included UNICEF staff,
partners and external stakeholders relevant to the education sector in Syria as well as affected children who are out
of school and at risk of dropping out of school (aged 7-17), parents/caregivers and guardians, and teachers and
educational personnel (including psycho-social support workers).

2.1 Evaluation Questions and Criteria
31. This evaluation followed the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/ Development
Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) evaluation criteria of relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, coordination,
coherence and coverage. In line with the ToR and formative objectives of this evaluation, the evaluation excluded the
criteria of impact and sustainability.41 Gender equality and human rights norms and standards are integrated into the
evaluation criteria and included as a standalone criterion: ‘cross-cutting issues’, namely disability, human rights and
gender. The main evaluation questions are provided in Table 6 below. Annex 11 includes the full evaluation matrix
specifying sub-questions, indicators and data collection methods.

2.2 Data Collection, Analysis and Sampling
32. The data collection phase of this evaluation comprised of a pilot and data collection phase. During the pilot
phase, the evaluation team conducted one pilot interview with a UNICEF staff member. Purposive sampling was
used to identify the interviewee, to ensure the selected respondent had sufficient knowledge of the program’s
activities. The children and teachers’ surveys were piloted internally.
33. Sampling: The sampling methodology for quantitative and qualitative data collection was based on a
comprehensive stakeholder mapping (Annex 2). In combination, the data collection methods allow for inclusion of
stakeholder groups directly responsible for implementation of or participation in ECW programming as well as a
selection of external actors.
34. Stratified random sampling was used to select participants for the FGDs to improve precision, ensure
inclusivity, and provide better coverage of the population under study, particularly among those that are ‘hard to
reach’. The student survey provides a representative sample at 95 per cent confidence level and 5 per cent margin of
error drawing students from the ECW program’s pool of students using the Systematic Sampling Technique.
Additionally, a sample that is considered sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to hold was randomly drawn
using the Systematic Sampling Technique for the Teacher survey. Facility and classroom observations were
randomly selected from the sample of centres visited to conduct the surveys to provide broad coverage of the
intervention sites. Table 7 provides an overview of the data collection in GCA and NGCA. Annex 10 provides
additional details on the sample calculation and data collection in the areas targeted for this evaluation.

35. Data collection took place between February and June 2023 with field work occurring between March and
April 2023. Data collection tools are provided in Annex 9.
36. Data analysis: Qualitative data was analysed thematically with information organized by criteria into a matrix
for comparison and triangulation of findings between sources.42 Descriptive analysis was used for the quantitative
data using Excel.
37. Triangulation: The mixed methods approach involving secondary and primary qualitative and quantitative
data collection methods supported triangulation between the different data sets and ensured rigor of findings.
Documentary review findings were recorded using a standardized analytical tool derived from the evaluation matrix,
questions, and criteria, and triangulated against other data sources. Strategic and project documents provided
context and assisted in refining the evaluation’s approach during the inception phase. The documents were reviewed
in detail during the field phase in drawing out findings and triangulating with primary sources of data. The ET used
three types of triangulation: 1) Data triangulation43, 2) investigator triangulation44, and 3) Methodological
triangulation.45
38. Gender and human rights: A human rights-based approach (HRBA)46 was applied to analyse inequalities and
discriminatory practice and the unfair distribution of power that impede justice. The evaluation has assessed how the
program was designed and implemented to ensure accountability, equality, non-discrimination and participation.
Human rights standards concerning women’s political and economic rights and gender equality were referenced,
including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 197947 and the
42 Thematic analysis was done manually. No coding software was used.
43 Data triangulation involved the use different sources of data. Sources include documentation (secondary sources), FGDs with
children, parents/caregivers, teachers/ PSS workers, children and teacher surveys, and facility and classroom observations.
Information from different sources is triangulated with data from other sources.
44 Investigator triangulation was carried out with an evaluation team comprising members with different backgrounds, qualifications,
experience, and knowledge, in a gender-balanced team.
45 Methodological triangulation was carried through a mixed methods approach.
46 A Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) means that human rights and democracy are considered fundamental to development.
It is a normative approach and method which implies that human rights standards and principles guide all development – goals as
well as means to achieve them.

Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).48 There was sufficient information collected during implementation and
complemented through the data collection period to assess progress on human rights and gender equality results.
The ET systematically disaggregated data collection and results by gender of the respondents to investigate whether
there were differences between respondent groups.
2.3 Ethical Issues and Considerations
39. The evaluation was guided by the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical standards for evaluation.
All evaluation team members were trained on the ethical protocol and were required to adhere to principles of
independence, impartiality, credibility, conflicts of interest and accountability. The ET referred to UNICEF’s pre-
existing ‘Strategic Guidance Note on Institutionalizing Ethical Practice for UNICEF Research,’ and the ‘Evaluation
Technical Note No. 1, Children Participating in Research, Monitoring and Evaluation’ to ensure ethical safeguards
were respected concerning data collection with children. Data collection took place in compliance with UNICEF and
Child Watch International Research Network (et al)’s ‘Ethical Research Involving Children’ – specifically in the areas
of ‘Harms and Benefits’ (See Annex 5-8 for ethical protocols and consent forms).
40. All evidence generation took into consideration social and cultural contexts. All interviews/FGDs were audio-
recorded upon receiving informed consent from interviewees and their guardians (where required), and summative
notes were produced. UNICEF and partners’ lists of rights holders were used to identify potential FGD and survey
participants. The lists were anonymised to maintain the security and confidentiality of participants. The ET was
responsible for participant selection to ensure transparency and a lack of bias. Compensation was not used to
coerce, pressure or bribe participants to take part in the evaluation.
41. In line with ethical protocols, informed consent was obtained from every participant (including guardians of
children where relevant). Written and/or oral consent was obtained from all United Nations (UN) Staff, (International)
Non-governmental Organization ((I)NGO) and other key informants prior to the remote KIIs. The autonomy of all
participants was ensured through the voluntary participation and confidentiality of FGDs/Surveys and anonymity of
the data analysis process (See Annex 8 for the information sheet and consent forms).
2.4 Methodology for post-earthquake assessment
42. Following the earthquakes, UNICEF requested a scope expansion to analyse the effect of the earthquakes
to ensure that the findings and recommendations of the ECW mid-term evaluation are relevant to the situation and
useful post-earthquake. The analysis – which included only NGCA in NWS - relied on a desk review of relevant
documents and direct observation of ECW learning facilities.
43. The evaluation team reviewed a total of eleven documents, primarily produced from UNICEF but also
including relevant World Bank Reports. Documents were produced between mid-February and the end of March
2023 (see Annex 14).
44. RMTeam developed a rapid observation checklist to assess the implications of the earthquakes on affected
population access to UNICEF’s ECW facilities in the two earthquake affected areas of Aleppo and Idleb. The
evaluation team conducted post-earthquake observations in 15 learning facilities supported by UNICEF and the ECW
program. The visits took place between 19–22 March 2023. The assessments were undertaken purely based on
observations, focusing on the populations’ ability to physically access learning facilities post-earthquake. The
methodology did not include interviews with affected stakeholders (i.e. children, teachers and school staff) to avoid
the potential of causing psychological harm or distress following the devastating earthquakes.
45. Twelve of the facilities assessed in this evaluation were primary schools; two were secondary schools; and
one (in Idleb) was a combined preparatory and primary facility.
46. Table 8 below provides an overview of the learning facilities visited in NGCA. The facilities highlighted in
orange were damaged by the earthquakes. Five out of 15 ECW-supported learning centres have been affected with
varying levels of damage. Damage to facilities is described in further detail within the Relevance criteria (see Table

3. KEY FINDINGS
3.1 Relevance
KF1. The program was able to respond to the education needs of children through its contribution to improving their
foundational learning skills. Children and parents were largely satisfied with the program activities.
KF2. UNICEF and partners sought feedback on rights holder needs during planning and implementation of activities
to ensure the relevance of program interventions. However, their active involvement -particularly with those who
are most vulnerable such as CwDs, IDPs and caregivers representing them – during decisions on what activities to
implement in the design phase (proposals) was limited.
KF4. The assessment of learning outcomes helped ensure the relevance of education content delivered to children.
49 The names of the learning centres have been removed at the request of UNICEF
50 Accessible: learning can continue without any measures in place.
51 Limited access meaning partially damaged: some measures to accommodate all students need to be taken. The measures
needed are explained in Table 9 below.
52 Tents and classrooms with an awning roof.

KF5. UNICEF and its partners were flexible to adapt programming to respond to changing needs and contextual
shifts.
KF6. The needs of CwDs were not adequately integrated into programming.
KF7. The earthquakes resulted in a temporary pause in ECW program implementation to allow for search and rescue
operations to be undertaken. UNICEF took swift action in prioritising responses for the most urgent needs to
support the safe re-opening of schools. This included the identification of the need to provide for children and
teachers with psychosocial support and health and safety awareness.
KF8. UNICEF’s rapid post-earthquakes response was relevant given the damage to physical infrastructure as a result
of the earthquakes as reported in the SitReps and confirmed through school observations.
Program’s responsiveness to children’s education needs
48. As highlighted in the context section, access to education in Syria is a major challenge, particularly for
vulnerable populations such as IDPs and CwDs. Thus, the successful contribution of the program in improving the
foundational learning skills in children is relevant to the operational context.53
49. The assessment of learning outcomes helped ensure the relevance of the education content delivered to
children. The Holistic Assessment for Learning and Development Outcomes (HALDO) was originally developed by
the second grantee for Education in Emergencies (EiE) contexts of different countries. For the purpose of the ECW
program, the HALDO was contextualized for Syria and utilized as a tool to assess learning outcomes in order to
strengthen the program’s education response by standardizing assessment methodologies of children’s learning
skills. The HALDO includes assessments of literacy, numeracy, social and emotional learning (SEL), and executive
functioning (EF). The HALDO tool helped UNICEF ensure that NFE education modalities were relevant to children
and identified learning approaches that are best suited in contexts of emergences.54
50. Assessing learning outcomes helped ensure relevance of the education content to student needs. Using
the HALDO helped implementation teams make concrete recommendations to ensure the relevance of education
content to children needs.55 Recommendations included, for example, focusing on single-digit and double-digit
operations in numeracy content for 7- to 8-year-olds and double-digit operations for 9- to 12-year-olds, and using role
play games and stories in SEL content to aid children in interpreting emotions. In addition, the tool helped UNICEF
understand the impact of demographic and home characteristic (such as gender, socioeconomic status, home
learning environment, and disability status) on children’s learning development. Surveyed teachers reported
assessments of students including periodically assessing students using pre and post assessments (see Figure 2).
The implementation of periodic evaluations to assess children’s learning outcomes was also highlighted during the
FGDs with teachers.
53 Further discussion on effectiveness of program activities on learning outcomes is discussed in section 3.2 on Effectiveness.
54 UNICEF & the second grantee Year two Achievement Report.
55 In addition, the ASER pre and post results were used during year one to evaluate student’s literacy and numeracy skills. During
Year two, HALDO tool was used rather than the ASER as it is more robust to measure learning outcomes of students

51. According to teacher survey results, 67 per cent of teachers in NGCA and 8 per cent (1 of 13 teachers) in
GCA were trained in continuous assessment practices in the classroom.57 When asked about the effectiveness of
this training, all teachers were positive about training reporting that it was at least ‘somewhat’ effective; over three-
quarters of surveyed teachers reported the training to be ‘very effective’ (76 percent, see Figure 3).
Figure 3 Effectiveness of assessment practices to inform of students’ progress.
Very effective Effective Somewhat effective

Source: Teacher survey
52. Approximately two-thirds of teachers in NGCA reported that trainings were ‘very effective’ while the
remaining reported them to be either ‘effective’ (28 per cent) or ‘somewhat effective (3 per cent). The teacher
trained in in GCA also felt the practices were ‘very effective’. Section 3.2 on Effectiveness provides further details on
teacher capacity building (see pp. 25). The lower percentage of teachers trained in GCA may be because new
partners were added to the program, and teachers had yet to participate in the trainings during the period of data
collection.
53. Psychosocial support needs are high in Syria (see paragraph 10). The relevance of PSS activities is
supported through findings from the student survey where the majority of surveyed students selected the ‘very
happy’ (62 per cent overall)58 or ‘happy’ (23 per cent)59 emoji when asked to describe their feelings when attending
PSS activities.
54. Including trainings for teachers and education personnel on foundational and life skills courses and Psycho-
social support (PSS) is also relevant to the operational context. Over half of teachers surveyed (55 per cent) had been
trained on how to identify signs and symptoms of psychosocial distress in students. In GCA 38 per cent (5 of 13) of
surveyed teachers received this training. In NGCA, 61 per cent of surveyed teachers were trained.
55. In the teacher survey, all participants in both GCA and NGCA reported valuing the PSS training as at least
‘somewhat’ effective with most trained teachers reporting the training as ‘effective’ (38 per cent) or ‘very’ effective

(54 per cent).60 When asked to explain their rating, teachers specified that they found this training beneficial in
improving their teaching styles, classroom management, ability to engage with children and identify children’s PSS
needs.
56. The innovative and interactive learning methodologies promoted by the program were relevant in engaging
children. Children in FGDs particularly enjoyed activities that were interactive and involved collective engagement
and disliked repetitive activities such as reading and writing. For example, children aged 13-17 years in GCA and
NGCA reported enjoying activities that involved sports, science, games, contests, playing, drawing, roleplay, while
children aged 7-12 years enjoyed activities such as the broken telephone activity, mental calculation, using illustrative
photos, and stories. Findings from the student survey also partially support the relevance of interactive strategies as
over half of students identified these strategies as helping them learn in literacy classes (52 per cent) and/or
numeracy class (57 per cent).61 However, the fact that approximately three-quarters of students highlighted learning
best when ‘students are quiet’62 indicates a need to include a mix of teaching strategies to meet the needs of
students.63
Participant satisfaction with program activities and services
57. Primary data collection highlights the satisfaction with activities and services received. Children displayed a
positive attitude towards learning highlighting UNICEF’s ability to provide relevant NFE programming to out of school
children and children at risk of dropping out. In the children’s survey, children in GCA and NGCA used the ‘very
happy’ (76 per cent) or the ‘happy’ (24 per cent) emoji to describe their feelings when they answered the teacher’s
question correctly. As mentioned above, most students reported to be ‘very happy’ or ‘happy’ when attending PSS
classes (paragraph 52) and children participating in FGDs were satisfied with interactive activities (paragraph 56).
58. Overall, parents in GCA and NGCA were satisfied with the participation of their children in the program and
valued the care and quality education the program provided. Parents interviewed in NGCA particularly appreciated
the program allowing children to continue their education.
Participation of affected populations and stakeholders in design, planning and implementation
59. UNICEF focused on the inclusion of duty bearers during program design. Program design in the
development stage was guided by achievements and lessons learnt from previous ECW investments and engaging
with local and international actors and education authorities. This engagement supported a design that properly
addressed education needs of children currently out of school and children at risk of dropping out. A MYRP task
force was also established to conduct consultations and assessments, collect data and lead the design process. This
task force was composed of Whole of Syria Education Coordinators, UNICEF, UNRWA, United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), and development partners represented by the Foreign, Common and
Development Office (FCDO), the European Union (EU), the European Commission on Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) and
Hub and Working Group coordinators.64
60. UNICEF incorporated the needs of affected populations in the program design and implementation based
on findings from needs assessments and regularly seeking feedback from children, parents and teachers via various
feedback and complaints (F&C) channels.65 Partners conducted needs assessments through engaging with local
communities through, for example, FGDs as well as using registration forms to identify those areas most in need
and to select the most suitable persons. In GCA, partners coordinated with local authorities and leaders and referred
to data available from the education directorate.
61. Evidence is lacking to show that program participants, particularly children who are most vulnerable, were
actively and directly involved in planning for and implementation of activities. After the design stage, participation

building on different topics including teaching practices in the classroom. Approximately a quarter of the teachers in GCA stated
that they did not receive training on new teaching strategies, and 15% of GCA teachers were unsure; as opposed to only 3% of
teachers from NGCA who did not receive any training.

14
strategies employed in the program seemed to have focused on more extractive methods of collecting feedback and
input from relevant stakeholders. One exception was the involvement of PSS workers in GCA and NGCA in the
planning of PSS activities through participating in brainstorming sessions and collecting data.
Flexibility of the program
62. UNICEF and its implementing partners were flexible in adapting programming to respond to contextual
changes. For example, UNICEF worked to ensure continued access to education for newly displaced children in
NGCA. Many of the NFE learning centres were in locations where formal education was not available (such as in
camp settings). Hence, continued NFE was necessary in such locations. Moreover, IDP students who completed
NFE catch-up classes in year one but could not access formal education were retained in NFE education in year two
and continued their education through the Self-Learning Program (SLP), which comprises grade 1-9 contents and is
equivalent to the formal education of GoS. However, this flexibility required a trade off as retention has negatively
impacted program capacity to accommodate new out of school children in catch-up programming.66
63. UNICEF and partners adapted programming to accommodate to participants’ needs. For example, in mid-
2020, to cope with the delays in obtaining approvals to transport children from their homes in KSA areas in Al-
Hasakeh to SLP learning centres in GCA areas, teachers travelled to children’s homes to provide instructions. During
the Cholera outbreak in Syria, partners provided hygienic supplies and disinfected spaces, and some partners in GCA
and NGCA offered health awareness sessions on Cholera to teachers and parents.
64. Activities were amended based on partner and participant’s’ feedback where possible and within the
restrictions of the donor red lines. Various mechanisms were in place to allow participants to share their feedback
and complaints. Section 3.4 on Efficiency provides a more comprehensive discussion on F&C mechanisms.
CwD inclusion in program design
65. Overall, the responsiveness of the program to the needs of CwDs has not been prioritized nor systematic.
This is mainly because the program did not dedicate a specific component for CwDs in its initial design due to cost
implications. Therefore, resources dedicated to addressing CwD accessibility and education needs have been limited
and insufficient. In addition, learning centres face challenges in reaching CwD populations due to social stigma that
typically keeps CwDs hidden in their homes and invisible to the rest of society. CwDs remain a very marginalized
group in Syria in terms of access and participation. A more comprehensive discussion on CwD inclusion is included
in section 3.5 on Cross-cutting Issues.
Addressing shifts in priorities caused by the earthquakes
66. SitReps produced by UNICEF following the earthquakes identified that the primary damage to school
facilities were cracks in ceilings and walls. The damage was verified as a valid concern through the observation
exercise undertaken to inform this evaluation (see Figure 5 and Figure 4). Importantly, the assessment was a purely
visual exercise not a technical survey. In coordination with the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sector,
education actors made reparations to enable immediate repairs and the light rehabilitation of damaged schools.
UNICEF deployed an engineering consultancy firm and worked with local education directorates and education
partners in NGCA to conduct rapid structural assessments for all schools in affected areas, starting with Aleppo.

67. Of the 15 facilities assessed during this evaluation, earthquake-related damage was observed in five
facilities, all of which were in Idleb (see Table 9 below). Damage was primarily to walls (LC1; LC2; LC4; and LC5).
The roof tiles at LC2 and the yard at LC5 were also damaged. At one secondary school (LC43), damage to ceiling
beams was also observed. There was no damage to the roads leading to any of the learning facilities observed or
damage to supplies (e.g. desks, chairs etc.) or to any of the WASH facilities.

could resume their education in a safe environment with adequate single-
sex WASH facilities. As of March 2023, debris removal, minor repairs and
light rehabilitation had started in 42 schools in Aleppo, Lattakia, Hama and
Homs while preparations are ongoing to rehabilitate more than 277
schools.68
69. UNICEF also identified the need for children and teachers to be
provided with basic PSS and health and safety awareness in coordination
with the Child Protection, WASH and Health sectors.69 At the time of this
evaluation, UNICEF was identifying locations and methods to work with
education partners, including local NGOs and community organizations, to
provide catch-up and remedial support lessons in which PSS would be
integrated.70 The response plan reviewed does not mention health and
safety needs being addressed.
70. UNICEF’s response to support access to learning through the
dispatch of education supplies and recreational kits for distribution to schools and shelters as well as high
performance tents (to be used as temporary learning centres), school-in-a-box kits and early childhood development
kits was relevant given the damage to physical infrastructure as a result of the earthquakes as reported in the
SitReps. Based on observations conducted for this evaluation, these needs remain relevant.
3.2 Coherence
KF9. The ECW program is aligning and coordinating its approach with other humanitarian responses and clusters
operating in the three hubs, within and across the NES Education Working Group and the NWS Education Cluster.
Despite these efforts, implementation is not always standardized within the same geographical location aside
from minimum standards. IPs are requesting harmonisation across aspects such as curricula, teaching methods
and certification.

KF10. Donor funding interests are not wholly consistent with needs in the supported areas, especially regarding
early child development and secondary education and vocational learning opportunities.
KF11. There is coherence between the project progress and the stated outcomes to an extent. However, there is
room for improvement in terms of providing children with equitable learning opportunities and the strengthening
of the education response.
Alignment with existing humanitarian-development responses
71. The ECW project is aligning and coordinating its approach with other humanitarian responses and clusters
operating in the three hubs. At the country-level, UNICEF is facilitating coordination as the cluster co-lead with all
UNICEF Country Office partners being linked to the child protection and Gender-based violence (GBV) sub-cluster.71
ECW program provision of teachers and educational personnel with trainings and incentives is in line with localization
initiatives promoted through coordination between members of the North East Syria Education Working Group
(EWG) and the North West Syria Education Cluster with support from the Global Education Cluster. 72 Outcome 1, to
provide girls and boys with more equitable learning opportunities, is aligned with the cluster approach that aims at
‘helping children return to and learn in a child-friendly, violence-free and inclusive education opportunities’73 as well
as broader SDGs on Quality Education (SDG4) and Gender Equality (SDG5).
72. The EWG consults with the WASH, Shelter and Child-Protection sectors on how to address cross-cutting
issues. All interviewed partner staff noted taking part in cluster meetings and other coordination efforts which
ensured coherence between approaches at a national level. In NWS, the project aligns its activities with the Shelter
and Protection Clusters through the North-West Syria Education Working Cluster, for example in working on using
shelters as NFE facilities.74 Close coordination is also confirmed in the joint task force between the North-West Syria
Education and GBV (sub-) clusters ensuring referral mechanism are in place and school staff participate in GBV
trainings. In GCA, there is also education/inter-sectoral coordination. These efforts are in line with the 2023
Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) call for closer coordination between all sectors for interventions supporting
education.75
73. Partners under the ECW are filling important educational gaps in covering out of camp areas, which are
often neglected. According to partner staff interviewed, many are working in areas that no other organization is
covering, ensuring a wide reach of education coverage. Partners ensure coherence and avoid duplication through
service mapping and needs assessments.
74. Despite these efforts, implementation has not been always aligned. Several partner staff requested a
standardized approach in all areas and across all partners, including harmonizing the curriculum, approach to
teaching, timelines, and certification, among other aspects. This is also related to additional training needs for
teachers to have a harmonised approach to NFE. UNICEF staff interviewed acknowledged those gaps and requests,
though specified that IPs must indicate needs more concretely. UNICEF also reported that there are limitations in
what types of trainings can be provided in the local context and with local resources. Additionally, harmonisation
requests need to be assessed considering the operational context.
Alignment with existing education opportunities
75. The Education Response Snapshot issues by the WoS Cluster called for support for community based early
childhood development (ECD) and opportunities for adolescents,76 both of which are currently absent from the ECW.
According to interviewed staff, alignment with these needs is not possible for several reasons. The primary reasons
cited were the lack of donor appetite to fund these activities and the absence of ECD and secondary NFE curriculum.
It was also highlighted that donor requirements and parameters can at times limit the interventions UNICEF can
provide. These limitations are not always understood by IPs.

Coherence of project implementation with ECW target outcomes
76. Despite the equity focus on Outcome 1, the project implementation is not fully aligned to meet this
objective. As discussed in section 3.1 on Relevance, the program has not had sufficient resources to meet the needs
of CwDs (see paragraph 65). Ensuring access to continued learning for vulnerable groups was also a consistent
challenge (see section 3.5 on Cross-cutting issues).
77. PSS providers and social workers form an important part of the project activities providing needed support
to traumatized children. This is coherent with a cluster report relating to NGCA from April 2023, that highlights the
critical opportunity to invest in integrated Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) activities. By June 2022,
1,678 teachers and education personnel were trained on PSS.77 While inclusion of PSS services and trainings in
Outcome 2 is aligned with population needs, coverage of PSS trainings may not be sufficient given potential gaps
identified in the teacher survey where approximately half of teachers reported not to have been trained in PSS (see
paragraph 54).78
78. The issue of identifying and retaining educational staff is well known and documented and is part of
strengthening the education response (Outcome 3). The fact that the funding period is not always aligned with the
school year creates risks of losing staff resources, especially in GCA. It was noted that there are times when
teachers are not being paid, hence children are not receiving the entire NFE, limiting their chances to transition into
the formal system. Uncertainty related to the one-year funding cycles under the MYRP is adding to this issue.79
3.3 Effectiveness
KF12. The program met or surpassed most program outputs. Overachievement in student participation and learning
outcomes is a positive indication of the ECW program effectiveness. However, differences in inclusion and learning
outcomes shows that vulnerable populations, particularly CwDs, have not been as effectively supported.
KF13. The establishment of Temporary Learning Spaces (TLSs), light rehabilitation, and maintenance work
contributed to improving learning environments for children. However, benefits varied across the centres with a
few Centres in NGO and government buildings identified to have gaps in WASH infrastructure.
KF14. Teachers are largely positive about the effectiveness of training and learning circles in improving teaching
and PSS capacities. Positive changes in teaching strategies can be observed and are appreciated by students.
KF15. Teaching practices are still quite teacher centred and explanations are at the core of the lesson as opposed
to more active learning strategies that involve higher order thinking skills. Space and materials to implement
interactive teaching methods remain a primary challenge.
KF16. Teachers used non-violent methods to manage classroom behaviour, with a few exceptions of corporal
punishment. Parents’ reaction to child misbehaviour was more concerning.
79. The program’s results framework provided the framework for the ET to assess effectiveness. Most of the
program outcomes and outputs were either fully or overachieved (See Annex 12 for the full results framework listing
program outcome and output indicator achievements).
80. The section below provides an overview of the findings under outcome 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the ECW program
followed by a discussion of safeguarding and ethical issues and factors affecting program implementation overall.
Despite systematic investigation throughout primary and secondary data collection, no unintended effects were
identified.

Outcome 1: Girls and boys access more equitable learning opportunities
81. As of 11 August 2022, UNICEF was able to reach 69,45380 children and adolescents, overachieving its
anticipated target by 21 individuals. The participation of CwDs was above targets included in the Results Framework;
1,206 children with disabilities were reached.81
82. The cumulative ‘average attendance rate for ECW supported children in learning spaces’ was 85% (106%
achievement rate). However, there were specific periods and particular learning centres with lower average
attendance rates based on a variety of reasons. For example, in Deir-ez-Zor, security unrest in March 2022 resulted
in low attendance. 82
83. While data analysis showed no notable difference among attendance rates based on student gender overall,
there were specific barriers to girls’ attendance within some governorates. In Idleb, average attendance rate of girls
was much lower than boys, and in some cases more than 10 per cent lower than boys’ attendance during specific
seasons, such as in November, which was the period for harvesting olives. To compensate for this loss of learning,
girls were provided additional lessons after harvest season.
Output 1.1: Safer and more protective learning spaces are accessible
84. Light rehabilitation of existing centres or the re-establishment of TLSs, as well as the provision of basic
learning and teaching materials, ensured that minimal conditions were present to allow safe and functional learning
for children. According to the monitoring data, 823 classrooms were repaired/rehabilitated/established (98 per cent
achieved, on track for full achievement). The program overachieved in the ‘number of learning centres provided with
maintenance and running costs’ by 103 per cent. These achievements support SDG4.A targets to build and upgrade
education facilities. Despite achievements, the student and teacher survey highlights gaps in infrastructure,
particularly lighting, heating and clean water (see Table 10).
Table 10 School infrastructure (teacher and student survey)83
Teachers Students
Lighting available 76% 54%
Heating available 74% 70%
Sufficient chairs 88% 97%
Sufficient desks 88% 85%
Always clean water n/a 72%
Washing basin and water n/a 84%
Clean toilet n/a 81%
85. Lighting availability was a frequently reported issue. Most surveyed students and teachers confirmed that
lighting was available in all classrooms, though most of the students and a minority of teachers reported depending
on sunlight. Issues in lighting were confirmed in classroom observations in GCA where 5 out of the 11 centres
observed did not have regular power supplies in the classrooms and they were not well lit. In GCA, reliance on
sunlight was a particular challenge in the winter when there was less sunlight exposure and inadequate alternative
lighting sources.84 Even in the classrooms where lighting rehabilitation was available in GCA, electricity or the type of
lighting was inadequate in half of the classrooms observed. In NGCA, lesson observations showed that light
rehabilitation was adequate where all classrooms were equipped with either electric or solar panel lighting. Lighting
was also available in all caravans in NGCA.
86. Temperature of classrooms was a consistently identified challenge. Though most students and teachers
surveyed confirmed that heating was available in classrooms in the winter, a quarter of the students reported very
cold classrooms indicating that this heating was not always used. Heaters not being used were confirmed during
80 Since the start of the program in January 2020, 69,453 (34,668 F) children participated in ECW supported education programming
in formal non-accredited education or non-formal education (NFE) settings in 7 governorates, namely Idleb, Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-
Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor, Hama, and Homs. The program has reached slightly over 100% of 69,143 children (34,737 F), the cumulative
target by June 2022.

83 Teachers were not asked about the availability of clean water, washing basin/water and toilets.
84 This was mentioned in the sample that was taken for GCA only. It should be noted that, even though it was not reported in the
NGCA sample, it does not mean that this was not an issue.

lesson observations, where heaters were left unused in a few of the classrooms; in one case due to the lack of
electricity. In FGDs with children aged 13-17, children mentioned that tents were warm during the summer and
ventilation was poor, as well as being cold in winter. During the FGDs with children aged 7-12 in GCA, there were
reports of classrooms being cold in the winter and needing heating.
87. All students were able to reach the washbasins though 10 per cent of students said they had difficulty
using the toilet (11 per cent of girls, 7 per cent of boys). This was primarily related to a lack of water in the learning
centre rather than specific disability or gender needs. However, facility checks showed that not all facilities had
separate latrines for boys and girls (12 out of 17 had separate toilets for boys and girls - 4 of these were in NGCA and
8 in GCA). Lack of gender-segregated latrines may present challenges for achieving equitable attendance. Lack of
gender-separated WASH facilities might be due to their location in existing buildings where construction was
difficult; that learning centres may be for younger children; or that some (particularly those in NGCA) were in homes
of camp dwellers.
88. There were specific barriers for CwDs attending learning centres. Students were asked what would allow
students in a wheelchair to access the learning centre. Less than half of students identified available adaptations for
classroom and WASH facilities or ramp access to the centre (see Figure 7). The fact that 20 per cent of teachers and
43 per cent of students said that lighting was available but that they depended on sunlight could disproportionately
disadvantage students with visibility impairments. Access to facilities for CwDs is covered in further detail in section
3.5 on cross-cutting issues (pp. 37).

89. The facility observations support student survey reports of limited adaptions. Table 11 below provides an
overview of adaptations observed during facility checks in GCA and NGCA. A total of 17 facilities were observed, of
which 11 were in GCA and 6 in NGCA. Observed access issues included a lack of ramps and issues with sufficient
spacing to allow movement for CwDs without difficulty in classes. Although all classrooms observed had seats and
desks for children, only one in NGCA had some specifically for CwDs. There were several potential access
constraints observed concerning latrines. Very few had grip bars or handles for CwDs. Additionally, some of the
latrines were on separate floors, and had steps to enter them, making it challenging for CwDs to access. One of the
centres in GCA had latrines outside the centre; the route was covered with stones and steps at the entrance making
it difficult for CwDs to access.

challenges for CwDs.
Separate toilets for 8 4 One of the latrines in DAM was in a building outside the
boys and girls centre. The route towards the toilet was covered with
21
stones and there were steps to enter it making it difficult
to access for CwDs. Furthermore, accessing the latrines
during wintertime may be unsafe. Some of the toilets were
on separate floors, which makes accessibility to those that
are not on the ground floor difficult for CwDs. Other
latrines had steps to enter them also making accessibility
challenging for CwDs.
Toilets for children with 2 5 One of the toilets was locked, and when opened, seemed

Classroom is 8 2 While some of the centres were accessible to children in
accessible to children wheelchairs in GCA, 2 were observed to be small and 1
on wheelchairs was not equipped to facilitate wheelchairs.
90. Data suggests that facilities were not equitably equipped. Survey results indicated that there were a few
centres in NGOs and government buildings that had gaps in WASH infrastructure. For example, almost all the
students surveyed who attended learning centres in tents or caravans reported that there was a clean toilet,
functioning washbasin and access to clean water. Approximately 75 per cent of students in school buildings (mostly
in GCA concentrated in six schools) reported the same. Despite gaps identified in a few learning centres in schools,
children in FGDs expressed a general preference of children to attend school buildings. For example, during FGDs
with children aged 13-17, several children wished to have school buildings rather than tents that were poorly
ventilated, particularly during the summer. In the FGD with children aged 7-12, participants also wished to learn in a
school with actual walls and a roof.
Output 1.2: Children are provided with school transportation support
91. Transportation remains a common request from children, teachers and parents. The program overachieved
in terms of the ‘number of children provided with school transportation support’ (by 101 per cent). . Despite
overachievement of the targets, the prevalence of requests for transport in qualitative data highlights continued
need. According to FGDs conducted for this evaluation, transportation was particularly important for ensuring facility
access to vulnerable groups of children such as girls, those residing in rural and secluded areas as well as CwDs.
Transportation is discussed further in section 3.5 on cross-cutting issues.
92. The back to learning campaigns aimed to facilitate motivating parents to bring their children to the TLSs.
The participatory nature of the campaigns meant that they were also an important way to identify areas where
awareness raising was needed. Other activities such as “return to school” activities were carried out in GCA to
encourage children to go back to school. These activities involved FGDs with children. Close collaboration between
the protection and education teams took place to carry out such activities.85 There were no specific output or
outcome indicators to measure results against planned achievements.
Output 1.3: Learning spaces are equipped with adequate learning and teaching supplies
93. The ‘number of teachers provided with teaching materials’ was mostly achieved (91 per cent). Survey
results indicate that almost all teachers reported access to at least some teaching aids, with ‘images’ being the most
frequently reported (see Figure 8).

94. Children and parents reported that learning aids were useful in improving learning outcomes. For example,
in FGDs with children, participants reported that they were able to better understand concepts when teachers used
learning aids. Children aged 13-17 participating in FGDs mentioned using coloured papers and cardboard to facilitate
their learning process. Others mentioned use of illustrations and maps to help them better understand concepts.
Similarly, during FGDs with children aged 7-12, participants valued the learning aids (such as illustrative photos) and
requested more. This was also reflected during the discussions with parents. For example, in GCA, parents reported
that their children used coloured papers with images and shapes to learn the letters, and that these helped their
children understand the lessons and encouraged children to memorize information.
95. Despite their perceived value, learning aids were not consistently used to illustrate literacy and numeracy
concepts. One-third of students surveyed reported that teachers did not use images in literacy or numeracy classes
(see Figure 9). There are differences in outcomes depending on specific learning centre. Use of images may be
related to which implementing partner was responsible for the school. For example, 65 percent of students
attending schools covered by one partner said teachers used images for both Arabic and math lessons. This
compares to less than five percent of students attending learning centres covered by a different partner.86

96. Monitoring data showed a partial achievement in the number of children provided with learning materials’
(95 per cent) and the ‘number of children benefiting from recreational materials’ (85 per cent). Provision of
stationary is clearly covering a gap as 81 per cent of surveyed students reported that the learning centre provided
them with stationary. However, according to FGDs and KIIs, stationary was not enough to cover wear and tear of
items. These sources also reported delays in receiving items. Surveyed students were much more positive about
stationary sufficiency with 98 per cent reporting sufficient stationary while teachers were slightly less positive (65
per cent reported sufficient stationary).87 More than half the teachers in GCA reported insufficient stationary for
students. In NGCA, less than a quarter of the teachers reported this.
97. Stationary was important in encouraging families to send their children to school, particularly for those who
did not have the financial means to cover such costs, as well as motivating children to continue and re-engage in

learning.88 There were reports in both GCA and NGCA of stationary encouraging higher attendance and commitment
in classes. Stationary provision appears different depending on the specific facility attended with over half the
students in some centres saying that they were not provided materials. Seventy-four per cent of students in
schools/buildings reported that the teacher/learning centre provided materials compared to all students in tents and
88 per cent of students in caravans reporting the same.
Outcome 2: Girls and boys acquire foundational, socio-emotional and life skills
98. The program overachieved in measurements of improved foundational, socio-emotional and life skills. The
outcome of providing girls and boys with foundational, social-emotional, and life skills was evaluated based on
HALDO scores. Over three-quarters of children assessed against the program’s HALDO tool (76 per cent)
demonstrated improvement in learning skills including literacy, numeracy, social and emotional learning, and
executive functioning.89 This was above the target of 65 per cent.90 Achievements support SDG4, specifically targets
for 4.7.
99. Improved learning outcomes for students were triangulated through qualitative data collected for the
evaluation. Interviewed parents, children and teachers in GCA and NGCA asserted the academic benefits of NFE
programming providing several examples of improvements in children’s literacy and numeracy skills including
reading, writing, letter recognition, spelling, pronunciation, solving mathematical problems, and learning new
methods in calculation. In FGDs with children aged 7-12, most participants reported improvements in their ability to
read and write and in recognizing numbers. During FGDs with children aged 13-17, some children reported that they
were now better able to perform tasks in class and no longer relied on anyone for assistance.
100. Learning gains were not uniform across population groups. As highlighted in the year two report, children
with disabilities had lower SEL and executive functioning gains than children not reporting difficulties/disability.
Children with difficulties in learning did not show the same level of improvement. 91 Gaps in learning gains for CwDs
were also identified in the teacher survey where only 65 per cent of teachers reported that ‘most’ CwDs are making
‘good’ progress in literacy and numeracy.92 A notable portion of surveyed teachers were less positive about the
impact of interactive teaching strategies on students with disabilities. Among those teachers identifying CwDs in
their classroom, 25 per cent felt these strategies had less impact while 10 per cent were unsure. ,
101. In the same year two report, better literacy outcomes were noted for girls, while boys outperformed in
numeracy questions.93 Students self-assessments somewhat mirror these findings with older girls (13-17) more
likely to report learning to ‘read a short story fluently and with ease’ compared to boys of the same age group, while
boys were more likely to report being able to ‘perform double digit subtraction/addition problems’ compared to girls.
The limitations in self-reported learning outcomes should be recognized.94
102. Moreover, learning outcomes were worse among children that were not able to attend school regularly,
specifically more economically marginalized children and CwDs. Children involved in work were not able to attend
classes as regularly. Children with disabilities whose attendance was not consistent also performed less well on
learning assessments. The program actively sought to address the needs of the most vulnerable through activities
such as providing daily transport to and from learning sites for marginalized children in Idleb and Deir-ez-Zor though
differences in learning outcomes remained through year two.95
103. Non-Formal education programs contributed to enhancing children’s wellbeing, social skills and happiness
and confidence levels. This was reflected in discussions with children, parents and teachers. Specifically, recreational

94 In students’ self-assessment of what they had learned in literacy classes, younger boys (7-12) were more likely to report being
able to ‘read a short story fluently and with ease’ compared to girls of the same age group (40% and 38%, respectively) while the
reverse was true for a comparison of older boys and girls aged 13-17 (84% of boys, 93% of girls). In mathematics, 68% of boys
reported being able to subtract double digit numbers and 66% reported being able to add double digit numbers. This compares to
55% and 58% of girls, respectively.

activities offered at learning centres contributed to enhancing children’s individual development, providing them with
better access to information, improving their communication and social skills, and providing them with an outlet to
release their energy. During the FGDs with children aged 7-12, several children mentioned that they felt happier after
attending the PSS sessions at the centres because they were able to make new friends and children became less
aggressive towards each other.
Output 2.1: Non-Formal education teachers possess basic skills to deliver foundation, socio-emotional and life skills
104. Monitoring data showed a 110 per cent achievement in the number of teachers and educational personnel
trained to deliver foundation, socio-emotional and life skills. Achievements are essential in supporting SDG4 in terms
of improving the quality of primary education (4.1). During the FGDs, all the teachers reported receiving trainings
through the project. However, quantitative data from the teachers surveys indicate that not all received these
trainings. Coverage was highest for training on lesson planning (81%) followed by preparation of home-based
learning material (74 percent) and student-centred teaching strategies (71 percent, see Figure 10).

105. In NGCA, all but one teacher reported receiving training on new interactive teaching strategies. In GCA,
eight of the 13 teachers from GCA confirmed receiving these trainings while the remaining said they received no
training on interactive strategies (n=3) or were not sure (n=2).
106. One objective of the project is to train all teachers on the standardized package in each hub with no
exception regardless of the year they entered into the program (i.e. Year 1, Year 2, or Year 3). Training budget was
always incorporated in partnership agreement with the IPs. However, the fact that most teachers who had not
received training had been teaching for two years or less suggests that newly recruited teachers (due to teacher
turnover) may have been waiting for next training opportunity. Moreover, in GCA, five new IPs started only in Year 3
(July 2022 onwards). Notable challenges in timely approval of partnership agreements may have delayed trainings for
teachers hired by these IPs, a possible explanation for lower coverage of surveyed teachers in GCA.
107. Most teachers who had received training on interactive teaching strategies found them ‘effective’ (28 per
cent) or ‘very effective’ (60 per cent). Most teachers participating in FGDs (in both GCA and NGCA) were also
satisfied with the trainings they received. For example, some reported that training helped them better engage with
children in classes. Another teacher found the training useful because it provided her with the skills to deal with
children who misbehave in a non-violent manner. Other benefits mentioned by the teachers included equipping
teachers with skills to better manage time in class, ensure equal participation among students, as well as identify
children with emotional problems. The training on assessing children’s learning outcomes was also perceived as
useful because it allowed the teacher to evaluate children’s progress.
108. However, some perceived the training as insufficient because it was too short and would have liked to
receive more training on topics such as PSS support, thinking patterns, computer skills and English language. Several
teachers participating in FGDs in NGCA were not happy that the training took place in tents and would have
preferred it to be in a training centre. The tents were described as too hot and lacking in equipment to properly

conduct the trainings. Others found that the duration of the training was too long (in a day) and needed to be divided
over a greater number of days.
109. Attending trainings on interactive teaching strategies contributed to improvements in teachers’ teaching
capacity. In the teacher survey, teachers who were trained on interactive teaching strategies reported several ways
their teaching practices had improved experiences in the classroom. All teachers who had received training reported
at least one improvement (see Figure 11). Teachers in NGCA reported an average of seven ways in which their
teaching had improved. In GCA, teachers reported an average of three ways their teaching had improved.

110. Students were asked to point to the image that describes what most of their numeracy and literacy lessons
look like to assess program effectiveness in promoting student-centred teaching strategies. Most students surveyed
selected images that reflected more teacher-centred methods (see Figure 12). In both GCA and NGCA most
students indicated that teachers explained the concept on the board while students listened and then answered
questions.

111. Lesson observations support students reports of more teacher-centred methods. Most teachers were
observed to be primarily explaining concepts to students with high student-teacher interaction through question-and-
97 This proportion only includes the sample who have been trained, which is 61% of teachers in GCA and 97% of teachers in
NGCA.
98 Students were able to select more than one image. In traditional learning, students listen in class without participation; the
teacher mainly provides them information directly. “Teacher explaining the lesson” would be that there is interaction in the sense
that teachers explained the lessons with some questions and back-and-forth between students and teachers.
26
answer sessions, mostly in plenary. In a few lessons (one in GCA and two in NGCA), question-and-answer sessions
were utilized to motivate a competition to answer questions between students. Dialogue was still teacher-centred as
the teacher answered their own questions in half the lessons observed in GCA and NGCA while students repeated
the answer after the teacher. This limited the opportunity for students to express themselves creatively and in a
more extended manner (student answers were brief due to the type of questioning).
112. While classes were interactive to an extent, observations did not identify any instances of questioning that
develops students’ higher order thinking skills. Rather, most of the questions posed by teachers in all lessons in GCA
and NGCA aimed at developing student knowledge and ensuring they can recall what they learn; and to explain their
understanding of concepts. Questioning almost always required single word or short answers from students such as
“Is this word singular or plural form?”; “Why is this word in the plural form?”; “Where in the word is the letter
located?”.
113. In a few cases in literacy lessons, questioning developed students’ ability to link their learning to real life
examples such as “Give me a food that you eat that starts with the letter ك”; or “What activities do you do in
summer and what kind of foods do you eat?” In one literacy lesson in GCA, the teacher asked questions to develop
students’ comprehension skills to introduce a new letter. Numeracy lessons were also observed to include simple
problem-solving questions in which students applied the new math concept to answer questions in their textbook.
114. Lesson observations showed that teachers in NGCA followed concrete practices, particularly when it
comes to implementing different activities in the lesson to create a more motivating learning environment.
Moreover, all teachers in NGCA and most teachers in GCA (7 of the 10) presented a lesson plan. Although three of
these teachers in GCA did not have a lesson plan with them, all lessons applied a clear structure that indicated a
well-planned aim to achieve lesson objective(s). The teachers also informed students of or noted the lesson
objective clearly on the board in all lessons in both GCA and NGCA. Other elements observed of class structure
included introducing the new topic, explanation of the concept; an opportunity for students to answer exercises in
textbook or solve math problems and a plenary to discuss the concept; and a conclusion of the lesson to revise its
objective. How effectively lesson plans were applied varied for each, according to the teaching methodologies used.
115. Despite learning strategies remaining largely teacher centred, there were improvements in the practices of
teachers for engaging children, which they greatly valued. As specified above, teachers self-reported improvements
following trainings (see Figure 11). These improvements were triangulated through data collection with students.
Some students explicitly referenced teachers’ attentiveness and use of interactive teaching methods as generating
improvements. For example, during FGDs with children aged 13-17, participants mentioned how they enjoyed the
new teaching methods used by their teachers, which were described as involving activities that encouraged
students’ participation. Some also appreciated that teachers were able to make them feel comfortable in class and
were more attentive to their needs. Others mentioned that teachers distributed questions on papers and rewarded
those who answered correctly and participated. Children in FGDs also particularly valued activities like music, dance
and drawing. However, several children also mentioned that they did not notice changes in the learning styles of
their teachers.
116. Teachers faced several challenges in implementing interactive teaching strategies. Over half of teachers
surveyed in GCA found it ‘difficult’ or ‘sometimes difficult’ to implement interactive teaching strategies that they had
been trained on during lessons. Most teachers related these difficulties to the large number of students in the
classroom and a lack of sufficient space/materials for implementation. The differing levels of student performance
was also reported to be a barrier. In NGCA, approximately a third of teachers found it (sometimes) difficult to
implement trainings (see Figure 13). One teacher from the NGCA did not apply any of the training during lessons.
Some teachers who had been trained on multiple interactive teaching strategies noted that only ‘some’ of the
trainings were difficult to implement. Teachers who found only ‘some’ trainings difficult specified that those
strategies requiring group work were difficult to implement due to class size and space limitations while strategies
that did not require additional space (such as encouraging participation and discussion) were easy to implement.

117. Availability of space and teaching materials were common barriers to implementing interactive teaching
methods. Teachers mentioned a variety of materials they needed to implement activities with children such as
materials to engage children with visual impairments, Arabic illustrations to support teaching, and equipment such as
computers (alongside a regular supply of electricity which would be required to use these materials). Another
challenge was the large number of students in the classroom.100 Furthermore, some active learning strategies
required children to leave the classroom. However, a teacher explained that there were no safe spaces for the
children to do such exercises in the centre. Finally, some teachers found that activities that involved learning through
playing or singing were too difficult to apply in classrooms with boys and girls of older age groups.
118. There are clear indicators of students’ positive attitude towards learning. During lesson observations, most
students observed were engaged in lesson activities or in answering the teacher’s questions. This positivity is
reflected in the student survey where all students surveyed in GCA and NGCA used the ‘very happy’ (76 per cent) or
‘happy’ (24 per cent) emoji to describe their feelings when they answered the teacher’s question correctly. Almost
all students (98 per cent) chose the ‘sad’ or ‘very sad’ emoji when they did not understand a lesson. During the
FGDs, children also valued classes that were interactive and involved activities such as storytelling, competitions,
and group work activities.
119. Providing positive feedback was important in encouraging children. In FGDs with students, students
reported that rewarding children was an important way to encourage them to participate and manage classroom
behaviour. During the FGDs and student surveys, some of the ways in which students mentioned being rewarded
included through, for example, increasing grades of students that excel; classmates and teacher applauding students
who respond correctly; rewarding children with a medal; as well as using motivational phrases. Findings align with
lesson observations where teachers used a variety of ways to provide positive feedback. In GCA, the reward system
was used mostly to encourage participation and reward correct answers rather than reinforce positive behaviour.
Lesson observations of teachers in NGCA indicated that they used more of a variety of reward systems to praise
good behaviour as well as academic achievement.
120. Learning circles: Approximately half of teachers in GCA (63 per cent) reported participating in learning
circles. In NGCA, 86 per cent said that they participated. A quarter of the teachers in GCA reported that they did not
know what learning circles were. Coverage was higher among FGD participants, where all teachers except for one in
GCA mentioned taking part in learning circles. Most teachers who participated in learning circles found them very
helpful. In the teachers’ survey, teachers who had attended learning circles identified several benefits of attendance,
namely the ability to exchange experiences and information, brainstorm solutions to challenges and receive support
from peers.
Output 2.4: NFE teachers and education personnel are financially supported
121. Monitoring data shows that UNICEF is on track for full achievement of targets for financially supported
personnel.101 A total of 2,278 NFE teachers (1,034 females and 1,244 males) were financially supported in 2022. In
the case of the stipends provided to teachers, although greatly valued, they were reported to not be adequate to
99 This proportion only includes the sample who have been trained, which is 61% of teachers in GCA and 97% of teachers in
NGCA. Teachers were able to select more than one type of training received.
100 In the teacher survey, teachers in GCA reported an average of 24 students per classroom compared to 33 in NGCA.
101 The target achievement for this output indicator is 2,676 (1,302 females and 1,374 males).
28
meet teachers needs in both GCA or NGCA. During an FGD with teachers in NGCA, participants reported that rising
inflation in the country further increased burdens on teachers, which affected their teaching practices. Many
mentioned that they would leave their current jobs if they found other opportunities with higher salaries, even if they
were not in their fields.
122. All teachers in GCA stated they received their stipends regularly in Syrian pound (SYP). Most teachers
surveyed in GCA ‘always’ received their stipend on time (69 per cent). Except for teachers in Aleppo,102 almost all
surveyed teachers in NGCA are paid in USD. In NGCA teachers were split relatively evenly in reporting to have
received their stipends ‘always’ (39 per cent), ‘mostly’ (33 per cent) or only ‘sometimes’ (28 per cent) on time.
Soaring inflation and price increases in Syria required partners to request for budget amendments. Despite UNICEF’s
flexibility to accommodate to the changing context, the process took time, which is likely to have delayed some
payments.
Outcome 3: Girls and boys access more equitable learning opportunities
123. Under Outcome 3, UNICEF is responsible for Activity 3.1 “the development of a summative or placement
assessment tool”. The actual implementation of this activity was delayed to Year 3. The delays in Year 1 and Year 2
were due to multiple factors. In Year 1: delays were due to the adjustments to the implementation plan to forgo the
inception phase— where these initiatives would have been a focus—to immediately initiate implementation to
address the NGCA displacement crisis of late 2019; and adjusting programming in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. Operating under these conditions, the PMU prioritized its focus on Outcome 1 and 2 to benefit the
children of Syria over Outcome 3 activities aiming to support education sector members.
124. A call for proposals was published nationally in quarter 3 of 2022. The objective was to find a national-level
consulting firm capable of completing the activity through a national call for proposal. However, upon receipt of a
limited number of applicant firms with insufficient experience or capacity, the decision was taken to move the call to
a global applicant pool. Mindful of the limited remaining time in the program, this was prioritized as urgent. As such,
the activity was proposed to the UNICEF LTA global pool for Education Assessments and Evaluation. UNICEF is
currently working with a candidate Long-Term Agreement (LTA) holder to amend the current ToR and adapt to the
shifting levels of access due to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution contingency planning. A roll
out among sector members was scheduled to take place after finalisation of tools and completion of piloting.103
Outcome 4: Resource mobilization
125. With regards to Outcome 4 on ‘resource mobilization to support program sustainability’, there is a lack of
clarity on the purpose and outputs among key informants as it was cancelled. This ambiguity also extended towards
the Donor Partnership Group (DPG) functions and the roles and responsibilities of the steering committee members.
Understanding of the governing structure of this body was also lacking.
126. In February 2021, the ECW Steering Committee determined that a resource mobilization strategy was
premature. Consequently, the donor mapping that had been partially conducted was put on hold. Moreover, as per
the Steering Committee discussions, the development of a resource mobilization strategy was cancelled through
year two with the possibility of revisiting its relevance in year three.104 However, UNICEF was able to mobilize $25
million through the Global Partnership Education (GPE) grant for the education of Syrian children in Syria.105,106
Despite such achievements, it was difficult to mobilize resources to compliment the ECW grant, as ECW donors
constitute the main funding agencies for the education sector in Syria.
127. A combination of factors influenced the decision to cancel the outputs under this outcome including on how
the grant could go directly to Syrian NGOs, the red lines affecting resource mobilization, and the complexity of
implementing the outcome within the Syrian context. High turnover among DPG and Steering Committee members
also made it difficult for them to meaningfully engage which had serious implications as they are key decision-
makers in the program implementation. To address this challenge, a consultant was secured to organize clarity

around red lines and improve donor engagement, as well as support the DPG in advocating for accelerator funding
from the GPE grant to compliment ECW.
128. From the donor end, the design of MYRP and GPE programs as complimentary or inter dependent was not
realistic for the Syrian context. Nevertheless, the meeting that took place in October 2022 was a major achievement
under this outcome, as it brought the donors together to discuss key challenges to implementation, namely, the red
lines. The objective of the conference was to ensure that clear understanding was achieved by all on the limitations
of programming under these restrictions, to support the donors to move the discussion upwards in their respective
organizations advocating for simplification of restrictions, as well as clarify what can and cannot be expected of
implementing partners in the ECW renewal program. This is an advocacy effort aimed at improving the current red
lines, or at least clarifying them so that program activities can better align with financial restrictions on use of funds
for the renewal program. The meeting also facilitated coordination among donors. There was an agreement to have
another meeting in March 2023 as well as a decision to revive the Education Dialogue Forum (EDF) following this
event.107.
Safeguarding and ethical issues
129. Protection form Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and child protection mechanisms were in place, as
were referral mechanisms used to refer children in need of specialized care. However, it is not clear from monitoring
data to what extent they were followed. Gaps in referrals were identified in the teacher survey as some teachers did
not report that they would refer students with PSS symptoms to the PSS officer or social worker (all in GCA).108
130. Findings from the teacher survey also suggest teachers may not have been aware of how to identify PSS
symptoms. Nearly half of teachers (45 per cent) said that they had not been trained on how to identify signs and
symptoms of psychosocial distress in students. However, some of these could be teachers that joined in year two
and three who were not targeted for inclusion in these trainings.109 Among teachers who were aware of the child
protection code of conduct, approximately half had not signed it (all from GCA).
131. Teachers used non-violent methods to manage classroom behaviour, with a few exceptions of corporal
punishment. When asked what teachers would do in reaction to fighting, most students in both GCA and NGCA
confirmed that teachers would speak to them calmly (which aligns with how teachers reported they deal with
misbehaviour) and resolve the conflict between peers by having them apologize to each other (see Figure 14). When
asked what teachers would do if students did not complete their work, a few students (6 per cent of total) reported
that teachers would shout/hit them. Boys were slightly more likely to report corporal punishment (6.5 per cent) than
girls (5 per cent). Teachers’ use of non-violent methods to manage classroom behaviour was also confirmed during
the lesson observations and FGDs with children in NGCA and GCA, with the few exceptions of corporal punishment
reported during discussions with students aged 13-17.

108 Teachers did not specify why they would not refer students to PSS services
109 Almost all teachers in NGCA are aware of the child protection code of conduct. In GCA, two-thirds of teachers (62 per cent)
were aware of this code of conduct.
30
132. In the quantitative survey, students were asked about their parent’s reaction should they receive a warning
letter about the student’s misbehaviour. In this scenario, most student reported that their parents would talk to them
calmly and try to understand the reasoning. However, a minority of students reported that their parents would use
corporal punishment (10 per cent). A small number of surveyed students (9 per cent) said that their parent would
ignore the warning letter altogether. However, qualitative findings were more concerning, as use of corporal
punishment by parents for misbehaviour in general was frequently reported by children from both age groups in
FGDs.
Internal/external factors affecting achievement of outcomes
133. External factors: During year one, the program went through several contextual challenges that affected its
start-up and implementation. The closure of schools during COVID-19 greatly affected implementation of activities.
Adapting modalities of instruction per location largely depended on the guidance provided by authorities in the
different areas, as well as issues relating to connectivity and access to devices.110
134. Additionally, in 2020, the unexpected need and processes to establish a second grant agent for operations
in NGCA-NES delayed development of IPs working in the area. Prolonged project approvals from the Ministry of
Education in Damascus also delayed implementation for UNICEF in Deir-ez-Zor, and other parts of Al Hasakaeh and
Aleppo.111
135. In 2021, the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2582 required that the two grant agents (the second
grantee and UNICEF) continue as ECW grant agents per the current arrangement (the second grantee managing
programming for non-governmental held areas of northeast Syria, and UNICEF managing programming for non-
government held areas of north-west Syria as well as for the government held areas of the country).112 While this
introduced some complications, this coordination was generally smooth and the arrangement allowed the program
to achieve broader coverage of children in need as the second grantee was able to cover areas where UNICEF could
not operate. Section 3.6 on Coordination provides further details on the partnership.
136. The two devastating earthquakes that struck southwest Türkiye and Syria also affected timeliness in the
implementation of some activities (Section 3.1 relevance and Section 3.4 on efficiency provides more details on the
implications of the earthquake on the program).
137. Internal factors: Coordination with local stakeholders facilitated implementation of activities. For example, in
GCA, UNICEF and partners closely coordinated with the directorate of Education, which facilitated in implementation
of the program activities. Including disability focused organizations during year three of the program. This also
facilitated in the inclusion of children with disabilities.
138. The donor red lines significantly affected the program’s capacity to enhance safer learning opportunities for
children. The clauses restricting funding for light rehabilitation or repairs of already structurally sound facilities limited
the ability of partners to ensure schools are safe and inclusive places for children. Red lines restricting payments of
teachers and education personnel in NGCA to only those who are living outside camps also caused challenges.113 In
addition, delays between ECW program phases significantly affected the program, as it was difficult to continue
operation of centres between those periods.
139. The high turnover of teachers was challenging because finding suitable teachers with the required
qualifications was difficult as was repeating the trainings for them, particularly in rural and isolated areas. It was also
more difficult to find women teachers in these areas. The lower salary scale for UNICEF was mentioned by a KII in
GCA as contributing to the high turnover.
3.4 Efficiency
KF17. Program outcomes and outputs were mostly achieved within the planned timeline with some delays.
KF18. Resources were allocated to respond to the needs of a range of participants. However, they were not
adequately allocated to best meet the needs of CwDs.

KF19. UNICEF was flexible in re-allocating resources based on contextual shifts and changing needs through greater
donor engagement.
KF20. Feedback and complaints mechanisms were available and varied. However, their use was limited and there
is little evidence to show their inclusivity.
KF21. Third party monitoring (TPM) supported UNICEF in ensuring compliance of partners in areas where the
Agency’s direct presence was limited. However, there is limited evidence to show that TPM activities were
participatory or inclusive.
KF22. As cluster lead/co-lead for the WASH, Nutrition and Education clusters, UNICEF was at the forefront of
ensuring that assessments were rapidly undertaken to assess damage to learning facilities following the earthquake
and ensuring that facilities would be safe for children to return.
KF23. UNICEF worked collaboratively with partners to rapidly identify the impacts of the earthquakes on the ECW
program and responded in a timely manner to address a range of needs which ensured minimal disruption to
continued learning.
Program implementation according to planned timelines and budget
Timelines
140. Program activities were mostly completed within the planned timelines with some delays affecting activity
implementation, notably COVID-19 lockdowns and school closures. Implementation modalities were adapted in a
timely manner to ensure continuity of education and compensate for loss of time in classroom as much as possible.
In some locations, implementation had to be fully stopped.
141. Delays also occurred due to government bureaucratic processes and obtaining permits. For example, in
year one, some partners experienced delays in securing necessary approvals from government, local and/or camp
authorities.114 In year two, three partners experienced delays in renewing their permits. To avoid the same delays in
year three, the partners either changed location or type of NFE programs offered to get necessary permits.115
142. In Al-Hasakeh, delays were experienced in obtaining approvals from authorities to transport children from
non-government held areas in Al-Hasakeh to learning centres in GoS areas. To deal with this, mobile teachers were
mobilized in mid-August 2020 to travel to children’s dwellings to provide instruction.116. In GCA, program
implementation was drastically reduced while a partner waited nine months to get clearance from the Ministry of
Education.
143. Challenges in finding suitable locations for learning centres affected program timelines. In Deir-ez- Zor,
implementation was delayed for four months due to difficulties in finding safe existing infrastructure to establish
learning centres in town settings. School buildings and infrastructure are frequently destroyed in Deir-ez-Zor which
limited the number of safe facilities that the program can use. To deal with these challenges, databases of potential
spaces for learning centres were established in collaboration with partners. A similar approach was applied in rural
areas in collaboration with local communities.117. In addition, in NGCA delays were experienced in areas where
camps were established for the first time as partners had to find suitable locations to establish learning centres.
144. Other delays were experienced due to internal factors. Internal factors included downstream partners being
late in submitting documents, delays in obtaining supplies and in receiving project documents from UNICEF (in GCA).
Budget revisions to accommodate inflation and price increases in GCA and NGCA also resulted in delays to activities
due to approval requirements from both UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour (MoSAL).

145. Multiple factors delayed activities under Outcome 3. As a result, the PMU prioritized Outcome 1 and 2
implementation (see paragraph 123). In year two, delays in Outcome 3 activities were due to the decision to focus
on establishing a more comprehensive year two plan for assessing learning gains of students.118
Budget
146. The ECW results framework achievement matrix shows that most of the outcomes and outputs targets
were achieved indicating efficient use of resources.119 However, at times, limited budgets affected the ability of
partners to deliver the level of service desired. For example, in GCA, the budget allocated to teachers’ salaries was
not enough to offer a competitive compensation in comparison to the private sector.120 Importantly, this was out of
UNICEF’s control as the government required UNICEF to match their practices.121 UNICEF’s salary scales for staff
are significantly lower than other INGOs operating in GCA, making it difficult to attract and retain qualified staff122
though the ET did not identify any evidence that lack of quality staff impacted the program. In addition, funding
restrictions on operational costs to local NGOs added additional burdens on partners.123 Budget limitations also
affected the ability of partners to better support CwDs through, for example, more advanced case management
support, assistive devices, and other learning material.
147. The economic crisis imposed significant challenges on the program, impacting the ability of partners to
deliver outputs according to agreed budgets. Inflation and increases in prices affected implementation of activities,
forcing partners to reduce services and supplies in some cases. For example, the drastic increase in fuel prices
significantly impacted activities depending on transport and other activities such as running generators for electricity.
148. To deal with this challenge, UNICEF authorized frequent budget revisions to reflect the changing exchange
rate and prices and changed agreements to USD. Despite this, partners had to work with deficient funding as the
official exchange rates used in agreements did not reflect actual market exchange rates and prices of commodities
frequently increased. UNICEF used contractors from abroad to mitigate the impact of fluctuating exchange rates.
However, this approach did not work when dealing with local partners as they had to transfer money to them in
Syrian Pounds. UNICEF also allowed partners to shift funding between budget lines to ensure essential supplies
were secured.
149. The high turnover of teachers in GCA also affected the budget, as additional training of new staff was not
accounted for. Interference from local authorities, particularly in Turkish controlled areas, presented some financial
challenges as well. For example, authorities interfered in the value of incentives provided to teachers and pressured
implementing partners to use the government postal service to make payments which complicated the process of
paying some of the local suppliers as some of their accounts were blocked. In addition, security risks and hostilities
in NGCA forced the program to shift locations of operations introducing additional costs.
Distributing resources in an equitable manner
150. Resources were allocated to respond to the needs of a range of participants, including girls and IDPs.
However, the financial resources dedicated to CwDs were not adequate to properly equip staff and education
personnel with the necessary capacity to integrate CwDs in the program, ensure that classroom environments were
adapted, and to ensure that CwDs were provided learning equipment/material and assistive devices to best meet
their needs. To deal with this challenge, the program increased its target of CwDs and standardized tools used to
identify CwDs.124 Equity issues are further discussed in section 3.5 on cross-cutting issues.
Strategies to improve effective allocation and use of resources
151. UNICEF established standards and mechanisms to support efficiency in achieving results, although
implementation varied across learning centres. While there were standards and mechanisms used to support
efficiency in achieving results, implementation was not standardised across all the learning centres and there was a
degree of flexibility to adapt implementation of activities depending on the context/needs. Overall, strategies such as
118 UNICEF & the second grantee (2022). Syria ECW Seed Fund Program: Year two Achievements.
119 The financial documents made available for the evaluation team did not cover the whole evaluation period. Therefore, an
accurate analysis of budget utilization against achievement of results was not possible.

tracking results, regular monitoring of teacher performance, feedback and complaint mechanisms, TPM reports (see
paragraph 154 below on F&C), and vetting partners facilitated in the provision of education in areas in most need.
Moreover, UNICEF signed agreements with partners on a six-month basis to mitigate the risk of losing access and
tried to maintain the same partnerships to ensure consistency in services provided.125
152. UNICEF has procedures in place to thoroughly vet its implementing partners. Partners were chosen based
on their capacity to respond, ability to demonstrate fiscal responsibility and operational transparency, and areas of
intervention. Partners are required to have a valid program cooperation agreement (PCA) before responding to a
UNICEF call for proposals, which helped UNICEF ensure that the most suitable partners were selected.
153. UNICEF was flexible in reallocating resources based on contextual shifts and changing needs, facilitating
the ability of partners to deliver results. As discussed above, UNICEF was flexible in transferring budget lines and
reassessing budget values in light of the economic crisis (see paragraphs 147-148). For example, IPs in NGCA were
able to move money from one budget line to another when the bill of material for building toilets changed.
154. Measures were in place to ensure that feedback could be collected from all participants. In general,
feedback and complaints mechanisms were easy to access and visible, Different types of feedback mechanisms
were employed by implementing partners, most commonly suggestion/complaint boxes, hotlines and WhatsApp
numbers. Partners also conducted regular meetings with caregivers and children and field visits to collect feedback
from the community. In NGCA, for example, 47 learning centres had Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) that set up
regular meetings between parents and teaching staff, allowing them to follow up on their children’s education and
share their concerns.126 Other F&C mechanisms include social media, emails, advertisements and conducting
surveys and FGDs. All facilities observed in GCA and NGCA had feedback and complaints mechanisms, most
commonly feedback/complaint boxes, which were visible in most locations.

155. A small number of participants in qualitative data collection described processes of responding to feedback
and complaints received from students, teachers or parents. For example, during FGDs with teachers in GCA,
several participants reported that they used strategies of listening, providing solutions, and ensuring confidentiality to
support students when they received complaints from students.
156. Inclusive F&C channels were not consistently available.127 This includes mechanisms for persons with
different types of disabilities, such as hearing, visual, intellectual, and physical impairments, as well as those with
multiple forms of disabilities. Only one partner in NGCA reported, for example, positioning complaint boxes at
reachable heights for children in wheelchairs. This lack of accessibility was observed through facility checks in GCA
where the complaints/feedback box was not accessible to CwDs. During KIIs, a few partners in GCA and NGCA
reported having in place child friendly mechanisms using stickers and drawings to help children express their
feelings.
157. Third party monitoring in NGCA and GCA supported UNICEF in ensuring compliance and accountability of
partners in areas where the Agency has limited reach. However, participatory and inclusive approaches were lacking
in the TPM work carried out. For example, the TPM mainly relied on surveys and focused on parents. Other
mechanisms in place to help ensure effective use of resources included the quarterly reports which included
125 These agreements were made due to the renewal of SC resolution on cross border operation. Following the validity of the
resolution, the partnership agreement was for 12 months initially, however, since July 2022 it changed 6 months.

participant feedback and findings of teachers’ evaluations, conducted through pre and post training surveys. UNICEF
also conducts a partnership review at the end of each project, and lessons learned and recommendations feed into
upcoming development cycles. Moreover, funding is only committed on a yearly basis. This allows implementation
teams to revise the program annually and identify areas in the program design that require adaptations based on
program learnings, as well as the changing contexts and needs.
Timeliness of post-earthquakes support
158. UNICEF continued to lead the WASH and Nutrition clusters and the Child Protection Area of Responsibility
in NGCA after the earthquakes. UNICEF and the second grantee continued to co-lead the Education Cluster. Schools
in NGCA were initially suspended until 18 February to allow search and rescue operations to continue and gradually
started to re-open from 25 February in Idleb.128
159. For many partners operating in NGCA, there was a disruption to services immediately post-earthquakes as
the focus shifted to search and rescue activities. UNICEF continued to work with partners to identify damage to
services and facilities in earthquake-affected zones. Within one week of the earthquakes, UNICEF, as sector lead,
worked with partners to undertake assessments to ensure that schools and learning facilities would be safe for
children to return. UNICEF also supported the World Bank-led RDNA. UNICEF and partners also conducted the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and European Union-led Syria Earthquake Recovery Needs
Assessment (SERNA) assessing WASH/Education and Social Protection as well as Health/Nutrition needs. The
Education Cluster also developed two standardised education rapid assessment tools to be used by all partners in
the sector. The evaluation team did not have access to the SERNA to confirm complementarity or possible
duplication of collected information.
160. Early data (from the beginning of March 2023) suggested that up to 220 schools in NGCA were damaged
and that 46 schools in NGCA were being used as shelters, thus potentially impacting ECW program implementation.
Concerns over aftershocks also made parents reluctant to send their children back to school.
161. A REACH rapid assessment in NGCA (with data collected between 9 – 11 February) reported that the repair,
rehabilitation and removal of debris from education facilities was one of the highest reported areas requiring support.
162. The collection of early data facilitated UNICEF’s ability to provide different forms of support to earthquake-
affected populations. Specifically, support included:
• UNICEF-supported Child Protection mobile teams in Aleppo, Hama and Latakia were re-deployed to
support displaced families with psychological first aid and other mental health and psychosocial
support, reaching approximately 18,625 children, parents and caregivers by mid-February.129
• By early March, education supplies, recreational kits and tents (temporary learning centres) were
provided to over 65,000 children in earthquakes-affected areas and additional supplies had been
ordered to cover the needs of 255,000 students.130
163. The ET does not have available data or feedback on how the coordination process worked.

Ensuring continued learning to vulnerable groups
164. It was challenging to ensure continued learning of children during COVID-19, particularly for vulnerable
groups such as CwDs and those without access to internet or devices. In FGDs with students in NGCA, several
students mentioned facing challenges such as poor internet connectivity and a lack of access to smart devices to
participate in lessons over WhatsApp.131 Most students in GCA and a quarter in NGCA stated that the distance
learning program was not made available to them (see Figure 16). However, it should be noted that over half of the
students who had not received any education during this period joined from year 3 (had been attending the centre
for less than a year). This may be partially due to the time lag that may have existed between activity implementation
and survey deployment. Also, it is worth noting that distance learning /homebased learning was implemented at
particular times when LCs were completely closed, as face-to-face modality, with safety measures in place, was
always a preferable choice for children’s effective learning.

165. In the teacher survey, not all teachers provided distance learning. In GCA, only 15 per cent of surveyed
teachers reported that they provided the distance learning program to their students during COVID-19. In NGCA
almost 90 per cent of surveyed teachers reported providing distance learning. In NGCA, home visits helped increase
access to distance learning.
166. Findings from FGDs also highlight limited coverage of distance learning. No children aged 7-12 participating
in FGDs in GCA reported that they attended any lessons during COVID-19. In NGCA, participants in two FGDs
mentioned attending the centres during COVID-19 while students in the third FGD reported receiving lessons on
WhatsApp. This pattern was also true for older students (aged 13-17). The distance learning modality also prevented
the program from conducting reliable assessment of students learning.132
167. None of the surveyed teachers who had provided distance learning in GCA reported receiving training on
how to create home-based material for their students when offering the distance learning program. In NGCA, nearly
three quarters of teachers who provided distance learning had received training on how to create home-based
learning material/digital study material (69 per cent). Most teachers who were providing distance learning found
preparatory training to be effective (95 per cent)133 for preparing them to conduct the distance learning program and
create digital study material.
168. Teachers reported a relatively equal spread of distance learning by gender with approximately a third of
teachers reporting to have provided learning to mostly girls, mostly boys or a mix. In GCA, all teachers who provided
distance learning reported that students were mostly girls and that no children with disabilities took part in this
program. In NGCA, participation was split roughly evenly between boys and girls. CwD inclusion remained limited, as

36
almost half of these teachers stated that the program did not include CwDs, either because they did not attend or
because the distance learning program was not inclusive of them.
WhatsApp groups for distance learning program
169. The WhatsApp groups contributed to the continued learning of students during COVID-19. However, access
was limited, particularly for those most vulnerable. Evidence from the evaluation surveys indicates that students did
not consistently engage through WhatsApp indicating that these groups were not as effective as face-to-face
learning. Of the two per cent of surveyed students from GCA who did participate in the distance learning program,
they reported that they did not communicate their assignments with their teachers through WhatsApp or any other
means. Notably, this contradicts findings from the teachers’ survey in GCA where all teachers reported that students
were highly responsive when receiving and sending their assignments to this group and that they believed the
distance learning program was highly effective.134
170. In NGCA, there is also some contradiction in describing student responsiveness. While most of the
teachers surveyed viewed the WhatsApp groups as at least ‘effective’, a large majority felt that students were only
‘somewhat’ responsive in receiving and sending their assignments. In contrast, most students (89 per cent) in NGCA
reported that they sent their assignments on time to their teachers on WhatsApp, whereas only 3 per cent reported
that they missed sending their assignments several times.135 These students also expressed their enjoyment of the
YouTube videos and lessons they received on these WhatsApp groups and what they were learning.
Access to learning for CwDs
171. The program contributed to improving physical accessibility of learning centres for CwDs, with varied
results. As discussed above, while students reported multiple amenities in learning centres that would allow
students with a wheelchair to access, there were clear infrastructure gaps (see section 3.3 on Effectiveness, p. 21).
172. Although referrals were made to support CwDs in need of more specialized support, assistive devices and
equipment to support CwDs in their learning was lacking. This was reflected during FGDs with teachers and parents
and was also confirmed during KIIs with partners. Several measures were taken to address these gaps. For example,
one partner set up an emergency cash fund used for equipment and assistive devices for CwDs (such as eyeglasses
and wheelchairs). Some cases were also referred to another disability focused project implemented by the partner
and UNICEF to address needs that could not be covered through ECW.
Capacities of teachers to apply student centred learning for CwDs
173. Teachers require further capacity building to apply student centred learning activities for CwDs. This was
reflected in the teachers’ surveys as over three quarter of the teachers (77 per cent, n=10) in GCA and a little less
than half the teachers (42 per cent, n=15) in NGCA were not trained on how to meet the needs of children with
disabilities in the classroom.136 Of those that were trained, over half found it ‘very’ effective to make suitable
adaptations in the classroom to meet the needs of children with disabilities.
174. The use of adaptational strategies to meet the needs of CwDs was not practiced by all teachers. This is
reflected in surveys, where 15 per cent of teachers with a CwD in their classroom reported that they did not use any
adaptational strategies. A gap in adaptational strategies was also identified in a small percentage of the student
surveys where 2 per cent of students with CwDs in the classroom reported that the teacher did not adapt strategies.
Of the adaptational strategies most frequently reported, teachers were most likely to report providing more time for
CwDs (76 per cent) and seating them closer to the board (62 per cent). Similarly, students mostly reported CwDs
sitting at the front of the classroom (88 per cent). The classroom observations confirmed survey findings showing
that only some teachers used adaptations to support CwDs. For example, in four out of the five classes in GCA,
children with visual impairments were observed to be seated in the front of the class with their backs facing the
wall. However, in NGCA, CwDs were observed to be seated in different places in the class irrespective of their
disability. It is possible that classroom adaptations were practiced in GCA because they were in centres run by
134 Students and teachers were not all from the same centres which could partially explain this discrepancy
135 The vast majority (97 per cent) of surveyed students from NGCA confirmed that they used the WhatsApp groups to
communicate with their teachers, either independently or with the help of their teachers to receive and send their assignments.
136 Most of the teachers who were not trained had been teaching at the learning centre for three years or more (80 percent of non-
trained teachers, n=20). The remaining had been teaching for two years or less and thus were year two and three teachers who
were not targeted for inclusion in these trainings.
37
disability focused organizations with teachers that have more experience dealing with CwDs (See Annex 13 for more
on classroom learning environment structure in NGCA and GCA).
175. Teachers reported that CwDs benefitted differently from teaching practices than children without
disabilities, though there was not coherence on whether they benefitted more or less. When asked whether
students with disabilities were impacted the same way when provided with interactive teaching strategies, teachers
who had children with disabilities in their class were split relatively evenly between reporting more impact/same
impact (35 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively) while 25 per cent felt these strategies had less impact.137
Teachers were more positive about the progress children made with literacy and numeracy skills. Most surveyed
teachers said that students with disabilities made ‘good progress’.138
Uniformity in identification and response to CwDs
176. The identification and response to CwDs was not carried out in a uniform manner. In GCA, the Syria
Government offices relied solely on health cards or documents issued by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to identify
CwDs. However, the Syria Government Office reported less cases than the actual numbers on the ground, as the
health cards issued by the MoH are mainly focused on physical disability. Meanwhile, in NGCA, partners use the
Washington Group Questions to identify CwDs. Some partners in NGCA also reported carrying out FGDs with
children during which the age and information on children with disabilities was collected.
177. The ECW program’s awareness campaigns and Back to Learning Campaigns sought to contribute to
tackling negative attitudes and practices towards CwDs. They were designed to increase the demand side of
education and were accompanied by social protection services for the most vulnerable children in some areas, such
as school transportation, especially for girls and the disabled, and referral pathways.139 The PSS sessions also raised
children’s awareness on important issues such as early marriage as reflected during an FGD with girls aged 13-17 in
GCA.
178. Program partners were able to support children with multiple and more severe disabilities through the
referral mechanisms. Though the referrals were important, the extent to which case follow up was made to ensure
that children received the needed care is not clear. The same uncertainty applies for the teachers’ capacities to
identify children with disabilities that are less visible.
179. UNICEF developed a comprehensive standardization tool that aimed to create uniformity in the way IPs
implemented the ECW program activities. However, the majority of UNICEF and partners key informants were
unaware of the standardization tool.
180. It should be noted that a plan to build capacities of IPs in both GCA and NGCA was developed by mid-year
of 2022 based on the identified gaps in their capacity needs, which required additional budget allocation as a new
activity. Considering the effectiveness of training, face-to face modality was pursued. Despite efforts to recruit local
consultants through the network in education in emergencies, UNICEF was not able to find consultants/experts who
could travel and deliver trainings on specific topics. Moreover, by the beginning of 2023, a decision was made to
postpone capacity building of IPs to the next phase of MYRP.
Gender and inclusionary considerations
181. The program targeted a broad range of persons including hard to reach and vulnerable populations in areas
with acute humanitarian and education needs (for example girls and boys, IDPs, CwDs, children at pre-primary,
primary and secondary levels). Program achievements in gender and inclusion considerations are provided in Table
12 below.140 In line with SDG5 (Gender Equality) the program achieved equitable reach for boys and girls and focused
on vulnerable populations such as IDPs and refugees.
Table 12 Program achievements in gender and inclusion considerations
• 40,109 out of 80,558 children reached were female.
• 1.9% of children reached were with disabilities.
137 Nearly half of teachers without CwDs in the classroom (45 per cent) were unsure of the impact of these strategies.
138 HALDO assessments for year 3 are also aligned with teachers’ survey results to some extent in at least that, there was no
difference in performance between children with and without disabilities in the literacy and numeracy scoring. However, the
difference remained in SEL and executive functioning.

• 63% of children reached were IDP, 3% refugees, and 34% other affected population/host communities.
• 75.8% children were enrolled in primary level education programs, 23.6% in secondary level, and 0.6%
in pre-primary level.
• 38% of children reached were in Idleb, 22% in Al Hasakeh, 12% in Aleppo, 12% in Deir-ez-Zor, 10% in
Ar-Raqqa, 4% in Homs and 2% in Hama.
182. There is limited evidence to show that regular gender analysis was carried out to address the gendered
needs of participants throughout the timeframe of the program. Nevertheless, different strategies were used to
facilitate access to particularly vulnerable groups. For example, UNICEF and IPs regularly collected and analysed
gender disaggregated data for all the indicators, as well as ensuring that periodical analysis (quarterly basis) was
carried out at the time of assessment and planning and monitoring and reporting periods. IPs also provided gender
disaggregated data and analysis in the event where there was a gender gap in the results. For instance, when
attendance among the girls at one month was recorded as low, IPs explained that that this was because of the olive
picking season where girls were more likely to be engaged in the activity at one particular time of a year. As a result,
girls were compensated with the additional classes they missed.
183. Moreover, women staff members were available to accommodate to the gendered needs of participants
and to socio-cultural norms. Teachers also took into consideration socio-cultural factors when implementing
activities. For example, in classrooms that were mixed, girls were seated in one side of the room and the boys in the
other.141 However, facility checks showed that not all facilities had separate latrines for boys and girls (12 out of 17 in
NGCA and 4 of 8 in GCA).142. This may be linked to donor red lines which only allow partners to carry out light
rehabilitation work at TLSs. In addition, red lines prohibiting partners from hiring camp residents even if they were
the only available teachers impacted the program’s ability to hire women staff and created tension within the camp.
184. Access to protection services was facilitated by linking partners to child protection and GBV sub-clusters
and the protection cluster working groups.143 The PSS support also contributed to enhancing the overall wellbeing of
children and encouraged them to take part in the program activities. This approach took into consideration the needs
of vulnerable and conflict affected children, and addressed factors that affected their willingness to attend learning
centres. Several children participating in FGDs144 mentioned that PSS activities, particularly those that involved
playing, contributed to improving their wellbeing and behaviour, helping them express their feelings and make new
friends, as well as how to deal with conflicts and mental health issues. During FGDs, PSS workers reported
employing several measures to ensure the inclusion of children including those at risk, such as assessing all cases,
following up on cases with PSS teams, working on aspects such as bullying and discrimination and seating
vulnerable children with exceptional students who are supportive during class. Social workers and support staff also
worked with CwDs, adapting activities to address caregivers’ concerns.
185. Transportation remains a barrier to attendance, especially for vulnerable groups. To facilitate access, the
program offered transportation to hard-to-reach and vulnerable children, including those who lived far from the
learning centres. These measures were important for linkages to SDG4 in promoting equal access to education for
children that are vulnerable. For example, transportation was provided for children living in Kurdish Self
Administration (KSA) controlled areas of Al Hasakeh to attend SLP learning centres in GoS controlled areas. In
addition, transportation was provided to vulnerable children (aged 6-18) in Idelb and Deir-ez-Zor including CwDs, girls,
children referred by case management, and boys at risk of dropping out due to child labour.145 Nevertheless,
transportation was not provided in all locations and did not meet all participant needs. This was reflected during the
FGDs with children, teachers and parents where transportation was frequently mentioned as a need. Families asked
for transportation to be provided or fees to be covered for children during the committee meetings.
186. Although over 90 per cent of students surveyed lived within walking distance to the learning centres they
went to, transportation was needed, particularly for vulnerable groups of children such as girls, and those residing in
rural and secluded areas as well as CwDs.146 The fact that most surveyed students reported that students went to
school alone in both GCA and NGCA is a clear indication that proximity of the students to the learning centre is a
141 This was the case for all classrooms observed with the exception of one in GCA.
142 Gender disaggregated latrines were not present for CwDs, as this was perceived as unnecessary.

determinant in their access to the non-formal education services. Moreover, socio-cultural norms are likely to make it
more challenging for girls to attend learning centres that are far from their residence.
187. Setting up learning facilities near population centres facilitated reaching wider populations. For example, in
Idleb, learning centres were located next to refugee camps to encourage more commitment from students.147 In
GCA, some learning centres were also set up in areas where girls were typically not allowed to continue their
primary education because of lack of availability of nearby schools.
188. Flexible NFE options were helpful in widening access to services and mitigating negative coping practices,
such as child labour. As with transportation options, these efforts helped extend education opportunities in support
of SDG4. The program offered a variety of NFE programs to address differentiated education needs and widen
accessibility and flexibility, including remedial classes, catch-up classes, basic literacy and numeracy classes, and the
Self-learning Program (SLP) to reengage children in education and prepare them to continue learning beyond
schooling. For example, some learning centres offered morning and afternoon shifts,148 as well as SLPs, which
accommodated to the needs of children who were involved in child labour. In NGCA, during olive harvest season in
Idleb, partners offered additional lessons for girls, who typically had lower attendance during this season.149 In NGCA
one centre started classes later during the day to give children more time to get to the centre. In GCA, a centre
implemented recreational activities to make NFE programs more attractive to children during harvest season.
Partners in GCA implemented other flexible modalities to engage with local communities in which activities were
conducted in the homes of people who were from the community.
3.6 Coordination
KF30. Coordination between UNICEF and the second grantee was smooth and worked well.
Coordination mechanisms within the program
189. Coordination between partners (between and among partners within and beyond each hub) was limited due
to confidentiality concerns and the sensitivity of the context. In contrast, UNICEF focal points facilitated regular
coordination between ECW partners and UNICEF; UNICEF was responsive to their needs.150 UNICEF invites ECW
partners to take part in annual reviews where achievements and lessons learned are shared. Moreover, partners
submitted quarterly reports on the progress of their work to UNICEF and UNICEF made sure to disseminate best
practices and manuals developed between them. Despite these efforts, interviewed IPs expressed a need for more
participatory opportunities to share experiences and lessons learned between each other. No duplication in efforts
was identified between partners.
190. Coordination between UNICEF and the second grantee was smooth and worked well. UNICEF was able to
capitalize on consistent institutional knowledge given lower turnover at PMU level compared to the second grantee.
The second grantee and UNICEF have regular weekly meetings.
191. The value of the EDF was not capitalized on until a later stage of the project. Efforts have been made to
reactivate the EDF in 2023 following COVID-19 to facilitate more effective and efficient mechanisms for donor
coordination. The meeting in Amman in October 2022 was a key milestone towards this.
Partnerships with other actors
192. Overall, there was good coordination between ECW partners and other organizations working in the
Education sector in Syria. Coordination is illustrated by partner referrals for children requiring more specialized
support. UNICEF’s role as the sector lead facilitates ensuring good coordination between education sector partners.
Moreover, all of UNICEF’s partners are linked to the child protection and GBV sub-cluster and protection cluster so
they can seek professional services from other sectors.151 Several interviewed international and national partners
also reported taking part in the education cluster meetings.

193. Providing salaries for coordinators and information management officers at both Whole of Syria and hub
levels enhanced effectiveness of support to education sector members.152 Moreover, the workshops provided to
education sector partners from the three hubs provided space for discussions between members and encouraged
networking and collaboration beyond the timeframe of the training.153 The education sector partners also contributed
to the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview and the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan, which are key documents
that identify the sector needs and related response. Education sector partners also participated in an OCHA-led
multi-sector critical-gaps paper, which highlighted the most urgent funding gaps in Syria.154 In NGCA, a mapping of
sector member’ current learning assessment practices and needs was conducted in October 2021 with findings
presented to the hubs in December 2021 for feedback and input on their prioritization of needs and possible next
steps.155 These efforts are linked to SDG10 in identifying and advocating for funding of priority needs.
194. GPE funding complements ECW efforts in expanding coverage of school children with NFE interventions in
Syria to an extent (see paragraph 126). The two programs were guided by a Joint Steering Committee that met on a
quarterly basis to discuss issues relating to both programs. Moreover, the joint steering committee held discussions
between the two programs to support the reactivation of the Education Dialogue Forum (EDF) to promote synergies
with other education programs in Syria.156
195. As for the coordination carried out with WoS/hub coordinators, the ECW standardisation guideline was
created with the participation of WoS/hub education coordinators. They provided technical inputs, existing guidelines
and good practices to make sure the ECW standardization guideline is in line with the reality of each hub.
196. Coordination between ECW partners and local stakeholders (such as local authorities, Directorates of
education, municipalities, etc.) was also important to facilitating implementation of activities. However, COVID-19
created some coordination challenges. Specifically, camp coordination with camp management and administration to
support home based-learning modalities was lacking157.
3.7 Coverage
KF31. The intervention focused on the most severely affected locations and vulnerable groups based on robust
needs assessments and consultations with local (education) authorities. Continuous and thorough service
mapping throughout the intervention ensures there is no duplication of education services and allows for a wider
geographical coverage.
KF32. While the program reached some children through early childhood development and education as well as
lower secondary level education (up to grade 9), neither ECD nor secondary level education represented key areas
of focus under the program. On upper secondary level, the program does not cover youth developmental skills
and vocational opportunities despite partners’ acknowledgement of these needs. Limited funds and lack of
curriculum for upper secondary education remain key barriers to the inclusion of older children.
KF33. Collecting and reporting disaggregated data on disability has aided the inclusion of CwDs. However, without
a specific intervention for these children, the response is largely based on partner capacity, while service mapping
and referral systems connect children requiring additional support to specialized organizations. Some constraints
to the systemic inclusion of CwDs relate to donor priorities and parameters for the intervention.
KF34. The transition to a closed selection later in the program is seen as beneficial in its promotion of efficiency
and ensuring high quality and capacitated partners in the pool. However, without new funding to expand coverage
and commit to new partnerships, potentially effective partners are excluded.
Coverage of most urgent locations and population groups and gaps
197. The ECW targets the most urgent educational crisis population groups and geographical areas based on the
HNO and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), the primary reference documents for the intervention. Programming

focused on school age children not attending any form of learning is in line with the 2020 HNO which highlights out
of school children as one of the most affected groups.158 Specific focus on IDPs in camps and settlements, as well
as out of camp areas not reached by other actors, helps ensure the intervention includes school children and children
most at risk of dropping out. Regionally, the focus on northeast and north-west Syria is appropriate based on the
2020 HNO identification of the highest education needs in these areas. According to the 2020 HNO, the highest
rates of non-attendance are within the governorates where the ECW operates: Ar-Raqqa (35 per cent), Al Hasakeh
(30 per cent), Idleb (28 per cent), Aleppo (26 per cent), and Deir-ez-Zor (25 per cent).159 Within these governorates, a
focus on areas rated from 4 to 6 on the severity scale per the HNO 2020 and 3 to 5 per the HNO 2021/2022,
respectively, ensures coverage of the most affected areas.160 Final selection of locations was made following
UNICEF’s consultations with local (education) authorities. Reinforced through regular reporting and monitoring, initial
service mapping ensured that there was no duplication of location or intervention across partners, who also signed
MoUs with the education authorities.
198. UNICEF and partners generally reported the coverage of activities and funding to be sufficient. Within these
locations, participants had equal access to services, particularly considering the lack of formal education. Operating
outside of formal education allowed service delivery without restrictions serving only specific children. This allowed
for the targeting and engagement of a large number of children while also taking into consideration disability and
gender inclusivity.
199. Despite generally reporting coverage to be sufficient, UNICEF and partners indicated the need for
strategically increasing targeted locations based on assessments demonstrating unassisted areas with no available
education opportunities for children.
Gaps in pre-primary and secondary education and needs related to older children
200. Based on the 2020 HNO, there are urgent education needs for pre-primary and secondary education. Over
three quarters of 12- 17-year-olds who were not in school had dropped out.161 Meanwhile, the majority of young
learners are not prepared for school; only 11 per cent of four-year-olds and 30 per cent of five year olds having
attended some form of learning.162 The need for community based and public ECD and engaging adolescents and
youth in learning opportunities beyond schooling for skills development were also highlighted in the Education
Response Snapshot.163 These affected groups were not substantially covered under the ECW program. The primary
level constitutes the ECW program’s main affected population. ECD and upper secondary level education (above
grade 9) are not included. Most participating children are in grades 1 to 6, ages 6-15.
201. Adolescent boys and girls represent an underserved group that experiences particular vulnerabilities and
risks that remain largely unaddressed within the ECW program, despite being one of the more at-risk populations.
These adolescents tend to be overlooked for livelihoods programs, which tend to focus on the primary level children
such that post-primary adolescents as early as 12 years of age face higher probabilities of losing out on services and
activities related to education and protection.
202. Inadequate investment in multiple learning pathways, including formal and non-formal technical and
vocation education training (TVET), limits the availability and quality of education services, especially for adolescents,
risking a “lost generation”.164 The 2023 HNO in Syria also highlights economic factors limiting access to education,
and as such, greater integration and coordination with Livelihoods, Food and Agricultural sectors and Cash, including
for TVET, is critical.165
203. In addition, ECW reporting demonstrated challenges related to literacy skills for older children covered
under the program and recommended targeting higher grades with more literacy support. UNICEF reporting shows
that older children in NGCA did not demonstrate the predicted developmental progress expected by age nor by
grade; older children in higher grades are not significantly outperforming children in lower grades.166

204. Retention of children in primary education also presents a significant challenge. The lack of NFE curriculum
to facilitate the transition into formal education and the lack of available formal education systems across locations
pose major barriers to continuing to progress in educational attainment and development. At the secondary level,
students are also more likely to drop out to work.
205. Funding and donor priorities represent key constraints to expanding coverage to address the considerable
needs on the ground for out of school children, including those outside of the primary level. While UNICEF sets the
target numbers, donor appetite informs the amount of funding and allocations for each level and subsequent
coverage across the intervention components. Based on the 2023 HNO in Syria, UNICEF has recommended to the
donor that the focus on primary education should be expanded to include pre-primary and secondary education,
including TVET. In particular, the 2023 HNO predicts that the education system’s inability to build on past
investments and parents’ inability to afford education will lead to an increase in children absent from school and
dropouts.167
206. The inclusion of secondary education programming (especially for over grade 9) would require revisions to
the project framework including identifying additional teachers and inclusion of different location for project activities.
Currently, the program does not work in formal education per donor red lines and there is no NFE curriculum for
upper secondary education (SLP covers up to grade 9, lower secondary). Furthermore, tailored support would be
needed to transition adolescents from learning to earning, equipping them with citizenship and life skills through
educational opportunities.
Inclusion of CwDs
207. Previous shortfalls in the budget were reported to have prevented stronger inclusion of this group of
vulnerable children. Such lessons learned informed the attention to these needs in the ECW program to some
extent. The ECW program aimed to engage CWDs within the target group of out of school children, facilitating their
inclusion through the rehabilitation of WASH facilities that were CwD and gender sensitive, in addition to awareness
campaigns within communities and with parents. Working with communities and raising awareness supported
inclusive participant engagement in ECW activities. In 2022, partners were able to supply children with wheelchairs
to help facilitate their access to education through emergency cash funds. Targeting children with disabilities incurs
additional costs, including recruiting and training specialists and providing adapted infrastructure such as ramps and
suitable WASH facilities.
208. Collecting and reporting disaggregated data on disability has aided the targeting of CwDs. However,
without a specific intervention for children with disabilities, the response is largely based on the capacity of the
partners. As a result, included CwDs are only those with moderate disabilities, which the program and partners have
the capacity to accommodate. Most of these selected children have physical disabilities resulting from injury, in
addition to those with chronic illnesses who are included. Through monitoring activities, partners follow up with CwD
participants, including ensuring their access to complaint boxes and following up on each case.
209. Service mapping and referral systems work to connect children to organizations with specialized capacities.
Children with mental disabilities, for example, are included in another UNICEF-funded project. Children who may
need certain types of assisted devices also receive referrals. These referral systems have been continuously
strengthened through the lessons learned processes from previous programming.
210. Some constraints to the systemic inclusion of children with disabilities relate to donor priorities and
parameters for the intervention. ECW was not initially designed with a significant focus on disability. Lack of
agreement on the cost per child allocated for CwDs inclusion contributed to partners’ limited capacity to strengthen
their response for children with special needs for learning.
211. Without explicit direction from the donor to target CwDs, UNICEF leverages its position to do so, including
through selecting partners that specifically seek to engage this group in GCA. Based on the experience of
implementing remote modalities in the COVID-19 context, certain partners have established remote-blended
approaches to target CwDs who could be hard to reach.
Open versus closed selection of partners
212. The advantages of closed partner selection are relevant given the challenging context in Syria. The open
selection process can require two to three months to complete and does not always guarantee the best result.
167 At the time of report submission there was no decision on the request for expansion of programming
43
There is a strong preference for continuity with existing partnerships based on partner performance to promote the
continuity of programming within targeted communities.168
213. ECW began with an open selection of implementing partners and transitioned to a closed selection process.
The initial open selection process provided UNICEF with a pool of partners. By the time of implementation, there
were some partners who were no longer suitable to continue with while others were able to maintain and build their
capacity. It was deemed more cost-effective to continue with high-performing partners in which UNICEF had
significantly invested. Likewise, selected IPs consider certain local organizations as strategic partners based on their
longer-term experience with previous UNICEF project phases. The uncertainty regarding the level of funding for the
program’s second and third year also made it difficult to commit to new partners and ensure continuity of learning.
Nevertheless, when funds to expand to new communities become available, UNICEF may announce a tender for an
open selection. In the latter half of year two of ECW (July 2021-June 2022), UNICEF engaged a new partner.
214. UNICEF procedures and processes including partnership reviews and third-party monitoring has supported
due diligence measures and practices at all levels. Third party monitoring includes annual spot checks, financial
auditing, operational, and technical assessments of partner organizations. Based on the rating partners receive from
their initial assessment, their capacities are subsequently followed up on through assessments conducted on a
periodic basis to determine their eligibility.
4. CONCLUSIONS
215. Program activities were relevant to the educational and PSS needs of children in program areas as well as
emerging needs from the earthquakes. UNICEF and partners took several steps to ensure program relevance
including seeking feedback from rightsholders, assessing learning outcomes and adapting programming to shifts in
the operating context, including in response to the earthquakes. However, the fact that the program did not dedicate
a specific component for CwDs in its initial design meant that the responsiveness of the program to the needs of
CwDs has not been prioritized nor systematic.
216. The program as it was designed is coherent with other humanitarian responses and clusters though
implementation is not always standardized beyond meeting minimum standards. Harmonisation requests need to be
assessed in light of the operational context. Standardisation of implementation depends heavily on the different
realities on the ground and the operational context in general, which vary greatly from one area to the next.
Therefore, aligned implementation is only possible to a degree and should focus on setting minimum standards
rather than full alignment across all contexts.
217. The program has been effective in extending learning opportunities and improving learning outcomes for
affected populations meeting or surpassing most program outputs and outcomes. Overachievement in student
participation and learning outcomes is a positive indication of the ECW program effectiveness. However, differences
in inclusion and learning outcomes shows that vulnerable populations, particularly CwDs, have not been as
effectively supported.
218. Teachers are largely positive about the effectiveness of training and learning circles in improving teaching
and PSS capacities. Positive changes in teaching strategies can be observed and are appreciated by students despite
teaching practices remaining largely teacher centred as opposed to more active learning strategies that involve
higher order thinking skills. Space and materials to implement interactive teaching methods remain a primary
challenge. Teachers used non-violent methods to manage classroom behaviour, with a few exceptions of corporal
punishment. In contrast, children frequently reported parents’ use of corporal punishment.
219. Most outcomes and outputs targets were achieved indicating efficient use of resources despite internal and
external factors affecting implementation. UNICEF’s establishment of standards and mechanisms, their flexibility in
responding to changing context, and the establishment of F&C mechanisms and TPM helped ensure compliance,
accountability and efficiency. However, implementation varied across learning centres and adaptations were needed
to make processes more inclusive.
220. The program was able to include a broad range of persons with acute humanitarian and education needs
with equitable reach for boys and girls. However, it was challenging to ensure equitable learning outcomes,
particularly during COVID-19 and for CwDs requiring more specialized support. Stakeholders identified needs for
168 UNICEF and IP KIIs
44
additional and/or adapted learning materials (such as access to devices), transportation and training to reach these
populations more effectively. Currently, referral services are providing an essential link for CwDs to access more
specialized services; it is anticipated that the eventual roll out of the capacity building plan would address current
inconsistencies in identification and response.
221. Coordination between UNICEF and the second grantee, between ECW partners and UNICEF and between
ECW partners and other organizations working in the Education sector was generally smooth and worked well.
However, confidentiality concerns and sensitivity of the context created challenges in coordination between partners
within and beyond each hub. Interviewed IPs expressed a need for more participatory opportunities to share
experiences and lessons learned between each other that go beyond current practices of dissemination of best
practices and guidance.
222. The intervention focused on the most severely affected locations and vulnerable groups based on robust
needs assessments and consultations with local (education) authorities. Continuous and thorough service mapping
throughout the intervention ensures there is no duplication of education services and allows for wider geographical
coverage. The program does not target ECD nor secondary level education and does not include a specific
intervention for CwDs, despite substantial needs in the country. The transition to a closed selection was reported to
improve efficiency and quality of capacitated partners.
5. LESSONS LEARNED
223. Ensuring that all teachers are trained on interactive learning strategies and PSS and regularly monitoring
teachers to make sure they correctly implement student-centred and interactive learning strategies is likely to
improve student’s learning outcomes. Evaluation evidence suggests this is particularly important in GCA.169 Support
could also be provided in classroom behaviour management strategies. Of particular importance is the need to
ensure that teachers can implement learnings in classes with more vulnerable groups such as CwDs.
224. Ensuring that teachers receive their stipends without delays is important to mitigate staff turnover and
support service continuity. Although greatly valued, the stipends provided to teachers in both GCA and NGCA were
not adequate to meet their needs. Rising inflation and increased economic hardship in the country has further
exacerbated burdens on teachers. Ensuring that they receive stipends on time can help reduce attrition rates to not
adversely affect students learning outcomes.
225. Raising awareness of parents/caregivers on how to manage their children’s behaviour without the use of
violence is key to better protecting children from harm. Helping parents and caregivers recognize the value of
positive, non-violent discipline in child development and of close, effective parent-child communication reduces
harsh parenting practices and encourages interaction between the parent and child. All these factors help prevent
violence against children.
226. High level advocacy has been effective in providing greater clarity around red lines and improving donor
engagement.
227. Enhancing Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) mechanisms so that they are more inclusive is an
important element to responding to the needs of participants, particularly those most vulnerable. Applying multiple,
integrated and child friendly feedback channels that meet the needs of children with different types of disabilities is
important to ensure that vulnerable groups are not marginalized. This includes channels that cater to the needs of
those who are visually and physically impaired and those with hearing disabilities.
228. Investing in accountability mechanisms and developing more detailed protocols to use during emergencies
is likely to have improved UNICEF’s capacity to deliver better outcomes in a more equitable manner. In the case of
COVID-19, use of hybrid mechanisms that combined both remote and in-person modalities were important to
ensuring access to more marginalized groups. Addressing challenges such as access to internet and mobile device
applications is also likely to facilitate greater reach of distance learning modalities.
229. Adequate funding to support disability inclusive education is key to better addressing the needs of CwDs.
Greater commitment among donors is imperative to ensure that comprehensive and cost-effective interventions are

than two years. These teachers may be included for planned trainings and just not trained by the time of data collection.
45
able to promote inclusive education. Such commitments require increased investment to enable education partners
to implement inclusive interventions, which may entail additional costs.
230. Supplementary PSS support for rights holders is needed following unanticipated traumatic events, such as
large scale disasters. UNICEF’s swift action to provide PSS support during the aftermath of the earthquakes was key
to addressing the urgent needs of children, teachers and parents. However, more investments are needed to
improve and make available PSS support to those impacted by the earthquakes.
231. Strengthening PSS support and referral mechanisms in coordination with child protection teams of IPs is
needed to better protect children. This would include referrals to income-generating activities for households of
working children where possible. Referral mechanisms can be strengthened through, for example, ensuring that
referral mappings are regularly updated and that case follow-up is carried out. Strengthening caregiver engagement
is also important to improving support to children, particularly during emergency situations such as COVID-19.
Community support is also key to facilitating implementation of program activities.
232. Flexibility has been essential for addressing needs of the most vulnerable and adapting to shifting priorities.
For example, UNICEF’s ability to adapt activities so that they were suitable to children who were working and
extending awareness and advocacy work to employers facilitated participation of more economically marginalized
children in the program. The program’s flexibility also allowed it to adapt to respond to contextual changes, such as
during COVID-19 and the Cholera outbreak. Experience has shown that it is important for programs to be designed
with the flexibility required to reorientate funds when a crisis hits by defining parameters that determine when
resources can be allocated (i.e., triggers) and how (i.e., contingency plans).
233. Use of robust assessments for targeting and partner review is good practice to help ensure populations
living in areas with the highest needs are provided with high quality services. . Additional funding and programmatic
adaption would be required to meet the needs of underserved populations, particularly adolescents and CwDs.
234. Addressing the challenge of supporting continued education and development of adolescents will be
essential to reduce the number of schools dropouts and facilitate their transition to employment. Inadequate
investment in multiple learning pathways, including formal and non-formal TVET, limits the availability and quality of
education services and prevents adolescents who will not return to school from learning skills needed for their
future. Responsive support may include providing these older children with compensation to incentivize their
educational continuation and support their families as suggested in partner feedback.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
The following set of recommendations has been derived from the evaluation process following logically from the

Justification/background
The Syria crisis continues to have a profound impact on people across the country. Countless civilians
have been killed and injured as a result of hostilities. Few Syrians have been spared from the direct and
indirect impact of what still constitutes one of the largest, most protracted displacement crises in the
world.
Millions of children and adults remain dependent on humanitarian assistance for their survival. The scale,
severity and complexity of humanitarian needs of people in Syria remain extensive. This is the result of
continued hostilities in localized areas, new and protracted displacement, increased self-organized
returns and the continued erosion of community resilience during more than eleven years of crisis. While
there has been a reduction in violence in many parts of the country over the past year, the impact of
hostilities on civilians remains the principal driver of humanitarian needs in Syria.170
In 2019, an estimated 5.8 million school-aged children (53 per cent male and 47 per cent female) were in
need of educational assistance in Syria. Additionally, approximately 121,000 teachers and education
personnel, including 57,000 females continue to require occupation related support. 61 per cent of those
in need (children and personnel) are in acute and immediate need.
In 2020, Syria’s children continue to bear the brunt of the conflict as Syria remains the largest
displacement crisis in the world. Needs across the country are dire, with more than 11.06 million people
(more than 7.5 million children) requiring humanitarian assistance, including 4.7 million people estimated
to be in acute need. There are 6.1 million people internally displaced, of whom 2.6 million are children. In
early 2020, even before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic hit, an estimated 2.1 million children were
already out of school and a further 1.3 million at risk of dropping out as the country entered into a tenth
year of conflict.
In 2021, the Syrian refugee crisis continued into its tenth consecutive year. Approximately 13.4 million
Syrians needed humanitarian assistance and protection. An estimated 6.9 million people (97 per cent
children) needed humanitarian education assistance.171 Nearly 5.6 million registered refugees, including
170 Syria Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), 2019

almost 2.5 million children, lived in camps, informal settlements and host communities in Türkiye,
Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. Lack of readily available data on out-of-school children generally,
especially on children with disabilities and those who have dropped out of school, means that these
children are invisible to the system.172
Learning needs continue to be unmet for children with disabilities. The conflict has exacerbated existing
barriers for children with disabilities to access quality education, while also increasing the rates of some
disabilities due to conflict related injuries and exposure to violence, family separation and displacement.
In some areas, over half of the children with a disability have an unmet need for education, and over two
thirds require specialized health services which are not available in their area.173
Closure of learning centres due to COVID-19 restrictions and sporadic fighting; worsening household
economic conditions with increased population numbers and displacement have contributed to increased
numbers of children and adolescents being out of school, and children who are at risk of dropping out.
Description of the Education Cannot Wait Program in Whole of Syria
The Syria Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Multi-Year Resilience Program (MYRP) aims to re- engage
children in learning by providing equitable access to safer and inclusive learning spaces where children
acquire foundational, socio-emotional, life skills and, where relevant, vocational skills necessary to
continue their education and be prepared for adult life.
The MYRP is needs and vulnerability based. Identified children that are out of school or at risk of
dropping out in the Whole of Syria whether because of poverty, disability and/or displacement and
Palestine refugees, as considered as the most vulnerable groups.
To ensure that the education needs of vulnerable children, adolescent girls and boys are addressed, an
Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Seed Fund Program was designed. The ECW program serves as an initial
investment under the MYRP and addresses a set of critical interventions that are implemented in the
current Syrian crisis and is referred to as MYRP across this document is outlined below.

Project Outcomes:
The program is jointly managed by Program Management Unit (PMU) composed of two grantees, the
second grantee and UNICEF. It has four outcomes as shown in below:
Figure 17 ECW Seed Fund results framework
Outcome 1: Girls and boys (age 3-17) access more equitable learning opportunities
The provision of non-formal education is critical to ensuring that children have a pathway to (re)engage in
learning and acquire skills for their future. Provision of non-formal education is available for girls and boys
174 The target, 130,205 children, was approved by ECW per the original proposal based on the summation of yearly reach of three
years from 2020 to 2023 and does not consider continuation of the same children throughout the three years. In November 2021,
PMU was given detailed instructions by ECW M&E team in reporting children reached which requires cumulative reach/unique
rights holders throughout the program years. Accordingly, the target is to be revised to 91,582 by the end of June 2023 as of April
2022.

that are out of school or behind in their learning and focuses on the provision of catch-up, remedial and
accelerated learning programs.
Outcome 2: Girls and boys (age 3-17) acquire foundational, socio-emotional and life skills for continued
learning opportunities
To ensure quality learning results, qualified, retained and motivated teachers and education personnel are
essential. First, NFE teachers and education personnel are provided with skills development to enable
participatory and student-centred teaching and learning methods. This includes not only pedagogy and
teaching skills, but also essential skills for working in a conflict or displacement setting. Second, NFE
teachers and education personnel will be trained and able to identify and interpret signs and symptoms
of psychosocial distress and behaviour associated with psychosocial distress of children affected by the
crisis. Third, while it will not be possible under the MYRP to pay NFE teachers’ salaries, it will be possible
to support them with financial incentives or stipends for the provision of non-formal education.
Outcome 3: Education response is strengthened
To facilitate and support continuity in learning, education partners and programs require sufficient human
and financial resources and capacities. Ultimately, the education partners – inclusive of all the
stakeholders in the MYRP governance and management structures – are accountable to the children and
their communities. The MYRP aims to ensure the delivery of quality results through the following specific
components: 1) To strengthen the ability to assess learning outcomes; 2) To ensure Education Sector
members have the competencies to deliver results, and 3) To strengthen evidence-based advocacy on
attacks on education.
Outcome 4: Resource mobilization supports program sustainability
To sustain and expand results initiated with the ECW Seed Funding, it will be important that all
stakeholders are proactively and regularly fundraising. There will be a need to encourage the continuation
of funding from traditional and non-traditional donors, including the private sector, to support the bridging
of the funding gap for the provision of learning opportunities for children, particularly the most vulnerable,
in Syria.
Objective and targets
Purpose and planned use
The primary purpose of the evaluation is to assist UNICEF and the second grantee (PMU), partners and
donors to evaluate the results achieved, the gaps and key bottlenecks and if the implementation is
equitable and inclusive and if it has been done in an efficient, effective, and well-coordinated manner.
The learning aspect of the evaluation will primarily benefit UNICEF, the second grantee and the donor in
designing and implementing the next phase (July 2023-June 2026) of the ECW program.
Objectives
The objective of the independent evaluation is to provide accountability to donors, rights holders,
Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and host communities with respect to whether UNICEF and the
second grantee through the implementation of the ECW program are fit for purpose in response to the
education needs of Syrian children, adolescent girls and boys.
More specifically, the objectives of the evaluation are threefold:
Assess UNICEF and the second grantee’s progress towards to the attainment of ECW results at output,
outcome levels, and the overall goal, including cross cutting issues of human rights, gender, and
disability, based on existing evidence and analysis.
Assess the relevance to context and needs, efficiency, effectiveness, and coherence of the MYRP
project in terms of design, implementation, partnership, and community/ participant engagement.
Document programmatic and operational – particularly the UNICEF- the second grantee implementation
arrangement of the ECW program- lessons learned and opportunities that will inform the design of the
next ECW funding.
Provide key recommendations (including potential shifts) on the planning, implementation, monitoring
and coordination of the ECW program.
Scope of the work (Work assignment)
51
The evaluation covers the entirety of the ECW program, divided into two separate contracts. The
evaluation is being conducted jointly with the second grantee, who are advertising the same ToR for their
respective areas of coverage, under ECW, as a separate contract. Respondents are encouraged to
submit for both UNICEF and the second grantee calls.
The scope will focus on the implementation of the ECW program for the in and out of school children and
adolescent girls and boys, including those living with disabilities, including IDPs and children in host
communities, covering the period between January 2020 and up till June 2022. In addition to the
intended results of the ECW program the evaluation will also aim to identify unintended effects and
lessons learned.
With this UNICEF ToR, geographical coverage will be limited to the following seven governorates: Idleb,
Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa, Deir-ez-Zor, Hama, and Homs. Refer to the second grantee’s call for
proposals for their respective areas of coverage.
Evaluation criteria and key evaluation questions
The evaluation aims to follow a selected OECD DAC evaluation criteria of relevance, efficiency, coherence,
and effectiveness in addition to humanitarian evaluation criteria on coverage and coordination. The OECD
DAC criteria on impact and sustainability are excluded. The evaluation will also assess cross cutting
issues namely gender, human rights, and disability.
The evaluation is expected to answer the questions in the table below which will be refined by the
evaluation consultancy during the inception phase of the evaluation and endorsed by the steering
committee. The evaluation consultancy will also develop sub-questions for each key evaluation question,
indicators and a data collection method as part of the evaluation matrix.

Evaluability
The Syria ECW program is clear on the different areas of delivery. The program proposals detail the
outcomes, outputs and activities, and in the results framework and this will provide enough of a basis to
start the evaluation. Gaps in understanding program implementation, management and partnership
arrangements will be addressed during the inception phase through a discussion with the ECW team at
UNICEF and the second grantee. Monitoring data and donor reports are available and will form a key
element of the evaluation. There are no indicators or targeted interventions specific to children with
disabilities (CWD) in the Seed Fund Program.

Methodology
The evaluation will be participatory, engaging students, teachers and all stakeholders directly through
FGDs and KIIs.
Both qualitative and quantitative, primary and secondary data will be collected to answer the evaluation
questions and objectives. Results data is disaggregated by gender, disability and other relevant groups,
including refugees and displaced populations.
During the inception phase, the evaluation team will detail the methodology, which will include a detailed
evaluation matrix, data collection tools for the chosen methodology, ethical considerations, and
limitations. (Please see workplan and deliverables below).
Data sources
53
Both secondary and primary data will be collected and analysed to answer the evaluation questions and
determine the merging themes.
Secondary data
The evaluation consultancy will be provided with existing program documents: proposals, plans, donor
reports, partnership agreements and reports, field monitoring data and reports, assessments reports that
have already been completed, financial records, and other documents that may be requested relevant to
the scope of work.
Primary data collection
Primary data will be collected from staff engaged in planning, monitoring, coordinating, and reporting the
ECW program. In Syria: “beneficiaries” children and adolescent girls and boys in and out of school,
teachers and parents, stakeholders, implementing partners, other UN agencies, donors, Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and International Non-Government Organizations (INGOs), and Civil
Society Organizations (CSOs) will be approached to participate in the evaluation. It is integral that
planning accommodates the presence of children in school while attending classes. No KIIs or FGDs for
children are to be scheduled for out of school (holiday) periods.
Methods for data collection include Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), Focus Group Discussions (FDGs),
observations, and perception surveys. Specific FDGs with men and women parents/caregivers of
children, CwD, boys, and girls of different age groups.
The consulting team should propose both remote-based and face to face data collection techniques to
ensure that COVID-19 mitigation protocols are followed and adhered to.
Data Analysis
The evaluation team will during the inception phase propose methodologies and tools, with clear
justifications, to analyse both qualitative and quantitative data. The analysis methodology and tools
should aim to examine if the ECW program has met or is expected to meet the goals and objectives, and
expenditure analysis.
Ethical conduct
The evaluation team shall follow United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) ethical conduct guidance in
data collection and verbal or written consent will be required from participants before commencement of
any interview.
The inception report, data collection tools and consent forms will go through an independent ethical
review body before proceeding to the fieldwork stage of the evaluation. All data collected and
confidential information shared during the evaluation shall be kept in a password protected system by the
evaluation team.
Limitations
The following are expected limitations during data collection and the evaluation team shall further detail
these and other limitations that will be identified during the inception phase and propose mitigating
solutions to minimize the impact on the evaluation:
COVID-19 transmission prevention and control measures - in particular, social gathering restrictions
resulting in in-person interviews, FGDs and observations being discouraged. The evaluation consultancy
may mitigate this by using a blended data collection methodology – remote and face-to-face interviews
and use of secondary data as much as possible for triangulation of data purposes.
Limited or no access to ECW beneficiaries.
Challenges in accessing primary and secondary data due to the conflict and fluid context in Syria.
Dissemination
As part of quality assurance processes and validation, the evaluation team will present preliminary
findings and recommendations to relevant stakeholders as referred to in the timeframe in section below.
The discussion that follows, stakeholders can reflect on the preliminary findings and recommendations
with the goal to making them more relevant to the ECW program.
All institutional stakeholders interviewed during the primary data collection period will be asked to
comment on the draft evaluation report. After the report is finalized a dedicated dissemination workshop
will be facilitated to discuss the findings as well as to design the actions that will address the
54
recommendations of the report. Additional sectoral working meetings and discussions of the findings and
recommendations might be facilitated ahead of the distribution workshop for those sections that require
more in-depth discussions.
Expected tasks and deliverables
The contract will have the following deliverables: Inception Report, Presentation of Preliminary Findings

the responsibility of the contractor in accordance with UNICEF’s rules and tariffs. All travel costs should
be planned properly in the technical proposal and included in the financial proposal. Please note that if
selected, the contract can be a supporting document to obtain entry visa (if necessary). UNICEF will be
56
unable to secure travel visas. Flight costs will be covered at an economy class rate as per UNICEF
policies.
Travel costs should be included as a separate component on cost proposal and the contract and paid
against actual travel undertaken. There could be a situation where is not possible due to the pandemic.

Annex 3. Evaluation methodology
This evaluation was rigorous, transparent, and consultative. It adopted an integrated, mixed methods
approach177 to answer the evaluation questions and include both qualitative and quantitative data to provide
credible answers to the questions.178
The United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) Norms and Standards were followed throughout this
evaluation,179 as was the UNEG Ethical Guidelines for Evaluation and SC’s Requirements for meaningful and
ethical child participation. More specifically, the principles of integrity, accountability, respect, and
beneficence were adhered to throughout the evaluation.
The evaluation approach, methods and tools, including the evaluation matrix and a final set of evaluation
questions, have been developed based on a document review and inception interviews carried out with
UNICEF and the second grantee staff.
To strengthen transparency and stakeholder consultation throughout the evaluation process, the evaluation
managers was consulted, at any point during the evaluation process when needed, about (i) the evaluation
design to enhance its relevance; (ii) the preliminary findings to enhance their validity and (iii) the
recommendations to enhance their feasibility, acceptability, and ownership.
Methodological Approach
This FE was framed by a human rights-based and intersectionality approach. The human rights-based
approach (HRBA) has been shaped by intersectionality discourse, particularly within the wider topic of
discrimination and prioritisation of marginalized and vulnerable populations.180 It was applied to the
evaluation to analyse inequalities and discriminatory practices and unjust distributions of power that impede
justice.
The evaluation assessed how well the program has been designed and implemented to ensure accountability,
equality, non-discrimination and participation, which are the core principles of a HRBA. Furthermore, human
rights standards concerning education, gender equality and disability rights was referred to. These include:
• The Convention on Non-Discrimination in Education (1960)
• The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC, 1989)
• The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979)
• The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol (CRPD, 2006)
• The Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action
An HRBA is based on the fundamental perspective that all individuals should have equal opportunities to
participate in society. For this to be achieved it is important to provide additional support or protection for
people to make sure that they can fully take part in society.
An HRBA is imperative to promoting equal participation for vulnerable groups including persons with
disabilities and IDPs.181 The evaluation will, therefore, assess aspects such as the level of engagement of
stakeholders, including rights holders and duty bearers, in the design, implementation and evaluation
processes of the program in order to respond to their needs. It will also examine existing mechanisms and
strategies that are in place to address human rights issues and the extent to which the program contributed

to an equitable improvement in the lives of vulnerable children and adolescent girls and boys including those
with disabilities.
The design of this FE was framed by an integrated mixed methods approach that is participatory, inclusive
and target group sensitive. Such an approach ensured that the evaluation findings are derived from a
collective contribution from a wide range of target groups. Gender, age, and disability considerations was
integrated into the data collection and methods of analysis.
An intersectionality approach was useful for uncovering qualitative differences in vulnerability and ways in
which they were considered in the program. It also allows a more nuanced understanding of the intersection
of a variety of social variables and identities (such as age, gender, and disability) and the overlap of traits.
This enabled the exploration of vulnerabilities and the exposure to crisis and their contribution to securing
greater advantage or disadvantage among different groups.182,183
Evaluation Phases
There were four main phases to this evaluation. The section below provides an overview of each phase.
Inception Phase
In the inception phase of this FE, the evaluation team conducted six interviews with five staff members from
UNICEF and three from the second grantee and undertook an initial review of key documentation relevant to
the ECW program in order to refine the evaluation questions and develop the methodology in this inception
report, which also includes the data collection tools and ethical protocols
Deliverables:
Inception Report, including the evaluation methodology, tools and ethical protocols
Pilot Phase
The purpose of the pilot phase was to strengthen the quality of the tools used in this evaluation and enhance
reliability and validity of findings.184 Furthermore, during this phase, all members of the evaluation team were
trained on the interview guides, ethical protocols and agree on a communication and coordination strategy
for the actual data collection phase.185 The training were provided remotely by the lead evaluator and the
education expert under the overall supervision of the KonTerra Group.
The evaluation team also recognized the sensitivity of working in the Syria context and particularly in regard
to this program and the various partners involved. The evaluation team made sure not to disclose UNICEF
and implementing partners when collecting data in non-government-controlled areas (NGCAs), as well as
avoiding any mention of the second grantee and implementing partners when collecting data in government-
controlled areas (GCAs) of Syria throughout the data collection (including the pilot and actual data collection
phases). All evaluation team members were informed of this during the training.
As for the tools that were tested during the pilot phase, these are the:
• Qualitative structured interviews with UNICEF staff, implementing partners
• Children’s surveys, and
• Teachers’ perception surveys

The evaluation team did not test the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and key informant tools because they
are semi-structured and allow a degree of flexibility in use. Section 3.3. provides more information on the
sampling strategy and recruitment process of participants for the pilot phase of this evaluation.
Prior to piloting the tools, the evaluation team made sure to obtain the necessary approvals, and this is
particularly for the Children’s and Teachers’ perception surveys. Hence, only after receiving the necessary
approvals will the evaluation team proceed with the piloting of the tools.
Deliverables:
Final inception report, including the evaluation methodology, ethical protocols, and finalised tools
Ethical approval certificate
Data Collection Phase
Data collection proceeded only after receiving ethical approval from the Evaluation Ethics Committee.
The evaluation team used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to collect data linked to the
overarching and sub-evaluation questions. Data collection methods corresponded to the needs and nature of
the program’s activities.
For the qualitative data collection, multiple forms of qualitative data collection methods were used, including
qualitative structured interviews, semi-structured FGDs, and non-participant observation. The qualitative data
generated rich, detailed data on aspects such as the extent to which the program was able to respond to the
rights and priorities of rights holders; how inclusive the program was to vulnerable populations; and the
extent to which the program contributed to tackling gendered barriers in order support the empowerment of
girls, including adolescent girls.
As for the quantitative data collection, this included surveys which generated primary quantitative data and
ensured a greater breadth of benefit participation in the evaluation than would be possible through FGDs and
interviews alone. The document review served to triangulate findings from all evidence streams.
Upon completion of the data collection and initial analysis, the evaluation team presented preliminary
findings and recommendations to stakeholders relevant to the program including those involved in the
evaluation process. These stakeholders were identified in close consultation with the evaluation managers
and primarily included UNICEF and the second grantee staff members, as well as implementing partners who
took part in the evaluation. The validation presentation was part of the quality assurance and validation
process within the evaluation.
A more detailed description on the data collection methods and tools is provided below.
Deliverables:
Presentation of preliminary findings and recommendations
Analysis, Reporting and Dissemination Phase
Analysis
The analysis was framed by the OECD/DAC and humanitarian evaluation criteria, and cross-cutting issues
specified in the TOR, in addition to the sub-questions highlighted in the evaluation matrix. It focused on
examining the extent to which the program’s goals and objectives have been or will be met, as well as
determined factors (internal and external) that influenced their achievement or non-achievement.
Furthermore, context played a significant role in framing the analysis and in the identification of patterns to
inform future programming.
The evaluation team applied both an inductive and deductive approach in the analysis. Inductive analysis was
carried out through a thematic analysis of the qualitative data produced from the interviews and focus
groups. This involved a process of iterative cycles whilst at the same time reducing the volume of data. As for
65
the quantitative data, this will be analysed using Excel. Descriptive analysis was used to interpret results,
describe trends (intended and unintended), compare between groups of rights holders, and determine
relationships between variables. Gender, age, and disability were consistent variables that were regularly
investigated with other variables to better understand the intersectional contributions (intended and
unintended) of the program on participants. Both the quantitative and qualitative data was triangulated in
order to validate results.
Strategies used to improve the rigour of the evaluation were applied, such as credibility, transferability, and
confirmability.186 Credibility refers to the confidence in the ‘truth’ of findings, which will be ensured through
techniques such as peer-debriefing. Transferability indicates that findings have applicability in other contexts,
and this was ensured using thick description in the analysis. Confirmability refers to the degree of neutrality
or the extent to which the findings of this evaluation are shaped by the participants and not evaluator bias,
motivation, or interest. Techniques that were used to establish confirmability include triangulation and
reflexivity.
Reporting and Dissemination
A draft report was developed, which integrated feedback from the validation presentation, and a final report
submitted followed. After the final report is finalised a dedicated dissemination workshop will be organised to
discuss findings and design actions that will address recommendations of the report.187 Additional sectoral
working meetings and discussions of the findings and recommendations may also be organised prior to the
dissemination workshop for more in-depth discussions. In addition to the final report, the evaluation team
will also produce two non-sensitive summarised final reports; one for the second grantee focusing on NES-
NGCAs and the other for UNICEF focusing on GCA-GCA and NGCA-NGCA.
Deliverables:
Draft final report

Data Collection Methods (UNICEF)
The section below provides a description of the data collection methods that were used for this evaluation
specifically in relation to UNICEF.
Desk Review
The evaluation team undertook a detailed desk review of program-related documents. The review included a
deep dive into the documentation already shared by UNICEF, in addition to other relevant documents
gathered (from internal and external stakeholders) during the data collection phase. The program documents
shared by UNICEF included the program proposals, plans, donor reports, partnership agreements and
reports, assessment reports already completed, and financial records .
The desk review was triangulated with other data collection methods used in this evaluation to answer the
evaluation questions.

studies. Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 14(4), 473-495
187 The workshop and/or sectoral meetings will be organised by UNICEF/the second grantee (covering aspects such as sending out
invitations, hosting the event, etc.), and the evaluation team will be responsible for presenting and facilitating the event.
66
The evaluation team recognized potential limitations to the use of resources such as official statistics and
third-party monitoring data. This includes issues of reliability and accuracy as well as difficulty in accessing
such data, particularly on sensitive issues relating to vulnerable target groups and GBV-related information.
Qualitative Structured Interviews with UNICEF Staff and Implementing Partners
Qualitative, structured individual interviews were carried out with UNICEF staff (including staff at Syria
country office (SCO), cross-border, and regional levels), as well as implementing partners (international and
national). The purpose of the interviews were to examine aspects such as the extent to which program
outputs and outcomes were achieved; whether resources were used in a timely and economical manner; how
well program staff and partners integrated gender and inclusion into the design and implementation of their
activities; the functionality of the UNICEF-the second grantee management arrangements; as well as how well
the program coordination with different stakeholders to improve delivery of results for children.
A structured interview guide was used with UNICEF staff and implementing partners. The duration of the
interview with UNICEF staff and implementing partners was between 1.15 – 1.30 hours.
Pilot Phase
Sampling strategy and recruitment
During pilot phase, the evaluation team conducted one pilot interview with a UNICEF staff member involved
in the ECW program at cross-border or SCO level with sufficient information on the program activities.
The pilot interview was conducted remotely by the lead evaluator. The purpose of this interview was to test
the above-mentioned tool and make any necessary amendments to the questions. The evaluation team were
also able to assess whether the tool can be covered within an appropriate time, or if there is a need to shorten
them.
Data Collection Phase
A total of 19 interviews were planned to be carried out, of which 10 would be with UNICEF staff and 9 with
implementing partners. This number was arrived following an identification and prioritisation of key UNICEF
staff members relevant to the program; as well as efforts to provide representation from implementing
partners involved in the ECW program.
Theoretical sampling methods188 were used to recruit these participants to ensure that the evaluation includes
individuals who are most relevant to the evaluation. Candidates for interviews have been selected through a
consultative manner with UNICEF program staff based on their relevance to the ECW program and
information needed to address the evaluation questions.
In the case of the implementing partners, in the event where the above criteria could not be fulfilled by one
staff member, group - rather than individual - interviews were planned to be carried out.
Table 2 provides a list of UNICEF candidates for interviews at MENARO, Gaziantep, and SCO levels. They

Qualitative Structured Interviews with Key Informants
The evaluation team also conducted qualitative structured key informant interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders
external to those who are directly involved in its implementation and theoretical sampling methods was used
to identify the participants to ensure that the evaluation includes individuals who are most relevant to the
evaluation.
A total of six KIIs were carried out, and Table 4 provides more details on key informants identified and their
level of involvement in this evaluation. The KIIs have been identified based on an initial desk review and
inception interviews with UNICEF staff191. The structured interview guide was used. UNICEF was required to
nominate the most relevant KIIs under each category. The estimated duration of the interview with KIs was
around 60 minutes.

Qualitative Semi-Structured Focus Group Discussions
Data was collected from qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions with rights holders of the
program. More specifically, the rights holders have been divided into three main broad categories:
• Out of school and ‘at-risk’ children
• Parents/ caregivers and guardians
• Teachers, education personnel and PSS workers
The estimated duration of the FGDs was between 1 to 1.5 hours. The FGD with children took up to a
maximum of 45 minutes. The FGDs with children focused on assessing aspects such as how satisfied rights
holders are with the services they received and activities they participated in; and the extent to which
activities/services contributed to (re)engaging them in learning. FGDs with teachers and PSS workers also
looked at aspects such as, for example, the extent to which capacity building activities for teachers and
educational personnel contributed to learning outcomes for children. As for FGDs with parents, caregivers
69
and/or guardians they focused on aspects such as, community outreach and community members’
experiences in the various program activities they were involved in, as well as their views on the significance
of the program in re-engaging their children in learning.
FGD tools have been developed in English and Arabic.
Stratified random sampling was used to select participants for the FGDs to improve precision, ensure
inclusivity, and provide better coverage of the population understudy, particularly among those that are ‘hard
to reach’. The selection process was therefore random, but stratification was applied to be as inclusive as
possible and obtain a sample that best reflects rights holders receiving diverse services/activities of programs
evaluated.
Implementing partners’ rights holders lists were used to identify potential FGD participants based on a
selection of criteria provided by the evaluation team. The list was anonymised to maintain security and
confidentiality of participants.
In total, 28 FGDs were planned to be carried out, of which:
• 16 would be with children,
• Six (6) with parents/caregivers, and another
• Six (6) with teachers/education personnel and PSS workers.
The FGDs with children, parents/caregivers and teachers/ education personnel and PSS workers would be
distributed across the following target groups:

Out of school and ‘at-risk’ children
In the case of the 16 FGDs with children, they were distributed according to the following three groups:

2) Children aged 13 and above (girls) and
70
3) Children aged 13 and above (boys).
In GCA-GCAs: Three (3) FGDs were planned to be carried out with children from the three target groups
above in each of the three governorates.
In NGCA-NGCAs: three (3) FGDs were planned to be carried with children aged 12 and below across two
governorates. Four (4) FGDs were planned to be carried out with children aged 13 and above (2 with girls and
2 with boys). The distribution is based on the fact that children reached for UNICEF is higher among primary
levels.
In both GCA-GCAs and NGCA-NGCAs, FGDs with children aged 13 and above were planned to be
disaggregated by gender to maintain cultural sensitivities and allow rights holders to share their views more
freely during the FGDs. The disaggregation was also aligned with the single sex education in lower/secondary
level of education in Syria.
In GCA-GCAs: FGDs with children aged 12 and below were planned to be mixed, considering formal
education or NFE is co-education up to primary level in Syria with a very rare exception. The evaluation team
also made sure that there is no risk to conducting mixed FGDs by seeking guidance RMTeam's local field
coordinators on this matter, as well as IPs and local communities.
Each focus group were planned to be comprise of between 6-8 participants. Furthermore, each FGD were
planned to consist of 2 CwDs, if they agree to be part of the integrated group and are comfortable to speak
up.

The FGDs will be carried out in Arabic.
Recruitment strategy and FGD logistics
The FGDs were carried out face to face by local evaluators who are of the same gender.
The evaluation team randomly selected TLSs in each of the geographical locations (communities) identified
for each of the FGDs.
UNICEF then provided lists of rights holders matching each of the above criteria to randomly select from the
chosen TLSs. An additional 10% from the required sample number was provided to replace those who refuse
or are unable to take part in the FGDs.
The evaluation team shared the short-listed candidates for each FGD, and implementing partners then
reached out to them to obtain the consent of rights holders and their caregivers (where applicable) to take
part in the FGDs. FGDs were arranged at the convenience of FGD participants.
Logistical requirements relating to the FGDs were facilitated by the implementing partners (namely allocating
spaces for the FGDs and inviting participants to the FGDs).
The FGDs were carried out in the TLSs or centres managed by the implementing partners .
The local evaluators were responsible for conducting the FGDs.
Children’s Survey
One survey was developed for children aged 7-17, incorporating age-appropriate questions to gather data
about the experience of students on students-centred learning approaches, the development of their literacy
and numeracy skills, their experience with PSS activities and its implications on their wellbeing and the
impact of the code of conduct on the way the teachers deal with student misbehaviour.
The estimated duration of the survey with children was between 20-25 minutes. The survey (which was
developed in both English and Arabic) contained multiple interactive modules with scenarios and images to
ensure that students understand and can provide valuable quantitative and some qualitative data, including
their perceptions on their teacher’s teaching methods and the learning environment.
Pilot Phase
Prior to beginning data collection, the children’s survey was pre-tested to ensure clarity and appropriateness
of questions; identify any potential gaps/unclear questions; determine the best way to ask questions where
74
appropriate; check the phrasing of any questions; test how long the tool takes to administer; and strengthen
field enumerators’ experience and confidence in using the tool.
Actual Data Collection Phase
To ensure the sample size is being calculated based on scientific foundations, a single population proportion
formula was used which considers a significance level of 95%; 50% population proportion, and 5 % margin of
error (See Annex 12 for the sample size calculation). The sample size was proportional to the number of
children reached per partner.
KonTerra Group and RMTeam International used Probability Proportional Sampling (PPS) techniques to
distribute the sample size across different Implementing partners of the project, relying on the direct Children
and Adolescents.
Additional factors that were considered during the sample distribution are as follows:
• Gender
• Location (hub & sub-district)
When the evaluation team received rights holders lists, rights holders selection was carried out in a stratified
random manner and was inclusive of aspects such as level of education, disability, and rights holders
receiving transportation.
KonTerra Group and RMTeam International proposed the following scenario on the modality aspect for the
actual data collection phase.
Selection of Locations
For the actual data collection, KonTerra Group and RMTeam International propose to cover all accessible
locations from each IP.
Teacher Perception Survey
The teacher survey will be a multi-module survey, designed to gain insight into teachers’ confidence in
pursuing children-centred, participatory teaching methodologies as a result of professional development,
their competency in teaching the PSS activities, their assessment of the quality of teaching, their perceptions
on their ability to respond to protection concerns and provide PSS; the quality of rehabilitations and
equipment provisions and their impact on the classroom environment; the utility and impact of the learning
assessment and learning tools rolled out; and the impact of any stipends received on their lives and
motivation. The estimated duration of the survey with teachers is 25-35 minutes.
Pilot Phase
During the pilot phase, the field enumerators will conduct one face to face pilot survey with a teacher in one
of the TLS’s selected for the children's survey, which will be excluded from the actual data collection phase.
Actual Data Collection Phase
Sampling strategy and recruitment
Teacher surveys will be conducted face-to-face with NFE teachers and educational personnel. Around 50
teachers will be sampled and interviewed at the selected TLSs (assuming 2 teachers per school and 20 - 25
schools will be visited). To the extent possible, the sample will be distributed proportionately across the
targeted governorates, as well as according to gender and any other relevant characteristics.
The sample size 50 is considered sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to hold, meaning that the
distribution of the sample means is normally distributed. That is, it represents a threshold above which the
sample size is no longer considered "small". Oversampling of 15% will be applied in the sampling process to
account for the non-response rate.
Classroom Observation Checklist
75
The evaluation team visited classrooms (around 2 observations per IP) to gather qualitative data and monitor
teaching in the classroom including, the teaching strategy used, interaction with students, impact on learning,
student behaviour and classroom management. The lesson observation took place throughout the duration of
a lesson.
Another facility observation checklist was developed to monitor the facilities of the learning centres including
WASH facilities, lighting, clean water and how inclusive they are and the number carried out is specified in
the main report.
Sampling strategy and recruitment
Stratified random sampling was used to select these learning centres, and geographic location were
considered during this process. They were randomly selected from the TLSs that have been selected for the
student surveys and were also carried out simultaneously when TLSs are visited for the children and
teachers’ surveys.

Annex 5. Ethical protocol and safeguarding
The evaluation team will be guided by UNICEF’s ‘Guidance Document for Informed Consent’ as part of UNICEF’s
Procedure for Ethical Standards in Research, Evaluation, Data Collection, and Analysis (Document Number:
CF/PD/DRP/2015-001) to support the ethicality of the project. This will be in addition to UNICEF’s ‘Procedures
Specifically Relating to Harms and Benefits’ (Annex B). Some specific areas that will be included are outlined below.
The evaluation team will also follow SC’s Requirements for meaningful and ethical child participation.
Informed Consent
Prior to any data collection, the evaluation team will inform all potential interviewees/participants in focus group
discussions of the evaluation including its nature and purpose and, in addition, explain the informed consent form prior
to commencing fieldwork. The Informed Consent Form is developed in-line with (1) UNICEF’s Guidance Document for
the Protection of Human Subjects’ Identities; (2) UNICEF’s Guidance Document for the Protection of Human Subjects’
Safety; and (3) UNICEF’s Guidance Document for Protection of Research Data.
The purpose of the interviews will be explained to all participants which is to provide feedback to the project teams
and evaluate the strengths and areas needing improvement in the ECW program. It will be clearly explained that the
information they provide will be incorporated into the final evaluation report, which will feed into the improvement and
tailoring of UNICEF and the second grantee’s future programming.
Participants in the fieldwork (whether in KIIs, FGDs or surveys) will be informed that the information they give will not
be included in the report in a way that will enable anyone to identify their identity. Informed consent to participate will
be required from each individual participant. All consent processes will be followed in the first language of the
participant and comply with the aforementioned guidance documents provided by UNICEF. Under normal
circumstances it would be usual for signed consent to be required. However, in the event where interviews are remote
and signed consent cannot be obtained, the evaluation team will make sure to record verbal consent from participants.
The structured interviews with adults will only take place if the participants have given their verbal consent which will
then be recorded on the questionnaire by the interviewer. If consent is not given, the interview will not take place.
Group discussions with child rights holders will be conducted face to face (where deemed necessary and if possible)
in compliance with UNICEF’s pre-existing ‘Strategic Guidance Note on Institutionalising Ethical Practice for UNICEF
Research,’ and the ‘Evaluation Technical Note No. 1, Children Participating in Research, Monitoring and Evaluation’.
These FGDs will also take place in compliance with UNICEF & Child Watch International Research Network (et al)’s
‘Ethical Research Involving Children’ – specifically, in the areas of ‘Harms and Benefits’ (pp 29-51).
All survey data, transcripts and KII/FGD notes will be stored on a password protected shared folder accessed only by
Dr. Hana Asfour (Team Leader), Darah Masoud (Education Expert), and RMTeam, and then deleted six months after
the close of this contract. During the analysis process, names will not be used, rather coding or identification numbers
will be resorted to as an alternative where needed.
Confidentiality and Anonymity
Confidentiality and anonymity of participants will be assured and maintained throughout the fieldwork and in the
analysis, all the way up to the completion of the project. To ensure that ethical considerations in this area are upheld,
Consultants will ensure that confidentiality and anonymity considerations uphold the guidelines outlined in UNICEF’s
‘Guidance Document for the Protection of Human Subjects’ Identities’; and ‘UNICEF’s Guidance Document for the
Protection of Human Subjects’ Safety.’
Child Protection
To ensure that children (aged under 18 years) involved in this evaluation are always protected, the following child
protection measures will be put in place:
1 All evaluation team members will be oriented on UNICEF’s/the second grantee‘s child protection policy194.
194 http://www.unevaluation.org/document/detail/1616
80
2 Evaluation team members and interviewers will not meet with children alone. There will be two adults (if possible)
in the room of the same gender as the child when interviewed and the door left slightly open. Regular reflexivity
will be practiced and by the interviewer in order to contribute to creating conditions where children have agency
and share power.195
3 Should any child express signs of distress, anxiety or upset during any discussion or interview, the focal point at
the TLS will be available to provide the necessary support and help provide a suitable referral for the child.
4 Should any child disclose any event of abuse, trauma or other negative experience, the interview/FGD will come
to an end and the field evaluator will contact the focal point at the TLS.
5 No child will be asked about, or expected to disclose, any personal information regarding experience of
abuse/surviving abuse at any time during the research. Specific examples of experienced abuse or trauma will not
be required, and participants will not be selected against their experiences of the same.
6 Should any cases of verbal or corporal punishment in the TLS be observed during the classroom observations,
this will be directly reported to RMTeam management and the focal point at the TLS. The monitor will not interfere
unless they feel that the child is threatened.
Reporting Concerns
7 If field evaluators become aware that an individual is at risk, or if someone discloses that they are in danger,
consultants need to alert the RMTeam immediately, unless the individual says they do not want to (in some
cases, reporting puts participants more at risk).
Managing a Report
9 If any participant divulges information about misconduct (this could range from a behavioural concern to a
disclosure of abuse):
- Gently request a confidential discussion after the FGD about what happens next. This will include where the
disclosure may go and referral to support services (if any exist).
- Never promise to be able to keep a disclosure a secret
- Report the disclosure to the focal point at the TLS, this should then be flagged to RMTeam who will deal with
this through their safeguarding system if there is no in-country mechanism for dealing with it.
Disability and Inclusive Practice
There will be a commitment to ensuring that children are not discriminated against, denied access to the evaluation
process, or poorly treated because of their individual characteristics. The specific individual needs of children with a
disability will be considered during the evaluation with appropriate adaptations put in place to secure their full
participation. Gender considerations will also be accounted for. All participants will be given the opportunity to
participate without discrimination or bias. Measures will also be taken to enable the most discriminated against,
disadvantaged and vulnerable groups of children will take part, meaningfully in the FGDs and interviews.
Disability further compounds the vulnerability of children to violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. Safeguarding
procedures employed during the evaluation will reflect this. Those interviewing will, consequently, be sensitive to the
heightened risks children with disabilities may face.196
Field Evaluators/ Team Members
• The interviewers/ field evaluators will be from the same city of the community and are knowledgeable of the
cultural context understudy. They also speak the same language and local dialect.
• Field evaluators will collect data in a safe and secure environment and data collectors will ensure that
individual vulnerabilities are not enhanced. The data collection will take place in the TLSs during school hours
where possible, or directly after school in order to minimise learning loss. In the event where they take place
after school hours, then the field evaluators will make sure that the TLS provides them with transportation to
their homes.
• Training of the field evaluators and other team members in ethical practice will be the responsibility of the
education expert supported by the team lead and RMTeam and will be completed during the pilot phase prior
to starting the evidence gathering stage of this evaluation.

and dialect.
• When interviewing vulnerable people or asking about sensitive topics, the interviewer will look for signs
of distress and be ready to move on to other topics or terminate the interview if deemed necessary.
Key Informant (KI) Participation Ethics
• Key informants will not be made party to any confidential or program-related documentation, information
or confidentially disclosed detail about the project or any project participants.
• Key informants will be assured of the confidentiality of their responses and participation in the evaluation.
• No names will be included in the final report, nor will any identifiable information be included.

Annex 6. RMTeam COVID-19 procedures
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, RMTeam has introduced a stringent set of policies and
measures designed to offset disruptions in the field and protect both staff and
respondents/participants. These measures include:
● Replacing in-person interviews/surveys with remote interviews (i.e., online or phone-
based) when possible, in coordination with the client.
● Replacing FGDs with KIIs or IDIs where possible or conducting them remotely
● If in-person FGDs do take place, ensuring that they occur with a reduced number of
participants in a well-ventilated venue where appropriate distance between individuals
can be maintained between individuals.
● Training all field staff on protection measures (i.e., wearing facemasks and gloves,
sterilizing equipment, maintaining a safe distance from others, and avoiding physical
contact, using hand sanitizer regularly etc.)
● Contacting respondents prior to interviews to ensure they are not displaying
symptoms and/or have not been in close contact with someone who has.
● Distributing face masks and gloves to respondents.
● Discontinuing interviews/surveys/FGDs if a respondent is displaying symptoms.
These measures and other considerations have implications for the methodology and tool design
process, which will need to be discussed in detail during the conceptualization and design phase of
the assignment based on the situation in the target areas. For example, based on recent experience,
we have begun to add more prompts and explanations to the data collection tools to ensure in-depth
answers are gathered as respondents in telephonic interviews tend to provide shorter answers.

document. Final scope of the ECW Seed Funds
program was narrowed to only providing non-formal
education, with the brief exception of former ECW
supported non-accredited formal schools in Idleb and
Aleppo. These schools were eligible only for the
second half of the 2019/20 school year. As UNRWA
schools are accredited formal schools, they were not
eligible for ECW seed funds. mention of UNRWA in

Annex 13. Classroom learning environment
Table 13 Classroom learning environment structure – GCA
Sufficiency of seats All classrooms possess sufficient seats and desks for the children available in the
classroom
Sufficient learning space All classrooms were arranged to enable all children to see the blackboard
Where children of disabilities were present, classrooms enable them to move around
without difficulty
Sex distribution in class All classrooms (but one which consisted of all boys) seated the girls in one section of
the class and the boys in another section. This was either in girls seated together on
one side or in the back of the classroom and the boys in the middle of the classroom
or on the other side of the classroom
CwD seat distribution In 4 of the 5 classes where children of disabilities were observed, children with visual
impairments were seated in the front of the class with their backs facing the wall. In
one of the classes, children with disabilities were observed to be seated in different
places in the class irrespective of their disability.
Wall displays In most of the classroom (7 of the 10), few displays were found on the wall which
were mostly created by the teacher such as numbers and alphabets. In 3 of these
classes, very few examples of student work (drawings) were observed on the walls.
Remained of classes (3 of the 10) did not possess any illustrations on the walls.
Classroom temperature Most of the classrooms’ temperature was suitable (not too hot or cold for students)
and ventilation whereas one was reported to be cold and the heaters did not work due to lack of
electricity.
Half of the classroom did not possess suitable ventilation – classes were stuffy and
fans could not be turned on due to lack of electricity
Lighting Lighting is available in 6 of the 10 classes; however, 3 of these 6 are inadequate to
provide adequate lighting (neon light is too dim or electric generator unavailable or
cannot be used daily)
4 of 10 classes do not possess lighting and rely completely on natural sunlight
Safety hazards Safety hazards were observed in 4 of the classrooms which included:
• Heater too close to children
• Exposed electric outlet and damp wall
• Broken wooden chairs with sharp edges
Table 14 Classroom learning environment structure - NGCA
Sufficiency of seats All classrooms possess sufficient seats and desks for the children available in the
classroom, including 1 LS that consist of special chairs and desks for CwD
Sufficient learning space All classrooms were arranged to enable all children to see the blackboard
Where children of disabilities were present, classrooms enable them to move around
without difficulty. However, one of the classes the classrooms were a bit narrow
Sex distribution in class Mixed gender classrooms seated the girls in one section of the class, usually in the
front or one side of the class, and the boys in another section.
CwD seat distribution Children with disabilities were observed to be seated in different places in the class
irrespective of their disability. In only one class, the student with speech impairment
was in the front of the class.
Wall displays In most of the classroom (5 of the 6), few displays were found on the wall which
were mostly created by the teacher. In 3 of the classes, few examples of student
work (drawings) were observed on the walls. One of the classes had an example of a
display created by the teacher with the help of some of the students.
Classroom temperature Most of the classrooms’ temperature was suitable (not too hot or cold for students).
and ventilation A few of the classrooms (1 of the 6) did not possess suitable ventilation – class was
crowded with small windows that were insufficient for adequate ventilation.
203
Lighting Most of classes (4 of the 6) sufficed from natural sunlight.
All classes had adequate light rehabilitation – ready to be used when required. This
was in the form of:
1. Electric energy and light bulbs– 4 classes
2. Solar powered light bulbs – 2 classes
Safety hazards No safety hazards were observed in any of the classes
